All eyes on me, OG
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Ay you know what?
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' - tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of - every time we ride
Hittin' - up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
F- with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'Cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, - pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a - razor blade
Say money bring - bring lies
One - gettin' jealous and - die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug - until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug - until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
Hey, to my - 'Pac
So much trouble in the world
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocre's got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this MoÃ«t and pay checks
Like Akai satellite - I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business -keep on coastin'
Where you goin'? I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, - still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny - don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?

Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
The feds is watchin' - plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers - the law
Passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug - until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These - got me tossin'
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my-
Keep your head up - make these - suffer

I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hell, man (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Let the champagne splash

Let that man get passed
He 'on't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's yo' pleasure?
Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort

Y'all homies lookin' like, why God?
When they reminisce over you, my God

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, G.O.O.D. got it made
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, G.O.O.D. got it made
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, G.O.O.D. got it madeCome on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Ooh, yeah
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
(I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)
Well, hey, well, that's the way it is
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
Come on, come on
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
But mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
Some things will never changeCodeine crazy

That ain't for you dawg, that's for them other
That ain't for you shorty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly, I'm drinking bubbly
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle
And fuck on a model, yeah
Audemar, this not a carnival
This is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon, I get down from the brown
I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I'm corrupting your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hounds
We order more bottles
And fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a talk a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (808 Mafia)
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you
Hahah, celibate
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went to St. Tropezin' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick and got my brain washed
And for the shit that got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' malt liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "please"
Playin' poker now we're back at Strokers
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles
These too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some mo'
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna, I get the crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'llac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partna
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining

Uh, California Love
California LoveAs I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin', got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz?
Okay, get yo' kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid
You know why?
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' with no broke, uh

I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than he is
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money (money)
If you ain't no punk holla, "We want prenup"
"We want prenup!", yeah

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl
Get down girl, go'n head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n head
Let me hear that backBreak 'em!
Shit!
Yo! Yeah!
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog (damn!)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally, got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (what's up?)
Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do'
Thinkin', "Will I live another 24'?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' every way like MJ
I can't believe, today was a good day, shit!
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from them cowards
'Cause just yesterday, them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police, and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a direction
As I ran, the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em!
Roll 'em in a circle of, and watch me break 'em
Wit' the seven, 7-11, 7-11
Seven, even back do' Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' "Domino!"
Plus, nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day, shit!
Left my house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on her big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp!" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home, and my pager's still blowin' up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day, shit!
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it
No sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man

Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some attack and don't end up makin' it back
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club?
'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me "Tae is the best"
Point at the who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Hmm-hmm, Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it?
Or just let it slip, yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clock's run out, times up, over, blaw!

Snap, back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows it's all over, these h**s is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads

God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These h**s don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum, da dum da da da da

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothaf****n' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped, writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these *** damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothaf****n' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot
Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, manYeah, I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip, what you cryin' about? You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney
Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever
Bein' together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be but it's just somethin'
That we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny, I remember back one year
When daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree

And said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom, was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart

And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' daddy on the TV

And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were too young
To understand that papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry, you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin', lookin'
At your baby pictures, it just trips me out to see how much
You both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird, I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing
And that ring don't shine, I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad, ha haI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (to take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (everybody)
I guess I had to go to that place
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
To get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you might still be in that place
Whatever weather, cold or warm
If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same roadBaby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby, I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishin' for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, and she love me long time
Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
Back up, back up, back up and wine up
Back up, back up and wine it
Girl, just back up, back up, back up and wine down
Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Ooh, tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where (ooh yeah, very long time)
(Back, up, back up and wine it, girl)
'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on meOnly God can judge me, is that right?
(Only God can judge me now)
(Only God baby)
Nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
(Only God can judge me now)
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin' time
Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
That's right baby, yeah baby
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
And only God can
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me now)
Flatline
I hear the doctor standing over me screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin' here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
'Cause every time I breathe, I think they killin' me
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime I hate
Dear mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' 'round strapped
Mista, Police, please try to see that it's
A million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live
Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin' a to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where
We're goin' wearin' a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them , "You can fade him", punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in
Your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
That's real
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me now)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me, only God)
Only God can judge me
(Only God can judge me now)
Only God man
That right?
That's real
(Only God can judge me now)
Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin'?
(Only God can judge me now)
Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated
(Only God can judge me now)
That's for the homey mental
We up out
(Only God can judge me now)
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me nowLook, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes, six minutes)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac', backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackity-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack, while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiÃ¨ce
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid, did nothin' but shoot for the moon since (pew)
Mc's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only hall of fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy
You witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watchin' a church gathering take place lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay", that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "Way-to-go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy, what you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "Hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get outta my face, lookin' boy
Basically boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod, this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big, and here they come tryin' to
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP One
When I tried to say, "I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray-gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'ma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lama duma lama, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you, I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feelin' like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too? Uh
School flunkie, pill junkie
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funky
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women-hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women, how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for (Satan)
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know winter's here
My dawg would prolly do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gone on you with the pick and roll
Young LaFlame, he in sicko mode
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up give me the loot
(Gimme the loot)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
Some-some-some, someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (yeah)
This shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my esÃ©s, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof (uh)
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (someone said)
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said (playin'-playin' for keeps)
Someone said, motherfuck what someone said
(Don't play us for weak)
Yeah
Astro
Yeah, yeah
Tay Keith, fuck these up (ayy, ayy)
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance (yeah)
Now I hit the FBO with duffles in my hands

Had me out like a light, ayy, yeah
Like a light, ayy, yeah
Like a light, ayy
Slept through the flight, ayy
Knocked for the night, ayy, 767, man
This shit got double bedroom, man
I still got scores to settle, man
I crept down the block (down the block), made a right (yeah, right)
Cut the lights (yeah, what?), paid the price (yeah)
think it's sweet (nah, nah), it's on sight (yeah, what?)
Nothin' nice (yeah), baguettes in my ice (aww, man)
Jesus Christ (yeah), checks over stripes (yeah)
That's what I like (yeah), that's what we like (yeah)
Lost my respect, you not a threat
When I shoot my shot, that shit wetty like I'm Sheck (bitch)
See the shots that I took (ayy), wet like I'm Book (ayy)
Wet like I'm Lizzie, I be spinnin' Valley
Circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (yeah, what?)
Like where is he? (Yeah, what?)
No one seen him (yeah, yeah)
I'm tryna clean 'em (yeah)
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
Now I hit the FBO with duffles in my hand (woo)
I did half a Xan, thirteen hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light, like a light
Like a light, like a light
Like a light (yeah), like a light
Like a light
Yeah, passed the dawgs a celly
Sendin' texts, ain't sendin' kites, yeah
He said, "Keep that on lock"
I said, "You know this shit, it's stife", yeah
It's absolute (yeah), I'm back reboot (it's lit)
LaFerrari to Jamba Juice, yeah (skrrt, skrrt)
We back on the road, they jumpin' off, no parachute, yeah
Shawty in the back
She said she workin' on her glutes, yeah (oh my God)
Ain't by the book, yeah
This how it look, yeah
'Bout a check, yeah
Just check the foots, yeah
Pass this to my daughter, I'ma show her what it took (yeah)
Baby mama cover Forbes, got these other bitches shook, yeah
Ye-ahI shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God, walk with me (grab a and take me to Heaven)
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind, couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions
Of leavin" here in a hearse, God ,can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', bout to go to pieces, screamin', "peace"
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive til the mornin' to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers, and
Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor, beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door, shed so many tears (dear God, please let me in)
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears(Yo, left, yo, left) 'cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo, left, right, left) and when you feel weak
(Yo, left, yo, left) you feel like you wanna just give up
(Yo, left, right, left) but you gotta search within you
(Yo, left, yo, left) try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(Yo, left, right, left) and get that motivation to not give up
(Yo, left, yo, left) and not be a quitter, no matter how bad
(Yo, left, right, left) you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

Till I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out (until the roof, until the roof)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (the roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps (until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic
There's a certain feelin' you get when you real and you spit
And people are feelin' your shit, this is your moment
And every single minute you spend tryna hold on to it
'Cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
AndrÃ© from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me!

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out (until the roof, until the roof)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (the roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps (until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinkin'? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out (until the roof, until the roof)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (the roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps (until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)

Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from underneath me

I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat meEarly in the morning, late at night (I will wait for you)
It don't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie already on the way (higher, sayin', "Aye, yi, yi, yi")
Whenever I find time, it's okay (ayy)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a going
I been in the field like the children of the corn
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (world was ending)
Travel around the world (would you cry, or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (tell me now, I want you be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do drugs (tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Yeah, I been trapping 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feeling
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a living (will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feelings flowing like a river
You be texting back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say "Delivered" (I will wait for you), but I know that you 'on't get it
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fucking for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dawg, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barking over dinner
I was fucking with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone
Gossip, being messy, that ain't what we doing, yeah (world was ending)
Trapping around the world (would you cry, or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (tell me now, I want you to be clear)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Early in the morning, late at night
It don't even matter what time it is
(World was ending, would you cry, or would you try to get me?)
(Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
(Tell me now)

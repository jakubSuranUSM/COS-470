A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean nightGot a girl from the Southside
Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number
It took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back
Like Cadillac seats
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
The way she fit in them blue jeans
She don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no help
Got hips like honey
So thick and so sweet (Man)
Ain't no curves like hers
On them downtown streets
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30
I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast I can (Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand)You know I like my chicken fried
A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's loveWell, I was born a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that my Daddy made sure of
And he shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy, he worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mama rocked the baby at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn'
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mama scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in Mama's understanding way
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalogue, money made by selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yes, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep, 'cause we were all tired
I never thought I'd ever leave Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed, since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
'Cause nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughterBeen up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah, girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heeled shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that bar room door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots
A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy
Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my bootsWhen I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Then watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Then watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
So long my friend, until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to
Sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeahI took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a planeI hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away I've been a walkin' heartache, I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately ain't who I wanna be
But you stay here right beside me
And watch as the storm blows through
And I need you
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you
There's more here than what we're seein', a divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely, could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr, and I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you, yeah
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered, I pray we never undo
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you
He gave me youJust walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for 18 hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
In the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I saw God today
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I saw God today
Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God todayIf I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, (oh-oh)
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearlsLast night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit, I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, "Let her go"
Your friends say, "What the hell?"
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)He said
"I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
And talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him
"When it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit you
When you get that kind of news?
Man, what'd you do?"
And he said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying"
He said
"I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the Good Book, and I
Took a good, long, hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then
I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift
And you've got eternity
To think about
What you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?
Skydiving
I went Rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
Man, I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying"
WooLove is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fireSomething like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
I really I shouldn't be
Yeah, but one more call
Is one more "whatcha doin right now?"
Leads to one more trip to my side of town
And you walk right in
To one more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
We're tearing t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
So calm and so cool, yeah, I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone
Then I'm picking up the phone
Yeah, but one more call
Is one more "whatcha doin right now?"
Leads to one more trip to my side of town
And you walk right in
To one more here we go again
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
We're tearing t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
We're tearing t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
And I'm here wishing you could stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer, hmm
Oh yeahAlmost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roadsUsed to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskeyI know they say you can't go home again
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favourite dog is buried in the yard
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothin' but a memory
From the house that built me
Momma cut out pictures of houses for years
From better homes and garden magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to momma's dream
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothin' but a memory
From the house that built me
You leave home, you move on
And you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world
And forgot who I am
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here, it's like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothin' but a memory
From the house that built meHeadin' down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Yeah, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a-headin' west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Oh, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel (oh, I wanna feel)
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock meShe put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
Little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
And the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breathe
She finally drank her pain away little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him of her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la laBaby, why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Just a little bitty living room, ain't gonna look like much
But when the lights go down and we move the couch
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet snd our two hearts beatin'
Nobody's gonna see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs?
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on
And those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on?
On second thought
Just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs?
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug
Well, it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
(Bouncing off the walls, floating on air)
Oh baby (baby), why don't we just dance?

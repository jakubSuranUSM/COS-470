The whole world turned its back on me.

No one to talk to.
And no one to keep me company.

Had a bad, bad dream last night.
Death came knocking up on my door.

Death came knocking up on my door.
Said: "Son, you're bound to leave with me.
Ain't gonna roam this world no more."

No butter on my roll

For the corn flakes in my bowl
Fresh out
Baby I'm all fresh out
Ain't had no lovin' since the day you went away
I'm fresh out
No jelly in the jar
No flour in the sack
I ain't got nothin' cookin'
Baby please won't you come back?
Fresh, out
I'm all fresh out
Ain't had no lovin' since the day, girl, you went away
I'm fresh out

Of Johnnie Walker Red
Nobody in this big house
But me and an empty bed
Fresh out
Baby I'm fresh out
I had no lovin' since the day you went away
I'm fresh out
No doubt I'm fresh outI left Louisiana
Some 60 years ago
Bought me a one-way ticket
To sweet home Chicago
When I lost my way
My fingers did the walking
I don't say too much
I let my guitar do the talking
Got a sixth grade education
I never finished school
I'm straight out of Louisiana (Ledgewood, that is)
I made my own rules
Nobody let me in
Nobody gave me nothing
I don't say too much
I let my guitar do the talking
Woo! My guitar's talking
Can you smell that?
That's so funky
A little higher
Take it
From the east coast to the west coast
New York to San Fran
Interstate 80 all the way
The band slept in the van
Sometimes nobody listened
I just kept on rocking
I learned a long time ago
I let my guitar do the talking
Talk to me, guitar
Tell it loud and clear
Say it loud
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Squeeze it
Bring it downI put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do
I tell you, I ain't lying
I ain't lying
You know I can't stand it
You're running around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Oh, no
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You know I can't stand it
You're running around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Ooh-hoo-ooh
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Because you're mine
Oh
YeahIf you're down and out and you feel real hurt
Come on over to the place where I live
And all your loneliness I'll try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you
Don't be afraid come on in
You might run across some of your old friends
All your loneliness I gotta soothe
I'll play the blues for you
I got no big name and I ain't no big star
I play the blues for you on my guitar
All your loneliness I'll try to soothe
I 'll play the blues for youBack before I was a homewrecker
I was a goodie good, good girl
Back before I was your heartbreaker
I was someone you could adore
Back before the love we made made me out a fool
I was looking for something more
Back before I put the fear of God in you
I was afraid to walk through your door
Make up your mind, I can kill or be kind
Baby, you decide, I can kill or be kind
Back before my kiss branded you
You were wild and free to roam
Back before I made a mess of the man in you
You were happy to be alone
Make up your mind, I can kill or be kind
Baby, you decide, I can kill or be kind
Make up your mind
Baby, you decide, I can kill or be kind
Baby won't you make up your mind, I can kill or be kind
Baby, you decide, I can kill or be kindWell that 61 highway is the loneliest road that I know

Why you do that anyway
You know I thought things were fine
Just yesterday
Baby you've got to tell me
You gotta tell me what's going through your head
You know I can't spend one more night
Sleeping in this lonely bed
You know I've been laying here thinking
About what you did
You know I know it was wrong
But I'm ready to forget
Hey my baby

And stay with me
Or I have a got trully
Have a got to get myself another woman instead
You know I can't spend one more night

Sleeping in this lonely bedI never win at love
At love I always lose
I keep looking for a good man
And I ain't got no clue
I can't find no one to love me
I guess I'm married to the blues
Married to the blues

There's a picture by my bedside
In a frame that's got a crack
Of one of my old lovers
Who ain't never comin' back
He swore he'd never leave me
Then I saw him start to pack
Start to pack

Oh when you're married to the blues
Married to the blues
You don't get no band of gold
All you get is a lonely cab ride
To a bed that's always cold
When you're married to the blues
Forget that honeymoon
All you get is luke-warm lovin'
That's over way, way too soon

There's a letter inm why pocket
It's all torn
Torn and frayed
The only thing
Only thing he left me
When he ran
Ran away
Now when you're married to the blues
It gets more lonely everyday

Oh... All these blues

I knew he would leave me
He was never comin' back
He left me a torn letter
Then he ran away
Ran away
Married to the blues
Oh... All these blues

You get so lonely
Lonely
Lonely
Lonely
Married to the bluesYou know it's a shame when a woman
Spends all the time alone
When I am perfectly willing
To give her everything she needs
I don't care about her past
I don't care what she's been through
I just want to feel one night with good love' baby
That's all I want to do
So, baby, if you've got the feeling

In the night, I'll shut my door
I just want to get your head back, baby
Give you all the love I got, for sure
So, baby, if you've got that feeling
You know, I wanna give you that midnight healing
Oh, I just want to make love to you all night long

And lock the door when you leave
And call me when you need some good loving
'Cause you know I am gonna please you

And you know I'll be around
Yeah, you know I've got the time
I just wanna heal your body, baby
Make it all fall into line

Low down and dirty shame
Lord, it's a pity
Low down and dirty shame
Tell me, how can a poor man make it?
I say, when money is the name of the game
I used to have the best credit
Every place in town
I sign my name
No money down
Things ain't tough y'all
And old Buster leads on
Now, my name won't even buy me
A piece of bubblegum
It's a pity
Low down, dirty shame
Tell me, how can I poor man make it?
I say, when money is the name of the game
So bad baby, yeah
Thinking here, about the good time
I know has passed
It ain't the old ravishing me
But, it got me looking for game
It's a pity
Low down and dirty shame
Oh low, baby
Tell me, how can I poor man make it?
I say, when money is the name of the game
I need some baby
I know, oh lord, yeah
We talking about crumbs
Don't forget about the fringe
Tell me, how can I poor make it?, hey
I say when money, yeah, is the name of the gameWell, did you ever quit a woman
But, then you realised that you need her so bad?
Did you ever quit a woman
And you realised that you need her so bad?
Now she belongs to someone else
And she's someone that you just can't have
Did you ever turn to cry
And you realised that it's just too late?
But did you ever turn to cry
And you realised that it's just too late?
Because the girl you had to yourself
She ain't coming back, no way, no, oh
Well, did you ever feel lonely
And you now know where to turn?
Did you ever feel lonely
And you now know where to turn?
Then you realise that you're paying the price
For what you did, for what you did to her, ohSlightly hungover
Slightly hungover of you
Slightly hungover
Slightly hungover of you
I'll be lying baby
If I said it wasn't true
Slightly hungover
Maybe, maybe slightly blues
Slightly hungover
Maybe slightly blues
I never had the blues baby
Before I meet you
Slightly hungover
Slightly hungover of you
Slightly hungover
Slightly hungover of you
You shouldn't lie baby
No, no
To someone who loves you
And I do
Morning after
Morning after you
Morning after
Morning after you
Morning who won't last forever
And I'll be over with you
And I'll be over with you
And I'll be over with youThe thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be
The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
All the thrill is gone
Baby, it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open-armed baby
Just like I know, I know I should
You know, I'm free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh, free, free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All that I can do is wish you wellA small thing like a seat on the bus
Changed life for the rest of us
A tiny woman that you never met
Put us on the road, but we ain't there yet
Her brave soul is long gone
But her spirit's marchin' on
We done come too far to be gone
Come too far to be gone
If you think we're stopping, you got it wrong
We come too far to be gone
Hand in hand, yours and mine
It's God's love on the line
Now we're miles from our first steps
'Bout as tired as you can get
But as sure as day turns night
We'll keep movin' 'til we make it right
We done come too far to be gone
Come too far to be gone
If you think we're stopping, you got it wrong
We come too far to be gone
Saw you in Selma and in Birmingham
Marching together to the glory land
Standin' proud, never stumbled
All through the daily struggle
Making good trouble
Just to keep movin' on
Thought we were silenced at the Lorraine
But that voice didn't die in vain
It's echo rings like no other
For every sister and every brother
Though many are gone, their spirits still scream
You can kill a man, but not a dream
We done come too far to be gone
Come too far to be gone
If you think we're stopping, you got it wrong
We come too far to be gone
Done come too far to be gone
We come too far to be gone
If you think we're stopping, you got it wrong
We come too far
Way too far
Too far to be goneBeen up to no good
Lotta wrong that I've done
'Cause of all my rowdy ways
She gonna pack up and run

She mad
Too mad to make up
She mad
Too mad to make up
All the sorries I can say
Won't be enough

Swore I wouldn't do it
Never let her down
But trouble got a way of
Chasing me around

She mad
Too mad to make up
She mad
Too mad to make up
All the sorries I can say
Won't be enough

Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying
I love you
I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Ooh, yesIf you ain't been to jail
You don't know the blues
And nobody post your bail
You don't know the blues
Lights ain't been off for 2 weeks
You don't know the blues
Sleeping out on the street
You don't know the blues
I've been living my life
Trying to make amends for things I done
If you ain't walked a mile in this man's shoes
Brother, you ain't had the blues
If the tax man took all your money
You don't know the blues
Your stomach hurtin' and hungry
You don't know the blues
If you ain't had nobody cheat on ya
You don't know the blues
If the police had heat on ya
You don't know the blues
If you ain't lost a deal
You don't know the blues
Had to beg borrow and steal
You don't know the blues
If you pawned your guitar
You don't know the blues
Or you're sleeping out in your car
You don't know the blues
If you ain't caught a flat
You don't know the blues
With no spare tire in the back
You don't know the blues

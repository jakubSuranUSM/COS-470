We left you in pastures rarely seen
(Holding out the fortress for a while)
Everyone knew why the calm had been
(Keeping friends among you saves a fight)

In the dead of the night there was movement and shadows
Attacking the women and taking the gold
The men were away and no one could hear them
They still cry today when the story is told

High on a mountain, out searching for gold
Men have had warning of scriptures foretold
Turn around and fight for freedom
You can hear the people screaming

Calling all the heroes
Shooting up the town boys
Call all the hero oh ooo oh ohs
Calling all the heroes
They're burning up the town boys
Calling you

Men returned to find their home destroyed
(People rushing round with scars of war)
Babies cryingâ€¦ the aged wounded mourned
(Calling out for someone to hear their prayers)

Five miles away were the thieves and the bandits
Laughing and joking and sickly and crude
They didn't know that the men had come back home
They didn't know they were being pursued

High on a mountain the men looked below
Cooked up a plan that would outwit their foe
They scrambled down the mountain shooting
Reclaimed all the bandits looted

Calling all the heroes
Shooting up the town boys
Call all the hero oh ooo oh ohs
Calling all the heroes
They're burning up the town boys
Calling you

Da!

Calling all the heroes
Shooting up the town boys
Call all the hero oh ooo oh ohs

Calling all the heroes
Shooting up the town boys
Call all the hero oh ooo oh ohs
Calling all the heroes
They're burning up the town boys
Calling all the hero ooo oh ooo ohs

Calling all the heroes
Shooting up the town boys
Call all the hero oh ooo oh ohs
Calling all the heroes
They're burning up the town boys
Call all the hero ooo oh ooo ohs

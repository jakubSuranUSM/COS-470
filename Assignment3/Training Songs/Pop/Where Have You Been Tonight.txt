Where have you been tonight
And nowhere to go when you need to
I took to you
I took to you from you I drew

Nothing but a lonely smile
I want go out in the sun
But there isn't any sun
And I want the sun

I want to change the way I look
Because I haven't any luck
And my brain is tired
Where have you been

If you hold me back I'll kick you in the shins
Until your night's on fire
It's good to be alive
Where have you been tonight

With the last cries of life
Yes we'll see
There is nothing to prove
Because no one can lose

But you will do
I took to you
I took to you from you I drew
Nothing but a lonely smile

I want to go out in the sun
And I want the sun
I want to change the way I look
Because I haven't any luck

And my brain is tired
Where have you been
If you stop me now
I'll push until you scream

Until the night's on fire
It's good to be alive
Where have you been tonight
With the last cries of life

Yes you'll soon feel the knife
With the last cries of life
Yes we'll see

O my heart it's a fish out of water
O my heart it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun
O my heart it's a rock in the gutter
O my heart it's a rocking great bolder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far it come back floating
And I watch it wash up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead it just is lifeless

O my heart it's a house in tornado
O my heart it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
O my heart it's a roof in el nino
O my heart it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of el niÃ±o

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard it gets mixed back in

Bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum,
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum

O my heart it's fish out of water
O my heart it's a rock in the gutter
O my heart it's a black in a rainbow
O my heart it's so damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cause I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid december

O my heart it's a fish out of water
O my heart it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun

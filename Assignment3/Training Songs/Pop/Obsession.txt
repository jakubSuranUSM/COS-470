Baby baby what can I do
I need to know that I belong
Belong with you
Yeah with you
Baby baby what can I say
The more you play those wicked games
The more I stay
The more I stay

Teacher be concerned
I want it so bad right now it hurts

Cause I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I'm in obsession
I'm in obsession

Baby baby don't make me beg
I only want to give up air
Breathe you instead
You instead
Baby baby just ring the bell
And I'll be staying after class
Under your spell
Yeah, your spell

Teacher be concerned
I don't think my lesson's been learned

Cause I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession

Baby this ain't love
It's obsession

Baby this ain't love
It's obsession
'session
'session
'session
'session

Cause I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I I I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession

Baby this ain't love
It's obsession

Baby this ain't love
It's obsession

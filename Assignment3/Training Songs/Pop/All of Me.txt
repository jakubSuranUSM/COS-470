Worn out faces hanging on the wall
Foreign places, names you still recall
You say loud to yourself, why you just don't care?
Say the things no one else will ever dare.

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
Pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking

All of me is asking, all of me is thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

So you lie to yourself
Why you just aren't scared
All the things that you felt, were always there

So pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking
Pardon me for asking, pardon me for thinking

All of me is asking, all of me is thinking
All of me is asking, all of me is thinking

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

So say it loud if you need it, we've got tough emotions
Do what you don't do
So say it loud when you need it, we've got tough emotions
I'm in awe of you

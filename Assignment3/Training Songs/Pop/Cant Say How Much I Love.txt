CAN’T SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE

I know the secrets of the wind
And the song that bluebird sings
And why seasons never stay.
I know what makes the morning rise
And the taste of paradise 
But there's one thing I can´t say

Oh I can´t say how much I love you
Say how much I need you
I could never find the words to say 
I really really Want you and you are all my eyes can see

Oh I can´t say how much I love you
Say how much I need you
Every word you say is fill with sunshine
When you say you love me that you´ll always stand by me

And now, at last I realize 
That my dreams were in disguise 
And that nothing was sincere.
You came to paint the rainbow line 
And to make each moment rhyme 
all in shades of tenderness 

(CHORUS)

Oh I can´t say how much I love you
Say how much I need you
Every word you say is fill with sunshine
When you say you love me that you´ll always stand by me

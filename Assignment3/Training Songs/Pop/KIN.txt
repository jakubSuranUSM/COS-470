Kin, you're my kin
Kin, you're my kin

Here comes the wave again
Hitting me square in the softest places
Fear has a designated plan
That is just for me
Quietly conceiving
I know it's just behaviour
And I should be braver
But sometimes I can't be
Thankfully
I'm not alone, no I'm never alone

I love you
You ask me how I feel
I love you
You pull back the curtain
I love you
Because I don't have to win
For you, I've already won
From day one
I've already won
You're my Kin

Hear how your nature calls
The peace and relief around you
Has only just begun
Nearby, a rain always falls
On higher ground
As welcome as the sun
You can feel like a faker
And still be your own maker
For all things lead you there
And don't be scared
Cos you're not alone no
You're never alone

I love you
You ask me how I feel
I love you
You pull back the curtain
I love you
Because I don't have to win
For you, I've already won
From day one
I've already won
You're my Kin

Kin, you're my kin
Kin, you're my kin

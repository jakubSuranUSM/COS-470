You say, that's world will getting harder 
Every time you see someone to be loved
Their some evil mind keeps you right for home, to come through
The world 'll getting smaller
And I don't know what to done that
I'll should be your woman 

You sir,loved to be much deeper
And you try to get up 
Now you 've lost your trust
Anything I say could be true
Trouble 'll getting harder 
Please let me pulled you through

I'll be your woman in sorrow and pain
I'll be your woman sunshine or rain
There's a star here in your heart to get burn
Maybe 'll you throw it away
Maybe without tears every day
Say you shared with me
I'll be your woman

You say you're a looser 
But loosers never die
And if you could let me teach you

Darling here's what I 'll be 
I'll be your woman in sorrow and pain
I'll be your woman sunshine or rain
There's a star here in your heart to get burn
Maybe 'll you throw it away

maybe without tears every day
Say you shared with me that 
I'll be your woman

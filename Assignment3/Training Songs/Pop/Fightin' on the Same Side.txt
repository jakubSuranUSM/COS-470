Here we are on the battlefield
A civil war is all each other feels
You say blue and I say gray
But we know love ain't love if it fades away
Don't let it fade away

Just leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl, we're fightin' on the same side

Here we are on the battlefield
Wounded by the words that cut so deep
I can't give if you won't take
Maybe we're just afraid that it's too late
I know it's not too late

Just leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl, we're fightin' on the same side

We're both soldiers of the heart
Fightin' for the dream that fell apart
We both know this war is real
Surrender to the way we used to feel
I miss the way we used to feel

Just leave these troubles behind
And break down all the battle lines
Open up your eyes girl, we're fightin' on the same side

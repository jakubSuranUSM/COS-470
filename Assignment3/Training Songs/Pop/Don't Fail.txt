Why do birds fly in the summer sky, hidden from the eyes of men. 
Where have I been?
Why do things hinge on certain things, and nothing is for sure.
Only pure uninterrupted acts prevail. 
Don't fail.

[Chorus]
Sun, don't fail to greet the morning. 
Moon, don't fail to meet the night.
Girl, don't fail to get your learnin'. 
Boy, don't fail to see the light.
See the light. Don't fail, don't fail, don't fail.

Why do leaves blow in the summer wind, torn from their end. 
Where have I been?
Why do times learn from certain times, and nothing is for sure.
Only pure uninterrupted acts prevail. 
Don't fail.

[Chorus]

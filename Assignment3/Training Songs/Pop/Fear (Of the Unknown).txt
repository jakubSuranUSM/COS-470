I get the feeling -- I'm not alone
I get the feeling -- it's someone I don't know
Do you ever have the strange sensation
When you're standing mighty tall
To jump from seventeen floors and crash into free fall
But then fear takes control -- fear of the unknown
Imagine two complete strangers
Who suspect they were meant to be
Both in need of love and affection
Yet their suspicions prevent something heavenly
Fear takes control -- fear of the unknown
Aware of what will hurt you
You're prepared to remain this way
So sad yet safe with your afflictions
Afraid to start a brand new day
We all get the strangest feeling
When we're standing mighty tall
To jump from seventeen floors and crash into free fall
But then fear carries all -- fear of the unknown
Fear takes its toll -- fear of the unknown
Aware of what will hurt you
You're prepared to remain this way
So sad yet safe with your afflictions
Afraid to start a brand new day

This world is freezing cold
I long for you to hold me in your arms
This world is burning, and
I'm waiting for your hand to lead me home

[Chorus:]
I know that you love me
Oh, I know you love me
Oh, I know you love me

This world is frightening
I see lightning in the sky
I hear the wind howl
Please, help me to be strong
I know it won't be long
Till I'm with you

[Chorus]

Well, here I am
Wandering down a darkened road
Your love shines
Always in my heart
Always in my heart

[Chorus]

This world is freezing cold
I long for you to hold me in your arms
Please, help me to be strong
I know it won't be long
Till I'm with you

[Chorus]

Oh, I know you love me

To think that you were mine, I never thought you'd be so wild 
You played around with everyone anytime at all 
I thought you were bein' friendly when you took them home to tea 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself 

When I used to ring you & you said you were ill in bed 
I should've realized, yes you were ill but in your head 
There's only one thing left for me to say, it's this, my friend: 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself 

Life, I know, is not a dream 
A dream of your A T 
But must you go & try to make some kind of monkey out of me? 

If this life you're livin' suits your temperament & your face 
I'm ever tryin' to change it, I will leave you in disgrace 
There's only one thing left for me to say, it's this, my friend: 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself 
I've been a fool, yes a fool to myself

We say goodnight but not goodbye
And try to calm the emotions that belong
In spaces where they can't go wrong
Are broken at the delicate scenes and thrills
That we call love and devotion where love forever stays

Inside you the light of day reveals the night
Which brings us to a state still yet [Incomprehensible]
Reflections of a distant past filled with longing
Of the trusting love of you I still recall
On it's yearning, where love forever stays inside you

We search as one as others do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places

When cherished goals are realized
The higher heights of life will lead you on
So for the past that go unchanged
These words are spoken

Like the trusting love of you I still recall
On it's learning, where love forever stays
Don't say it's over

We search as one as lovers do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places

We search as one as many do
We look for truths in frightened faces
And try without conclusion to chase away the fears
In all the hidden places

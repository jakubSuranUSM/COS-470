Tonight you gotta look in my eyes
You got it, you drive me out of my mind

Drive, driven
Gave, given
It's dangerous to stay
And I say
Drive, driven
Gave, given
I gave myself away

You drive me crazy
You're lazy
Calling my name
You drive me crazy
You're lazy
Out of my mind
Cause you're a diva
I'm a believer
Cause you're a diva
I'm a believer

Tonight, you gotta give me a number of games
You got it, you gotta give me a number of names

Drive, driven
Gave, given
It's dangerous to stay
And I say
Drive, driven
Gave, given
I gave myself away

You drive me crazy

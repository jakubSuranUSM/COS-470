How long
'til you and i can be together
How long
until we see this through.
Do you recall that winter evening
the night that i first said i'm leaving
hoping
you would change my mind
i lay my head upon your knes and
whispered please but inside i was
leaving
i'm the leaving kind
i could put you off forever
this longing has no end
how long
'til you and i can be together
how long
until we see this through
how long
until we know that this is forever
'til i say i love you
should i say i love you
can i say i love you
we've got to see this through
and when the burning leaves are falling
i can always hear you calling
fearing
that we are losing ground
but in our secret hearts we're knowing
our love is winter and it's snowing
falling
comfort coming down
i cut put you off forever
this longing has no end
advertising lasts a lifetime
if not now, then when.
how long
'til you and i can be together
how long
until we see this through

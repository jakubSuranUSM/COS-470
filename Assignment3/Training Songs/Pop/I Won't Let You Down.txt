You ask me if I'm happy here
no doubt about it
You ask me if my love is clear
want me to shout it
Gave you the best years of my life
woman
I know I failed to treat you right
woman

Don't let me out of here
don't let me out of here

I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again

You say our love is running one way
coming from your side
No help from me to see it through 
to beat the high tide
Take me and chain me if you please
woman
Don't help me dig deeper my grave
woman

Don't let me out of here
don't let me out of here

I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again

I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down
won't let you down again
I won't let you down

When the sky was gold
And I needed no protection
But as the wind would blow
A thousand miles in no direction
Man, it was a beautiful sight
Days were soaked in sunlight
Just so long ago
But lately I like to imagine

When I was young
Whatever happened it would do me no wrong
As long as I could sing my favorite song
When I was young, oh
And the holidays went on and on
We were so high
Let the freeway take us into the night
And in the dark you sang my favorite song
When I was young, oh
And the holidays went on and on
And on, and on, and on
When I was young (Woo!)

Now the sky is gray
But honestly, it doesn’t hurt me (No)
I learned to find my way
On the path and no returnin' oh, oh
Everything I’ve left behind
I'm reminded every time I meet your eyes
We were so bold and brave
Baby, can you imagine?

When I was young
Whatever happened it would do me no wrong
As long as I could sing my favorite song
When I was young, oh
And the holidays went on and on
We were so high
Let the freeway take us into the night
And in the dark you sang my favorite song
When I was young, oh
And the holidays went on and on
And on, and on, and on
When I was young (Woo!)

When I was young
We would play with fire
When I was young
And we would f*ck the price
When I was young
It was do or die
I would give my life just to feel like
When I was young

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Oh, do or die)
When I was young
Do me no wrong
We were so high
Oh, and the holidays went on and on
And on, and on, and on
When I was young

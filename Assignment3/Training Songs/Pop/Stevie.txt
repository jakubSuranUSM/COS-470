Stevie, where you going with that gun
Who you wanna shoot down
Who you trynna kill

You've been watching too much TV
It's playing with your memories
It's trynna break your heart

Just calm down, take your medication
It numbs you to the world
Not my world

And all the kids they say
Live to fight another day
Live to fight again
And all the kids they say
Live to fight another day
Live to fight again, again, again, again

There's no life underneath your finger
Dreamt a little bigger
I'm sick and tired of this

If you, show us what we can't have
What do you expect when
We take it back from you

'Cause it's no joke, no joke
I wanna open up your eyes wide, eyes wide
I feel it coming but you can't hide, can't hide
I wanna make you see

And all the kids they say
Live to fight another day
Live to fight again
And all the kids they say
Live to fight another day
Live to fight again, again, again, again

And the ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
There's more than just existence
I see the fire in your eyes

You knew the song already
It comes as no surprise
It's time to push things forward
'Cause there's no way back, yeah
There's no way back now

Live to fight another day
Live to fight again

Live to fight another day
Live to fight again, again, again, again

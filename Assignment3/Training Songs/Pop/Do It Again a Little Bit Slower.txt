Kiss me (kiss me), I love the way that you kiss me (kiss me, ooo)
There's only one thing wrong with the way you kiss me (kiss me, yeah)
Now your kisses are sweeter than sugar & plenty strong enough
But the bad part is you don't do it slow enough, oh

Do it again just a little bit slower
Do it again just a little bit slower
I just can't stand it when it's over
Do it again just a little bit slower
Hold me (hold me), I love the way that you hold me (hold me, ooo)
There's only one thing wrong with the way you hold me (hold me, yeah)
Maybe you'd just laugh if I let you know too soon
But the thing about this, you just let go too soon, oh baby

Slower, slower, kiss me just a little bit slower
Tell me that you love me, hold me fast, make it last &...
(chorus)
(repeat the word "slower" & fade)

You're everything that I was never ever meant to hold
You are the stories, every riddle that I was never told

Don't you wanna know
What is right behind the door

Open your heart to unexpected love
Open your heart to unexpected, long neglected love

You are the unknown,
All that's hidden in love's equation
You are the sound in the silence of cruel sensation

Don't you wanna know
What is right behind the door

Open your heart to unexpected love
Open your heart to unexpected, long neglected love
Open your heart to unexpected love
Open your heart to unexpected, long neglected love

Like slippery stones under bare feet
A twist of fate walked over me
Sharp intrusion never meant to be
Now I'm calling falling craving raving

Open your heart to unexpected love
Open your heart to unexpected, long neglected love
Open your heart to unexpected love
Open your heart to unexpected, long neglected love
Open up your heart
Open up
Open up your heart
Open up

I'm a statue in the light, a witness in the empty crowd 
Lost in thoughts, shrink by your touch, frozen silent, not a sound 
Through the music you can see that by a vision I have captured 
The fever of the night is raging, I only dream of what comes after 

We know the scheme is in the air, no camouflaged intentions 
For starving hearts it never ends, so let's not be pretentious 

I can't think about dancing, won't think about, I just think about you 
I can't think about dancing, won't think about, I just think about you 
I can't think about dancing, all I think about is you 
I can't think about dancing, I only think about you, just think about you 

Like the victim of the nightlife, so compelled to stay around you 
Moving in electric silence, wondering what you'll lead me into 
We know the scheme is in the air, no camouflaged intentions 
For starving hearts it never ends, so let's not be pretentious 

I can't think about dancing, won't think about, I just think about you 
I can't think about dancing, won't think about, I just think about you 
I can't think about dancing, all I think about is you 
I can't think about dancing, I only think about you, just think about you 
Can't think about dancing just think about you, 
Can't think about dancing, just think about you 
I can't think about dancing, 
Can't think about dancing, just think about you

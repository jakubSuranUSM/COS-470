I got two diamonds and a feather
Gimme three reasons why we ain’t together
I push my body through the floor like
'Cause I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

You’re on the corner waiting for my love
I put two walls behind you just to lean on
You’re gonna need 'em 'cause I stood you up
'Cause I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

'Cause I f*ck with myself more than anybody else
It's all love
I used to care what you think about me
It's all love
'Cause my love so good
So I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

I caught you fishing through the fodder
This whole relationship is under water
You’re facing ages in your third strike
'Cause I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

'Cause I f*ck with myself more than anybody else
It's all love
I used to care what you think about me
It's all love
'Cause my love so good
So I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

I used to have a nickel for what you say, baby
Your words would burn me in the third degree
Now baby look what it’s come to
'Cause my love is the one
My love is the one

So I f*ck with myself more than anybody else
It's all love
I used to care what you think about me
It's all love
'Cause my love so good
So I f*ck with myself more than anybody else

(I used to care what you think)
(So good)

She says "It's not you - it's me
I need a little time, a little space
a place to find myself again
you know?"
Oh yes, I know a goodbye when I hear it 
She smiles but her heart's already out there
Walking down the street

(Chorus)
She says
"I don't want nobody else
I love you", She's lying
"There won't be somebody else
and that's true", She's lying
"say you'll always be my friend
sweet darling"
Why does she pretend?
Ain't no doubt, it's plain to see
A woman like you's no good for me
Your heart's beating at another door
I'm a done fool for to ask for more

She says "It's like in a song, remember?
If you love someone, set them free
Well, that's how it is for me"
And then she kisses me
and somewhere I hear a door slam
So I say "fine"
And just hope that I'm a better liar than she is

(Chorus)
(Chorus)

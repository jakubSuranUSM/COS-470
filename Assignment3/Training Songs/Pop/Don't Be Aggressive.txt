You came around here today
And again you were so cold
I could see it in your eyes
When i tried to touch you
I just can't understand
What happened
I just know i love you

There may be a trouble
There may be pain
But there i am
I am longin' for you
Tell me your wishes
Tell me your dreams
I'll do everything for you
But please don't be aggressive

Don't be aggressive
Don't be a fool
Don't be aggressive
Don't be so cruel
Just love me
Don't be aggressive to me

There was a time not long ago
Our love was young
You were totally different
And i felt safe in your arms
Now tell me what made you change
What made your heart turn to stone
I could be your friend
I could be your slave
I could be everything
That you want me to
But baby don't be aggressive

Don't be aggressive
Don't be a fool
Don't be aggressive
Don't be so cruel
Just love me
Don't be aggressive to me

Don't be aggressive
Don't be a fool
Better love me
Don't be aggressive

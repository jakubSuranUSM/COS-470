God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
For Jesus Christ our Savior
Was born upon this day

To save us all from Satan`s power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
When unto certain Sheppard's
Brought tidings of the same

How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas
All under she`ll replace
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

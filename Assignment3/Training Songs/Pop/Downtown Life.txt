Ah yeah, 
Oh, oh, yeah 
No doubt 
Do it downtown in from the outside 
Yeah, find the scene & work it brother 
Moving through sound 
City's like wild life 
All overgrown & living undercover 
And wound up so tight 

(We love the Downtown Life) 
Downtime life baby 
(Driftin' through the day waiting for the night, oh oh) 
Oh 
(Downtown Life) 
(it feels so right) 
Feels so right 
(It keeps me hangin' on, hangin' on) 

So listen now 
Velvet Lou was a neighbor of mine 
Now he walks the dog in Jersey, Brother 
Yuppies in black with the white collar crime 
They scared away the local color 
But they can't steal the night 

(We love the Downtown Life) 
Downtown life baby 
(Driftin' through the day waiting for the night, oh oh) 
Oh 
(Downtown Life it feels so right) 
Feels so right 
(It keeps me hangin' on) on 

(Downtown Life) 
Oh you'll be downtown life baby 
(Drifting through the day waiting for the night to come) 
Waiting for the night to come 
(Downtown Life it feels so right) 
(It keeps me hangin' on) 
Hangin' hangin' hangin' hangin' hangin' on 

My baby knows she's got to go for this kind of life 
`Cause city life can't stand to see the sunlite 
Dawn patrol better leave me alone 
`Cause I can only take it for so long 
Going down isn't hard to do 
The King of Clubs, and the Queen of Hearts fall too 
She says, "If you believe this is only a lonely time, 
Stay at home boy the blues are lost on you" 
Ain't it true 

(We love the Downtown Life) 
Downtown life baby 
(Drifting through the day waiting for the night, oh) 
We're waiting for the night to fall 
(Downtown Life it feels so right) 
It feels so right 
(It keeps me hangin' on) on 

(Downtown Life) 
Downtown life baby 
(Drifting through the day waiting for the night to come) 
To come 
(Downtown Life) 
And it feels and it feels so right 
(And it feels so right) 
(It keeps me hangin') oh 

Downtown Life 
(Downtown Life it keeps me hangin' on) 
Hangin' hangin' on to Downtown Life 
(Downtown Life it keeps me hangin') 
Hangin' on 
(Downtown Life) 
You want the Downtown Life 
(Drifting through the day waiting for the night) 

Drifting, waiting, hangin' on hangin' on to Downtown Life 
(Downtown Life it keeps me hangin') 
You want the Downtown Life 
(Downtown Life) 
Hangin' on hangin' on 
(Drifting through the night waiting for the night) 
Hangin' on to Downtown Life 
(Downtown Life it keeps me hangin') 
Hangin' on to Downtown Life

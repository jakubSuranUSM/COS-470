Pallbearers in heavy weather
How the guilty put themselves to work!
Less common to see the patterns in the timing of the universe.
Oh my sweet Lucretia why won't you believe me
Oh you know I really need you,
Why won't you believe me.
I hate these sure-footed doctors.
He won't help me- yes I know his kind;
All "bootstraps" and "how's your mother"
Never loved a moment of his life!
Oh my sweet Lucretia why won't you believe me.
Oh you know I really need you,
Why won't you believe me.
Terrified of the postman and the electrical service
Tide roll out, tide roll back in.
This time a wave is coming.

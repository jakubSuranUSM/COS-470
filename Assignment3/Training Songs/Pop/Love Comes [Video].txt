If I told you 
Heaven knows 
Got me spinning from my head down to my toes 
Oh 
Without warning I'm exposed 
And my heart misses a beat when you're so close 
Oh 

And then love comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't breathe 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) 
And then Love Comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't sleep 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh heartbeat heartbeat-beat-beat 

Caught a rainbow 
A ray of light 
With your kisses and caresses 
Your delight 
Oh 
I have waited to justify 
This love we have 
It cannot be denied 
Oh 

And then love comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't breathe 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) 
And then love comes in a heartbeat 
Love comes and you can't sleep 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh heartbeat heartbeat-beat-beat-beat 

Memories past are bitter sweet 
Faded fast now you're with me 
You're with me 

And then love comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't breathe 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) 
And then love comes in a heartbeat 
Love comes and you can't sleep 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) 
And then love comes 
Love comes 
Love comes 
Love comes 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh heartbeat heartbeat-beat-beat-beat 
Oh

I won't be here when you come home
I'm sorry if you don't understand  forgive me if you can
But I can see  another road
And I ain't coming back

Don't look for me you  bound this town
Cause I will be so far away  you'll never find me anywhere
And I won't take  no souvernirs  no perfume  picture  promises
Because it's over
And I ain't coming back

You gave me everything
And now I'm breaking your heart
You know that I don't mean
To tear your world apart

I would never leave, if I thought you couldn't stand the pain
A letter in hall, is written on the wall
A letter with the words of love at all
Because it's over
And I ain't coming back

And as I close the door
I know I'm breaking your heart
I should have loved you more
Instead I've torn world apart

And as I walk into the lonely afternoon
I feel sad enough, I feel bad enough
And all the times when you are lonely where you are
Please don't hate me then, I just could not pretend

Tears, feel the tears, I can feel the tears, running through the years

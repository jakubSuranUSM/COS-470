Cold dawn won`t comfort you
Cold coffee
Won`t see you through
Cold sheets

Won`t heal your heart
Your frozen fingers of your
Name so tarred
I know so rarely

That things come your way
Your ways are tender
And your paths are straight
Your mind`s not lived in

The way ours are set
Your heart is open
To love and regret
Rings and letters they pass you by

You wish them well
And seldom cry
For stones and promises and wedding sighs
You`ve known the times that you`ve

Lived and died
These sailors come by
And spend time ashore
Their thoughts are hoarded

As yours have been stored
Your mind`s not lived in
The way ours are set
Your heart is open

To love and regret
Outside in the morning air
I hear the soundtrack of the
Blues harp player

It touches feelings that you
Don`t arouse
Knocks me back to that
Shuttered house

Take me back
When they`re all out
Take me back to that
Shuttered house

I know so rarely
That things come your way
Your ways are tender
And your paths are straight

Your mind`s not lived in
The way ours are set
Your heart is open
To love and regret

Love and regret
Love and regret

Ah, do you remember the first time you started to date 
And the places you had to go just to be alone with your number one? 
Well, I hope this song brings back a whole lot of beautiful memories 
For you. 

Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show 
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go 
And when the lights went way down low 
Did you forget about the picture show 
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show 

Hey, little girl was it so long ago 
We'd take a walk just to be alone 
And hey little girl if it should rain or snow 
Remember where we would go 

Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show 
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go 
And when the lights went way down low 
Did you forget about the picture show 
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show 

Sometimes I get to thinkin' there's not enough love and 
Romance left in our lives today. And that's why I'd like to 
Reminisce and to relive that first feeling of love and do it all over 
Again. 

Hey little girl why not come over here 
And set beside me and make believe 
And say, little girl, why not stay over here 
We'll have a party for two 

Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show 
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go 
And when the lights went way down low 
Did you forget about the picture show 
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show

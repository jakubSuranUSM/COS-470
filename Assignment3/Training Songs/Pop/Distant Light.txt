She sits at table number thirty-five,
The only one of us who's still alive 

There's no telling when you need a friend 
To get you home and back again 
There's something special in emergency,
It was a heart
But what blind to see

Lately we're caught up in the skinny wars, 
We like to sit back and compare the scars

Outside awaits, it's calling your name,
And it won't be long
Tomorrow and a day,
It's your life from a distant light 
Still doing drive buys in your neighbourhood
I want to leave you but I never could 

It's just a party, but it's so much more,
Please feed the socialite before it bores

There's no mistake, they keep telling me,
A happy heart has a world to see 

Outside awaits, it's calling your name
And it won't be long
Tomorrow and a day
It's your life from a distant light 

Distant light,
Distant line
Distant light,
Distant line

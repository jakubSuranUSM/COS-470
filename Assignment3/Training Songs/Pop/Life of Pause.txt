On my own
She's at home
There's not a single day that I don't tell you "miss you more"
Time in space
A love delayed
Just know that when I go, there's no reason to be afraid

How can we want love?
How can we want love? (Tell me how)
How can we want love?

How can we want love?
How can we want love? (Tell me how)
How can we want love?

Distance frays
Pull away
But when the static comes there's nothing left for us to say
No words
The best words
I take a life of pause just so I can be near to you

How can we want love?
How can we want love? (Tell me how)
How can we want love?

How can we want love?
How can we want love? (Tell me how)
How can we want love?

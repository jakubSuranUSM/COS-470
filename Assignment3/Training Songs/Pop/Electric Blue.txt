Eyes wide electric baby
All dyed in cobalt blue
Stole from the Army Navy store
Army Navy store

My dominatrix baby
Dolled up in rubber tube
All evolution dated
My carbon copy too
Carbon copy too

When we dance to super nature
Hold your hands in space
Come on darling
I won't hate you
There's nothing left in this life
I die for you oh
I die for you oh

Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)
Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)

Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)
Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)

Eyes wide electric baby
All dyed in cobalt blue
March of the clones elated
Revolution overdue
Revolution overdue

When we dance to super nature
Hold your hands in space
Come on darling
I won't hate you
There's nothing left in this life
I would die for you oh
I would die for you oh

Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)
Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)

Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)
Gotta a pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
Gotta a pain in feet
(Deeper and deeper)

When you're down and in despair
Don't be uneasy because He'll be there
Say don't you worry, no, don't you fret
The Lord has never, never failed you yet

So hold on, help is on the way
Hold on, God is on his way
Hey, hold on He's on his way
He told me to hold on

He's on his way
Hold on, He's coming soon
Pray, He'll be there
C'mon now, yeah

Now when it seems that you can't stand
Just hold on to God's unchanging hand
Yeah, weeping may, yes, endure for just one night
But joy will come in the morning light

Hold on, He's on his way
Come on, hold on
See I've tried it and I know

Help is on the way
Hold on, hold on
I'm begging 'cause I know
He's on his way

He may not come when you want him
But He's right on time
But He'll be right there
(On time)

Help is on the way, help is on the way
Help is on the way, yeah
The word told me, if I ask, He's on his way
I'm thankful 'cause I know He is

Come on just say, help
Come on just try, help
Ask Him for a little bit, help
He'll give it to you right away, help

Help, believe, He's on his way now, help
Help, know the help, I know, help
I've called Him before, help
He said, His help is on the way, help

Help is on the way
So glad to know, hey [unverified]

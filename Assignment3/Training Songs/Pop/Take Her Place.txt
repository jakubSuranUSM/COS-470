Ease my mind, with a little conversation
Left me high on our past time
Maybe if I use my imagination
Then I would be your love, you'd be mine

You know, I know, that we're both here all alone
Take my broken heart now and pull me close

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

I close my eyes, need your sweet distraction
It's been a long time and we're out here on the line
Doesn't need to be right, I need to fight the attraction
I just need you to steal my heart away from my mind

Hope you know, I know, why we're both here all alone
But take my broken heart now and pull me close

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

Damn you look good, yeah, you know that I want you
It's nothing personal, might never call you
'Cause I have some issues and I gotta warn you
But I don't gotta lie, know that ain't right

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

You can take her place tonight
I need somebody in the morning
Somebody to hold me tight
You don't even have to meet her
And you can take her place tonight
Don't even have to talk in the morning
Though I know that ain't right
But you can take her place tonight

Help me beat this losing streak
I'm running 'round like a dog on heat.
I've got it bad
I know it's sad

Every time I'm around you baby.
I just can't stand it anymore

And I just can't stand it anymore.
You play me up
You cut me down

I must be blind when you fool me around.
It's bitter-sweet
This love you keep

Every time I'm around you baby.
I just can't stand it anymore

And I just can't stand it anymore.
A love-hate emotion I can't hide
Cause I let each day take away my pride.
And you hurt me more
Each time I try to say good-bye.

A love, hate emotion I can't hide

I can't believe
I do the things I do for you

I've seen your tricks a hundred times yeah.
It's bitter-sweet
Just a losing streak

Every time I'm around you baby.

I just can't stand it anymore
And I just can't stand it anymore.
I just can't stand it anymore

And I just can't stand it anymore.
Every time I'm around you baby.
And I just can't stand it anymore, oh baby,
And I just can't stand it anymore.

Why don't we try a slow dance
It's all going by us too fast
Oh, why don't we try a slow dance
And maybe this moment will last

All night long we've been dancing
Dancing too far away
All night long I've been waiting for them to play
A slow dance

Why don't we try a slow dance
Before it all comes to a close
We'll see how it feels
And see where the feelings goes
Oh, why don't we try a slow dance
And then who knows

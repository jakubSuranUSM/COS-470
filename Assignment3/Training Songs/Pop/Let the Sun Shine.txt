I feel a cold flush going through my hair
And hey you know what
I dont even care
The time has passed me by
Its gone with the wind
Its only cus the sun shined once again
Now the party’s on
Everybody’s there
And if you dont know anyone
You’ll still meet some new friends
That’s the way it is
When I have myself a drink
Its only cus the sun shines once again

Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby

So turn the lights off
Aint no one afraid
When the night comes
It’ll be just like the day
And without the day
I am glowing from within
Only cus the sun shined once again
So play that sweet tune
Play it through the air
And the volume
Blaze it up
Don't you ask me twice
You know I'm gonna bid
Only cause the sun shined once again

Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby

I know that the world is gonna smile again
When we go from the darkness into the light
Oh
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine

Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let it all go baby

Let the sun shine yeah eh ey yeah

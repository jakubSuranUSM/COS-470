Let me invite you in
Look around and feel at home
But let me insist on one thing
Tell me if I'm wrong

They must have put
Something in the water
'Cause somethings not in order
And that's why I'm alone

They said love,
Love was my arena
But God you should have seen her
So why is she now gone?

Now that you've seen the house
So clean and well designed
How could a man like me
Get left so far behind?

They must have put
Something in the water
'Cause somethings not in order
And that's why I'm alone

They said love, 
Love was my arena
And God, you should have seen her
So why is she now gone?

It read "most desirable
A place with modern lines
They said, "you'd a mug to lose it
It is your time to buy."

I know that I'll be calling up the council
The halls of power in my sights
Its my right to know the truth
Let me invite you in

It's soon to be your home
It really has everything
But are you happy on your own?
I know they put

Something in the water
'Cause somethings not in order
And that's why I'm alone
They said love, love was my arena

But God, you should have seen her
So why is she now gone?

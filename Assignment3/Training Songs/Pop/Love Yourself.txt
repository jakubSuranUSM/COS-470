Pamper me
Perhaps you could do your worst in biro
Tattoo scratch for real or for me or for everyone I know 
You hurt, I know you cry, and there I understand

Christmas lights, blizzards and the snow
You have to let go, give in to your grief
Find a figurehead in a paper bag or down the street
Someone who's there to care you
Need to let go, it's not forevermore
Be practical and love yourself

I'm here, I understand
I'm here, I understand
I'm here, I understand.

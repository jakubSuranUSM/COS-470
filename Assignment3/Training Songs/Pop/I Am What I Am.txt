Looking at me, through the eye of a needle,
Is a scary thing to do.
I feel a mole hill lies in front of me, to climb.
Is your primary purpose in life,
To scrutinize every move I make?
'cause if it is, I think your wasting precious time.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
And I know, that my job is pleasing you, but...

I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

Well I know I have my weaknessess,
As you point them out to me.
But I'll confront the spots of doubt as they arise.
Never born to be a leader,
But I'll take my role with pride.
'cause a soldier with his honours, lies inside.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
As you say, that my job revolves around you.
I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

Well I know that I have got a job to do,
But my life, wasn't made for you.

I am what I am,
The way god made me.
I am what I am,
Don't try and change me.

I am what I am,
The way god made me.

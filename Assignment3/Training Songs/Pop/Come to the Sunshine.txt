Come to the sunshine
Hang your ups and downs you come to the sunshine
Come to the sunshine
You know I know you know that I love you

Weather here could not be finer
It suits to sail off Carolina shore
I`ll tell you more and moreover
Cotton threads to keep me cool
In the sun-swept afterglow
I know I`m a fool
But I`m hoping that you`ll be
Mine in time

Sailboats sail two by two by
I think a lot of you I
Really doubt you think about me like I do you

Come to the sunshine
To the sunshine
You know I know you know that I love you

While they play the White Swan Serenade
Cornered, struck, I watch them promenade
They`re comforted, got it made over

Dunn and Bradstreet, Vanity Fair
Who wears what how much and who`s been where
But I really don`t care
The lesson we share

Come to the sunshine
Hang your ups and downs you come to the sunshine
Come to the sunshine

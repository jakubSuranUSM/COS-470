We can stay
Or we can move along
Either way don't leave me all alone
I'm sorry about your eye

I'll find a way to make amends
It's only that sometimes
I've got to break
Before I bend

Come on, darling
There's a show downtown tonight
Let's go out dancing
We can drink until the light

I know I've haven't been everything
A man should be
But I promise I will change
You just leave that up to me

And I'll kiss your face, attend to your aches
I swear that I can make you happy
And you'll rub my back, forget the past
And baby, I know that that ain't so easy

It ain't too late
To salvage all of this
It ain't too late we could
Fix it with a kiss

All I want this one more chance
So that we could have a home
'Cause I would not stand a change
If I had to make it on my own

Oh, let me kiss your face, attend to your aches
I swear that I could make you happy
And you'll rub my back, forget the past
And baby I know that that ain't so easy

Maybe someday
You will remember what I said to you today
Maybe someday
And where would you go anyway

Put that suitcase down
Leave it for another day
Stop this fooling around
I could never let you get away

Let me kiss your face, attend to your aches
I swear that I can make you happy
And you'll rub my back, forget the past
And baby, I know that that ain't so easy, please

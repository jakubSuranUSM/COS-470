I never tried to be a hero
You took us from the stars to zero

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go f*ck yourself with other people
Other people

No more song, no more dance, no dance floor
We left it all to chance, no encore

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, go f*ck yourself with other people

Oh, baby it's just your body
Go, lay it on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people

Thank you baby, thank you babe
Darling don't explain, don't explain
Thank you baby, thank you babe
Darling don't explain, don't explain

We had a love devout without a shred of doubt
We never worried 'bout other people
You broke the spell and wanted something else
Well, now go f*ck yourself with other people

Oh, baby it's just your body
Go, lay it on everybody
They won't be there when you're sorry
Other people
Oh, baby it's just your body
Will it know that you love somebody
Who won't be there when you're sorry?
Other people
Other people

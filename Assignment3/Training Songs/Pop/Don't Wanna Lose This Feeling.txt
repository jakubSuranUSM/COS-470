I'm back for more, and I got the cure
I know where I'm going for sure
What we threw away, we should've saved
Come and make my day

I said some things
That did not ring true
And I said some things I did not mean to
Now I'm back for more (more)

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to lose this feeling
That you're givin' me everytime I need it
Ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me more, and more
I don't want to lose this feelin' 
That you're givin' me everytime I need it
I ain't lookin' for more
I nned what you're givin' me, more
(give me more)

Why can't we blow, why don't we go
With our imperfections, we know
What we threw away, we should've saved
Come and make my day

I said some things
That did not ring true
And I said some things I did not mean 
Now I'm back for more (more)

[Chorus]

Don't want to lose, don't, this feel
Don't, don't want to lose, don't, this feel
Want to lose, don't, this, this feel
I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, ready

I'm ready, come get me
And give me some more, give me some more
I'm ready, come get get me
And give some more

[Chorus]

Ooh I'm ready
Oh give me some more
Oh some more
Yeah

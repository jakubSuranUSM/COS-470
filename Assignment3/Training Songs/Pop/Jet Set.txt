This is the time
Now gimme that beat
Feel how the rhythm grips your feet.
Kitty-Baby
Take my hand
She's like a devil heaven sent.
I'm in her arms and she's in mine
Maybe we'll make the film on time.
Sitting in the 15th row
Oh baby
I love you so.
We are the jet set society
We are the jet set
And the means liberty
Liberty.
We are the jet set society
We are the jet set
We are the jet set-set society.
We're on the run
We know where to go
We've got the tickets for the midnight show.
Nights are buniing out so fast
Hop on the beam
You won't be last.
The Russians seem to be that way
We love 'em like we love D. Kaye.
We need no money
We got it free
We are the high-high-high-high-high-society.
We are the jet set society
We are the jet set
. . .
We are the jet set
Hop on the beam
We are the jet set
Hop on the beam.
We are the jet set
Hop on the beam
We are the jet set
Hop on the beam.
Shine on society
Shine on liberty
Shine on luxury
Shine on society.
Streets are full of love and fear
This could be the final year.
Enrico's dead but still o. k
We dance the streets
Feeling well.
If she's a lady
I'm her man
If she's a man
I'll do what I can.
Let's go to the moon
Let's go to the moon
Come and join the institution
Let's go to the moon.
Let's go to the moon
Let's go to the moon
Set that taste of liberty and let's go to the moon.
Let's go to the jet set - let's go to the moon = society.
We are the jet set - let's go to the moon - liberty.
We are the jet set - let's go to the moon - society.
We are the jet set - let's go to the moon - liberty.
Jet set - let's go to the moon - society.
We are the jet set - let's go to the moon - liberty. . . .

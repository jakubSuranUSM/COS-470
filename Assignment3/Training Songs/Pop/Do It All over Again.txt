No matter what the weather,
Got to get yourself together
Gonna swing that head,
You’re a long time dead.

Don’t get your mind out of line or you’ll do it all over again.

Why do you stick to the rules, 
If rules are just for fools.
Once you leave that track
Ain’t no going back.

Don’t get your mind out of line or you’ll do it all over again.

You’ve been living like a crackajack.
5-37 with a knife in your back.
Try sunshine and drinking wine.
Oh don’t you know, (don’t you know) it’s gonna work out fine.

So when your running out of money,
And feeling kinda funny
Try charity, for eternity

Don’t get your mind out of line or you’ll do it all over again.

Don’t get your mind out of line or you’ll do it all over again.

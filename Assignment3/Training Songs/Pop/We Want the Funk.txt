Excuse me, where have I seen you? 
They tend to ask me 
A humble answer I give them 
As we start to get closer 
But then even more so 
They all persist on rubbing my torso 
I'm Latin but I ain't wrapping in satin 
No, that old disco look just ain't happening 
I'm fresh and new and making my debut 
So let me run this information by you 
Its true we outdo, it has become an issue 
Love em and leave em fast we won't miss you 
Its tradition were well conditioned 
We outlast the competition, so listen 
We don't care too much about kissing 
No, we know just what you've been missing 
Were straight out and blunt 
We don't put up with stunts 
Baby, you know what we want 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

don't play shy, don't expect long good-byes 
These are some of the rules that we go by 
No demands and forget holding hands 
Please, not around our friends 
We intend to hold on to our image 
Don't try to cross that line of scrimmage 
Don't say you weren't aware, so have yourself prepared 
And beware, this is a one-time love affair 
See, that's as far as it goes, its our motto 
And you thought you won the lotto 
Waiting to claim your prize you go unrecognized 
Huh! how's that for a surprise? 
So save yourself from confusion and sorrow 
Don't even think about tomorrow 
Tonights the night, enjoy! 
Were here to make some noise 
Let me hear that high pitch in your voice 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

Smoother than James Bond you wake and were gone 
So you wonder what you did wrong 
Huh! don't be blaming yourself, its a must that we vanish 
Here's the scroop straight to you, but in Spanish... 
Oye nena, rubia o morena, mi excusa est en mis venas 
Soy un simple mujeriego no lo niego ni miento 
Soy latino cien por ciento 
As que piensa lo bien si no es conmigo con quien es? 

Responde de una vez 
No te me hagas la importante la dificil o atorrante 
Al cabo tengo mas amantes 
No te prometo nada saldrs por donde entrastes 
Yo no pienso molestarte 
As que no me busques, me sigas, me asustes 
Busca otro que te la ajuste 

Now there it is, laid out plain and simple 
In Spanish but on tempo 
Can't comprehend at all, confused or in a hole? 
What's the matter? No habla espaol? 
If that's the case then no need to worry 
Bust out the dictionary 
You want some inside info 
Wanna know what you're in for 
Look up right under nympho 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk

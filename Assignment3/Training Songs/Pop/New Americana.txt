Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles, just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga
Bad romance, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success now she rose with Rockafellas

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound but we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father, but he could never love somebody’s daughter
Football team loved more than just the game so he vowed to be his husband at the altar

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They’re Monaco and Hamptons bound but we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We know very well who we are, so we hold it down when summer starts
What kind of dough have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
We are the new Americana (we know very well)
High on legal marijuana (who we are)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (so we hold it down)
We are the new Americana

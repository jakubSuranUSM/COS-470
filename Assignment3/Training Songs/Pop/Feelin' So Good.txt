Looky over there, sunshine in her hair
That's my girl, her name is Skooby-Doo
Don'tcha like her smile?
Don'tcha like her style?
You know I'd walk a mile for Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my lonely head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good

Anytime at all I wanna have a ball
All I do is call my Skooby-Doo
She can make me laugh in a minute in a half
Yes, I'm going daff with Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my only head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good

Oh my I love you
Skooby-Doo, I love you
I said a "S"
"K"
"O-O"
"B"
"Y"
"D-O-O"
oh oh
oh oh

oh oh oh oh

Diamonds and a ring, presents I could bring
Wouldn't mean a thing to Skooby-Doo
Sunday after mass picnic in the grass
Diggin' Mama Cass with Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my only head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good
So good 

Feelin' so good

She's a diva lady.
She's a hopeless case.
She needs extra makeup
For her extra face.
She's a hopeless case.

She's a diva lady.
She's got special needs.
She wants chocolate candies
But no blue ones, please
She's got special needs.

She lives in a vacuum.
She has no real home.
Where did diva come from?
Where shall diva go?
She has no real home.

She's got thirty people in her entourage.
Just in case her ego needs a quick massage.
She's got a famous boyfriend
They go out in style.
She makes him look hetero
He helps her profile.

She's a diva lady.
She looks down her nose
at the shoes I'm wearing
and my care worn clothes.
Such a pretty nose.
Such a pretty nose.

She's a diva lady.

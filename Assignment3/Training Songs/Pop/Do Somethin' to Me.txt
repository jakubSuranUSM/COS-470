Do something to me
I've got to find love in a hurry 
Do something to me
Help me to ease all the worry 

Whenever you're near me
You give me such a lovin' feeling
But baby you keep concealin'
What I want to know (so come on)
I want to know so come on

Do something to me
I've got to find love in a hurry 
Do something to me
Help me to ease all the worry 
Do something to me
Help me to ease all the worry 
So let's get together 
Just think of all the time we've wasted
All the love we could be tastin'
So baby let's go (oh come on)

[Chorus]
Do something to me
I've got to find love in a hurry 
Do something to me
Help me to ease all the worry 

It should be so easy 
For you to hear what my heart's sayin'
So why do you keep delayin'
What I want to know
So come on do something to me

[Chorus]

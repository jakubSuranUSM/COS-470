I talk to you as to a friend
I hope that's what you've 
Come to be 
It feels as though we've 
Made amends
Like we found a way 
Eventually

It was you who picked 
The pieces up 
When I was a broken soul 
And then glued me
Back together
Returned to me what 
Others stole

I don't want to hurt you 
I don't want to make you sway
Like I know I've done before
I will not do it anymore
I've always been a dreamer
I've had my head among 
The clouds
Now that I'm coming down
Won't you be my solid ground?

I look at you and see a friend
I hope that's what you want to be
Are we back now where 
It all began?
Have you finally forgiven me?

You gathered my dreams in 
When they all blew away
And then tricked them 
Back into me
You saved me I was 
Almost dead

You saved me when I was almost dead.

I don't want to hurt you,
I don't want to make you sway.
Like I've done before,
I will not do it anymore.

[Repeat x2]
I've always been a dreamer,
I've had my head among the clouds.
But now that IÂ´m coming down,
Won't you be my solid ground?

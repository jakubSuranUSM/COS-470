There's a little Don Juan in everyone 
Who can't stop looking but that ain't wrong 
Don't even try to stop a roving eye 
'Cos there's a hundred pretty women to every guy 

But I, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep 
I've lost my appetite 
It's gotta be, you and me 
We've got it right 

They say a little window shopping 
Don't hurt no one 
I'm only looking, not touching 
Just having fun 

But I, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep 
I've lost my appetite 
It's gotta be, you and me 
We've got it right 

But I'm on my own, what to do 
I don't need solitude 
I need someone else, that is true 
And that someone else has got to be you 

I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But if can't have you, can't have you 
Don't want someone else instead 
I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But I really want you, really want you 
Don't want no one else instead 
Isn't it strange what a man can do 
If he can't have you 

There's a little bit of Romeo in every guy 
With a runaway mind and twinkle in his eye 
Always looking out for something sweet 
But you can look at the candy but you don't have to eat 

But I, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep 
I've lost my appetite 
It's gotta be, you and me 
We've got it right 

But I'm on my own, what to do 
I don't need solitude 
I need someone else, that is true 
And that someone else has got to be you 

I sleep much better in someone else's bed 

 
  
 

I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But if can't have you, can't have you 
Don't want someone else instead 
I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But I really want you, really want you 
Don't want no one else instead 
Isn't it strange what a man can do 
If he can't have you 

Yo, sweetheart what's wrong with you 

What's wrong with me? Let's talk about it 

I told you it's just you 

Hmmm, I doubt it, who's Shandy? 

Oh well that's 

And who's Renee 

Well, see last week I was a the market 

Aha, and who's that other girl I saw you with today 

Come on, baby, these are girls I used to play with 
But you're the lady I want to stay with 

Yeah, but hey if you think I'm gonna sit here and listen 
while you run a line and fall into a trap like those other 
girls 

Come on, I'm sorry, I told you that, hmm gimme a kiss 

Don't you understand it's hard to deal with this? 
You play me part time, hello then goodbye 
While you run around town like some playboy, some fly guy 

Look, I'm a new man now, the playboy's dead. 
Now how's about we both sleep better in your bed 

But I'm on my own, what to do 
I don't need solitude 
I need someone else, that is true 
And that someone else has got to be you 

I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But if can't have you, can't have you 
Don't want someone else instead 
I sleep much better in someone else's bed 
But I really want you, really want you 
Don't want no one else instead 
Isn't it strange what a man can do 
If he can't have you

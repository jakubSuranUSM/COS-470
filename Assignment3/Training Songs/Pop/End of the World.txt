Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?

I'm feeling low today,
Is this the latest fashion.
What do the papers say,
Well then I'm bored already.
I could die, would anybody really notice
I can't relate today,
I've never felt so lonely.
Is this the modern world,
I feel I'm dead already.
That's the catch, it's such a beautiful confusion

Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Aaaah Ahhhh

I breathe a motorway,
Just for the sake of breathing.
I turn the TV on,
Don't know what to believe in.
Aaaa ahhh
Oh yeah
Aaah ahhhh

Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Aaaah Ahhhh

Can hardly see the stars
There's too much light pollution
Is this reality, or just a new illusion?
That's the catch, it's such a beautiful confusion
That's the catch, it's such a beautiful confusion

Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?
Is this the end of the world?

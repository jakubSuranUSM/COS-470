I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun (girls, they wanna, wanna have fun, girls wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just want to have fun (girls, they wanna, wanna have fun, girls wanna have)
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)
Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)
Girls just want to have fun

When the working
When the working day is done
Oh when the working day is done, oh girls
Girls, they wanna have fun, everybody

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls (girls just wanna have fun)
Girls just want to have fun

(They just wanna, they just wanna) when the working
When the working day is done (they just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh when the working day is done, oh girl (girls just wanna have fun)
Girls just wanna have fun (they just wanna, they just wanna)

Say goodnight and go

Skipping beats, blushing cheeks I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner caf√©
And then I'm left in bits recovering tectonic tremblings
You get me every time

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing
Got lucky, beautiful shot you taking everything off watch the curtains wide open
Then you fall in the same routine flicking through the TV relaxed and reclining
And you think your alone

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

One of these days, you'll miss your train and come stay with me
It's always say goodnight and go
We'll have drinks and talk about things, any excuse to stay awake with you
You'll sleep here, I'd sleep there, but then the heating may be down again
At my convenience
We'd be good, we'd be great together.

It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Say goodnight and go,
Why's it always always
Goodnight and go
Darling not again
Goodnight and go.

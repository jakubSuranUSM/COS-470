When I was in your arms last night.
I felt this aching pain inside.
Oh, baby, I knew we must part.
You gave me all the things I missed.
Oh, I just loved the way you kissed.
I felt this song in my heart.

Around and 'round the world.
Love is the only connection.
Around and 'round the world.
Oh, baby, I'm lost in affection.
Around and 'round the world.

Turn on the radio and listen to the sound.
It goes round and round and round.

Young love is made of joy and fears.
I hear our song and feel the tears.
Just wanna be sure you are true.
Maybe I was too blind to see.
But you can't foretell what will be.
Before it comes out of the blue.

Around and 'round the world.
Love is the only connection.
Around and 'round the world.
Oh, baby, I'm lost in affection.
Around and 'round the world.

Turn on the radio and listen to the sound.
It goes round and round and round.

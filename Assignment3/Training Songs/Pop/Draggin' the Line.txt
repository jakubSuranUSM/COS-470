Making a living the old, hard way.
Taking and giving my day by day.
I dig the snow and the rai nand the bright sunshine.
I'm draggin' the line (draggin' the line).

My dog Sam eats purple flowers.
We ain't got much, but what we've got's ours.
We dig snow and the rain and the bright sunshine.
Draggin' the line (draggin the line).

I feel fine.
I'm talking about peace of mind.
I'm gonna take my time.
I'm getting to good times.
Draggin' the line (draggin the line).

Loving a free and feeling spirit.
Hugging a tree when you get near it.
Digging the snow and the rain and the bright sunshine.
I'm draggin' the line (draggin the line).
Draggin' the line (draggin' the line).

I feel fine.
I'm talking about peace of mind.
I'm gonna take my time.
I'm getting to good times.
Draggin' the line (draggin the line).

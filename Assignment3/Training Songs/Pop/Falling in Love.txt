Your eyelids are gettin' heavy
Hard to lift
Your mind begins to wander
Things start to drift
Your arms are getting heavy
Hard to lift
You sink down a little deeper
You're feeling wonderful

[Chorus]
Maybe you're falling in love
Maybe you're falling in love
Maybe you're falling  falling  falling  falling in love

You stare across the harbor
At the lights along the bay
Your arms have got so heavy  now
They're just getting in your way
Look
Now you're walkin' in the holy land
Yeah, that's you there, walkin' with the king
You ask "What have I done to deserve this?"
Why, you haven't done a thing

[Chorus]

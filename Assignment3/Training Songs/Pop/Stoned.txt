Hey sad girl
Why is it you would do anything
To hang with the bad girls
Committing crimes and doing time
To be in your own world
Fantasies of guns and ammunition
Are possessions that you prize

You're always stoned
Yes, you're always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned

Hey hippie
Pushing incense and stink love
While you were heaving
Catching Krishna's curse at Govinda's
In Venice town
Where Hecker lived for many years
In Venice town where everyone's on crack

You're always stoned
Yes, you're always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned

You are really out of it
Every day just like the rest
Live bootlegs recorded
At the Nest, yeah

Punk rock squatter girls from Hollywood
You are so sweet
Except when you're on the speed
You're always stoned

Yeah you're always stoned (always stoned you're)
You're always stoned (always stoned you're)
You know you're always stoned (always stoned you're)
Always

Always stoned you're
Always stoned you're
Always stoned you're
Always

Always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned
Always stoned

Why you acting so reserved?
Talk to me, girl

What? Is that all you got to say?
What what? You're rubbing me the wrong way
See your lips moving
But I don't catch a word you say
Shut up your chatter
I need for you to go away

And all I ever hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head, get outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
get outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
want you outta my head
outta my, outta my head
that's what i said

What
You looking at me for?
Show me respect, or I will show you the door
Get out that door
Lately, I've a problem with the way that you behave
You're too much
And all your questions don't leave
me no time for me

And all I ever hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head, get outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
get outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
want you outta my head
outta my, outta my head
that's what i said

All your opinions, keep them to yourself
Just let me think so I can hear myself
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just go solo, take a day off?
I'd be all right if you would leave me to it, back out the door
Ay ya ya ya, you're talking way too much

You tell me one more time how I should live
I swear I'll bite your head off
I am who I am, and I can't be no one else
You've got nothing left to say, keep your comments to yourself

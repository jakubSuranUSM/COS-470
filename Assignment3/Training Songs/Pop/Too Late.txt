We've been going back and forth 
I'm waiting for the day you call me 
I think I can do it on my own 
Swinging like a pendulum 
The time ticks by until it's gone 
I'm thinking that 
The sun has never shown 

Time is gonna start 
It's never gonna stop 
Time is running out 
Going into shock 
'Cause you're 
Too late 
Too late 
Too late 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Never quite the effort-maker 
I see you're not nearly ready 
I think I can do it on my own 
Just too late and still too little 
I just seemed to miss you crawling 
Never thought the day would come I know 

Time is gonna start 
It's never gonna stop 
Time is running out 
Going into shock 
'Cause you're 
Too late 
Too late 
Too late 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Time is gonna start 
It's never gonna stop 
Time is running out 
Going into shock 
'Cause you're 
Too late 
Too late 
Too late 

You're too late 
Too late 
Too late 
You're too late 
Not quite 
The same 
Oh oh oh oh oh

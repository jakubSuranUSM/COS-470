I love your body next to mine
When you're always there to hold my hand
I love the way you say it's fine

When I be fucking up my life again

But I don't love you I'm just lonely
You don't know that I'm a waste if time
If that's wrong, than no one told me
I just need someone to hold me now
'Cause I don't love you I'm just lonely

There's a fire in your heartbeat
Not a worry in her bright blue eyes
And I'm a coward 'cause I'm still here
And I ain't leaving you tonight

But I don't love you I'm just lonely
You don't know that I'm a waste if time
If that's wrong, than no one told me
I just need someone to hold me now
'Cause I don't love you I'm just lonely

But I don't love you I'm just lonely

But I don't love you I'm just lonely
You don't know that I'm a waste if time
If that's wrong, than no one told me
I just need someone to hold me now
'Cause I don't love you I'm just lonely

But I don't love you I'm just lonely
You don't know that I'm a waste if time
If that's wrong, than no one told me
I just need someone to hold me now
'Cause I don't love you I'm just lonely

But I don't love you I'm just lonely

You don't have to look too hard
To see the future in that old woman's eyes
Her son's broken
And his son's close behind
Disappointment's on her face
She's been walking through a reoccurring
Dream
Races, hatred. This is what it means
And every time she witnesses
The violence in the streets she reaches for the
cross
Bows her head and then she pleads
Let the spell be broken
Break its hold on our minds
Let it pass from our lives
Let the spell be broken
Every heart beats the same
So how much longer will it take?
Neighbourhoods are burnin' down
And when they're gone
There's still a line in the dust
Your side. My side.
Ain't things bad enough
'Cause everyone's victim
Of the violence in the street
And every mother knows
About the sorrow that it breeds
So let the spell be broken
Break its hold on our minds
Let it pass from our lives
Let the spell be broken
Every heart beats the same
So how much longer will it take?
Till it's over. Over yeah.
Let the spell be broken
Let the spell be broken
'Cause everyone's a victim
Of the violence in the street
And every mother knows
About the sorrow that it breeds
So let the spell be broken
Break its hold on our minds
Let it pass from our lives
Let the spell be broken
Every heart beats the same
So how much longer will it take?

Outside looking in
Mirrors once again
Nothing left to say
Tomorrow's gone today

Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Sweet lies on your face
Tears are out of place
Sunshine in your hair
Comes in rainbows and leaves a gift

Lose your smile
Lose your smile
When all the world shine
It's your own self giving you
Who's to blame this time?

Lose your smile
Lose your smile

Dreams maybe do come true (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Dreams maybe do come true (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Dreams maybe do come true (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Dreams maybe do come true (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

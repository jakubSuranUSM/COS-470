Counting stars, laying in the grass 
Side by side, your head on my shoulder
We talk a lot about nothing much
With every breath we are getting closer

Parallel, in this universe 
Do we light up our hearts just to watch them burn? 
Parallel, I will cross the lines
'Cause maybe tonight the stars align

The stars align

What if the one who was meant for you
Was all along right in front of you 
Just didn’t see it, it was there all the time 
Yeah, feel it tonight, yeah, the stars align

The stars align

I take the thoughts out of your mind 
And put the pieces into my puzzle 
Everything I wanna say about you 
Is more than enough to write a novel

Parallel in this universe 
Do we light up our hearts just to watch them burn? 
Parallel, I will cross the lines
'Cause maybe tonight the stars align

The stars align

What if the one who was meant for you
Was all along right in front of you 
Just didn’t see it, it was there all the time 
Yeah, feel it tonight, yeah, the stars align

I’d throw a rope around the moon
And pull it close whatever it takes to be with you 
Maybe tonight 
Maybe tonight the stars align 

The stars align

What if the one who was meant for you
Was all along right in front of you 
Just didn’t see it, it was there all the time 
Yeah, feel it tonight, yeah, the stars align

The stars align 
The stars align

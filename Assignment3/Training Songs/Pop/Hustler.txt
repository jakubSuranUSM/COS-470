It's not easy on my bed sheets
It's not easy on my nerves
It's not easy on my conscience
It's not easy on my soul

This is not what you wanted
What you wanted for me
I know that much now
My apologies

You will call me a harlot
You will call me a whore
But see I'm a man now
I'm worth so much more

But I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all a hustler's shame

I've got the body of a lover
With a masochists brain
I've got the heart of a hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

The mind say no sir
But the body says please
The heart stays silent
Such a silent tease

And I don't know why I'm telling you this
Maybe I've got to get it off my unholy chest
There's a road much travelled
But one I haven't walked down yet

And it calls my name (it calls my name)
Yes it calls my name

It's a darker path

And it calls my name

I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all a hustler's shame

I've got the body of a lover
With a masochists brain
I've got the heart of a hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

I'm playing a dangerous game

I've got the heart of a hustler
With a hustler's pain
I've got the heart of a hustler
With all a hustler's shame

I've got the body of a lover
With a masochists brain
I've got the heart of a hustler
I'm playing a dangerous game

I've got a hustlers heart

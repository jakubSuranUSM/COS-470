In a, in a deep sleep
Awakened, by the dragons
Kept you hidden, here with me
Was not prepared, for a dead end

Take me, take me downtown
Tonight, I want to forget
I want lights to, blind me
I want peace, want to disappear

Oh oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry out, cover my ears

A foreign hand, and runaway horses
Restless doubt heart, in a vision
I did not see, see it coming
Now it's in my blood, now it's in my blood

Oh oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry out, cover my ears

(Play that song again)

Oh oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry out, cover my ears

DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Where we heard it the first time
And if I cry out, cover my ears

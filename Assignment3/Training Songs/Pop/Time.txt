The time's on the way, my love
I know I'm going away, my love
Yeah I know what I want, I see
Have it all you
I know what I want, I see
Have it all you

A live feeling inside, my love
I know I'm going away, my love

Yeah I know what I want, I see
Have it all you
Yeah I know what I want, I see
Have it all you

Yeah I know what I want, I see
Have it all you
And I know what I want, I see
Have it all you

Yeah I know what I want, I see
Have it all you

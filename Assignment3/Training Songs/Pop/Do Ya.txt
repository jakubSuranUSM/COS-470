In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you

Do you, do you want my love, woman
Do you, do you want my face, I need it!
Do you, do you want my mind, I'm saying it!
Do you, do you want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preachers bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you

In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

But I never seen nothin' like you
Do you, do you want my love, woman
Do you, do you want my face, I need it!
Do you, do you want my mind, I'm saying it!
Do you, do you want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do you, do you want my love, woman
Do you, do you want my face
Do you, do you want my mind
Do you, do you want my love

Do you, do you want my love
Do you, do you want my love

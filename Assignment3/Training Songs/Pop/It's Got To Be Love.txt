It's a quite night and you look so right
Why don't we just stay here
Holding hands together?

Well that's a good idea
Let's just stay right here
You can tell me you love me again
That's all I really want to do
I'm happy just to be with you

Is this love?
It's got to be love
'Cause I'm feeling in, feeling in love
It's got to be love

I know we've just met but I'm willing to bet
That the feeling I'm feeling now

Is gonna last forever

I feel just as sure I seem to love you more
Every minute I'm here with you
Helps to get the message through
I'm happy just to be with you

Is this love?
It's got to be love
'Cause I'm feeling in, feeling in love
It's got to be love

Is this love?
It's got to be love
'Cause I'm feeling in, feeling in love
It's got to be love

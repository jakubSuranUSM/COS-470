Hundred times I write followed around again to when 
Needed once running out the spaces of mind 

Standing in the garden, 
Guard my number from the one who says go 
Standing in the garden, 
Guard my number from the one who says go 
Leave the son alone

You can care, you can stand reasons to go on 
Can't hear anyone tell you what you like! 
You can rest in finding that your [?] are over 
You can see the reason why your story is not over! 

Leave the son alone moonlight way, way back home 
I'm nothing I'm not the one who still, still awaits alone [x2]

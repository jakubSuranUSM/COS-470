The nights are colder now 
Maybe I should close the door 
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps 
And I can follow you no more 

The fire still burns at night 
My memories are warm and clear 
But everybody knows it's hard to be alone at this time of year 

It was only a winter's tale 
Just another winter's tale 
And why should the world take notice 
Of one more love that's failed 

A love that can never be 
Though we meant to love to you and me 
On a worldwide scale we're just another winter's tale 

Why I stand alone 
A bell is ringing far away
I wonder if you hear 
I wonder if you listening 
I wonder where you are today 

Good luck, I wish you well 
For all that wishes may be worth 
I hope that love and strength are with you for the length of your time on earth

It was only a winter's tale 
Just another winter's tale 
And why should the world take notice 
Of one more love that's failed 

It's a love that can never be 
Though we meant to love to you and me 
On a worldwide scale we're just another winter's tale 

It was only a winter's tale 
Just another winter's tale 
And why should the world take notice 
Of one more love that's failed 

It's a love that can never be 
Though we meant to love to you and me 
On a worldwide scale we're just another winter's tale

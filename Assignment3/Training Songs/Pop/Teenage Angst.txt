Shine the headlight
Straight into my eyes
Like the roadkill
I'm paralyzed
You see through my disguise

At the drive in
Double feature
Pull the lever
Break the fever
And say your last goodbyes

Since I was born I started to decay
Now nothing ever ever goes my way

One fluid gesture
Like stepping back in time
Trapped in amber
Petrified
And still not satisfied

Airs and social graces
Elocution so divine
I'll stick to my needle
And my favorite waste of time
Both spineless and sublime

Since I was born I started to decay
Now nothing ever ever goes my way

Said she come from Rio
Lived on a mountain
I met her in Trafalgar Square
She was sitting in the fountain

She took off her hat
And she had lovely hair
Said she smoked marijuana
At the Coco Cabana there

South American lady
You've got that crazy beat
Brazilian beauty
With the flashing feet

We danced to the music
At the Mardi-Gras
Then jumped on the Concorde
You're so lah-di-dah

Si, si
Si, si
Si, si

Took her to a disco
In Battersea
I asked her to dance
And then she danced with me

And then I took a chance
Come home with me today
I live in France
We can get there be-E-A

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

But BEA's on strike
There's no planes flying
I can rent a motorbike
At least I'm trying

We could go on the hovercraft
Across the water
They'll think I'm your dad
And you're my daughter

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

Je suis un rock star
Je avais un residence
Je habiter la
A la south of France

Voulez vous
Partir with me?
And come and rester la
With me in France

Extrasensory perception, she has special powers. 
I saw her on the TV, I gotta deep impression.
She can guess the future, 
She can guess your past.
Is it true or false? 
Many skillful tricks.
I don't know what's real, 
Unless I see her face to face. 

E.S.P. E.S.P. E.S.P. 

She knows about ghosts, she can read your mind.
But I don't believe her, and I want to see her.
The TV program continues, 
Irrespective of my thought.
Momentary amusements, 
So for now I'll make a rule of believing.

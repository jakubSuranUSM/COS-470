Lovers in the sand, Lovers in the sand
I didn't want emotions did not dare. 
'Cause I've lost too many love affairs.
I was in the mood to have some fun, somewhere in the sun. 
I blame on the southern summer nights. 
When I lost my heart at the site. 
Now all I want to do. Is just to be with you.

Lovers in the sand. 
Walking hand in hand. 
And dreaming of the last night we shared. 
Lovers in the sand. 
Deep in love again. 
And now that I have found you. 
I know I'll never let you go. 

I know that you're the one I've always missed. 
Know it everytime I kissed your lips. 
When you're close to me, down by the sea. 
Somewhere in the sun. 
When I feel your hands touching me. 
Feel your heartbeat faster then I see. 
All I want to do, is just to be with you.

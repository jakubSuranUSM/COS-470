So many days spent together
Sharing affection and sympathy
People said we were made for each other
Giving our hearts to each endlessly
Looking back I realize
The pain I caused you girl
And now I see that I was wrong
'Cause I'm the fool who blew

A wonderful world
But my love is coming back and my love is coming
It's a wonderful world
'Cause my love is coming back and my love is coming back to stay

Remembering the sweetest things
Holding me close so tenderly
Memories of you beside me
Running in my mind like I can't believe

We could have a wonderful world
We could have a wonderful world
We could have a wonderful world
We could have a wonderful world

A wonderful world
But my love is coming back and my love is coming
It's a wonderful world
'Cause my love is coming back and my love is coming back to stay

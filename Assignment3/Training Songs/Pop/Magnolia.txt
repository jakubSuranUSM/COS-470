You feel like you're wide awake 
You can see you're dragging down the morning sun, the morning sun 
You believe you hide away 
You can see you're burning in your innocence, your innocence 

Yeah you gotta give it up 
You're laughing at the morning sun 
Yeah you gotta give it up, give it up 
You're laughing at the morning sun

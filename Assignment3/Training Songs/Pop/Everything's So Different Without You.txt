I said my heart would never break
I coulda tried to meet you halfway
But now and then we make mistakes
Oh, I shoulda tried to change your mind
Beggin' you to stay

I did all the right things to hurt you
And I stood by watchin' while you hurt inside
Oh, I shoulda seen it in your eyes
But I didn't realize

Thought that I could take losin' you, but I just make it
I know that I could win, but being alone just won't do
Being on my own
Everything's so different without you

I made you think you were wrong
I led you to believe in the lie
While I was weak you were strong
Oh, but now you'll see the change in me
Won't you let me try

I hope that you reading my letter
That I'm cryin' out to you in every line
Tell me how could I have been so blind
Now I need you all the time

Thought that I could take losin' you, but I just make it
I know that I could win, but being alone just won't do
Being on my own
Everything's so different without you

Thought that I could take the road by myself
Now I know that I need you and no one else

Thought that I could take losin' you, but I just make it
I know that I could win, but being alone just won't do
Being on my own
Everything's so different, oh oh ooh mmm

No, no, no, no, no
It just won't do
Being on my own
Everything's so different without you

I said my heart would never break

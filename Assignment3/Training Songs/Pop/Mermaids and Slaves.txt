Baby lets drink and drive
Baby lets drink and drive, 
Drink till the conversation turns pink
And drive to the over side

Baby lets look and learn
Baby lets look and learn
Look till I set the feelings take hole
And learn when the river is burned

Lets all out of first died of and suffer from pain
For you for dream a bucklear or dream must genius can jump off and say

Oh lets drive of a cliff or maybe a rift maybe a rift cursed of the car from Spain 
Oh lets put out to sea poor you and poor me, 
Poor you and poor me the racks of mermaids and slaves
 
Baby lets duck and dive
Baby lets duck and dive
I duck till I made a change in our life
And dive to the over side

Baby lets hit and run
Baby lets hit and run
Hit till you see the split in my lip and run like the wind to the sun

Oh lets rap up in motion to serious potion the gradients 
A good way to die take tragic mistake and crash in to lake

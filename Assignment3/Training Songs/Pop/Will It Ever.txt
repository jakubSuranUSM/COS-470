Can you see me baby, I'm right here
I hang around
But you don't seem to care 

Wish I knew just how to make a start
I've been waiting for too long
To say where you belong

And all I see – is your face

Everywhere I turn

(Chorus)
Will it ever be you and me
Will I ever be the one that you'll see
Will it ever come a time just right
To love you at first site 
Will you ever be my destiny
Will I ever be the one that you'll need
Will it ever come a perfect night
To love you at first sight, baby 

I can feel you baby, in my heart
Flowing through my veins 
Like a river of love

It might sound strange, I can't deny
I am lonely in this prison
And you're the reason why

All I see – is your eyes

On every girl I meet 

(Chorus)


Oh babe I'm wondering when you will
When will you come my way?

(Chorus)

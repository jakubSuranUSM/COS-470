You can't abuse a love affair
Take for granted what you think is there 
Let the silence fill the lonely air around us

The truth falls like pieces of dreams
Invisible walls that I can't see
How can it happen Why can't we just be

What is it makes us act so crazy 
Riskin' it all
Over passion and pain
Stripped to the soul
We hold on for safety
And we give it all we know how
So don't cry now

The risk is all in the take
We see it all when it's too late
And we dance so fast
To keep the flame inside

What is it makes us act so crazy
Riskin' it all
Over passion and pain
Stripped to the soul
We hold on for safety
And we give it all we know how
So don't cry now

Do you remember
When nothing else mattered
But the fire in your eyes
How do we find ourselves
Caught in this battle
Of what to do with our lives

What is it makes us act so crazy
Riskin' it all
Over passion and pain
Stripped to the soul
We hold on for safety
And we give it all we know how
So don't cry now

She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American, I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American, I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort 'em out
Kill me, kill me or

She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American, I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American, I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I'm an American, I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, Stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep

Altered boys, altered boys
We're the things that love destroyed
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We're just resurrection men
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were only there, to make you live again
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)

I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American, I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American, I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I'm an American, I'm an American, I'm an American psycho
I'm an American, I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

We could be the last two on earth
to start a new world
Just you and me girl
Try and you can almost see
how it could be
Just you and me
Lost trapped in the freezing cold
Barely alive
Have to make love to survive
I'll show you it's done
We'll take it as it comes
A rocket to the sun

I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long, forgot what I'm waiting for

Stranded on a desert isle
with no one around
for thousands of miles
Imagine anyplace
This is what it takes
But don't tell me to wait

I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long, forgot what I'm waiting for

I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long, forgot what I'm waiting for

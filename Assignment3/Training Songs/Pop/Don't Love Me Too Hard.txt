Don't push me too hard
Don't push me too far,
Don't try and make me,
If you want to take me,
Then Don't play on my heart 

Don't love me too hard,
You're moving to fast,
I know that you want to please me,
But don't think it's easy,
So let's make the right start

I know your move,
When you come up close to me,
But I Ain't in that groove,
I need warming up Oh can't you see
Tonight go slow,
We might make out,
Who knows but Honey

Don't push me too hard
Don't push me too far,
Don't try and make me,
If you want to take me,
Then Don't play on my heart 

Don't think I'm cold,
And your love ain't tempting me,
Have you no control,
What's your hurry Boy, it's time we need,
Tonight go slow,
We might make out,
Who knows but Honey

Don't push me too hard
Don't push me too far,
Don't try and make me,
If you want to take me,
Then Don't play on my heart

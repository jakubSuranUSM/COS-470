I need more,
Of what I've got,
Cos' what I've got,
Is not enough,
I want better,
Than the best,
To compete,
With the Rest,
So give me more,
Of what I want,
Run right through me,
Like a hurricane,
 
Oh brother, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
Oh sister, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
 
I will beg,
For what you've got,
I will fall down on my knees,
Fell me tremble,
I will steal to achieve more,
No restriction on my time,
Freedom writer,
Soak it up,
Take it in,
Dig a hole inside my life,
You can build with me,
 
Oh brother, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
Oh sister, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
 
And everybody's looking for a contribution,
What's the point in doing,
To find out whether it's true
To bleed you,
 
And I break sometimes but I don't know why,
It feels just like its raining in my minds eye,
In my minds eye,
 
Oh brother, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
 
Oh brother, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,
Oh sister, where to we go from here?
Nothing is denied,
When you're doing it, doing it right,

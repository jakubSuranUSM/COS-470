I was waiting for you
I was sat in the sun
I could picture your face on the tip of my tongue
I woke up laughing
I broke into a sweat
I broke into a run
You were hot in my heels so I hired a gun
I woke up laughing
I was flat on my back
I was taking a plunge
It was making a stand but my plan was undone
I woke up laughing
Well I planned an escape for the middle of June
But I drug too fast and I fire too soon
I woke up laughing
Woke up laughing

You make yourself a fortune, out in Hong Kong
You sit at home and wonder whether you were wrong
You take a small vacation just to keep sane
You find on your return your home has blown away
You meditate, you make haste
You run a risk, you come late, 
You pay a bill, you lose face
You're not fully unaware
Your star or your fate
If you fall do you break
You go to war, you make love
You sign out in a box

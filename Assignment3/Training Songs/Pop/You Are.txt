You film the dark in Technicolor
And I'll be wrapped around your finger
If you've a lesson you can teach my heart

You rescued me out of a lake
So deep and dark with my mistakes
That I get wet whenever we're apart

You are more than what I bargained for

You are my guiding star
You are, that's what you are
You are my Shangri-La
You are, that's where you are

Did I pretend to crave their souls'
To serve while kissing all their holes
Did I pretend to be their truest friend'

Another string, a bow of sin
My heart, a silent violin
At least you made me tune it in the end

You are more than what I bargained for

You are my guiding star
You are, that's what you are
You are my Shangri-La
You are, that's where you are

And if you want to run away for the day
I will stay by your side
But if you want to leave me here
Then my dear, I won't fear suicide
More than I bargained for

You are my guiding star
You are, that's what you are
You are my Shangri-La
You are, that's where you are

You are my guiding star
You are, that's what you are
You are my Shangri-La
You are, that's where you are

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

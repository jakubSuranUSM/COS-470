"Veronica, you look like hell."
"Yeah? I just got back."
"Veronica, what are you doing?"
"Heather, my love-"

Now that I'm at 20 years, hell is where I'm livin'
Don't know how to cope with all the existential thinkin'
I never used to give a shit but now it's all I'm givin'
Now it's all I'm givin'
The party's in an hour but I'm crying in a towel
'Cause this fucking picture doesn't even look like me now
Took a couple uppers, that's what they do when they feel down
"Heather, my love-"

Peer pressure
Nothing gon' save me
(Run run run run run run run)
Peer pressure
Got me going crazy
(Run run run run run run run)
Peer pressure
How you gonna take me?
(Run run run run run run run)
Peer pressure
I'm trying but it's hard to explain
Peer pressure let me swallow the pain

Got so many friends and they all make me feel alone
They always say they love me but I know they really don't
I just suck it up and do whatever they want
Tell me what I want
I lost all my money so that I could look like you
Where's my personality? I guess I lost that too
Doesn't really matter, that's what we're supposed to do
When I'm under the influence

Peer pressure

I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
So much fun
When I'm under the influence
(Peer pressure)
I'm so numb
I'm under the influence
So much fun

Now that I'm at 20 years, hell is where I'm livin'
I don't know how to cope with all the existential thinkin'
Never used to give a shit but now it's all I'm givin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But now it's all I'm-

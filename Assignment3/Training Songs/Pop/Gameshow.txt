And then I drew my line
Oh what a twisted crime
Sink, float, sink, float, sink, float, sink
In pursuit of looking good
You must do everything you should
Why think? Don't think
Why, why?

Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Find no reason
Say my name, babe
Insane, insane

I'm a windshield dream
I'm made of plasticine
I'm a Pinocchio, broken nose, let me go
I play the souvenir
Of this cheap champagne here
Spill the bubbles on designer clothes

Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Find no reason
Say my name, babe
Insane, insane

I don't know what to wear
I can't get over this
Well, let's talk afterwards
Somehow this strange love makes it easier
Just give me something, anything to live by
My blood is pumping so fast, I've forgotten why I try

Sing to me
Woo

Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Find no reason
Say my name, babe
Insane, insane

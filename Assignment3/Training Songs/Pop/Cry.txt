I find myself
In times of  trouble
And all I can do is cry

I find  that all
The cares surround me
And all I can do 
Is cry 

Nothing you can do 
Is ever gonna hurt like this
Nothing you can say
Is ever gonna hurt like this

I can't forget the one
Said I can't forget the one
No I can't forget the one 
I saw you holding 

As your beautiful mouth kissed those pouting mouth
I could tell that I was losing 
     
My source of comfort is now fading
And all I can do
Is cry

Nothing you can do 
Is ever gonna hurt like this
Nothing you can say
Is ever gonna hurt like this

And I can't forget the one
I just can't forget the one
Said I can't forget the one 
No I can't forget the one 
I saw you holding 

Why just doesn't matter
What I want to know is when

When did you stop craving 
For  the nearness of me
And my perfumed smell
When I play with your hair
And the feeling you get
When I touch you

The sun has set 
Our love
Is shaded
And all I can do 
Is cry

Nothing you can do 
Is ever gonna hurt like this
Nothing you can say
Is ever gonna hurt like this

And I can't forget the one
Said I can't forget the one
No I can't forget the one  
I saw you holding

I was like, good gracious ass is bodacious
Flirtacious, tryin to show faces
Lookin' for the right time to shoot my Steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them G's
I'm leavin', please believin'
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the four seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve, no teasin'
I need you to get up up on the dance floor 
Give that man what he askin' for 
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you 
And cant nobody stop the juice so baby tell me whats the use

I said
Its gettin' hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes

I am gettin' so hot,
I wanna take my clothes off

Its gettin' hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes

I am gettin' so hot, 
I wanna take my clothes off

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models
I see you drivin' sportscars, aint hittin' the throttle
And I be down, and do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cuz baby I cant talk it
Warm (ah), sweatin' (ah) its hot up in this joint
Vocal tanktop, all on at this point
Your with a winner so baby you cant lose
I got secrets cant leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while your on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend, 
like "girl I think my butts gettin' big,

I said
Its gettin' hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes

I am gettin' so hot,
I wanna take my clothes off

Its gettin' hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes

I am gettin' so hot, 
I wanna take my clothes off

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I gotta a friend with a pole' in the basement (What?)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra , spread the news
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptunes
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she got a thing bout cuttin' in restrooms
Mix a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
Give a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
Mix a little bit of ah, ah
With a little bit of ah, ah
sprinkle of that ah, ah
Its gettin' hot in here
So take off all your clothes
Its gettin' hot in here
So take off all your clothes
Its gettin' hot in here
So take off all your clothes

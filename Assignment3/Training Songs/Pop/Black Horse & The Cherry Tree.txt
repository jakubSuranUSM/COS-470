(Two, three, four)

Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree

I felt a little fear upon my back
He said, Don't look back, just keep on walking
When the big black horse said, Hey lady
(When the big black horse said, Look this way
Said, Look this way, will you marry me?
(Said, Hey, lady, will you marry me?)

But I said no, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back 'cause it's oh-so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

And it said no, no, no, no, no, no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me

Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're not the one for me

(Do, do, do, do)

Well I was
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
Big black horse and a cherry tree
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me

No, no, no, no
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me

No, no, no, no
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
(Big black horse and a cherry tree)
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me

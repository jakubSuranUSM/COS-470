Do you remember the time we used to spend
Doing what we used to do back then
But the only thing that's different now
You won't admit your love... that's if you love me again

[Chorus]
Everytime I close my eyes the visions re-appear
And when I wake up you're not there
Could you fall in love with me again
'Cause all I see is you everytime I close my eyes

When you look at me, I wish that you were mine once again
'Cause now I love you more than I did then
And I'm hoping that we can mend it all back
'Cause when we're together the spark is there and the flame comes back

[Chorus]

Should I say this to you and just let it go
Tell you what I feel and just let it show
No matter how hard that I think this through
My feelings are the same I'm in love with you

[Chorus]

You say, I love you boy.
But I know you lie.
I trust you all the same.
I don't know why.

'Cause when my back is turned,
My bruises shine.
Our broken fairytale,
So hard to hide

I still believe
It's you and me 'til the end of time.
When we collide we come together,
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard.

Sitting in a wishing hole,
Hoping it stays dry.
Feet cast in solid stone,
I got Gilligan's eyes

I still believe
It's you and me 'til the end of time.

When we collide we come together,
If we don't we'll always be apart.
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it.
When you hit me, hit me hard.

'Cause you sat alone
Just let us go against one
Our future's is for many of horror
Our future's is for many of horror

I still believe,
It's you and me 'til the end of time

When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard.

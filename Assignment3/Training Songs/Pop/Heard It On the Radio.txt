What up?!
Summer in the sand
He's a drummer in the band
Drop the beach
He's a dj at the boardwalk
I smile and I tan
And her sandals in her hand
Rockin' her shades
You could almost see the eyes lock
What could be better
Than a party in the weather
With the both of us together
In the backdrop?
Everything was right
And the day turned into night
With the music and the lights
That's when we stop

Oh, I heard it on the radio
Sing it out loud
Oh, coming down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh,
Everybody now
I heard it on the radio
Oh, ohoo
Uh, uh, oh

Everybody now
Coming down to see your show
Play it back, play it back
One time yeah
I heard it on the radio
Board and a wet suit
On the day we met
You'd think if you were
Catching a wave
Shorts and a jet ski
All the other summer things
Kickin' it in the sun
All day
We only got time for each other
And we only got time for the summer
Everybody knows
If you gotta let it go
Take the chance
Make it go your way
Oh, I heard it on the radio
Sing it out loud
Oh, coming down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh,
Everybody now

I heard it on the radio
Oh, ohoo
Uh, uh, oh
Everybody now
Coming down to see your show
Play it back, play it back
One time yeah
I heard it on the radio

Okay,
Listen to the story 'bout the party
'bout the glory, 'bout the summer that would raise the bar
Anyone will tell you
It was chillin', it was stellar
The best time we've had so far
Everyone together
Always goin' "never better"
And the good times go on, and on, and on
Never will forget it
Doesn't matter where we're headed
I'll remember when I hear our song
What!

Oh, heard it on the radio
Oh, coming down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh,
Everybody now

Heard it on the radio
Oh, ohoo
Uh, uh, oh
Everybody now
Coming down to see your show
Oh oh, oh

I heard it on the radio
Oh oh, oh
I heard it on the radio
Oh, I heard it on the radio
Everybody now
Oh, coming down to see your show

Uh, uh, oh,
Uh, uh, oh
Play it back, play it back
One time yeah
Uh, uh, oh

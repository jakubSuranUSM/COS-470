(Take it from the top)

Did you ever walk on a stormy night
Oblivious to the rain?
Did you ever decide that the time was right
When you'd never go home again?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?

(I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it,
 I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it,
 I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it,
 I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it)

     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?
     Forever in love, were you ever in love?

(Ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-ye-yeah
 Ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-ye-yeah
 Ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-ye-yeah
 Ye-yeah-ye-yeah-ye-yeah)

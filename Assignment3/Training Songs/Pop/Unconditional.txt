Unconditional
Venus by my side
Uncontainable
Nowhere you can hide
It’s something to know
No matter where you are
The venus light is shining in your star
And it’s back with my heart again
Saying that you do
Indivisible
Loving inside you
It’s nothing to know
Knowing that you are
The venus light is shining in your star

Oh come on
It was right here all along
What you’re looking for is never gone
How did we do this, we’re here
Hold me close and hold me near
Near

Unconditional
Yeah
Unconditional
Yeah

Uncontrollable
How could I resist
Underneath it all
The way that you undress
Irreplaceable
The mark upon your lip
The venus light is shining in your kiss

Oh come one
It was right here all along
What you’re missing was never gone
How did we do this, we’re here
Hold me close and hold me near
Yeah

Unconditional
Yeah
Unconditional
Yeah
Unconditional
Yeah
Unconditional
Yeah

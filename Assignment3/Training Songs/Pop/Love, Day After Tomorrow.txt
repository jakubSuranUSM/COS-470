Itsuka wa yume ga kanau what are you hoping for 
Namida mo tsuyogari mo nagesuteru koto ga dekiru yo ne 
Fukinukeru kaze no tsuyosa ni kokoro ga yure 
Setsunai omoi to ima tatakatteru 
Don't ask me why dou shiyou mo naku 
You are the first thing on my mind 

Love, day after tomorrow, I wish you knew 
Aimai ni kazatta kotoba wa iranai 
Love, day after tomorrow, I need you back 
Tada kimi to onaji hayasa de arukitai kara 

Anna ni okotta kao wa 
You never looked at me this way 
Hitomi no oku ni aru shinken na ai to adobaisu 
Gomen ne, no hitokoto 
Me-are you de okutta moji ja, henji wa konai ne
Namida ga afureteku Don't ask me why 
Dou shiyou mo naku 
I can't see the world, walking through 

Love, day after tomorrow, I wish you knew 
Mayowazu ni susumitai donna kurayami mo 
Love, day after tomorrow, I need you back 
Ima kimi to onaji hikari o mezashiteiru kara

Furidashita ame yasashiku saseru yo 
Kitto yakusoku shita hi ni wa 
Motto kimi ni chikazuki soshite mayowazu ni 
Ieru Oh~ Stay with me 

Love, day after tomorrow, I wish you knew 
I'm still in Love, But you're gone, And now my heart is breaking 
Love, day after tomorrow, I need you back 
My heart is waiting for your love, 
L.O.V.E one more day

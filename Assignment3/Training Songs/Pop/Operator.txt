Baby, if you rule my world
Oh, don't cry, babe in the rain
Who is talking to my girl
Never trust a good old friend
'cause every night they want to steal
And every moment, that is real
Oh, my heart, never heal of your love

And the operator said : "40 cents more, or it's over"
(and that's no lie)
I'm the biggest fool of all
Will you catch me baby, when I fall
And the operator said: "40 cents more, or it's over"
(and that's no lie)
Words are not enough for me
Baby where's your destiny

Your love shot diamonds from your eyes
Oh, this love is so bizarre
And I'm lonely, secret lies
Oh, this time you've gone too far
'cause every night you play a game
And every moment, call your name
Oh, I cry out insane for your love

It's my party, you can come
It's my party, have some fun
It's my dream, have a laugh
It's my life, have a half, well

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no (I like it when you tell me slow)

It's my transition, it's my play
It's my phone call to beta ray
It's my hopscotch, light the torch
It's my downtime, feel the scorch, well

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no  (don't tell me no)

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no (I don't like it when you tell me no)

It's my ambition, it's my joke
It's my teardrop, emotional smoke
It's my mercy, it's my plan
I want to go to futureland, well

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no (don't tell me no)

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no (I like it when you tell me slow)

Don't tell me no (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no, no, no, no (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no (don't tell me, I don't want to know)

Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, no, no, ay (don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no (Don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no, no (don't tell me no, no, don't tell me no)
Don't tell me no
Don't tell me no (don't tell me, you have to go, don't tell me no)

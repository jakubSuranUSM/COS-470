Breaking down
Never seems to be that hard
Falling short
Is always in the cards
I'm on the road
Sun rising at my back
Lost it all
Somewhere between the cracks

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town
Gets to feel just like a job
My desire
Never winds up on top
I can't say now
I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach
Somewhere beyond this room

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

I've always tried to make things clear
Then I watched as progress stalled
I only hope I'm standing here
When Heaven finally comes to call

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Thankful; I'm thankful;
So thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

All that I'm allowed

I'm thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed
So thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed

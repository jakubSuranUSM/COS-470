He looks just like you
He even says the same things
He's always hanging upside down
He looks just like you
He even wears the same clothes
In Winter, Summer comes around

Back in paradise
It's like another country
If they could only see you smile
Nobody watches us
Deep inside a death machine maze
They're trying to make it through the night

He looks just like you
He even says the same things
He's always hanging upside down
In 1995 he even wears the same clothes
He says he's going underground

He looks just like you
He even loves like we used to
He looks just like you
He even loves like we used to
He looks just like you
He even loves like we used to
He looks just like you
He even loves like we used to

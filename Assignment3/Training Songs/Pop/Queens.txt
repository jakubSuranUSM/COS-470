You and I were the first to decide
Now it's gone and it's over, it's done
Break the walls, put the spade in the ground
'Cause the new kind of world has begun

Brick by brick we put the past behind us
This is the way we want it, this is the way we build it
Bit by bit we let the love define us
This is the way we want it

We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up
We make the rules so that we can break them
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
It's all for us
This is the way we want it
We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it, light it up

You and I on the ball to a line
Carry on, we are strong, we are one
Take the crown, we stand our ground
Only light, this is where we belong

Brick by brick we put the past behind us
This is the way we want it, this is the way we build it
Bit by bit we let the love define us
This is the way we want it

We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up
We make the rules so that we can break them
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
It's all for us
This is the way we want it
We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it, light it up

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Bit by bit, we let the love divide us
This is the way we want it

We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up
We make the rules so that we can break them
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it up

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
It's all for us
This is the way we want it
We are the queens of the brand new nation
Now it's all for us
Light it, light it, light it up

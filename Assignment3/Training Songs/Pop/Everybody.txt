Cold morning 
I was looking out it was a cold day 

songbird was drinking from a table 
but songbird you just flew away 

everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometimes 
and find out what it's like to be left behind 
sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why 

so let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 
and let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 

it's not a sign of weakness 
when your searching for the places where the memories flow 
there may come a time 
when you rearrange and may leave those memories 
you've gotta let them go 

everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometimes 
and find out what it's like to be left behind 
sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why 

let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 
let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 

everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometimes 
and find out what it's like to be left behind 
sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why 

let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 
let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind 

stay strong 
move on 
keep on

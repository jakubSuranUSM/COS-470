She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit and bambi eyes
Everybody who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine

I should have known I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity but
They say you never miss the water til it's gone

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life without you
How am I supposed to walk on by
When you're looking like that

She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
Want to squeeze her real tight get out of this place
If only I could take control

But she's out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just to see

That I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

I don't want to forget you
I don't even want to try
How am I supposed to walk on by
When you're looking like that

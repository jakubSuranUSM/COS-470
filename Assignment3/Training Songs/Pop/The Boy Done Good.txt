Strange as it may seem, I once had my football dreams
But I was always the last one, the last to get chosen
When my classmates picked their teams
I guess that was the way it stayed in every game I played
Life just tripped me and clattered and kicked me
Till you picked me from the parade
Now I feel like I've won the cup every time that we
Make love
Forty-five minutes each way, at halftime I hear a brass
Band play
The boy done good, the girl done better
The seasons turn and we're still together
The sky is still blue and tomorrow is another day
You weren't that kind of a girl who likes her studs to
Be covered in mud
Taking you to the pictures was a regular fixture
For one of life's eternal subs
I tried hard acting tough, but I just can't stand the
Taste of that stuff
Like some macho park player I got in the way of
In some grudge match against his club
But I'm happier how I am today now I've put my
Boots away
I guess I'll never get picked to play my song on match
Of the day

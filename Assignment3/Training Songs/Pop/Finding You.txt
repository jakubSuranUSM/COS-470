What would you do if you turned around
And saw me beside you
Not in a dream but in a song?
Would you float like a phantom
Or would you sing along?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing
But I know it's finding you

What would you do
If you saw me driving by in a car
The quickest you've ever seen me spin?
Would you smile and wave
Or would you bow and get in?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing
But I know it's finding you

But then the lightning finds us
Burns away our kindness
We can't find a place to hide
Come the rainy season
Surrender to our treasons
Can we even find our tears?

Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it's flowing 
But I know it's finding you

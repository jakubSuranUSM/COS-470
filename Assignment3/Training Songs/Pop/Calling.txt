Five miles deep under wa-ater
You hear their voices si-ing
Surely that must be to every man
A most fantastic thing

Five miles dee-eep under wa-ater
You can hear them singing, yeah-eah
Calling, calling

Put away the harpoon gun
You don't need it anymore-ore
All we have for a memory
Is bones washed on the shore

And five miles dee-eep under wa-ater
You can hear them singing
Calling, calling, hear 'em calling, hear 'em ca-alling
Five miles deep under wa-ater
You can hear 'em sing
Calling, it's a most fantastic thing

Tell me how did we get this far
Are we allowed to lose
Does it come to late we realize
We've lost the chance to choose

Five miles dee-eep under wa-ater
You can hear them singing
Calling, calling, calling, hear them, ca-alling
Five miles deep under wa-ater
You can hear them sing
Five miles deep under wa-ater
Calling, it's a most fantastic thing
Hear 'em calli-ing, ca-alling

Do you hear the-em... si-ing
Five miles deep under wa-ater
Five miles deep under wa-ater
Calling, it's a most fantastic thing
Five miles deep under wa-ater
Five miles deep under wa-ater
Calling

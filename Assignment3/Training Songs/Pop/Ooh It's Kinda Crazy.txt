If you want my love help me heal the pain in my eyes 
Ooh it's kinda crazy 
I've been thinking maybe gotta get you out of my mind 
First you say you want me now your memories haunt me 
Why don't you just give me a sign 
I thought I had someone that 
I could fall in love with 
Someone who would treat me right 
So I tried to be so kind 
I thought for sure I'd make you mine but something's 
Weighing up on my mind 
Why don't you take my hand, and help me understand 
'Cause I can't figure out 
What you're thinking and why don't you let me know 
Don't want to be alone going out of my mind 
Waiting for the day you'll say you'll be mine 
If you want my love 
(Why don't you show me then) 
Help me heal the pain in my eyes 
(I know you want me now) 
If you want my love, why don't you tell me 
'Cause I've had enough of plastic people wasting my time 

Chorus 

Thought I had someone that I could really care for 
Someone who won't waste my time 
(lead me on) 
But now I find that you lie 
You're always out with other guys 
Is that your way of playing with my mind 
Why don't you take my hand, help me understand 
'Cause I can't figure out 
What you're thinking about 
Why don't you let me know 
Don't want to be alone going out of my mind 
Waiting for the day you'll say you'll be mine 
If you want my love 
(why don't you show me then) 
Help me heal the pain in my eyes 
(I know you want me now) 
If you want my love why don't you tell me 
'Cause I've had enough of plastic people wasting my time 

Chorus 

Showed you all that I am 
And treated you well 
Gave you half of my heart but you tore it to hell 
Give me someone who won't lie and won't cheat on me 
Baby up in my room, 
That's exactly what you asked of me 
Baby if you want my love, if you want my love 
Oh, yeah then why don't you just 
Take my hand and help me understand 
Going out of my mind 
Waiting for the day you'll say you'll be mine 
Baby if you want my love, if you want my love 
I've had enough, I've had enough 
Ohh, it's kinda crazy (I've had enough) 
Gotta get you out of my mind 
(I've had enough) 
First you say you want me (I've had enough) 
Why don't you just give me a sign

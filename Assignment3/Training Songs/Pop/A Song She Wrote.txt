Sometimes she wishes she was stronger, but she’s not 
She’ll leave her room and go out find her man 
It takes just an hour to fall again, and spend the night 
Walking high under the pale moon light 

Oh you’ve tried so hard to give it up, now carry on 
You’re much stronger than these ghosts and walls, but you don’t know 
The morning will come and you’ll keep faking through the day 
And I wish I could help you when you’re going insane 

Time will pass and soon you’ll know where you are 
Oh but she’s trapped in a non-sense, an “in-between” 
And all I do is hold her when she’s down 
She talks of a friend who’s far away, wearing her clothes 
And singing on a stage (A song she wrote)

Oh you’ve tried so hard to give it up, now carry on 
You’re much stronger than these ghosts and walls, but you don’t know 
The morning will come and you’ll keep faking through the day
Clip a song she wrote

And I wish I could help you when you’re going insane 

You’d better look out for a place where you can be just fine 
(Go where you want to) 
Oh you’ve tried so hard to give it up, now carry on 
You’re much stronger than these ghosts and walls, but you don’t know 
Time will pass and soon you’ll know where you are

If I was beautiful like you, oh the things I would do
Those not so blessed would be crying out murder and I'd just laugh and get away
With it too. like you do.

If I was beautiful like you, I would never be at fault
I'd walk in the rain between the raindrops, bringing traffic to a hault.

But that will never be, that will never ever be. 'cause I'm not beautiful like you.
I'm beautiful like me.

If I was beautiful like you, I'd be quick to assume. they'd do anything to
Please me why not. I see their reaction when you walk into the room.

CHORUS

If I was beautiful like you, I'd have so many friends all fighting for my time
To be next in line. so if I hurt one, I wouldn't have to make amends.

CHORUS

Just a little time 
Won't you give us 
Just a little time 
Take tomorrow and borrow 
Just a little time 

Just a little more, baby 
Not too much 
But just a little more 
And the rest is sure to follow 
Just a little more 

We could have it all 
We could touch the stars 
We could make them shine 
With just a little time 

Just a little love, baby 
Everyday just a little love darling 
For romace without heartache 
Just a little love 

We could have it all 
We could touch the stars 
Maybe make them shine 
With just a little time 

Only time can show 
Only time can tell 
If we take the time 
To know each each very well 

We have could have it all 
We could touch the stars 
Make them yours and mine 
With just a little time 

Just a little time 
Just a little time

I lay down to rest my head
My soul to keep the night I dread
It's no dream
Slumber comes as darkness falls
And shadows dance across my walls
It's no dream

But I never sleep alone
My dreams become so real to me
I unplug the phone
While the night is young

Catch me I'm falling down again
I know it's a dream but just the same

There's a face before my eyes
Are closed but I can't recognise
The danger there
Slumber comes as darkness falls
And shadows dance across my walls
It's no dream

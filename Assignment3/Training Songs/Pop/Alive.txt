Al, he sells records 
Down on old St. Charley's Street
He's cleaning up Fat Tuesday's mess 
He keeps the sidewalks neat
And he just lost his father 
And he just lost his wife
And if it wasn't for the music 
He couldn't get on with his life
And he knows what I know
It's not all that hard to survive
You take the good and the bad 
And the time in between
It lets us know we're alive
Well now Be Be's singing gospel
And down on Bourbon she sings the blues
She plays on all my heart strings 
Curls my toes up in my shoes
And she knows what I'm after
Chase my dreams with all my might
She says you shouldn't be so anxious 
And deep down I know she's right
And she knows what I know
It's not all that hard to survive
You take the good and the bad 
And the time in between
It lets us know we're alive
Well get on board the rocket
Step right into the front car
You know life's a roller coaster 
It ain't got no safety bar
Raise your voices up with laughter
Bring it in with one big sigh
Consecrated in the wonder...we're alive
Norman he plays music 
But only in my dreams
Shows me all the beauty 
That soulful music brings
But sometimes he's a specter 
And I wake up clenched with fear
But lesson good or bad 
He always keeps me clear
And he knows what I know
It's not all that hard to survive
You take the good and the bad 
And the time in between
It lets us know we're alive

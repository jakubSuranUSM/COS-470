[Claire]
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

[Marjorie]
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into the light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance.

[Coralie]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[L5]
She's a maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Alexandra]
On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
Touch it but can't hold it

[Lydy]
You word all your life for that moment in time
It can come or pass you by
It's push, shove world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

[Coralie]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[L5]
She's a maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Coralie]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[L5]
She's a maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

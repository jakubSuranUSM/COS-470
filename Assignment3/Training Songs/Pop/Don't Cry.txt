You say that you're misunderstood
But you like it that way
Then you say you're lonely
Well that's the price you pay

And I don't think I love you
That's the cruellest game we play
But I love you that way

You're a perfect lover
Why don't you stay?
You're a perfect lover
Ain't it always that way?

You feel a little twisted
You feel a little pain
You feel a little hateful
Don't worry, you'll feel that way again

Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me
Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me

You say that you're not beautiful
But you are in my eyes
You say my love's too heavy
Well that comes as no surprise

You're a perfect lover
Why don't you stay?
You're a perfect lover
Ain't it always that way?

You feel a little twisted
And you feel a little pain
You feel a little hateful
Don't worry, you'll fall in love again

Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me
Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me

It's already over
There's nothing to say
It's already over
But you need love to show you your way

Don't cry for me
Don't you cry
Don't cry, don't cry for me

You're the perfect lover
Why don't you stay?
You're the perfect lover
Ain't it always that way?

You feel a little pain
Don't worry, you'll fall in love again

Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me
Cry, don't cry, don't cry for me

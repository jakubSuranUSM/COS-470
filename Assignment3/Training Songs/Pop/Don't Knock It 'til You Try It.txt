A kid is killed on any corner 
From Brooklyn Heights to California 
There's different ways of gettin' higher 
Don't knock it 'til you try it 
The summer's hot, the winter's longer 
An angry wind is getting stronger 
You play it cool you stop the fire 
Don't knock it 'til you try it 

What we all need now, let me show you how 
Don't knock it 'til you try it... 

They build a wall around a city 
It's not for looks, it isn't pretty 
A kid will take his chance and climb it 
Don't knock it 'til you try it 

Well no one really has to suffer 
Tear down the walls around each other 
A kid is lucky to survive it 
Don't knock it 'til you try it 

What we all need now... 
For every kid on every corner 
I see a wall that stands no longer 
The words are written down beside it 
Don't knock it 'til you try it 

Don't knock it 'til you try it...

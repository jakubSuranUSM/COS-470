Window frosted in the rain
Dusty pages, broken lines
Is all we have

Candle shadow in the flame
Of the moments that we try
To start again

Of many things that I remember
Too many now that you forget

How can you tell me that it gone
How can you turn and walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say it's over
Don't turn away
A love so fine
Now it's over
Don't turn/give away
A love so fine

The empty room you leave behind
Nothing is, nothing belongs
Nothing belongs

The faded roses by the door
The picture hanging on my wall
No more than this

Of the promises we made
Of the good time that we had

'Cause they don't come to nothing now
Just look again before you go

[Chorus]

Dusty pages, broken lines

So many things that I remember
Too many now that you forget

How can you tell me that it gone
How can you turn and walk away

[Chorus]

Don't say it's over

A love so fine

Now it's over
Don't give away
A love so fine

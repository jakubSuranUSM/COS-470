I'm waiting 
Wind has blown away my breath 
I'm gone, I'm gone 
I'm staying 
Though you're acting like I've left 
I'm gone, I'm gone 

In the crowd I'm drowning 
No one's around me, eh 
In your arms my whole world 
Is falling away 

My armor 
Left in bottles on the floor 
Can't hide anymore 
My shadow 
Some are darker than before 
Can't see anymore 

In the crowd I'm drowning 
No one surrounds me, eh 
Seeing blind 
My whole world 
Is falling away, hey 

And I'm sorry that I've stopped your ways 
But you can have me when you're on your way in 
And I'm sorry that you feel this way 
Sorry that you stopped to say 
You couldn't stop to stay 
You couldn't stop to stay 
You couldn't stop to stay 

I'm waiting 
Fear is pulsing in my breath 
I'm gone, I'm gone 

In the crowd I'm drowning 
No one's around me, eh 
And it's lost, surrounding 
I'm falling away, hey 

And I'm sorry that I've stopped your ways 
But you can have me when you're on your way in 
And I'm sorry that you feel this way 
Sorry that you stopped to say 
You couldn't stop to stay 
Oh, stop to stay 
You couldn't stop to stay 

You couldn't stop, no no 
You couldn't stop, no no 
You couldn't stop 

And I'm sorry that I've stopped your ways 
But you can have me when you're on your way in 
And I'm sorry that you feel this way 
Sorry that you stopped to say 
You couldn't stop to stay 
You couldn't stop to stay 
You couldn't stop to stay 

I'm waiting 
I'm waiting 
I'm waiting 
I'm waiting 

I'm waiting

Don't go away mad
'Cause that'd really make me sad
I know you're burnin'
Burnin' like a cigarette
I know we're learnin'
But maybe we ain't learned nothin' yet
Something's burning
Don't go away mad
It can't be so bad
You know what to do
I'm leavin' it up to you
Don't go away mad
That'd really make me sad
Smoke is clearing
If you just ride with me a while
There's no fearing
We can work it out in family style
If you're willing
Don't go away mad
It can't be so bad
Don't hold your breath
You're scaring me half to death
Don't go away mad
You're the best I ever had
What can I do more of
To make a little bit of peace and love
Don't go away mad
'Cause that'd really make me sad

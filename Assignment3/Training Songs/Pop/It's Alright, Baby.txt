From patience and from pain 
The one who never ends will gain. 
The lovely notes from score to score 
Become the sound of the general score? 

I'm tired of being wasted 
I'm so sick of being tired. 
Yeah, but sure that love existed 
Long before the first word was pronounced. 

Woo hoo it's alright, baby 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, sugar 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, honey 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, it's okay 
It-is-so-crazy 

To put it all in place 
Requires a special grace 
A single gesture of sweet emotion 
A single notion of bitter potion 

A strawberry-flavored composition 
Is all that it takes 
When the lyrics stand on end 
And the head is full of conclusions of a simple mind 

Woo hoo it's alright, baby 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, sugar 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, honey 
It's a crazy world, it's a bit absurd 
Woo hoo it's alright, it's okay 
It-is-so-crazy

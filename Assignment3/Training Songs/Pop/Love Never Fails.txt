There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As Long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails
Love never fails

I have all that I need
So much so I feel weak
Cause the love we have is never ending
All those moments we make
Are too precious to waste
In a world that is forever changing
I wouldn't change you for anything
I'll be forever loving you

There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As Long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails
Love never fails

Asllep or awake
No, there's never a day
That goes by when I don't think about you
Only you touched my life
For the very first time
I'd be lost baby without you
I wouldn't change you for anything
I'll be forever loving you

There will be those times we fight back tears
And there will be those times when we get scared
As Long as we're together we'll get there
Cause love never fails
Love never fails

There's no greater gift
Than the love that you breathe
Forever hold me
Many rivers to cross
But our love will guide us
It's all we need
It's all we need

There will be those times
When we test our faith
On some other roads
We have to take
We'll always find our way
Cause love never fails

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I don't know why, why you decided
You said I was fine, said I was your freedom
Run from the past into the near
Nothing to fear,
Run from the dark into the clear
Nothing to fear!

That's where the love lies,
Under the shadows
That's where the birds fly,
Under the shadows
We're afraid of nothing, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
No one can we hear us
That's where the love lies, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Under the shadows

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I can see why, why it weren't easy
I know it's hard, so hard to please me
Why does it feel like it's a dream?
Caught in between
Somewhere I know, somewhere I've been
Caught in between!

That's where the love lies,
Under the shadows
That's where the birds fly, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Under the shadows
We're afraid of nothing, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
No one can we hear us
That's where the love lies, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Under the shadows

Oh, you have to live a life
Feel like I've forgotten why
I feel alive!
Caught between the consequence,
Caught it up and given in
I feel alive!

Oh, you have to live a life
Feel like I've forgotten why
I feel alive!
Caught between the consequence,
Caught it up and given in
I feel alive!

That's where the love lies,
Under the shadows
That's where the birds fly,
Under the shadows
'Cause I'm afraid of nothing, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
No one can we hear us
That's where the love lies, (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Under the shadows

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

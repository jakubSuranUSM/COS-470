Silent Night 
SPOKEN Intro: "To you the man, woman, the child we have never met but think of as a friend, this is Nelson Eddy wishing you a Christmas complete with the excitement and pleasure of giving and receiving presents and warm and inspiring with its spiritual beauty. May the coming year bring this blessed land of ours a little closer to that day of eternal Christmas, that day of peace on earth." 

Silent night! Holy night! 
All is calm all is bright 
round yon virgin mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace! 
sleep in heavenly peace! 

Silent night! holy night! 
Shepherds quake at the sight 
glories stream from heaven afar 
heavenly hosts sing Alleluia 
Christ the Saviour is born! 
Christ the Saviour is born!

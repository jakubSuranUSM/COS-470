The worst thing that could happen...had happened to me
My best friend and my baby left town for California
...without saying anything

Everybody gets a little rain sometimes...

I've seen it before, I'll see it again
Now I just let it pour down
'cause there's nothing you can do about it
...you just get wet

(Chorus)
Take your overcoat Get your rubber soul
Put your rain hat on...it's getting cold
When clouds appear, be careful dear
The weather changes suddenly...

The best thing that could happen...has happened to me
My baby's in the city Wants me to forgive her
But I can't bring myself to tell her...

Everybody gets a little rain sometimes...

It falls and it falls...always gonna, always gonna fall

Take your over coat Take your rubber soul
Put your rain hat on...it's getting cold
When clouds appear, be careful dear...

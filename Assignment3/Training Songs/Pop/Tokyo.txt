Warm and cold, you grab me down
You lift me with your magic, new and old
I know your way but I don't understand it
Steel and stone, a thousand years of history and future

Kodachrome
Are lazy beam's creating this illusion
I can leave any day
But you're always gonna stay on my mind

Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you
Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you

Sleepless nights, my eyes are open
But I must be dreaming, you and I
We play it cool but underneath we're steaming
You can run you can hide
But this roller-coaster ride never stops

Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you
Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you
She's gonna do it to you, she's gonna do it to you

Ohh, I can leave any day
But you're always gonna stay on my mind
And you can run you can hide
But this roller-coaster ride never stops

Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you
Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you

Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you
Tokyo, you've got the rhythm in you
High and low, she's gonna do it to you

(lew/graham)

I gave you all my time and I gave all my love to you
I gave you every dime and tell me what did you do
You broke this heart of mine by loving somebody new
You said that love was forever you'd leave me never
But where are you now

Chorus:
I gave you everything all that one could ever give
I gave you everything you were my reason to live
Everythings out of place
There's an empty space
In my heart
And I gave you everything

You took the best of me you took everything I had
You took so selfishly and gave nothing in return
I would have set you free if that's how it had to be
Why would you lie (why, why)
Why would you need to make me cry

Ooh, yeah, I cried myself to sleep that night
It wasn't right for you to leave me here high and dry
It wasn't right to close the door without so much as a goodbye
Could have blood from a stone
Why did you leave me alone?

Chorus

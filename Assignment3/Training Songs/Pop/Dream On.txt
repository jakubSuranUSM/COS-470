There's this girl I used to know, the way I feel heaven knows.
I look up high and dream at night, memories I can't let go. 

Don't you know how it feels?
Did you know your dreams are real?
Don't you know you have the time?
This dream feels good inside. 

Dream on, oh, dream on, don't you know your gonna find that star, dream on.
Dream on, oh, dream on. Wish upon a star and dream on. 

Hand in hand we'll rock this land, gone through blues with her heart.
Sometimes we need to make our dreams, things may glow bright as the stars.

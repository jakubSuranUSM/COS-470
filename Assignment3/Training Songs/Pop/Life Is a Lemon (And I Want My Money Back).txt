I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
It's all or nothin'
And nothin's all I ever get,
Every time I turn it I burn it up and burn it out

There's always something,
There's always something going wrong.
That's the only guarantee, that's what this is all about.

It's a never ending attack.
Everything's a lie and that's a fact
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!

And all the morons,
and all the stooges with their coins,
Their the ones who make the rules, it's not a game it's just a rout

There's desperation, (there's desperation)
There's desperation in the air.
It leaves a stain on all your clothes and no detergent gets it out.

And we're always slippin' through the cracks.
Then the movie's over, fade to black.
Then the movie's over, fade to black
Life is a lemon and I want my money back

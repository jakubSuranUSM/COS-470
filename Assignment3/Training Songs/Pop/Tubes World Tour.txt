The girls got embarrassed 
When we did our act in Paris 
Same way that they did in L.A. 
And we really had a battle 
When we did it in Seattle 
Vancouver on the very next day 
San Diego kept us busy 
We got so dizzy 
With the interviews and radio shows 
The fans were no turkeys 
When the Tubes played Albuquerque 
They stood up and shout and let us know 

Bonjour, bonjour 
The Tubes World Tour 
A mighty important crusade 
Tres chouette mi amore 
The Tubes World Tour 
We'll be leavin' as soon as we're paid 

The threw us in the slammer 
When we did it in Miamer 
Mondo Bondage blew their mind 
The kids were screamin' for more in Baltimore 
Thought they would never unwind 
They rushed Dr. Fee 
In Washington D.C. 
A.M.A. didn't go for the chainsaw 
Played Town Without Pity 
Just for New York City 
And Quay knocked 'em dead with his big guitar 

Buongiorno ate 
The Tubes World Touree 
A mighty important crusade 
Tres chouette mi amore 
The Tubes World Tour 
We'll be leavin' as soon as we're paid 

Oh ho ho ho, thank heaven for little girls 
A mighty important crusade 
Tres chouette mi amore 
The Tubes World Tour 
We'll be leavin' as soon as we're paid

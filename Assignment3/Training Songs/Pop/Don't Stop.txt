I see you in the light
Movin' in and out of sight
Who are you?
Where have I seen you before?

Watching you move around
Turns my emotions upside down
Who are you?
I know that I've seen you before

Now that I've found you
I wanna see you some more
Don't stop, the feeling is growing
Don't stop, it's starting to show
Don't stop what you're doin' to me
Do it forever, do it forever

Don't stop, I love what you say
Don't stop, it's magic to me
Don't stop touching my soul
Do it forever, do it forever

You see me? I can tell
By your eyes that this thing is in motion
Taking us both by surprise
Could it be? it's so easy

Taking you into my soul like a river
Finding it's way to the sea
Like an old friend
You're finding your way back to me

Don't stop, the feeling is growing
Don't stop, it's starting to show
Don't stop what you're doin' to me
Do it forever, do it forever

Like an old friend
You're finding your way back to me

Don't stop, the feeling is growing
Don't stop, it's starting to show
Don't stop what you're doin' to me
Do it forever, do it forever

Don't stop, I love what you say
Don't stop, it's magic to me
Don't stop touching my soul
Do it forever, do it forever

Don't stop
Do it forever, do it forever
Don't stop
No no no, don't stop
Don't stop
Do it forever, do it forever
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Do it forever, do it forever

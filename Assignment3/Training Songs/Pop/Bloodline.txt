Take my hand
If it gets you through then it’s all right
Take my hand

But take your time
‘Till it relates to you then it’s all right
You break my mind

But if your view is of golden valleys
But the sense of regret paralyzes
Then you’ll never know how it feels

And if you never challenge what you see
Then the beacons of light will stop flashing
And you’ll never know how it feels

To have hope
To have hope
To have hope
To have hope

To have hope
To have hope
To have hope

If you could replay this
Where would you stop to untie your hands?

And if you could unsay it
How could I ever understand?

Like you never will
Ohh uh ohh ohh
Like you never will

And it would break your heart
Well, if you knew
That this is all about you

Oh, but you carry on regardless
But we’ve already started
A new bloodline

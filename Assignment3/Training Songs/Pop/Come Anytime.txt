What is it you want from me? 
There isn´t much I will not do. 
If it´s only company 
You know, I might need that too. 
Won´t you 
Come anytime - I´m a man of leisure, 
Come anytime, I await your pleasure. 

There´s nothing new beneath the sun 
We´ve butchered every sacred cow 
Don´t tell me about all the things you might have done 
Just tell me what are you doing now - right now. 

Come anytime, I won´t give you pressure 
Come anytime - I can wait forever 
And if you can´t make up your mind 
We could make it up together. 

Things like this happen every day 
Whatever happens, it´s O.K. 
Why be afraid when we´ve got it made -
I´ll never ask you to explain. 

What is it you want from me? 
You won´t shock me easily. 
Maybe it´s your heart´s desire, 
Maybe it´s your wildest dream, 
Maybe I´m a gun-for-hire but, 
Baby, don´t we make quite a team, Don´t we?
Don´t we? 
Come anytime (you´re so inclined) I won´t give you trouble 
Come anytime (you´re going blind) or you´re seeing double 
And I have never been the kind who´d want to 
Burst your bubble. 
Come anytime.

You stop, and I go
Too fast, much too slow
Your uptown is downtown to me
I lose it, you find it
You're ahead, and I'm behind it
Your day time is night time to me
Feels like a million miles between us
Just like Mars and Venus
Must be the pull of gravity
I'm made for you, you're made for me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I drive you crazy
Sometimes you want to change me
I say you don't, you say I do
That's how it plays with me and you
When we can't seem to make up
When we are about to break up
I look at you, you smile at me, and then
We fall in love again
(Just like Mars and Venus)
(Just like Mars and Venus)

You get what I don't
And you will when I just won't
Your upside is downside to me
I flip it, you drop it
You start me up, and I can't stop it
You're on time is off time to me
Feels like a million miles between us
Just like Mars and Venus
Must be the pull of Gravity
I'm made for you, you're made for me

[Chorus]

For every action, baby, baby, there's reaction
Must be opposite attraction
No matter what, you're my ultimate distraction
And I know it gives you satisfaction
I was made for you, and you were made for me

[Chorus]

We fall in love again
We fall in love again
(Just like Mars and Venus)
I look at you; we fall in love again
We fall in love again

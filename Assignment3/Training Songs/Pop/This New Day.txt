Look before you leave
Cause then you'll see what everybody sees
You'll see the other side is out of reach
It's nothing you can change

And everything will work out in the end
You realise the world is not your friend
There's nothing that you've broken you cant mend

On this new Day
I found my feet
You know you better look before you leap again
On this new day
I found my place
You know you better look before you leap again

Stop before you rush
Before you try to make that final push
Now your prayers will never be enough
It's nothing you cant change

And I was simply watching as you chased
Knowing that as fools go all away
Saying you should leave it all to fate

It's up to you on this new day
All the seeds youve sewn
You shouldn't throw away
Nothing would grow
You're in the shade
And you will stay there alone

On this new Day
I found my feet
You know you better look before you leap again
On this new day
I found my place
You know you better look before you leap again

You've gotta make them see it
You've gotta make then need it
Youve gotta make them see it
See you mean it
Break these feelings
?????

Just keep dreaming
Just keep on weeping
You gotta break this feeling
?????

Just keep dreaming
Keep on weeping
You gotta fight these feelings
You gotta see a meaning

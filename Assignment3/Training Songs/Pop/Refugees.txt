You are the dust and,
I am the rain,
Lets go out in the rust and
Let's gather the change

Let's take to the streets
You and I we're life's refugees
But like Bonnie and Clyde we're free
Don't say there's nothing between us

You stain the pavements
I'll take the blame
Our love is our savior
Our life is our grave

Let's take to the streets
You and I we're life's refugees
But like Bonnie and Clyde we're free
Don't say there's nothing between us

Ã¢??Cause we're all refugees
And we're all drifting like leaves
But like Bonnie and Clyde we're free
Don't say there's nothing between us

We'll live for the sunshine
And smile through the rain

And we're all refugees
And we're all drifting like leaves
But like Bonnie and Clyde we're free
Don't say there's nothing between us

So let's take to the streets
You and I compete with the freaks
And like Bonnie and Clyde we're free
Don't say there's nothing between us

Well there's nothing between us
Well there's nothing between us

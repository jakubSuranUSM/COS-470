She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
Rays of hope that hypnotize
They're a blessing in disguise
Lightning up my life

We can play
In our secret hideaway
We can go there everyday
Time is on our side

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
There will be no compromise
Now that I have realized
What they mean to me, oh yeah

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

She brought heaven to me
Just like a symphony
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world

I'm not a superstitious mind
Not a spiritual kind
But she became a revelation to me
She made me believe

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

She brought heaven to me
Just like a symphony
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world

She's the sun that makes the rainbow
She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
She's the thunder, she's the lightning
She's the weather that keeps blowing throughout time

She's the sun that makes the rainbow
She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
She's the thunder

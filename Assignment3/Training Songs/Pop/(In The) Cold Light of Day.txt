I`ve offered you all I have 
Just to spend my life with you (Just to be with you) 
But someone`s got a claim on me 
These few hours will have to do 
So hold me tight, let`s make this night last forever 

Cos in the cold light of day, baby 
I`ll be going on my way 
You`re good for me, baby, but we met to late 
And I`ve got so much love to give 
And I`ve just got to learn to live 
Without you 

How could we know the time would come 
When you and I would feel this way (Just to be with you) 
Love started as a playful thing 
Just turned out a different way 
So clock on the wall 
Please don`t tick at all 
Just stand still 

Cos in the cold light of day, baby 
I`ll be going on my way 
You`re good for me, baby, but we met to late 
And I`ve got so much love to give 
And I`ve just got to learn to live 
Without you 

In the cold light of day baby 
I`ll be going on my way (repeat 2x)

It's three o'clock in the mornin'
No one can make me go home
'Cause no one's waitin' there for me
And I just can't be alone
Your green eyes are a weapon
Shot a hole in my heart
Now I'm fallin' for the bad one
And I'm seein' signs

I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
Every time you're pullin' backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh

No one likes bein' honest, but I'ma give you that
So ask me how much I want you, and I'ma whisper back
How many other girls you know sayin'
"Hold up front and I'll take care of you"?
'Cause now I fell for the bad one, and it never lasts

So I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
Every time you're pullin' backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh 

I don't wanna
I don't wanna

No, I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go so

No I don't wanna go slow, oh
I don't wanna go slow, (I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go) oh
Every time you're pullin' backwards
I'm just gonna fall in faster
'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh

I don't wanna
I don't wanna go slow
I don't wanna

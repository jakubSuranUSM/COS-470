Every night when the light has gone
I can see you carry on
Knights in armour won't rescue you
In the shadows - the naked truth

Chain of love - don't put me away
Chain of love - don't put me away

Any time you took my name
i had to change it back again
Caught in crossfire never worried me
I'm caught in chains deliberately

Chain of love - don't put me away ...

Take me away from this notion
I'm nervous enough
Take me away from this girl
Who's a genius for love

She's a genius

Lonely nights like the night before
See I've made you ask for more
Tropical fever when the heat is on
A pocket Venus the lonely one ?

Chain of love - don't put me away

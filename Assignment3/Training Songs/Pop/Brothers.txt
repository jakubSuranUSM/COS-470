I remember the times when we'd fight
For a slice of cake
And my mother would slap us
For breaking the kitchen plates
And I hated the days
She dressed us all up the same
In those little green suits
Man did I feel ashamed
But Momma said remember
Blood's thicker than water

[Chorus]
So brothers don't drift apart
Sons of your mothers
Sons of your fathers' heart
Don't drift apart
Now it don't matter when

I can call them at three am.
And they may curse at first
But I know they're sure gonna listen
I've had some really good friends
But time always breaks the bond
But all my brothers are there
When everyone else has gone
But Momma said remember
Blood's thicker than water

[Chorus]

Don't drift apart
But Momma said remember
Blood's thicker than water

[Chorus]

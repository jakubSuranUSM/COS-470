Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party

Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand, hand in hand
We're gonna have all night party

Hey little girl, you know he won't call up again
He's out there on the town with your best friend
Don't wait all night by the window, you know it had to end
You might as well come down and have a good time

Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance 'till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party

Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand hand in hand
We're gonna have all night party

Little girl, he'll always be the cheating kind
I knew that he would soon step out of line
So don't cry all night on your pillow 'cause he ain't worth the time
You might as well come down and join the party

Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance 'till break of day
Underneath the stars to soft guitars
There's gonna be an all night party

Say you'll meet me down on the beach tonight
Where you and I can dance your tears away
Barefoot in the sand hand in hand
We're gonna have all night party

I'm me if you care
I am, so lost without you
I'm me if you're there
I am, alone- so far from you

Its been so long since I last saw you
Just one kiss and you were off to
Your new career- so far from me
I could tell deep in your eyes
You were ready for a brand new life
Without me by your side

Istant Message conversations are filled with empty exclamations
Twelve point text cannot replace
Five minutes with you face to face
Geneva is such a cold cold front
I'm sorry if this comes out wrong
But I met someone new today
Long distance love is not my thing

I'm, me if you care
I am about to give up hope
I'm if you need a friend
I am still here, to type to you
If you want me to

I don't want you to

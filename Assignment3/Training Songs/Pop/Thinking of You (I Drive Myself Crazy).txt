Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lying in your arms, so close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn'
'Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head? Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy 
Wanting you the way that I do (Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me (Just how good you were to me)

You confessed your love (You confessed your love)
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left with all this pain 
I've only got myself to blame

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do (Wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know it (How much I loved you baby)
Why couldn't show it (If I had only told you)
When I had the chance
Oh, I had the chance, oh, la, la, la, la 

I drive myself crazy', ah
Oh, so crazy, la, la, la, la, oh

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy 
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake (made a mistake), let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do 

I lie awake, I drive myself crazy (I drive myself crazy) 
Drive myself crazy, crazy, crazy
Made a mistake, let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself crazy 
Wanting you the way that I do

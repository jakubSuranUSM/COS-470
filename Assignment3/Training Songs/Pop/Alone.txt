Baby, can I talk to you for a minute?
Ohhh...
Ohh...
Listen...

Boy, you had me fooled
I can't believe you
'Cause' you never done anything that I asked of you
Always talking like I just can't do right
Blaming me for everything and that just ain't right
'Cause I...

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't do this alone (I don't know what to do)
Alone(I'm tryna stay with you)
It's not all about you (Ohhh)
Boy, I can't do this alone (You're making this harder)
Alone (Boy, I'm 'bout to leave ya)
(Cuz I can't do this alone)
Alone...
Alone...
Alone

And I gave you everything I had
Yeah
And I never said nothing
Did everything for you
What did you do?
Nothing
Then you got the nerve to wanna run your mouth
Like I ain't never held you down
Baby, what did I do to deserve this?
'Cause' I put you on a shelf
Girl, I need help
'Cause' I can't do this alone, baby

[Chorus:]

And I tried to work this out(I'm tryna work this out)
But boy you're changing now (Oh, you're changing now)
What do I do? (What do I do?)
I'm so confused (I'm so confused, baby)

(And I tried to work this out)
 I tried it all
(But girl, you're changing now)
 So did I
(What do I do?)
 What do I do?
(I'm so confused)
 What do I do?
I can't do this alone

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I don't know what to do
'Cause' boy I'm so tired of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh...

Oh, said I don't know what to do
Ohh...
Girl, I'm so tired of you
Do what you gotta do
'Cause I, I can't do this alone

[Chorus:]

Said I can't do this alone.
Said I can't do this alone.
Said I tried everything.
I've done everything.
Ohh, what we gonna do baby?

There's smell of fresh cut grass
And it's filling up my senses
And the sun is shining down 
On the blossoms in the avenue.
There's a buzzing fly hanging
Around the bluebells and the daisies
And there's a lot more loving left in this world.

Don't go
Don't leave me now now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while yeah.

And I lie on warm and soft sancly beaches
And my toes are submerged in the water
And it feels good.
Children playing building castles on the shoreline
Like a painted little love and lord
It feels so fine.

Don't go
Don't leave me now now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while yeah.
Uh Huh
Uh Huh

There's white horses and they're
Coming at me and they face now
And there's a blue sirocco 
Blowing warm into my face.
The sun is shining on the other side of the bridges
The cars going by with smiles in the windows.

There's a black cat Iying in the
Shadow of the gate-post
And the black cat keeps telling me
That love is on it's way. Yeah

There's a black cat Iying in the
Shadow of the gate-post
And the black cat tells me that 
Love is on it's way.

Don't go
Don't ieave me now now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while yeah.

Stick around and laugh a while. - Don't go! -

Don't go
Don't leave me now now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while yeah.
Uh huh 
Uh huh

Don't go
Don't leave me now now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while yeah.

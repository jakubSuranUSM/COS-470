Walked around, no one around
You were the one who taught me better
This old town brings me down
You were the one who told me

You've got to move to Memphis
And that's what I'll do
Gonna move to Memphis and follow you
Trace that highway, down to your doorway
Gonna move to Memphis, be with you, yeah

On the day, you walked away
I was the one who said
You'd better stick around, stay in town
You were the one who told me

You've got to move to Memphis
And that's what I'll do
Chase the shadow and follow you
Take the highway, down to your doorway
Gonna move to Memphis, be with you

Gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
Gonna move to Memphis

I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna move to Memphis

Move to Memphis
That's what I'll do
Chase the shadows and follow you
Take the highway, down to your doorway
Gonna move to Memphis to be with you

That's what I'll do
Chase the shadow and follow you
Take the highway, down to your doorway
Gonna move to Memphis, follow you

That's what I'll do
Take the highway, to your doorway
Move to Memphis

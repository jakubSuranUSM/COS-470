Only you...

[Talk]
And the man and woman fall in love
And it's magic...pure magic!
(work that magic)
All alone
On a night like this
With nothing to do
But think about you

Under the moon
Two lovers kiss
And all I can do
Is think about you

I fall in love with you
Day after day after day
Baby in New York heartbeat
A herd of wild horses
Could not keep me away
And that's no promise
That's a guarantee

[Chorus]
Without your
My heart is frantic
Distant love can become tragic
When we touch
It's so romantic
Only you can work that magic
Only you...can work that magic [Repeat: x 3]

In my heart 
I hold your hand
I'm gonna be true
So true to you baby

And I've decided
To make a love stand
Next to you, right next to you baby
I fall in love with you (etc)

[Chorus]

When the night
Comes closing in
Be there for me, be there baby

We'll sail away
To a magic land
Stay forever...stay forever

Tenderly you call my name
Turned my heart into a burning flame

[Chorus]

Without you
My heart is frantic
When we touch
It's so romantic
So romantic
See'mon now...work it
Work that magic [Repeat: x 4]

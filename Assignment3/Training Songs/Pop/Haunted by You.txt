I cross the road
Just to hide
And to avoid the times
When you stood
At my side
Still battered by the tide
A wreck exposed
At my door
My eyes they cannot lie
So get up from my floor
For you, you've had your time
Your chance has gone
You're not so strong
Your words they cannot harm me now
But with all the things that I've said
I'm still haunted by you
In every town, every place
You're waiting
On my tongue lies disgrace
Still haunted by you
Yes you, you're in my way

Oh is this the way they say the future's meant to feel?
Or just twenty thousand people standing in a field
And I don't quite understand just what this feeling is
But that okay cos we're all sorted out for E's and Wizz
And tell me when the spaceship lands
Cause all this has just got to mean something

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
It feels alright but then tomorrow morning
Oh oh when you come down

Oh yeah the pirate radio told us what was going down
Got the tickets from some fucked up bloke in Camden Town
And no one seems to know exactly where it is
But that's okay, cos we're all sorted out for E's and Wizz
At 4 0'clock the normal world seems very very very far away
Hey hey

[Chorus]

Just keep on moving
Everybody asks your name they say we're all the same
And now it's "Nice one, Geezer"-and that's far the conversation went
I lost my friends, I dance alone, it's 6 o'clock, I wanna go home
But it's no way not today, makes you wonder what it meant
And the hollow feeling grows and grows and grows and grows
And you wanna call your mother and say,
"Mother, I can never come home again because I seem to have left
An important part of my brain somewhere in a field in Hampshire."
Alright

[Chorus]

Oh oh when you come down
Oh what if you never come down?

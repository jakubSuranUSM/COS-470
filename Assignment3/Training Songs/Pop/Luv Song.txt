That wasn't very encouraging. I don't wanna stop your creative flow, honey. Are you sure? That was cute. Isn't he sweet? I'm overly-excited. A lot of ideas. A little headphone bleed. Ow! All right! Do it again.

Heyyyy. Here's a "luv" song for your boyfriend. 
A luv song for your new boyfriend!

He's gotta be cool like James Dean. 
And burn like fire. 
He's sweet like sugar.
Or like custard and desire. 
Never walks away from a good fight.
Never gets sleepy - he goes down all night 

Here's a luv song for your boyfriend. 
A luv song for your new boyfriend.

He's gotta act like a maniac, and never get hurt.
He drives a 4 wheel slam, off road in the dirt.
He's sweet, He's fine. 
He's Mr. Slick on time.
And your mama's gotta love him. 
Or he ain't worth a dime!

Here's a luv song for your new boyfriend. Here's a luv song for your new boyfriend.

He's not codependent or anything weird like that. No fertilizer bomb materials in his closet. Not convicted of any major crimes. Not really much into Entomology. Never tries to calm you down.You can stay out all nightâ?¦talk all you want. he's not jealous of your friends that are guys... and thinks they're really cool.

What did you say?
Is he a real pool shark? And can he shake it like Elvis?Is he down for the barbecue, the race and the relatives?Can he rebuild the engine of a '56 Chevy?Can he down a whiskey-sour and knock off an Ever-Ready battery?

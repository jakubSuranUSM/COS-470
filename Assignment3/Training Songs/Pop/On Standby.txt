would you stay on standby
because i need another alibi
in the wrong place at the wrong time
could you talk a fine line
i need to know that i'll be fine
bulletproof 
it's like i've never been born
we conceive in the alleyways
it's like i've never been born
we believe in other ways
that you do and you did
and there's proof that we did wrong tonight 

could you sense a tragedy
because i saw it on the bbc
there's a panel on that channel
could you walk a narrow line
i need to know i'll serve my time
with some use 

it's like i've never been born
we conceive in the alleyways
it's like i've never been born
we believe in other ways
that you do and you did
and there's proof that we did wrong tonight 

and tonight you can cry if you want to
but it won't help you
you can cry if you want to
but it won't help you
to get you through this crime
it will plague you standby 

we did wrong we did wrong

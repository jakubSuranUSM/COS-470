What's it gonna be?
Red jacket girl, lover, midnight spree
What's it gonna be? 
You look so imperial
What's it gonna be? 
You tried and you tried but you couldn't hook your shoelace
What's it gonna be?
Know you got intention, difficult to see

You can make the switch
You can have your wish 

What's it gonna prove?
Turning all the dials, makin' all the right moves
What's it gonna prove?
It's all so mystical
What's it gonna prove?
You look so tacky in your chrome drip belt
What's it gonna prove?
Your ready to rage and startin' to melt down

You can make the switch
You can have your wish

Don't go to pieces
Be	-be	-be	-baby
Don't go to pieces

Don't go to pieces
Be	-be	-be	-baby
Don't go to pieces

What's it gonna show?
All left out and ready to go
What's it gonna mean?
You feel like trash but you look so clean
What's it gonna do?
All of them angels jealous of you
Where's it gonna go?
Anyplace, faster pace, overcome the low blow

You can make the switch
(ooooo)
You can have your wish

Don't go to pieces
Be	-be	-be	-baby
Don't go to pieces

Don't go to pieces
Be	-be	-be	-baby
Don't go to pieces

Don't go to pieces
Be	-be	-be	-baby
Don't go to pieces

(ooooo)
Don't go to pieces
(ooooo)
Be	-baby
(ooooo)
Don't go to pieces
(ooooo)
Don't go to pieces
Be	-baby
(ooooo)
Don't go to pieces
(ooooo)

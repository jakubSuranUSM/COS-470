She caught my eye
When she came into view
I met her on some New York avenue
I liked her smile
Her style and her grace
Her sexy walk could light up anyplace
She said to me
I just came in from Paris
I said to her
I'd like to get to know you
She said to me
I'm shy and a bit embarrassed
I said to her
There are some things I'd like to show you

Christine, Christine

I soon found out
It was more than fascination
I soon found out
It was much more than just a cheap imitation
I held her hand
Slowly we got closer
Felt like a man
And not some kind of poseur
Yes it's true she just came in from Paris
Her French perfume I got to know it better
We talked of love and poetry and marriage
Then I discovered that mysterious love letter

Christine, Christine

She caught my eye
When she came into view
I met her on some New York City avenue
I liked her smile
Her style and her grace
Her sexy walk could light up anyplace
She said to me
I must go back to Paris
I said to her
Oh please don't do that to me
She said to me
I got another boyfriend
I said to her
Well why didn't the hell you tell me

Christine, Christine

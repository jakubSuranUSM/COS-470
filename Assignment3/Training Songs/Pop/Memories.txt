Could you stop playing with my mind 
You know I'm not that kind 
To leave it all behind 
But all I wanted was you 
You made love blind to see 
Cause you could never be that 
One for me that life you see 

[Chorus]
Now all I have are just memories 
Time is what we used to have 
Memories, love we shared in our past 
Memories, days you used to hold me tight 
Memories, memories 

You must know that I still care 
Bout all we used to share 
I know the love's still there 
So what did all these games girl 
Let's not forget the past 
It went by much to fast 
Can't we make it last forever 

[Chorus]

I just need you, you see, tonight 

Oh please, let's not forget the past 
It went by much to fast 
Can't we make it last forever girl 

[Chorus: x3]

There comes a time when
You need a good friend
But all that you have
Is that glowing screen

You know you could fly
Your hate a run high
But you've been squeezed in
To that same old scene
You know what I mean

Turn up the power
This is the hour
From every tower
Shout it from above

Turn up the power
This is the hour
From every tower
A million watts of love

By turning that switch
You're finding your niche
And you could tell then
Where to put the advice

You should get back in
It's time to jack in
We'll help you hack in
To that glowing life
You won't have to think twice

(Are you Ready? Here We Go) 
Slow-Slow- Quick Quick Slow 
Slow-Slow- Quick Quick Slow 

Countdown Its getting to the flight time 
Night stars are shining in my eyes 
My shoes are going to be the first ones 
To dance deep up in the Skys 

Dancing in Heaven I never thought I could get my feet this far 
(Orbital Be-Bop) 
Dancing in Heaven I never thought I could get my feet this far 
(Orbital Be-Bop) 
(Kick it out) 

Slow-Slow- Quick Quick Slow 
Slow-Slow- Quick Quick Slow 

I'll be the first to Bassa Nova 
Ten thousand miles above my legs 
You dear, my lady on the Radar 
I'll bring a child to Outer Space 

Dancing in Heaven I never thought I could get my feet this far 
(Orbital Be-Bop) 
Dancing in Heaven I never thought I could get my feet this far 
(Orbital Be-Bop) 

Hey, Here I am 
I hear the Universe Sing 
The Celestial Scream 
I am not alone 
Are you receiving me clear 

 
  
 

There is Others out here 

Dancing in Heaven I never thought I could get my feet this far

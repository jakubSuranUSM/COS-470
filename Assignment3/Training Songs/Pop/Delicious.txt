You're a big man
But you're out of shape
I could help you
Get it back again
We should both go to bed
Till we make each other sore
We should both stay in bed
Till we make each other roar
You're a good man
But you're hard to please
You shouldn't worry
It's just my head that's diseased
We should both get away
And explore our darkest dreams
We should both find a place
Where no one can hear our screams
You're delicious
You're so dirty
Make it dirtier

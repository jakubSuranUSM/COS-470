Now the plummer's got a drip in his spigot 
The mechanic's got a clank in his car 
And the preacher's thinking thoughts that are wicked 
And the lover's got a lonely heart 
My friends ain't the way I wish they were 
They are just the way they are 

And I will be my brother's keeper 
Not the one who judges him 
I won't despise him for his weakness 
I won't regard him for his strength 
I won't take away his freedom 
I will help him learn to stand 
And I will, I will be my brother's keeper 

Now this roof has got a few missing shingles 
But at least we got ourselves a roof 
And they say that she's a fallen angel 
I wonder if she recalls when she last flew 
There's no point in pointing fingers 
Unless you're pointing to the truth 

And I will be my brother's keeper 
Not the one who judges him 
I won't despise him for his weakness 
I won't regard him for his strength 
I won't take away his freedom 
I will help him learn to stand 
And I will, I will be my brother's keeper 

I will be my brother's keeper 
Not the one who judges him 
I won't despise him for his weakness 
I won't regard him for his strength 
I won't take away his freedom 
I will help him learn to stand 
And I will, I will be my brother's keeper

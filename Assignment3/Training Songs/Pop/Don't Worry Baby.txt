Well it's been building up inside of me for
Oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why, but I keep thinkin'
Something's bound to go wrong
When she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
When she says

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby, don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)
I guess I should have kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back out now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to ride
When she says

[Chorus]

She tells me
"Baby when you leave today just
Take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I love you baby
Nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh what she does to me
When she brings love to me
And she says

[Chorus]

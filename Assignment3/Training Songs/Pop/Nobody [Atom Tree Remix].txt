I don’t even like your type of pain
You don’t even ask me what’s my name
We just fit together like wet on rain
Hey, leather jacket wait up
Hold the elevator

Some nights I’m like
Am I am I alive?
Am I alive?
'Cause you feel like a dream
And I can’t even take it
Too much too much to loose
Too much to loose
I just got to tell ya
Nobody does it better

Ooh tonight, were gonna start a fire, gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher
Nobody takes me higher

No nobody
It's you and me you and me all night
No nobody
It's you and me under the sun light
No nobody
It's you and me, you and me all night
No nobody, no nobody

Never, never, never, never, never thought I'd find a love like this
And she don't even understand how she gotta mend all this bullshit
Never, never, never, never, never had a love like this right
I met her once, I met her twice and then the third time I was all in

Never, never never, never, never had a love like this right
She don't need no man but she know she need a little lovin'
Never, never, never, never, never thought I'd find a love like this
And I don't even like it
But tonight I'm tryin' to start shit

Ooh tonight, were gonna start a fire, gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher
Nobody takes me higher

No nobody
It's you and me you and me all night
No nobody
It's you and me under the sun light
No nobody
It's you and me, you and me all night
No nobody, no nobody

Yeah you feel like a dream
I just gotta tell ya
Nobody does it better

Ooh tonight, were gonna start a fire, gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher
Nobody takes me higher

No nobody (oh it's you and me)
(Oh nobody) no nobody
Ooh, no nobody, yeah
No nobody, no nobody
No nobody, no nobody
It's you and me, you and me all night
It's you and me under the sunlight
It's you and me, you and me all night

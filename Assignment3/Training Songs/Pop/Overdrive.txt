I wanna seize the day
Like its the greatest thing that ever happen
I'm gonna shift my gear
And leave it for up tied in the traffic
The one that hit the wall like a lumberjack
Gonna crank it up like a maniac
'Cause I, I like it and I do it again

You can rush a car
But only if you bring it on some jingle
And if you don't confide
'Cause I'm thinking better cause I'm single

I took one steep forward and two steps back
It was this close to a heart attack
And I, now why do I wanna do it again?

I'm into
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Yes super
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Life's a hell of a ride when the rules don't look right
I'm into
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
I listen to only me, myself and I
Think I just let it slide it
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive

I see the burst light high
And they wear suits but they got nothing on me
I take the paid chick back ?
They will never own me

I took one steep forward and two steeps back
It was this close to a heart attack
And now why do I wanna do it again?

I'm into
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Yes super
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Life's a hell of a ride when the rules don't look right
I'm into
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
I listen to only me, myself and I
Think I just let it slide it
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive

Tripping all over the world
Spinning the big ? around
Every night and every day
Follow the lines of the road
I'm farming a map on the way
Figure it out I figure it out

(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Yes super
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
Life's a hell of a ride when the rules don't look right
I'm into
(O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh) overdrive
I listen to only me, myself and I
Think I just let it slide it

Tripping all over the world
Spinning the big ? around
Every night and every day
Follow the lines of the road
I'm farming a map on the way
Figure it out I figure it out
Think I just let it slide it

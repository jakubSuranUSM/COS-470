Get up, get up, get up, get up
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat; x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving

Backwards straight to the dance floor
Will you still be waiting for me? will you still be my friend?
I don't wanna bug you
All these crazy, crazy ideas
For I know this ain't a good place for us to talk
You better get your move on or all the good ones will have gone (3x)

Get up, get up, get up, get up
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving

If you wanna say goodbye, if you want to play seek and hide
Just tail got the time

Playing nice you know what?
You better get your move on or all the good ones will have gone [Repeat: x 3]

Get up, get up, get up, get up
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving
Get up [Repeat: x 4]
You gotta keep on moving

Let me look at you, just look at you
You're a sight for sore eyes, yes you are
If you knew how many nights I spent holding you so tight
Then I'd wake up and we're still apart
Now you're really near and I'm really here
And I can wrap my arms around you, yes I can
This is just like I remember, no I think it's even better
Maybe even more than I can stand
Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back
Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again
Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back
Honey, it's good to be back with you, oh yeah
Well it's not the first time we've been apart
But as far as I'm concerned it's the last
I don't care what we have to do to stay together from now on
But those days away from you are past
'cause when I go through the day and I haven't seen your face
Seems like nothing that I do feels right
You're the one I wanna see when I wake up every day
You're the one I wanna kiss goodnight
Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back
Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again (ooh)
Baby, it's good to be back, so good to be back
Honey, it's good to be back with you
So good, so good, so good, so good, so good with you, baby
So good with you
Why don't you start me up with just one kiss
That's just one of the things I've missed
You better kiss me once again 'til it finally settles in
Well, I think I could get used to this
Baby, it's good to be back, so good, so good to be back, real good
Baby, it's good to be back in your arms again, I just got to say it
Good to be back, so good to be back
Honey, it's good to be back with you
Baby, it's good to be back, feels mighty good to be back
Baby, it's good to be back with you
Baby, it's good to be back, so good, so good to be back
Aw honey, honey it's good to be back with you
And it's so good to be back, aw sing it girls
Yeah, good to be back, I like the way you sang
Baby, it's good to be back in you're arms again
Sang, sang, sang, sang
And it's so good to be back...

I spend my nights awake
Thinking about the way we used to
Feel like a summer day
I love to watch you sway
But now you're someone new
Lately I know I get the strangest feeling
From strangers falling in love
I never thought I'd be the one to say this
But I don't know what to do

Let's move into our old house
Love me this time
We'll be grooving to the old sounds
Pumping up clouds
Kiss me like the first time
Dancing like we're young
Let's move into our old house
Pumping up clouds
I know we can get it right

You always got me high
Tell me to stay the night
I'd love to turn all the wrongs to right
And make you stay for life
I could be someone new
You always dreamed about a walk-in closet
I'd love to give it to you
I still remember singing in the hallway
We watched the stars on the roof

Let's move into our old house
Love me this time
We'll be grooving to the old sounds
Pumping up clouds
Kiss me like the first time
Dancing like we're young
Let's move into our old house
Pumping up clouds
I know we can get it right

Move, move into our old house
I know we can get it, I know we can get it right
Move, move into our old house
I know we can get it, I know we can get it right

Let's move into our old house
Love me this time
We'll be grooving to the old sounds
Pumping up clouds
Kiss me like the first time
Dancing like we're young
Let's move into our old house
Pumping up clouds
I know we can get it right

My luck ran out it got the best of me
You said I was a toy and he's a prettier boy than me
I don't care no more I wanna waste away
Well, well, well, it don't feel right in spite of what
You say

I feel so pushed around, pushed around
Well I feel so pushed around, pushed around, pushed
Around now
Don't be a fool man play it cool man
I'm in a bad way I saw you today
Lookin' for an easy prey

You took my nerves you tied 'em in a knot

You know I'm feeling sick and hot now who knows what I
Got
Don't bother me don't bother me right now
Well I'm tired of this routine
I'm in a bad machine

I feel so pushed around, pushed around
Well I feel so pushed around, pushed around, pushed
Around now
Don't be a fool man play it cool man
I'm in a bad way I saw you today
Lookin' for an easy prey

Here come my baby ooh she's a walkin' by
Come on and tell why my baby's with some other guy
I don't care no more I wanna waste away
Well, well, well, it don't feel right in spite of what
You say.

I feel so pushed around, pushed around
Well I feel so pushed around, pushed around, pushed
Around now
Don't be a fool man play it cool man
I'm in a bad way I saw you today
Lookin' for an easy prey

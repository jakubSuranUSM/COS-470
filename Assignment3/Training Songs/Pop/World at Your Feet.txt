You're the first in my life to make me think
That we might just go all the way
And I want you to know we're all hanging on

They'll come and yes they'll try
To brake us down
But we know that we'll never lose
If we keep moving forward and don't look back

With the world at your feet
There's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet
There's no heart you can't reach
This could be the one
Its calling, Its calling you now
You know its gonna be your time
'Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at your feet

Like stars in the sky
Burning bright, seen by a billion eyes
Now, I want you to know we're all turned your way

With the world at your feet
There's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet
There's no heart you can't reach
This could be the one
Its calling, Its calling you now
You know its gonna be your time
'Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at...

With the world at your feet
There's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet
There's no heart you can't reach
This could be the one

You're lifted up
With one proud kiss
There's nothing else
That feels like this
So lift your arms
And everyone sing

With the world at your feet
There's no one you can't beat
Yes it can be done
With the world at your feet
There's no heart you can't reach
This could be the one
Its calling, Its calling you now
You know its gonna be your time
'Cause the world is at your feet
Yeah, the world is at your feet

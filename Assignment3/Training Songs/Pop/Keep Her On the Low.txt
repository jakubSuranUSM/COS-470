All the girls, at the school, won't y'all meet us down there.
We gon' take ya, then gon' show you how we do it round here.
We got a party on the roof
If you miss it, oh well
Gotta keep it on the low
Ain't nobody can tell

Sixteen balling like them boys at Menudo
Only difference is our crib is in the hood
We got them jumping out the pool like they’re all from Reno
We dance like the Jackson's,
All we’re missing is Tito

It’s a whole lot of y’all that's up in here that’s looking for love,
But we go breaking hearts and gettin' to the money on tour.
If you my honey, it’s only for the moment,
'Cause another 100 want it,
We keep it young, popping off

We gotta keep her,
Gotta keep her, keep her,
Keep her on the low
Gotta k-k-keep her,
Gotta keep her on the low
Now even tho I got a girl,
But I wanna get some more
Gotta figure how to get 'em
Without messin' up my flow!
Gotta keep her,
Gotta keep her, keep her,
Keep her on the low
Gotta k-k-keep her,
Gotta keep her on the low
It's the One to the Two,
And one that lets it go.
When the DJ plays my music,
We gon' get down on the floor

Let me define, what I call a girlfriend!
She will be mine, about two weekends
I’m only sixteen, that means it’s show time
When I ain’t with her, that means I’m on mine!

It’s a whole lot of y’all that's up in here that’s looking for love,
But we go breaking hearts and gettin' to the money on tour.
If you my honey, it’s only for the moment,
Cause another a hundred want it,
We keep it young, popping off

We gotta keep her,
Gotta keep her, keep her,
Keep her on the low
Gotta k-k-keep her,
Gotta keep her on the low
Now even tho I got a girl,
But I wanna get some more
Gotta figure how to get 'em
Without messin' up my flow!
Gotta keep her,
Gotta keep her, keep her,
Keep her on the low
Gotta k-k-keep her,
Gotta keep her on the low
It's the One to the Two,
And one that lets it go.

We gon' get down on the floor

We gon' get down on the dance floor
Girls, move them hips though!
Back up in yo speakers,
We gon' smash on the radio
I said for y'all to get down on the dance floor
Smash on the radio
You know what I mean shawty.
Look how fast the cash blow!

Change your mind
We're getting closer
Change your mind
We're getting closer

Change your mind
We can get closer
These eyes that shine
Are telling a story
I'll change your mind
All I need is time
Till' I show you
The way I want to be

You think you know me
But you're wrong
Too late for questions
When I'm gone
So if you'll hear me
I'll explain
I need your comfort
Not your blame

Change your mind
We can get closer
These eyes that shine
Are telling a story
I'll change your mind
All I need is time
Till I show you
The way I want to be

How can you ever be so sure
Are you the justice
And the law?
All I'm defending is my world
Do you believe in all you heard?

Change your mind
We can get closer
These eyes that shine
Are telling a story
I changed your mind
All I need is time
Till' I show you
Where I want to be

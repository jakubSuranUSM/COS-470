There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold
You were right
Come to see all the girls
They agree you shine like gold

I can't speak 'cause you took the words from me
You are my weakness
It's sweeter than the center bone
His body is all want, you got the whole room blowing
Everybody know
I can tell that your love is dancing
Magic touch I feel you inside me
And I wanna know, yeah I just gotta know
Can you light me up when we're alone

There's no light in this room
It's all right we got you
You shine like gold
You were right
Come to see all the girls
They agree you shine like gold

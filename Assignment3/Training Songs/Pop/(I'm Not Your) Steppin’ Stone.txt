I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone,
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone.

You're trying to make your mark in society,
You're using all the tricks that you used on me,
You're reading all them high-fashion magazines,
The clothes you're wearing, girl, they're causing public scenes.

I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone,
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone. (No!)

Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,

When I first met you, girl, you didn't have no shoes,
But, now you're walking around like you're front page news,
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose,
But, you won't find my name in your book of "Who's Who".

I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone, (No, girl, not me!)
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone. (No!)

Not your steppin' stone,
I'm not your steppin' stone,

Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,

No, girl, I'm not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,
Not your steppin' stone,

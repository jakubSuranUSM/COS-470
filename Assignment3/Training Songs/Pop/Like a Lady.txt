I want to go insane
Just when I hear you're name
Even the thought of you
Should give me in a crazy mood
The thought of you and me doesn't leave my memory
I think that you should know
How to get me in you're flow
Make it to real love
Start it up and show that you could
And if you're going
Take it to the limit now
And show that your doing good

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if I fall save me
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should

Don't wanna mess around
Waiting till you find out
That I'm the one for you
Fiddling in you're dancing shoes
I need your feedback now
Just be a man somehow
Don't wait for centuries
Show what you've got up is weak

They getting show-stopper heart rocker
Show that you could
And if you gonna take it to the limit now
Be sure that you do way good, so good , so good

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Love me like crazy
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady

Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should

Treat me like a ,a, a, a lady
And I'll love ya like a girl should
Treat me like a, a, a, a lady
And I'll love you like a girl should

And if you finally make it
I know we both could
Feel like Cristal lovers
Like boy a girl should
I just can't have wait for
Treating you good
And giving you the right love
Just like a girl should

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Love me like crazy
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should

Treat me like a, a, a, a lady
And I'll love ya like a girl should
Treat me like a a a a lady
And I'll love ya like a girl should

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could

Love you like a girl should

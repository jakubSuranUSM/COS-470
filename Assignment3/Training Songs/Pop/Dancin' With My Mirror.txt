Oh-no-no
Ah
Whoa
It's late at night I can't fall asleep

Shadows on the lake are obsolete
So I just stay awake
Images running 'round my brain
Paint your picture you're the king of the walk

Declare your space and prepare to shock
There is no precedence
Alone in your room your first offence
So I turn surprised, (o-o)

Reflections from behind
And I gaze to the sublime, (o-o)
Said na na na na na na

Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)

Catch it when I can
O no
Hear "Roxanne" on the radio, (on the radio)
The red light burns

Tell me where to go
I found my decadence
Obscure but approved experience
So the truth can't be denied, (o-o)

Though sometimes I have tried
O the blast from the looking glass, (o-o)
Say na na na na na na
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)

Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Catch it when I can
I am dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)

Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Catch it when I can, oh no
Oh no no

So I turn surprised, (o-o)
Reflections from behind
And then I gaze to the sublime, (o-o)
Said na na na na na na na na na na na na

Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Catch it when I can

I am dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Catch it when I can

I am dancin' with my mirror-are
Yeah - oh, no no no
Late at night, I can't fall asleep
Late at night, I can't fall asleep

It's late at night I can't fall asleep
I said no no no no no no

(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Oh)
(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Oh)
(Dancin' with my mirror)
(Dancin' with my mirror).

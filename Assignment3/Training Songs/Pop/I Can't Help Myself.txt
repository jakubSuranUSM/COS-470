I steal a glance at you, and save it up for later
You see what I've come to? I really should know better

But I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you

I lie awake at night to savour every moment I've stolen
I'm hoping that you might know where this is going

But I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you

And the funny part is I feel no guilt and no shame
And I guess where there's no action there's no blame
And if I had an ounce of sense left I'd keep it that way too
And I think of you, I think of me
And remember what will be will be
And I'm looking forward to the day
Where I don't have to feel this way

I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, help myself (can't help it)
I'm lost in you
I can't help myself, I'm lost in you darling, I am lost
I'm so lost, I can't help myself

I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...

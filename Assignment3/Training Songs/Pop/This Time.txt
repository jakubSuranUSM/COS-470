Outta sight 
Didn't put up a fight 
Now I wonder if you're right 
This time 

Down and out 
Now I'm found out 
Another Saturday night out 
Wastin' time 

Now I'm complicated 
But I'm not quite elated 
To hear your point of view 
I guess I'm going to 
I'll take a seat 
I won't make you repeat 
What you want to say 
I know you've got a lot to say 
I know you've got a lot to say 
This time 

Come and go 
Now the true colors show 
Feelin' left out of the know 
Time after time 

Break it down 
Out on the streets of this town 
Gonna take another round 
Can ya do the time 

Now I'm complicated 
But I'm not quite elated 
To hear your point of view 
I know you really want me to 
I'll take a seat 
I won't make you repeat 
What you've come to say 
I know you've got a lot to say 
I know you've got a lot to say 
This time 
I know you've got a lot to say 
This time

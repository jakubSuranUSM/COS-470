Are you with us
Or against us
Are you coming alive
Will you give them or give out
And then pick a side
Those animals that you ground up
Now they eat you inside
There ain't no use in hanging
If you didn't do the crime

You do what you're told
And everything's coming up roses
The puzzle unfolds
And everything's coming up roses

Now you're glowing
Now you're brilliant
Now you're going all night
The high life is killing
The hate you're trying to hide
And the animals that you run with
Now they almost seem alive
But it ain't no use you're flying
Well wait out the high

You do what you're told
And everything's coming up roses
And the puzzle unfolds
And everything's coming up roses
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up roses
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up roses

I wanna thank you for your time
I wanna thank you for the misery
And I take you back tonight
I need nothing (nothing)
Nothing (nothing)
To remember you by
You never leave my mind

All borrowed and sold
And everything's coming up roses
Just do what you're told
And everything's coming up roses
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up roses
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up
Everything's coming up roses

Oh oh oh oh oh (Ah)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Ah)

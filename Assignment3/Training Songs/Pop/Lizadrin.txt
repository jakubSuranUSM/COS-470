Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't come around
Don't bring me down
Everytime we think you've found the things
You've looked for all around
Well you were simply out of town
While we were cold and lonely
Things were turning upside down
And there were rumors underground
And you were simply out of town
While we were cold and lonely
Yeah, yeah
(chorus)
Everytime we think you've found the things
You've looked for all around
Well you were simply out of town
While we were cold and lonely
Things were turning upside down
And there were rumors underground
And you were simply out of town
While we were cold and lonely
Yeah, yeah
(chorus)

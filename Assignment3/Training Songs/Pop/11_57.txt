Another day slips away and I gotta wonder 
Lying here in my bed do I even care 
Everyday seems the same, seems so paint by numbers 

Early bird catches the worm is what the people tell me 
Put on a face, put on a suit and then you'll be someone 
I live for fun, live for One, live for little wonders 

It's 11.57 
And I'm running out of time 
Pick me up and turn me on 
Out of luck I'm out of my mind 
Running out of time 

Broken man with a pen and a piece of paper 
Rolls the dice, takes a hit but he didn't care 
Takes a card, takes your lies takes your name and number 

Given what I got, got a lot, got a situation 
Taken from the top, at the top it couldn't it be so bad 
Lost the shirt and tie cause that style doesn't qualify me.

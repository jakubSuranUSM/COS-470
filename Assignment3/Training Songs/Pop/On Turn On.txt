Boy I want to know, you like a brother,
Boy I want the hole in you as well,
Boy you know you move, you're like no other,
Saving all that sweet ass for myself.

And it goes on and on, on and on,
All because of you,
And the reason's no reason,
It's in your lips, your legs, your body.

Boy you've got the source, you've got the answers,
Boy I wonder best who was well,
And it goes on and on, on and on,
All because of you,

And the reason's no reason,
It's in your shoes, your moves, your body.

All I want is all I see,
All I see is all I need,
All I need is all I have,
All I have is nothing.

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

And it goes on and on, on and on,
All because of you,
And the reason's no reason,
It's in your lips,

Your lips,
Your legs,
Your shoes,
Your moves,
Your arse,
Your suss,
Your body.

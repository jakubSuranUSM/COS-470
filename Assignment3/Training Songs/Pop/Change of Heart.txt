I never planned to fall in love
I told her from the start
But she had that look in her eye
And I had a change of heart

I tried my best to say good bye
But every time I'd start
She'd get that look in her eye
And I'd have a change of heart

I knew that she was changing me
But I never realized
That I was leanin' on her, dependent on her
And seemed to my surprise

One day she found somebody new
And tore my world apart
Now I say a prayer every night
That she'll have a change of heart

I knew that she was changing me
But I never realized
That I was leanin' on her, dependent on her
And seemed to my surprise

One day she found somebody new
And tore my world apart
Now I say a prayer every night
That she'll have a change of heart

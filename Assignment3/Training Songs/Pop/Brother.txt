Listen

Hey brother, stay loose
Don't give it too much use
That mouth of yours
Ain't never gonna get her.

Talk is cheap
Go sell it on the street
But your brother might be
Just a little bit better.
 
I might seem like a lover's dream
Got bullets in my gun
You might explode in the middle of the road
Before the race is run.

Don't jump off the sidewalk, brother
Don't give me that jive talk, brother.
 
What's the sense of sitting on the fence
It's them or us, can you make it
Why make waves pretending to be brave
It hurts too much, can you fake it.

Tell it straight, you know I'm great
Ain't never seen you score?
Who d'ya think climbs out your window
While you're knocking at the door?
Don't jump off the sidewalk, brother
Don't give me that jive talk, brother.

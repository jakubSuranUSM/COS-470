Yes, yes, yes, you might be cuter than I wanna admit
I'll take it step, step, step, 'till I know if I wanna commit.
You're comin' on real strong, so what am I gonna do whit ya?
I'll give you just one kiss but you only get this to humour ya,
I taste you on my lips and

Slam!
You drop me where I stand
Yeah it just hit the fan
the moment that you kissed me
hit me

Slam!
My heard didn't touch the floor
Can't feel it anymore
Goddamn, wham, bam
here I am.

Shake, shake, shake, why'd you have to go and rattle my cage?
I'm tryin' to hold a little back while the blood rushes to my face.
Boom, boom, boom, it's like you shoot a little gun inside of me.
Think I know what's gonna come so baby put me out of my misery
Oh, oh, oh

Slam!
You drop me where I stand
Yeah it just hit the fan
the moment that you kissed me
hit me

Slam!
My heard didn't touch the floor
Can't feel it anymore
Goddamn, wham, bam
here I am.

I must confess that this is such a new experience.
Attraction hit me with the sweetest kind of violence.
I never thought that just the thought of you could take me down.
I close my eyes and know I'm yours before I hit the ground.

Slam!
You drop me where I stand
Yeah it just hit the fan
the moment that you kissed me
hit me

Slam!
My heard didn't touch the floor
Can't feel it anymore
Goddamn, wham, bam
here I am.

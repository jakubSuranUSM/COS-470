(Denis LePage, Denyse LePage)

You know my love has a mind of its own
Even when I know that I'm all alone
Sometimes it feels like it's just a machine
Even though I think that you're just a dream

(Pre-Chorus, Repeat 2x)
'Cause I love you, love you, love you

(Chorus 1)
Baby, you've got the key (oh, baby)
You can ignite me, baby
When you're still at the wheel (ooh-ooh, baby)
Of my emotions, baby

You know my love has a mind of its own
And when I know you're in my danger zone
I can't explain though when you make me feel
Sometimes it seems that you cannot be real

(Repeat Pre-Chorus 2x)

(Repeat Chorus 1)

(Instrumental Break)

You know my love has a mind of it own
'Specially when you know that I'm all alone
That's when I'm sure that you're not just a doll
You can hug me just a frame on the wall

(Repeat Pre-Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)
Babe, it's easy to see (yeah, baby)
You're not a picture, baby
Yeah, you've got to be real, (ooh, baby)
With your emotions, baby

(Repeat Chorus 1 and 2 and Fade)

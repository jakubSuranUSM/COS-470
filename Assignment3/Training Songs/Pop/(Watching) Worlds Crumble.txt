I can see the look in their eyes
Their fears
Cold tears fall to the ground
And their words just echo more lies
More plans, blood stained hands
Are all around

[Chorus]
Look at me - I'm watching worlds crumble
Look at me - I'm making walls tumble
Take my hand, oh, Lord; it's all I've got
Look at me - I'm watching worlds crumble
With their hearts, they ask me to stay
One life, one voice, calling me
I see their eyes, and I can't look away
Oh, God, why do people have to suffer everyday?
I know there's more than just you
You know it's all I can do

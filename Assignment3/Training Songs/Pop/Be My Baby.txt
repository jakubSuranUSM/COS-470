The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go.
So won't you say you love me,
I'll make you so proud of me.
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go.

So won't you, please, BE MY BE MY BABY
Be my little. baby MY ONE AND ONLY BABY
Say you'll be my darlin', BE MY BE MY BABY
Be my baby now. MY ONE AND ONLY BABY
Wha-oh-oh-oh.

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see.
For every kiss you give me I'll give you three.
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you.
You know I will adore you 'til eternity.

So won't you, please, BE MY BE MY BABY
Be my little. baby MY ONE AND ONLY BABY
Say you'll be my darlin', BE MY BE MY BABY
Be my baby now. MY ONE AND ONLY BABY

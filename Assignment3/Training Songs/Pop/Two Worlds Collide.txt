I steal to feed, I fight to breathe, through hunger not greed
I find these days it's the only way I can survive
What have I done with my life?
Is this the end, when two worlds collide?
Oh, in this dusty city with all the gods on the hill
Will not one of them help us?
The temple which they built is an empty shell
The people who I see, scurrying on the streets, oblivious to our needs
I wonder sometimes how so many could be so blind?
What have I done with my life ?
Is this the end, when two worlds collide?

What have I done with my life?
Is this the end, when two worlds collide?
Today I stole the sun from the sky, the color from the heart of a rose
Today I took food from the hand of a starving child
What have I done with my life?
Is this the end, when two worlds collide?
What have I done with my life?
Is this the end, when two worlds collide?
(I guess that makes me a bad man)
(I guess that makes me a bad man)
(I guess that makes me a bad man)

Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening
On my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed
To see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me 
Chase the shadows away
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow,
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world
I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and
I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see
No one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight

It's been a while, you've been walking alone, it's been a while
It's been a while since your heart had a home, it's been a while
You remember the way you came tumbling down
Down to your knees like never before
You're at the bottom in a bottomless town
And as you lie on the floor

The rain falls over your face
Drowned in this place too long
Well I know that the sun shines and fights for your day
You hear it say be strong, and let it go
Just keep holding on
Ohhhhhhh
Soon you'll see that you belong.

You know there's still darkness ahead, you know it
And I know you heard the things that they said, you try not to show it.
You remember the way you came tumbling down
Down to your knees like never before
You're at the bottom in a bottomless town
And you can't see the door

The rain falls over your face
Drowned in this place too long
Well I know that the sun shines and fights for your day
You hear it say be strong, and let it go
Just keep holding on
Ohhhhhhh
Soon you'll see that you belong.

You belong, you already belong, you belong

You remember the way you came tumbling down
Down to your knees like never before
You're at the bottom in a bottomless town
And as you lie on the floor

The rain falls over your face
Drowned in this place too long
Well I know that the sun shines and fights for your day
You hear it say be strong, and let it go
Just keep holding on
Ohhhhhhh
Soon you'll see that you belong.

All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
The moon rose through the nighttime
Till the day break comes around
All my life's a circle
But I can't tell you why
The seasons spinning round again
The years keep rolling by

It seems like I've been here before
I can't remember when
But I've got this funny feeling
That I'll be back once again
There's no straight lines make up my life
And all my roads have bends
There?s no clear-cut beginnings
And so far no dead-ends

All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
The moon rose through the nighttime
Till the day break comes around
All my life's a circle
But I can't tell you why
The seasons spinning round again
The years keep rolling by

I've found you a thousand times
I guess you've done the same
But then we lose each other
It's just like a children's game
And as I see you here again
The thought runs through my mind
Our love is like a circle
Let's go round one more time

All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
The moon rose through the nighttime
Till the day break comes around
All my life's a circle
And I can't tell you why
The seasons spinning round again
The years keep rolling by

(Repeat chorus)
(Repeat chorus)
(Repeat chorus & fade)

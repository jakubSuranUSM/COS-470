Sitting in the summer sun
Binding my time
Waiting for the demons to go away
No one knows when they come
Or when they're gonna go away
As long as they do were OK, yes were alright

[Chorus]
Cause I had the time of my life
Show me some love tonight
You know I'll treat you right
Cause I had the time of my life

Woke up in the morning rain
God knows were I slept again
No recollection of the night
Oh God what's this I see lying next to me
With a smile on your face
Were alright, yes were alright

[Chorus]

oh yeah yeah
Yeah Yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah were alright, yeah
Yes were alright

[Chorus: x2]

I had the time [Repeat: x4]
I had the time of my life
I had the time [Repeat: x4]
I had the time of my life

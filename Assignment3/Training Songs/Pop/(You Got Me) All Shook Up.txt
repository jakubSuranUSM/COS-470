Little by little, you put me in the middle 
And I can't stop the rain from falling down 
Falling down like my world around me, 
to drown me 
I'm just shakin' my head, looking for an answer 
As I watch all my heartstrings unwind 
No, I can't hide from my worst suspicions, 
I've listened 
To every little tale she tells 
Bought every little lie she sells 

[Chorus] 
And now I'm all shook up 
'Cause I've been finding out a lot about you, girl 
Just running 'round in circles over you, it's true 
Yes, I'm all shook up 
You've got me all shook up 

Minute by minute, got tired of stepping in it 
And I can't ride this train anymore 
So what's in store for a fool and a dreamer? I believed her 
And now I'm speaking in tongues, lying to the mirror 
I'm afraid that I still haven't learned 
Don't be concerned if you see me crying, its only me dyin' 
'Cause everything I had is gone 
Everything that's right's gone wrong 

[Chorus] 

I don't want to play, I don't want to hear it 
Nothing's gonna change my mind 
I say,

Diane's got everything, a helicopter and a submarine. 
Yeah man you're just what this world needs. 
Diane lives in a sanctuary, 
she swears to Jesus she'll never marry. 
Yeah man you're everything to me.

Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane.
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane.

Diane is everywhere pretending that she just don't care. 
Diane I hear you're just nineteen. 
Diane's a superstar, she's everything you hoped you were. 
Diane you're all these things to me.

Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane.
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane.

She's got everything she wants in the world, Diane. 
Pretending to be some kind of calendar girl, 
well I'll pull you out and pin you down, Diane.

Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane,
Diane, Diane, Diane.

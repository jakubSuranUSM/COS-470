We've had it good for years now
Don't let the change
We've never needed answers
To find the way

Now all of a sudden
Like waves on a beach
Love has come crashing down
The truth has been lost and found

(Chorus)
Don't say it's love, baby
'Cos you are to me
What you want to be
Don't say it's love, baby
If our friendship is to survive
Don't say it's love

We've shared so many secrets
Now kiss and tell
You make one move to love me
And it's farewell

'Cos somewhere there's someone
Who's waiting for you
To love you more than I could
Your heart was misunderstood

(Chorus)

Don't be a fool
You'll be alone in your confusion
If loving me is an illusion
Then let it go
Oh no no no no

Now I never counted
On ending this way
I always trusted fate
But if we are no too late

(Chorus)

...All you do is say it's love

You're mine, you're mine, the stars told me
You're mine, you're mine, it's your destiny
It's true, it's true it was meant to be
It's true, it's true, it's your destiny

And for your world my love is free
There's nothing here holding me
Kept this feeling deep on down, down, down

(I just wanna) be	 with you
(I just wanna) be	 with you
(I just wanna) be	 with you
Baby that's all

Well the authority have got their problems
I always try to be one of them
And I think I'd be happy, to be bad
If you said I was good at it

Please baby, please baby tell me
Was I good at it?

(I just wanna) be	 with you
(I just wanna) be	 with you
(I just wanna) be	 with you
Baby that's all

Please baby, please baby tell me
You know what I mean

Ooh baby the stars told me
You're mine, you're mine

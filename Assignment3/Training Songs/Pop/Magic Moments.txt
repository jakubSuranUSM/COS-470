Magic moments, when two hearts are caring.
Magic moments, memories we`ve been sharing.

I`ll never forget the moment we kissed,
the night of the hay-ride.
The way that we hugged and tried to keep warm
on taking the sleigh-ride.

Magic moments, when two hearts are caring.
Magic moments, memories we`ve been sharing.
Time can`t erase, the memory of
these magic moments, filled with love.

The telephone call that tied up the line
for hours and hours.
The Saturday Dance I got up the nerves
to send you some flowers.

Magic moments, when two hearts are caring.
Magic moments, memories we`ve been sharing.
Time can`t erase, the memory of
these magic moments, filled with love.

The way that we cheered on one of our team
for scoring a touch-down.
The time when the floor fell out of my car,
when I put the clutch down.

The petty arcade, the games that we played,
the fun and the prizes.
The Halloween Hop, when everyone came
in funny disguises.

Magic moments, filled with love. (la la la la la la)

Something's happening to me and you
lighting up the night brighter than the moon
I couldn't stop it even if we wanted to
Tell me I'm not dreaming

Uh-oh, I'm out of my depth
Struggling to breath, got to catch my breath
A little voice saying yes yes yes
I can hear the sirens screaming

When you touch me, when you hold me
I don't care, I'm in too deep

You're like a riptide dragging me away
Adrenaline kicking and my heartbeat thumping
Riptide underneath the waves
Hold on tight cause it's the start of something

Gotta love this riptide
Gotta love this riptide

Nothing ever gonna feel so fine
I finally found a little piece of paradise
It's like I'm living in a different life
The sun is always shining

See the shoreline fade from view
Treading water just me and you
There's nothing else about to do
It feels just like I'm flying

When you touch me, when you hold me
I don't care, I'm in too deep

You're like a riptide dragging me away
Adrenaline kicking and my heartbeat thumping
Riptide underneath the waves
Hold on tight cause it's the start of something

Riptide washing me away
A force so strong that I just can't fight it
Riptide, love it when you say
Feels so good, I never thought I'd find it

Can't hear it, can't see it
Invisible but you believe
This power, this feeling
God, I love the way it's taking over me
I feel it, I need it
Impossible to let it be
You know that I want it
You're the only one who's going to set me free

Riptide dragging me away
Adrenaline kicking and my heartbeat thumping
Riptide underneath the waves
Hold on tight cause it's the start of something

Riptide dragging me away
Adrenaline kicking and my heartbeat thumping
Riptide underneath the waves
Hold on tight cause it's the start of something

Riptide washing me away
A force so strong that I just can't fight it
Riptide, love it when you say
Feels so good, I never thought I'd find it

I gotta love it, riptide
I gotta love it, riptide

I can feel your force right across the floor.
Every look I take makes me want you more.
Now we're all alone and the time is right.
So don't even try telling me goodbye.

So why do you need to go when we've just begun?
We got time.
Come inside, come inside!

Stay the night.
Won't you stay the night?
I can be your lover.
Hold on tight.

Stay the night.
If you stay the night
I can be your guide to paradise.

Everybody's looking for the pot of gold.
Trouble is to find it and we still don't know.
I was never one to let the chances slip
with a boy like you at my fingertips.

So why do you wanna go when we're just getting hot?
We got time.
Come inside! Come inside!

Stay the night.
Won't you stay the night?
I can be your lover.
Hold on tight.

Stay the night.
If you stay the night
I can be your guide to paradise.

Stay the night.
Won't you stay the night?
I can be your lover.
Hold on tight.

Stay the night.
If you stay the night
I can be your guide to paradise.

But baby it's cold outside
so just make up your mind.
Baby, this is a once in a lifetime.

(I can be your lover, lover, lover, lover, lover,
stay the night, the night, the night,)

Stay the night.
Won't you stay the night?
I can be your lover.
Hold on tight.

Stay the night.
If you stay the night
I can be your guide to paradise.

Stay the night.
Won't you stay the night?
I can be your lover.
Hold on tight.

Stay the night.
If you stay the night
I can be your guide to paradise.

Baby, what a shame not a cab in sight.

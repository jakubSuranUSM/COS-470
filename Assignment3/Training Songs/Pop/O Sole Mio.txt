O Sole Mio?
O Sole mio
O Sole mio
Ha huh ha
So high give me your love, imagination
Run wild and tell me your mine,
I can never remember your name
So high give me your heart
Hey guardian angels
More light I'm falling in love
And I want to remember the way
Mother mother can't you see
Everyone's in love with me
O sole mio
So far given the light of distant ages
Sometimes I can never be sure
I can only remember today
So now given enough I'll heat the stages
How far is the mountain above
Where I wasn't a potion away
Mother mother can't you see
Everyone's in love with me
But only I know
All the people in the square
Try to act like nothings there
Oh sole mio
I was a rainbow
I was a rainbow
So now give me your love in celebration
Of life and love, of fascination
So now give me your heart
My guardian angel no
Oh no, oh ho
I was a rainbow
Mother mother, can't you see
Something's wrong inside of me
Every time I try to say the words they don't come out right
Mother mother if you please
Life has got me on my knees
I'm expecting someone's love to come and hit me blindside
Mother mother, if you care
Tell me I am unaware
Of what I'm doing to your beauty and your holy love life
Mother mother if you please
Something's wrong inside of me
Every time I try to say the words they don't come out right
And me I was a rainbow
(o sole mio) repeat chorus over following:
So high give me your love imagination
Run wild and tell me your mine, I can never remember your name
So high give me your heart hey guardian angels
More light I'm falling in love and I want to remember the way
So high give me your love, imagination
Run wild and tell me your mine, I can never remember your name
So high give me your heart hey guardian angels
More light I'm falling in love and I want to remember the way

All the things I used to do
 Don't seem to mean much anymore
 Every face and every place
 Were lost along the way
 I'm sitting here all by myself
 Looking in the mirror
 Holding an old photograph
 Oh how it used to be

 Everything comes from the heart
 I believe that it's true
 Time changes pride from the heart
 It's all from the heart

 All the words I used to say
 Don't seem to mean much anymore
 Every hurt and every word
 Were bought along the way
 I'm sitting here all by myself
 Looking out the window
 I'm playing an old record
 The same old melody

 Every word comes from the heart
 I believe that it's true
 Time mends each hurt from the heart
 It's all from the heart

 There's no need to hide inside
 The old world anymore
 You're standing here right next to me
 I turn to you and smile

 Love, it begins from the heart
 I believe that it's true
 Time mends each hurt from the heart
 I believe that it's true
 Every word comes from the heart
 I believe that it's true

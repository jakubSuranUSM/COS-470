A pair in the night, and the troubles come on, 
But you would survive, just like nobody does. 
? turning red, light cold on the bed, 
And now ? out, there's not the end. 

You are a bound, we're shopping our tea 
For magnificent drum, ?
You're making them rich, they throw you away 
The magic is gone, but you're here to stay. 

? too weak, and darkens the speech 
The walls are ? high ? love and sacrifice 

[Repeat: x5]
Oh, Henrietta, we can live on forever 
Oh, Henrietta, we can live on forever

Changes are happening
It's too late to turn back
What'cha had in mind
Turning into something
Of another kind

Changes are happening
All over the place
Feels like you were slapped
By a big hand in the face

No need to understand
It's far too late
Just let it go
Your only choice is to abdicate

Changes are happening
It's too late to turn back
Changes are happening
The surface begins to crack

What'cha had in mind
Turning into something
Of another kind
Turning into something
Of another kind

Changes

Remember when you were a kid
Playing in the yard
No friends was high enough
To stop you moving forward

It's the same situation now
Nothing can stop you, just go
Go now

Changes are happening
It's too late to turn back
Changes are happening
The surface begins to crack

What'cha had in mind
Turning into something
Of another kind
Turning into something
Of another kind

Changes

Just dream anything
You want to say
Make up the rules for the games
You choose to play

Just dream anything
You ever want to say
Make up the rules for the games
You choose to play

Changes, changes, changes
Changes are happening

Right there, right in front of your eyes
You can't pretend it was a big surprise

Changes, changes are happening
All over the place

What'cha had in mind
Turning into something
Of another kind
Turning into something
Of another kind

Changes, changes are happening
All over the place

What'cha had in mind
Turning into something
Of another kind
Turning into something
Of another kind

Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

Don't give it to me easy, make me work a little (oh woah woah woah woah)
We move aside, aside and you work the middle (oh woah woah woah woah)
That was one word to describe your ways
It's a Coca Cola bottle shape
I'm a teapot, come on, blow the kettle

I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

If you say you can't do it then you better do it (oh woah woah woah woah)
'Cause I'ma take your word, I'ma hold you to it (oh woah woah woah woah)
Soon as you start steppin' in the place
You put all of 'em other girls to shame
Now I already know who I'm leavin' with

I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

I see the trouble that you're trying to make
I see you're doing what your lips won't say
Baby, I ain't gettin' in your way, in your way

Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
So you don't have to say words to me
No, you don't have to say
Your body's tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

Tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes
Your eyes are tellin' me yes, tellin' me yes

Yeah
Your heartbeat's taking over
And there's nowhere you can go
And the love that you discover
Is finally taking hold
When it feels like the beginning
And the story will unfold
There's a time to take your chances
Don't be scared of the unknown

Oh, 'cause you can't fight it
Don't deny it
Love is stronger than each other
Show me baby
What you're gonna do, do
Love ain't gonna wait for you
Don't run, don't hide

Love ain't gonna wait for you
It's so good, it's so right
Love ain't gonna wait for you
You know when it's true
Love ain't gonna wait for you

So baby hold me bring me closer
Be the one I give my all
There's no waiting for a minute longer
To finally give your heart

You can't hide it
Don't deny it
Love is stronger than each other
Show me baby
What you're gonna do, do

Love ain't gonna wait for you
Don't run, don't hide

Love ain't gonna wait for you
It's so good, it's so right
Love ain't gonna wait for you
You know when it's true

I can't hold back what I'm thinking
Don't you tell me that I'm dreaming
You know that there's something you should do, do, do, do, do

'Cause love ain't gonna wait for you (oh)
Don't run (don't run), don't hide (don't hide)

Love ain't gonna wait for you
It's so good (so good), it's so right (so right)
Love ain't gonna wait for you (you)

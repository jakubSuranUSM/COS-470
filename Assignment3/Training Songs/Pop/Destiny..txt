Some say it's sure collision
Say it's bound to lose
But there's no danying
I'm able to choose
I know what leaves me cold and what burns me up
Now this time it's just right
I'm very sure
I call it wonder
Something hard of define
Sometimes it's thunder that strikes my senses hard
He's my destiny
And it's hard to see how I could love him more
He's my destiny
Gotta hold on me
I'm always back for more
My heart has spent time drifting back and forth in love
Just in what direction was never sure
And then he moved me quite like this
I call it wonder
Something hard to define
It's just like thunder that strikes my senses hard
He's my destiny
And it's hard to see how I could love him more
He's my destiny
Gotta hold on me
I'm always back for more
He can turn me round
Slow me down
Anytime he sees it fit to hold me back
It's enough to make me go out of my mind
He's my destiny
And it's hard to see how I could love him more
He's my destiny
Gotta hold on me
I'm always back for more
He's my destiny
And it's hard to see how I could love him more
He's my destiny
Gotta hold on me
I'm always back for more
He's my destiny
And it's hard to see how I could love him more
He's my destiny
Gotta hold on me
I'm always back for more

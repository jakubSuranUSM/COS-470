Every breath you take and every move you make 
Every bond you break, every step you take 
I'll be watchin' you 

Every single day and every word you say 
Every game you play, every night you stay 
I'll be watchin' you 

Oh, can't you see 
You belong to me 
How my poor heart aches 
With every step you take 

Every move you make and every vow you break 
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake 
I'll be watchin' you 

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace 
I dream at night, I can only see your face 
I look around but it's you I can't replace 
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace 
I keep cryin', baby, baby, please 

Oh, can't you see 
You belong to me 
How my poor heart aches 
With every step you take 

Every move you make and every vow you break 
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake 
I'll be watchin' you 
Every move you make, every step you take 
I'll be watchin' you 

I'll be watchin' you 
(Every breath you take, every move you make, 
every bond you break, every step you take) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every single day, every word you say, 
every game you play, every night you stay) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every move you make, every vow you break, 
every smile you fake, every claim you stake) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every single day, every word you say, 
every game you play, every night you stay) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every breath you take, every move you make, 
every bond you break, every step you take) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every single day, every word you say, 
every game you play, every night you stay) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every move you make, every vow you break, 
every smile you fake, every claim you stake) 
I'll be watchin' you 
(Every single day, every word you say, 
every game you play, every night you stay) 
I'll be watchin' you

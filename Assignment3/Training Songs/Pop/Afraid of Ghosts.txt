Well there’s a man
Who dips his feet in holy water
And so he throws the rest of his body in
Says it’ll take more than wading
To keep the memories fading
I’m at least up to my neck in sin
He said i’m coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
I’m gonna take what scares me the most
And turn it into something real
I try to go to the hospice every Friday
Sit in traffic, thicker than blood
Try to know a man that I never really knew
And swim away from a forty year flood
And i’m coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
I’m gonna take just what scares me the most
And turn it into something real
Sometimes she takes a little longer getting ready
To pretend there’s someone to show
Did she ever find love
Or did this town have enough
I kinda bet, she’ll never let you know
But I can tell from the caked on powdered makeup
Covering wrinkles from smoking away tears
She wants it either way
And I want so bad to say
Love yourself for once my dear
She said…
I bet she’s coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
Gonna take just what scares her the most
Turn it into something real

I’m only human, I’m out of excuses
I know it was stupid and wrong
To get close to you before I even knew it
My conscience and morals were gone

You need to know
Where my mind goes when I’m without you
I’m not myself
It’s not hard to tell when I’m around you

And I can try to fight it deep under deny
I’m loving you to death
Until I’m touching you again
You know I can’t help the feelings that I felt
I’m gonna be a mess
Until I’m touching you again
Until I’m touching you again
I’m gonna be a mess
Until I’m touching you again

Whenever we touch nothing mattered
The rush was enough to make me come alive
Now I can’t escape it
I’m hopeless, can’t take it
I need you, I need you tonight

You need to know
Where my mind goes when I’m without you
I’m not myself
It’s not hard to tell when I’m around you

And I can try to fight it deep under deny
I’m loving you to death
Until I’m touching you again
You know I can’t help the feelings that I felt
I’m gonna be a mess
Until I’m touching you again
Until I’m touching you again
I’m gonna be a mess
Until I’m touching you again

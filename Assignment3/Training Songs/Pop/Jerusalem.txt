Waiting on this empty street
Watching rivers' waves go by 
Feeling mellow, lighting a cigarette 
Silver moon floats through the night 

Eris, princess of the isles
Disperse your sparkling trace
Lead it on to the house of love 
Where the gods may turn his eyes 

To Jerusalem we pray
It's time to meet you there 
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah 
Let me know, love 
In Jerusalem, let me know

You might be the one I'm waiting for
I think we've met somewhere for sure
Chasing shadows leaves you feeling blue
This situation needs a cure

New assassins, new messiahs
Keepers of a balanced law
Strangest lovers of the fire
Which ignites the halo of our souls

Oh, in Jerusalem we pray
It's time to meet you there
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh, yeah
Let's take love

To Jerusalem we pray
It's time to meet you there
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh, yeah
Oh Jerusalem

Big yellow cadillac 
Carry me back home (carry me back home)
On glory roads of pure delight
We head out for the stars

To Jerusalem we pray
It's time to meet you there 
Let's take love to Jerusalem, oh yeah 
Rein our love

Believe me now, you're too young girl
Cherry pie and your gold curls
Growin' up like a grapevine
Wrapped around you in due time

Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away

Up, up away
Up, up away

Singing like it's a full moon (singing like it's a full moon)
Careless now that he has you (careless now that he has you)
Turns you on to the right songs (turns you on to the right songs)
Promises that you're hooked on (promises that you're hooked on)

Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away

Up, up away
Up, up away

Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia!
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away

Up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away

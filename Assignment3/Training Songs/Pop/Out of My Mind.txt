Light a candle                                   lay flowers at the door                         for those who left behind                      and the one's who've gone before
Here it comes now                                 sure as silence follows rain
The taste of you upon my lips                    the fingers in my brain
And be gentle as it kills me where I lay       who am I to resist
Who are you to fail

Got to get you out of my mind                   but I can't escape from the feeling
As I try to leave the memory behind         without you what's left to believe in

It could be so sorry                             for the way it had to go
But now I feel your presence in a way I could not know
And I wonder do you ever feel the same
In whispering darkness                          do you ever hear my name

Got to get you out of my mind                   but I can't escape from the feeling
As I try to leave the memory behind         without you what's left to belive in

(Here in the back of your mind)              (here in the back of your mind)
And how could you dare to become so close so real when you're just a ghost of me

And I've got to get you out of my mind          but I can't escape from the feeling
As I try to leave the memory behind         without you what's left to believe in

Here in the back of your mind                  deep in the back of your mind

Here in the back of your mind                 deep in the back of your mind

Deep in the back of your mind

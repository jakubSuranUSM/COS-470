Everytime we talk about the future
You run away
Why do you always see the danger
You're so afraid

I'm not the one you should fear
Cause I'll always be here
Show me how much you care
We can make it anywhere

How will I know what's on your mind this time
How will I know your love can be forever
Am I the only one that you want
Half a heart will just not do
Now it's all up to you

Baby when I feel we're getting closer
You turn around
Saying all the things we're not supposed to
You let me down

I'm not the one you should fear
Cause I'll always be here
Show me how much you care
We can make it anywhere

How will I know what's on your mind this time
How will I know your love can be forever
Am I the only one that you want
Half a heart will just not do
Now it's all up to you

I want to know what's going on
I have been waiting for so long
Tell me the reason why
You make me cry
When all I want is you
Do you remember days of joy
Can we bring back what we destroyed
Tell me the reason why
You make me cry

How will I know what's on your mind this time
How will I know your love can be forever
Am I the only one that you want
Half a heart will just not do
Now it's all up to you

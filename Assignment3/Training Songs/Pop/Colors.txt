I’ll find you and go right through walls we made
I see you, I need you every day
It’s nothing, it’s your life
I don’t know why, can’t get what I want
I keep, I keep trying
Found our way through the lost years
And now the day brings it all here

All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors, she says
See it in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you the love?

All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors, she says
Now it's in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel the love?

Do you feel the love?
Do you feel the love?

I’ve got all the love you need
I’ve got all the love you need
I'll keep it with you
I don’t have the time to wait
I don’t have the time to wait
I need to see you
Got it all under control
Got it all under control
You can’t hear me
Now it only hurts to know
Now it only hurts to know
When you don’t need me
You don’t need me

We found our way through the lost years
Now the day brings it all here

All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors, she says
See it in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel alive?

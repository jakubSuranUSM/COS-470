You're the beauty, the stranger in the grocery store
You're the highest quality hardwood door
You're the final wartime piece of bread
You once told me that you hate the shaven head

I want you so
And God must be the greatest comedian I know
To put you so far away
He put you so far away

There are "Davids" and "Janets" everywhere
There are juveniles with the blondest hair
There are cronies with their jobs and ties and cash
There are people like me - the whitest trash

I want you so
And God must be the greatest comedian I know
To put you so far away
He put you so far away

I have heard
That Jesus was a very handsome girl
If she were
I'd bet she'd look something like you now
I have heard
That some people feel the Earth is flat
But if it were
How come I don't see you anywhere
How come I don't see you any...

I want you so
And God must be the greatest comedian I know
To put you so far away
He put you so far away
I want you so
And God must be the greatest comedian I know
To put you so far away
He put you so far away

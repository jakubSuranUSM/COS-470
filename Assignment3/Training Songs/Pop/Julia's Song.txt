The means to an end
The sinful distress
Of writing down mean in this words
Vaguley I've had
So the rest of the men
Can learn bout the bees and the birds
Constraint business man you haven't got it all
Been at it to rule in your heart
Stilletos and ? may be burning your eyes
Kept you you for falling apart
Inhibit generalize
Sorted and wet
Someone advised me to die
Blowing your mind
Cause you know what you'll find
When you're looking for things in the sky
Under the influence
Rotting your nerves
Cutting us off at the base
Nearing the end is your grandmother's friend
Something to do when it wrythes
Something to do when it wrythes
Something to do when it wrythes

(VERSE 1)
Is it your alluring way?
Could you always drown the fire? 
Keep a check on all you feel 
Keep a hold on your desire 
But I feel there?s something new 
And it?s lying in your eyes 
There?s a shudder running through...
You... now I realize 

(CHORUS)
Inside turning to outside 
The feeling you can?t hide 
Is touching a high-light in your eyes 
Inside turning to outside 
It?s gonna be alright 
It?s runnin? a high for you and I 

(VERSE 2)
Like a shadow of yourself 
Like a spirit in the air 
Looking desp?rately for help 
You?ve been looking everywhere 
My heart is beating fast 
Blue eyes are locked on mine 
A vision flashes past 
Moving me in time 

(REPEAT CHORUS) 
Inside turning to outside 
The feeling you can?t hide 
Is touching a high-light in your eyes 
Inside turning to outside 
It?s gonna be alright 
It?s runnin? a high for you and I 

(MIDDLE)
And we can live in a beautiful world 
Hide away under peaceful skies 
We can survive on time and a word 
Feel the nights passing by... 

(REPEAT CHORUS) 
Inside turning to outside 
The feeling you can?t hide 
Is touching a high-light in your eyes 
Inside turning to outside 
It?s gonna be alright 
It?s runnin? a high for you and I 
(TO FADE)

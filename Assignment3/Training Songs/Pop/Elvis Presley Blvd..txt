Once long ago, all the faithful held a show
Down in Elvis Presley Blvd. on Memphis Radio
Where the hopeless held a vigil and the nameless played the charts
Where the losers lost their sorrow and the lonely left their hearts

Step on these shoes then I'll see you in hell
"Love me so tender," I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

I took a ride with my baby by my side
And the Elvis Presley Blvd. where all the faithful cried
And I saw that silent mansion and I knew that I was lost
They were selling plastic souvenirs of Elvis on the cross

Step on these shoes and I'll see you in hell
"Love me so tender," I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on

Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Down to Elvis Presley Blvd. in a one-way dead end street
And I smashed my car to pieces and I said goodbye to youth
I had all the ugly rumors and I could not face the truth

Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die
Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on

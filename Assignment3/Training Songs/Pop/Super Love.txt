Maybe this is all a little crazy
But I wanna know if you'd come run away with me
Because you are, are thinking about my love
Because I, I'm thinking about your love

And maybe it's euphoria that's talking now
But I wanna breathe you in and never breathe you out
Because you are, are thinking about my love
Because I, I'm thinking about your love

We're diamonds in the rough
The stars are made of us
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

We got that super love
We got that super love
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

They say what doesn't kill you is supposed to make you strong
But I wanna die a thousand times inside your arms
Because you are, are thinking about my love
Because I, I'm thinking about your love

And maybe you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
I'm already so far gone on what you got me on
Because you are, are thinking about my love
Because I, I'm thinking about your love

We're diamonds in the rough
The stars are made of us
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

We got that super love
We got that super love
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

(We got that super love)

They say we got our heads in the clouds, I don't mind
So forget about your lows and your highs, you're the sky
(We got that super love)
(We got that super love)

We got that super love
We got that super love
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

We got that super love
We got that super love
Nothing can bring us down down down
We got that super love

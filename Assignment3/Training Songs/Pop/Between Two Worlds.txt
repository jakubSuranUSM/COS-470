I got a dirty, dirty feelin' 
That I just can't shake 
Yeah my brain keeps burnin' 
And my body just aches 

I know a woman's body 
Is only flesh and bone 
A woman's body is 
Only flesh and bone 

How come I can't let go? 
I'm between two worlds 
I said oh yeah, I'm out of my mind 
I'm between two worlds 

There's a lot of people talkin' 
'Bout the danger zone 
There's adventure novels 
'Bout takin' to the road 

I know a woman's body 
Is only flesh and bone 
How come I can't let go 
I'm between two worlds

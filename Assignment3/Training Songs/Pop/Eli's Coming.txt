Eli's comin'
Eli's comin' (Eli's a-comin')
Well you better hide your heart, your loving heart
Eli's a-comin' and the cards say... a broken heart

Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl (hide it)
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk

Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away
From the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go though,
Eli's a-comin' (she walked but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' (she walked but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' and he's comin' to git ya
(she walked but... she walked but...)
Get down on your knees
(she walked but she never got away)

Eli's comin' (hide it, hide it, hide it)
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
(Hide it)
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk

Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go though, Eli's a-comin'
(she walked but she'll never getaway)
Eli's a-comin' (she walked but she'll never get away)
Eli's a-comin' and he's comin' to git ya
(She walked but, she walked but)
Get down on your knees
(She walked but she'll never get away)
Get down on your knees

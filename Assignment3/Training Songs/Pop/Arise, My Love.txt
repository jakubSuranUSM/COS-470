Not a word was heard at the tomb that day
Just shuffling of soldiers' feet as they guarded the grave
One day, two days, three days had passed
Could it be that Jesus breathed His last

Could it be that His Father had forsaken Him
Turned His back on His Son, despising our sin
All Hell seemed to whisper, "Just forget it, He's dead"
Then the Father looked down to His Son and said

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise, My Love

The earth trembled, and the tomb began to shake
And like lightning from Heaven, the stone was rolled away
And as dead men, the guards, they all stood there in fright
As the power of love displayed its might

Then suddenly a melody filled the air
Riding wings of wind, it was everywhere
The words all creation had been longing to hear
The sweet sound of victory, so loud and clear

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise

Sin, where are your shackles
Death, where is your sting
Hell has been defeated
The grave could not hold the King

Arise, My Love
Arise, My Love
The grave no longer has a hold on You
No more death's sting
No more suffering
Arise, arise, arise

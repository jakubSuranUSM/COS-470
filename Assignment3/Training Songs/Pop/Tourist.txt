This European air
It always warms my face
I wish I could buy some

I will bring you stories
And bleary eyed photos
Like a regular tourist

We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down 
I feel like nothing

Suitcases down our street
Are rolling once again
I roll away with them

Five days inside Zoo York
To loose myself with friends
I'm nowhere without you

We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down 
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down 
I feel like nothing

Just want to be with you my baby (x 4)

I'm counting up the cost of time
And we'll embrace our time away
We cannot save ourselves alone
Or rely on a mobile phone

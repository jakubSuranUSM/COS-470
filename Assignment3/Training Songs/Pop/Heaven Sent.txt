Your eyes are like deep wells of desire
Once in your arms I'm on fire
You were sent girl, so perfectly true
Changing my life
Now I'm a survivor

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

Late at night when the evening fire has died
There's a look in your eye
Seductive images fly

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

One day you'll see
What angels can see
Dressed in black if she comes back
I think I'll loose my mind

Tuesday she works in the library uptown
Some useful knowledge can always be found
Don't burn the library till you've read all the books
Sometimes in life you get a second look

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent

All I need to know, she's dead to me
Eyes are runnin' strange, head's drivin' me insane
All I need to say, in every way
Don't come running 'round my door, I'll kick my head into the floor

Through my vein, it's never been
Quite like what I need to be, I'll send your [?] to the sea
Maybe, you'll never know
I have been lost and found, I'll send my heart out to the hounds

Ahh
Ahh

I'm feelin' old tonight
But I won't be anymore, no, it won't be anymore
Ahhh, take me in your stride
No, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore
No, we won't be anymore, no, I won't be anymore
If I am nothing, then you are no one

Lately, we've lost control of everything you're biddin' for
You keep me down, you set the score
I've been impossible, only words are drowning out
Take your head out of the clouds

I'm feelin' old tonight
No, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore
Ahhh, take me in your stride
No, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore
No, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore
If I am nothing, then you are no one
If I am nothing, you are no one

Lost it to no one, feelings in my head
Lost it to no one, feelings in my head
Lost it to no one, feelings in my head
Lost it to no one, feelings in my head
Lost it to no one, feelings in my head

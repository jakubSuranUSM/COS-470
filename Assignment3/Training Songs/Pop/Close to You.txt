Time is never on our side
Beauty reaches for the light
From the shadow of your smile
Into my arms

There's a flower in my field you know
Holding love up like a shield
Now I know we have it sealed
Here in my heart

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

Where the stream begins to flow
A life of love that springs you know
From every word
Into my soul

Treasure buried deep inside
Turns the hands way back in time you know
Leaving all our past behind
Can we let it go?

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

We've been holding on
For things to change
The fear is gone
We've turned the page

In the book of love
And to know this love
Is to own it all 
From high above

I feel the call
Of your love
My love
I want to get close to you

Tell me you want me to
What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now

In my life
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to
I want to get close to you
I want to get close to you

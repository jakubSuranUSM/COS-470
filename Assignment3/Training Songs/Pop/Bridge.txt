I could hurl myself from wall to wall
But would you catch me should I fall
That's if you can't fall through your own
Cause you could make or break me subject to
The way you feel about this night
I must be careful lest you bite
Or can you bite?

And I've burnt every bridge that spans the water
Just for you
Now I'll never reach the other side
Oh what am I to do
Brunel's phoned my lawyer he's threatening to sue

Well another lesson for us all
But one I'm not too keen to learn
Besides this bridge is still too burnt
For you may say I've yet to find my voice
I say presented with a choice
I wouldn't change it for the world
Not for your world

And I've burnt every bridge that spans the water
Just for you
Now I'll never reach the other side
Oh what am I to do
Brunel's phoned my lawyer he's threatening to sue

Brunel's phoned my lawyer
He's threatening to sue

And I've burnt every bridge that spans the water
Just for you
Now I'll never reach the other side
Oh what am I to do
Brunel's phoned my lawyer he's threatening to sue

What am I to do, what am I to do

Well another lesson for us all
But one I'm not too keen to learn
Besides this bridge is still too burnt
For you may say I've yet to find my voice
I say presented with a choice
I wouldn't change it for the world
Not for your world

And I've burnt every bridge that spans the water
Just for you
Now I'll never reach the other side
Oh what am I to do
Brunel's phoned my lawyer he's threatening to sue

Whome else phone my lawyer
He's threatening to sue

And I've burnt every bridge that spans the water
Just for you
Now I'll never reach the other side
Oh what am I to do
Brunel's phoned my lawyer he's threatening to sue

What am I to do, what am I to do

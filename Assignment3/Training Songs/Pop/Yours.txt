Your microphone, microphone
Hits me like a bomb
Like a bomb, like a Bomb
Where ever I may roam

I may be right or wrong (wrong)
I may be on the run (run)
Maybe all alone
Like a rolling stone (stone)

Your microphone, microphone
Hits me like a bomb
Like a bomb, like a bomb
Where ever I may roam

You're my navigator
My entertainer
My instigator
The Ultimate truth teller

The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours

Your microphone, microphone
Hits me like a bomb
Like a bomb, like a bomb
Where ever I may roam

Let the idiots pass (pass)
Let the first be the last (last)
Barefoot on shards of glass
Don't ignore my ass

Your microphone, microphone
Hits me like a bomb
Like a bomb, like a bomb
Where ever I may roam

You're my navigator
My entertainer
My instigator
The Ultimate truth teller

The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours

You're my navigator
My entertainer
The hit parader
A soul invader
A fly like an aviator
You're a gladiator
Like an alligator
Inside the radiator
The ultimate truth teller

When you touch me
I feel there's nothing you could do to turn me away
And I know that
In the past you've had that luck so I should help you stay

[Chorus]
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
Loving you is the right thing to do

And I'll see it through

When I close my eyes
I think of you it takes me places that I've never seen
And the rain, it blows
You're brushing up against my skin to wash me clean

[Chorus]

And I'll see it through

I'll show you the love in my head
I'll show you the love that we have
I'll show you the love in my head
I'll show you the love that we have

[Chorus:Repeat x3]

And I'll see it through

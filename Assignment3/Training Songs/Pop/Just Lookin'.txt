There's things I want
There's things I think I want
There's things I have
There's things I wanna have
Do I want the dreams?
The ones were forced to see?

Do I want the perfect wife?
The word perfect, ain't quite right
Shopping every day, take it back the next break
They say the more you fly
The more you risk your life

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
Keeps me smiling

A house I've seen
Another could'a been
You drenched my head
And said what I said
You said that life is what you make of it
Yet most of us just fake

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
Keeps me smiling

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Ooh, I'm just looking
Keeps me trying

I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Ooh, I'm just looking
Keeps me smiling

There's things I want
There's things I think I want
There's things I have
There's things I wanna have
They say the more you fly
The more you risk your life
Well I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
Keeps me smiling

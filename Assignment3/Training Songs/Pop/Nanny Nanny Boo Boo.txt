if you ask us how we want it we'll say man to man
when you go to kiss our cheeks we're gonna put out our hands because
all night we've been talking to liars
and it's all right, just not in the style of tigers
and if you ask us what we're doin we'll
"it doesn't matter to you"
all you need to know is we love to see the crowd move
so turn it up
it really isn't loud enough
when we say when we know you think it's too much
so what?

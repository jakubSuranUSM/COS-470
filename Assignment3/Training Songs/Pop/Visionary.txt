I'm looking for a visionary
Someone just exactly like you
I'm looking for a visionary
Someone just exactly like you

You killed the superstars
The superstars of punk
You fed the demons inside
Strung out on lies
Strung out on junk

I'm looking for a visionary
Because I guess I want somebody
We all need somebody
Looking for a visionary
And that savior is you

Is it nice to be the one with the eyes
And lead us all astray
Always proud keep our knees to the ground
I'll be your whore, I'll give you more

I'm looking for a visionary
Because I guess I want somebody
We all need somebody
Looking for a visionary
And that savior is you

The abyss is all it is
It's the smell of the trash
Turned to ash in a flash
Well it happened so fast

I'm looking for a visionary
Someone just exactly like you
I'm looking for a visionary
Someone just exactly like you
Because I guess I want somebody
We all need somebody
Looking for a visionary
And that savior is you

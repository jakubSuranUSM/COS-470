Well outside the rain falls down
And there's a pool of mirrored streetlights on the ground
And it's the evening after the night before
When my mind is knocking on my door
But I'm pretty sure there's nobody at home.

And I'm trying to leave everything
That I used to do
Trying to save something I can use.

Chorus:
And Out There the sun is shining
And Out There they won't know your name
And Out there you get by without lying
And Out There you won't feel the same.

We're talking 'round in circles
Every day of the week
And I know you're trying to help
But I just turn the other cheek

And I'm taking my own pulse
Taking the pressure of my blood
But I can't find my own heartbeat
And I'd change it if I could.

Chorus

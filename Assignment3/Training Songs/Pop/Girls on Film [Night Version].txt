See them walking hand in hand 
Across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out 
Are so bright
And walk right out to the four line track
There's a camera rolling on her back
On her back
And I sense the rhythms humming in a frenzy 
All the way down her spine

Girls on Film

Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
In miles of sharp blue water coming in 
Where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling Dolly by the hair
By the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here 
As she goes under again

Wider, baby, smiling and you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close
I'm holding bright, holding tight
Give me shudders with a whisper,
Take me high 'til I'm shooting a star

Girls on Film (she's more than a lady)
Girls on Film
Girls on Film (see you together)
Girls on Film
Girls on Film (see you later)

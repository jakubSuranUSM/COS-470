Pop pop pop bottles 
Pop bottles 
In the… in the… in the… in the club 
Pop pop pop bottles in the club 

Had a few hits now we changed the game 
Itch gets crazy when he gets to fame 
Different city every night but it’s all the same 
Everywhere I go people know my name 
Bring champagne, you could hold the glasses 
What we don’t drink, we spray to masses 
And if you can’t keep up your ass is useless 
‘Cause all we do is 

Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we hit the plane 
Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we… then we… then we 
Big bad motherfucker 

Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we hit the plane 
Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we hit the plane 
 
Tom in the club like who that that? 
I’mma break it down, how you do that that? 
Couple ball shots, won’t you move that back? 
Skinny pockets on slow cuz the moola fat 
Big bad, we on top 
Live life like a green light, we don’t stop 
Grow our own tree, baby we got prop 
Yea, we got this club on lock 

The club is really velvet and I’m drinking something big 
Alright… big, alright… 
All these ladies come around, watch me break it down 
All night, all night 

Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we hit the plane 
Pop bottles, make it rain 
Every night it’s all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party, then we… 

Now put your hands in the sky if you wanna get drunk tonight 
And wave em side to side if you love the sound 
Now put your hands in the sky if you wanna get drunk tonight 
And wave em side to side if wanna get down 

The club is still jumping, jumping, jumping 
Say what? The music’s really bumpin bumpin bumpin 
Nobody’s scared of jumping jumping jumping 

Pop bottles, make it make it rain rain 
It’s all the same, every night is all the same 
Pop bottles, make it make it rain rain 
Every night is all the same 
Hit the club, hit the after-party then we then we then we then we 
Big bad motherfucker 
I bring it down like 
Let’s go! 
Go go go go go 
Go go go go go 
I bring it down like

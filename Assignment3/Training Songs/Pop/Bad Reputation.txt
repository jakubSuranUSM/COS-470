New girl in school, she looks cool
Cool enough to cool you down like a summer vacation
She sleeps around, so they say
So do they of course but
She's got a bad reputation
Reputation
Reputation

They say you've got a bad reputation
But I say it's their imagination
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh
They say you get off on frustration
But I know you've got an explanation
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

She's got it bad, got it bad all right
But I've got it worse for her and her bad reputation

They say you've got a bad reputation
But I say it's their imagination
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh
They say you get off on frustration
But I know you've got an explanation
You're an angel
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

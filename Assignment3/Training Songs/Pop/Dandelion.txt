All my life I thought
I was the one to save the world
It would come easy, now I'm old enough
To sit around and piss and moan instead

Save a tree and I will gladly admire
Its beauty, ten to twelve inches
Don't expect that I will get out
Of my chair to see it grow

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to weed

Those are people with them votes
And all them hippie thoughts
They do it better, if I got involved
I'd only get in everybody's way

Shine my shoe and I won't say a thing
Behind your back, yeah, we're all brothers
Don't expect that I will share my plate
When your ribs start to show

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to

Dandelion, dandelion
Souls of you and me
How can you smell so bad
But look so pretty?

And I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and

I was a blooming flower
Blossoming from the seed
And I was a blooming flower
Turn my back and turn to

Turn my back and turn to
Turn my back and turn to weed

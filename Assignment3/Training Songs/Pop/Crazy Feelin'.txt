I love you so you'll never know 
Don't ever stop believing 
Out of out minds time after time 
It's such a crazy feelin' 

Feelin' good feelin' high 
Feel so free I want to fly 
Feel the sun feel the ground 
Feel it just go round and round 

I want to stay day after day 
And just a little longer 
You close to me I gotta be 
You know the love gets stronger 

Oh turnin' like a wheel 
Changin' it to real 
Whenever we are one 
It's true it's always me and you 
Through any kinda weather

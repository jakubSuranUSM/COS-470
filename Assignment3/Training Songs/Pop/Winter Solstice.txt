We fell from a dying tree
We wait for it to leave
I wanna be, I wanna be 
Leave ashes for borrowed instruments and borrowed hearts
We will pass them on to every saint and dead lover
I have *mine God to give me my ?

Sons and daughters, 
May you kill what my blind heart could not
Sons and daughters, 
May you kill what my blind heart could not
Sons and daughters, 
May you kill 

I saw your grandfather's death on the news
Remembered when you took me me to your room
You put your hand over your chest
So that the fire would rage

Whoa I,
I put my hand over my chest, sons and daughters
I put my hand over my chest, sons and daughters
I put my hand over my chest, sons and daughters
So that the fire would rage

Yeah, you know better ways to fall
Yeah, you know better ways to fall
You know better ways to fall
You knock me down, knock me down
Put my cold hand over my cold heart
Turn the fire and die whoa
Turn the fire and die whoa
Turn the fire to die

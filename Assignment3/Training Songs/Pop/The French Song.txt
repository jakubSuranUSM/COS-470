Don't you be nervous baby
I didn't come to bring you down
This is so natural baby
Just let my love turn you around
This twisted love affair
Could really take us somewhere
J'aime faire I'amour sur tout a trois
J'aime faire I'amour sur tout a trois
Don't you feel guilty baby
I won't take long to understand
Don't waste time arguing

We'll make the most with what's at hand 
I have to laugh out loud
When you say three's a crowd
I know what I am, I am what I am
I know what I am
I know what I am, I am what I am
I know what I am, I know what I am, I am what I am
I know what I am, I am what I am
Don't think that I'm uncouth, I only speak the truth
J'aime faire I'amour sur tout a trois
J'aime faire I'amour sur tout a trois

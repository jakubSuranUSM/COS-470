I can see the difference, a difference over me
There's something that has happened
No more cold defeat
There's another dawning, a tremor where we stood
They said I would never, I said that I would
That I would do something good
That I would do something better
Hey ey yeah
That I would do something, something, something, oh
I know it's a higher love, 
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough, 
I know this is it for us
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough

Didn't mean to be so distant, 
So callous and so cruel, 
Never meant to make you worry
Never meant to act the fool
There's another dawning, a tremor where we stood
When they said I would never, you said that I would
That I would do something good
That I would do something better
Hey ey yeah
That I would do something, something, something, oh
I know it's a higher love, 
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough, 
I know this is it for us
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough

I know that another will change, another will change
I know that the blood's still pumping through my veins
I know that the slower it fades, the slower it fades
I know when another will change, another will stay
I know that the blood's still pumping through my veins
I know that the blood's still pumping through my veins

I know it's a higher love, 
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough, 
I know this is it for us
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough 

I know it's a higher love, 
They say we don't know enough
They say we don't know enough
Well I know enough, for the both of us
I know enough for the both of us
I know enough for the both of us
I know enough for the both of us
I know

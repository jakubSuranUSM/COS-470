Rain pours down over a city
Night has fallen like a stone
Are you gone or are you with me?
In my heart I'll never know
If I close my eyes I'll see you
Hear your footsteps in the rain
In my dream I'll never find you
but I'll hear you call my name

As I tread through crowds of people
Trying to keep from looking back
Got your sense on something passing
And it sends me off my track

Do I find you will I follow
To forever and a day
I can feel you in the distance
But you seem so far away

What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
What about all the things I just don't don't know (ooh)
What if I just can't find my way back home (ooh)
Would you be there to show me where to go (ooh)

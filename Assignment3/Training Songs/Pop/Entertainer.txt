I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand 
Another serenader and another longhaired band 
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts 
But I know the game, you'll forget my name 
And I won't be here in another year 
If I don't stay on the charts 

I am the entertainer and I've had to pay my price 
The things I did not know at first 
I learned by doing twice 
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say 
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants 
And I rub my neck and I write em a check 
And they go their merry way 

I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs 
I'd like to spend a day or two but I can't stay that long 
I got to meet expenses ,I got to stay in line 
Got to get those fees to the agencies 
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay 
So I just don't have the time 

I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show 
You've heard my latest record spin on the radio 
It took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life 
***>>***
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit 
So they cut it down to 3:05 

I am the entertainer, the idol of my age 
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage 
You see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines 
But if I go cold, I won't get sold 
I get put in the back in the discount rack 
Like another can of beans 

I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand 
Another serenader and another longhaired band 
Today I am your champion, 
I may have won your hearts 
But I knew the game, you'll forget my name 
I won't be here in another year 
If I don't stay on the charts.

So welcome to the real world
Where there's nowhere to hide
From the pain and hurt, 
You've got to take it in stride
You say you've got your big problems,
Baby, join the club
You won't find the solutions with a gun or a drug

Inner revolution, shake it up baby
There's something in your life you don't like,
You got the power to change it
You can't fix it with a drug, can't kill it with a gun
Inner revolution, that's the way it's done

So welcome to the real world
Full of pain and hurt
Where there's a million excuses, 
And you know what they're worth
You say you've got your big problems
Like everybody else 
You won't find any answers until you find yourself

Inner revolution, shake it up baby
There's something in your life you don't like,
You got the power to change it
You can't fix it with a drug, can't kill it with a gun
Inner revolution, that's the way it's done

When you face yourself; and you look inside
You see there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Inner revolution
You've got to shake up your life
You've got to make it work out
Inner revolution, you've got to do it yourself

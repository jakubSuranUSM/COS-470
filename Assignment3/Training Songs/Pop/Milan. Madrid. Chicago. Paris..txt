Milan, oh! madrid, chicago, paris
I searched and I searched again

I turned around to see if you were looking back
I saw your eyes and fell in love
I cought a glance of heaven but was thrown away
So now my quest is search the world for you

Milan, oh! madrid, chicago, paris
I search all over the world for you
Havana, berlin, hawaii, brasil
I search and I search again

My hope was running dry then finally one day
I saw a face I've seen before
You smiled at me but said
I really care, I do
But in love and married to another man

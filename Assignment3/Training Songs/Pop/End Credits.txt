Hey, you're not at home 
Or never answer 
Pick up your telephone 

Stop this teenage movie we've lived 
Stop this teenage movie, you dig? 

I'm ready to roll the end credits 

Ready for the curtain call 

You think you're blowing me off 
Well, maybe you are 
Maybe I say sour grapes 
I still never want to see you again 

Stop this teenage movie we've been in 
Stop this teenage movie, you dig? 

I'm ready to roll the end credits 

Ready for the curtain call 

End credits

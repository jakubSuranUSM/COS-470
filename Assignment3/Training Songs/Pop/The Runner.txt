How many times have I felt down inside? 
The Need to be loved by you! 
I wanted to show you how good it could be, 
If you would only show a little interest in me. 

You came into my life and turned my head around 
And just as quickly you put me down, 
Now you don't wanna know what I'm going through 
'Cause just like I said, it means nothing to you!

Oh, oh, oh

I've got this need eating away at my soul 
An insurmountable need that I just can't control 
You created this fire, when the flame got too hot 
You turned and walked away, just leaving me on the spot! 
Yes you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of

Oh, oh, oh

Fire!
Fire!

There's little hope but the fool that I am, 
Still holding on to this dream of a man 
The taste of his skin, the gentle touch of his hand 
Is worth waiting for, so I must understand. 

But you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of

But you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of!

But you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of!

I've got this need eating away at my soul, 
An insurmountable need that I just can't control! 
You created this fire, when the flame got too hot 
You turned and walked away, just leaving me on the spot! 
Yes you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of

Oh, oh, oh

He's a runner, he's a runner 

Running away, running away, running away 
He's a runner, just running away! 

He's a runner, he's a runner. 
He's a runner, he's a runner.

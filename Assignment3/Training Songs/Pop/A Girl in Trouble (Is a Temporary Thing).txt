She's got a face that shows that she knows she's heard every line
Tenderly she talks on the phone
There's a way to walk that says "stay away"
And a time to go around the long way

A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)

There's a time when every girl learns 
To use her head
Tears will be saved 
Till they're better spent
There's no time for her to be afraid
So instead 
She takes care of business 
Keeps a cool head

A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)

She's got a face that shows that she knows she's heard every line
Tenderly she talks on the phone
There's a way to walk that says "stay away"
And a time to go around the long way

A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing 
(temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary)
A girl in trouble is a temporary thing

There''s a whole lot of lo-ovin'' goin'' o-o-on in-i my hear-eart
It''s a fee-eelin'' I''m feelin'' through and throu-ou-ough
There''s a whole lot of missin'' everytime we''re apart
There''s a whole lot of lovin'' just for you

Bigger than the Mississippi River near the ocean (love for you)
Brighter than the desert and the Utah sky (it''s for you)
Stronger than the dynamo''s of Hoover Dam in motion
You supply the reason why-y

There''s a whole lot of lovin'' goin'' on in my heart
It''s a fee-eelin'' I''m feelin'' through and throu-ou-ough
There''s a whole lot of missin'' everytime we''re apart
There''s a whole lot of lovin'' just for you

Warmer than the sun that warms the corners of Kentucky
Taller than a California Redwood tree
Richer than a forty-niner miner strikin'' lucky
He was never rich as me-ee

There''s a whole lot of lovin'' goin'' on in my heart
It''s a fee-eelin'' I''m feelin'' through and throu-ou-ough
There''s a whole lot of missin'' everytime we''re apart
There''s a who-ole lot of lovin'' just for you

Like a highway that goes on and on
And never ends
Like a fire that glows on and on
And it never e-e-e-ends

There''s a whole (whole lot of) lot of lovin'' (lovin'' goin'') 
Goin on in my heart (lovin'' goin'' on)
It''s a fee-eelin'' I''m feelin'' through and throu-ou-ough, (oh yes I feel it)
There''s a whole lot (whole lot of) of missin'' (lot of missin'')
Everytime we''re apart (everytime we''re apart)
There''s a whole lot of lovin'' just for you-ou-ou
There''s a whole lot o'' lovin'' - just for - you ...

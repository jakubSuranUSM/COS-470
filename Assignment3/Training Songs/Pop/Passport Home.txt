I just stepped off the train
Dodging the evening rain
These days just ain't the same without you, lady
Right now my feet are wet
And they don't know the steps
Or maybe they regret me leaving, lady

You're my passport home
My guiding light
My hand to hold
Oh, don't you know that you're my passport home
Without you close I can't go on
So, darling, keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on

I step back on the stage
The people call my name
These crowds just ain't the same without you, lady
And though they sing along I'd rather hear your song again, again

Oh, don't you know that you're my passport home
My guiding light
My hand to hold
Oh, don't you know that you're my passport home
Without you close I can't go on

You're the only one who knows every weakness I've exposed
And I can't believe you chose to see this through
You're the picture in my heart and I loved you from the start
That's the reason I keep coming back to you

So, darling, keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
Keep the light on
You're my passport home
Without you close I can't go on

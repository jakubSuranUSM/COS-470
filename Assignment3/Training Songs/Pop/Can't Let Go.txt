I think of the two of us
And how we both came to trust
In each other and how we both have grown

Suddenly you're afraid
And letting it slip away
Just you remember we're
We're a very special love

Can't let go, can't let go
You and me is all I know
It took a lot of love to
Get us to this place

Can't let go, can't let go
I just keep holdin' on
Tell this impatient heart
This is no mistake

So much for promises
And what you think love is
Maybe time will find you what you need

Slow down
Things go through change
And pleasure can come from pain
Here's a memory
Of where we both belong

Didn't it work
For us so long?
Together we'll find
What's gone

Can't let go, can't let go
You and me is all I know
It took a lot of love to
Get us to this place

Can't let go, can't let go
I just keep holdin' on
Tell this impatient heart
This is no mistake

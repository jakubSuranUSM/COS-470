Tell me the story of the boy who lived in hell
Trapped in silence
No-one there to keep him sane
Clandestine pain
Total absence
Coming back from the dead
Into a world of sorrow 
Making no sense
Hear the voices in his head, see through his eyes 

pass through the gate of the banished citadel
No turning backwards
Pray for mercy, to be free, an unchained soul
Disembodied
When are you coming home?
You've been away too long
Too far you've wandered
Through the shadows and the dark depths of your mind

I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating
I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating
I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating
I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating

Beneath the arches of a cold and distant sky
Held in rapture
Infinite number , I am left to wonder why
Forever after
Through the darkest days of doubt 
Your soul denied these warnings 
Took no notice
Disbelieving with the end in clearest sight

I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating
I'm still breathing , my heart's still beating

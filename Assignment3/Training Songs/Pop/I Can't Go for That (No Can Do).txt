Easy, ready, willing, overtime
Where does it stop
Where do you dare me
To draw the line
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say no go

Yeah, I 'll do anything
That you want me to do
And I'll do almost anything
That you want me too, ooh

Yeah but I can't go for that no (no can do)
I can't go for that no (no can do)

I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that

I can go for being twice as nice
I can go for just repeating
The same old lines
Use the body
Now you want my soul
Ooh, forget about it
Now say no go

Yeah I, I'll do anything
That you want me to do

That you want me to do

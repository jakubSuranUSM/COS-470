I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too
I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too

You left me in the worst way
I'm scarred and I'm tear stained
And when you know I'm hurting
Put my heart out, it was yours to break

And I'm running out of time to heal the pain that you're causing me
And I know you've been on my mind
I can't make you mine can't you see

I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too
I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too
Need you

I need
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need
I need you
I need your fire
I need you
You-ou-ou

Yeah we be together
Is it gonna change
Or will you feel the same, forever
You were the one in love
It's done, you can't understand what it was like
And I wonder why

I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too
I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too

I need
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need
I need you
I need

I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too
I need you
But you don't want me, don't want me too

Ooh ooh ooh
Got me in your fire
I need you-ou-ou-ou
Need you

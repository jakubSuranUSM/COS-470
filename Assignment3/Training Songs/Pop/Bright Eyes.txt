Is it a kind of drea-eam?
Floating out of the ti-hide
Following a river of death down stream
Or is it a dream?

There's a sparkle on the hori-izon
A strange glow in the sky-hy
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean
Oh-oh is it a dream?

Bri-ight eyes, burning like fire
Bri-ight eyes, how can you close and fail
How could a light that burns so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale, bri-ight eyes

Is it a kind of sha-adow
Reaching into the ni-hight
Wandering all over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?

There's a hi-igh wind in the tree-ees
A called sound in the air-hair
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh-oh into the dark

Bri-ight eyes, burning like fire
Bri-ight eyes, how can you close and fail
How could a light that burns so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale, bri-ight eyes

Bri-ight eyes, burning like fire
Bri-ight eyes, how can you close and fail
How could a light that burns so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale, bri-ight eyes

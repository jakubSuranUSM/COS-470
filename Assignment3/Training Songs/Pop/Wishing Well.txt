I go to that wishing well
Stand looking down
So many thoughts cloud my brain
As I think about their lives
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do

Each time I leave that wishing well
Because I'm not afraid to dream
I hold my head up high
I'm not afraid to cry
I think of all the things I'd do
If wishes could come true

(only wishes don't come true)
If only there were peace on Earth
If only justice walked in blue
(only wishes don't come true)
If only everybody cared
If only we could never say never:
(only wishes don't come true)
I think of all the things I'd do
If only we could work together
If wishes could come true

Each time I leave that wishing well
I hold my head up high
I've got a thousand wishes
And I'm not afraid to try
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do
I tossed a penny in the well
A useless gesture, just as well
I watched it fall

A penny for your thoughts -
Do you care at all?

I think of all the things I'd do
If wishes could come true

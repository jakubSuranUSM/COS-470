I'm gonna ride out this love wave
Breaking in my mind

Caroline
Calling out loud I say wait
I want to know where I'm going

Is it too late
For my love to be ever showing?
Is it too late
For my love to be ever growing?
Is it too late?

Hold it
Caroline I'm fading I'm fading I'm fading I'm fading
Away from love
Hold it
Caroline I'm breaking I'm breaking I'm breaking
Away from love

Is it having the pain
That doubles the heart
Or is it having the heart
That doubles the pain

All the signs say
It's having the heart
Yes, it's having the heart
That doubles the pain

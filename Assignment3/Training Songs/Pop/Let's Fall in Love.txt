And if there's no tomorrow
Don't live in all your sorrow
On your own
Don't make it so hard

And never stop believing
I know it's just a feeling
Can't you tell
It's just your foolish heart

Take a chance
Give it all
You know I won't let you fall
And if I stay
I won't mind at all

Let's fall, let's fall in love
Oh oh oh
Let's fall, let's fall in love
I will be yours 
You will be mine
Let's fall in love

Whenever you are calling
When all you need is holding
Talk to me
I won't let you fall

And if it's all confusion
There's only one solution
Oh oh oh
Just fall in love

Take a chance
Give it all
You know I won't let you fall
And if I stay
I won't mind at all

Let's fall, let's fall in love
Oh oh oh
Let's fall, let's fall in love
I will be yours 
You will be mine
Let's fall in love

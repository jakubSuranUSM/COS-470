I killed Sara V.
Rest in peace. We loved her dearly.
I woke up, and there was she,
Standing low and limp before me.
And I reached to find a breath,
My fingertips along her chest.
Her lingerie on the floor, defibrillator
Hardened kiss, her lip gloss sweet.

So long sweet Sara V.
So long sweet Sara V.
Please exorcise me
Please, please exorcise me

I woke up on a Saturday night
Didn't feel like trying, but I missed the real life
Sippin' on caffeine, wakin' at 5
Working 9 to 9, and whinin' about
My bank account going down by the minute.
With the suits on bank
I hoped to see me thrive.

And not too long 'till I find myself
Gettin' high with strangers, takin' a trip to
Heaven with a bottle of gin in hand,
Hopin' high would help me swallow everything.
I lose myself with your body beside me,
Lying lifeless, helpless, heaven help us.
Hope for the boys on the lower east side,
Throwin' back their hearts on the lifeline
Makin' a dime.

So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long.

And the girls undressed on the high street
Callin' it quits just to get a little bit.
And I hope someday you and I will find the life
through the world in the suburbs, there we hide.

So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long.

Take a little breath, take a little breath
Everybody knows we can't go down from here.
And the kids in the wilderness
Never been stopped by the cops for the color of their skin
And I think too bad, nearly everyone who can
Buy my record has the money to keep themselves
From knowing that the truth is that you get rich and
Everyone else just lies beneath you

So long Sara V.
So long.

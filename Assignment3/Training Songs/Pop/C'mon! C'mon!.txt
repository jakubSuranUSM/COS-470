We stand here trapped and so angry
These walls are crumblin' down around me
We've never got any money
It never seems to be around anymore
So c'mon, c'mon release me baby
Only if you could
C'mon, c'mon relieve me darlin'
This boy ain't what he should be tonight
This is no big-big moment
Can't see a second chance
They'd even stop us from dancing
And try and end our romance
The emptiness that surrounds me
This inner city decay
It doesn't stop me from waiting
To love our life our own way
So c'mon, c'mon release me baby
Only if you could
C'mon, c'mon relieve me darlin'
This boy ain't what he should be tonight
This boy ain't what he should be tonight
This boy ain't what he should be tonight
Together we fight
We'll make it tonight
The same the whole world over
No love to save our souls
Some people think it's funny
Already reached their goals
Praching Victorian values
Now in this day and age
No wonder we're still angry
We can't contain our rage anymore
Obe diama
Obe denusu
C'mon, c'mon release me baby
C'mon, c'mon relieve me darlin'
This boy ain't what he should be tonight

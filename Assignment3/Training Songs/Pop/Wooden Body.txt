When I rest my chest
On this wooden body,
Feel my soul pore through my moth
So that everyone can hear it
Come out.

That's when I know what it is about,
That's when I realize
How coincident made me find this one thing inside of me

Aiaha, aiaha

That's when I know what it is about,
That's when I realize
Realize, realize

When I rest my chest
On this wooden body,
Feel my soul pore through my mouth
So that everyone can hear it
Come out, Come out

That's when I know what it is about,
That's when I realize
Realize, realize

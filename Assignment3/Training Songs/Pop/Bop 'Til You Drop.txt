Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on working day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Burn the candle, burn it bright
Love will have to wait

You wake up wired and draw on your makeup
And the city breathes
And the city jumps to life
Lately it seems
Your time is all used up
Chasing dreams
Of money and the good life

But there is something you've been thinking of
Lately you're feeling the power of love
Everybody says it's so hard to hold
The alarm rings
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on working day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
'Til you sit pretty
Burn the candle, burn it bright
Love will have to wait

People say you're the lucky one
But you don't believe it
And you want to stop
And you want to take some time
To suss out a feeling and look for a reason
And the flesh is weak
But the spirit is willing

'Cause there is something you've been thinking of
Lately you're feeling the power of love
Everybody says it's so, so hard to hold
The alarm rings
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city
Keep on working day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
'Til you sit pretty
Burn the candle, burn it bright
Love won't, love won't wait

There is something you've been thinking of
Lately you're feeling the power of love
Everybody says it's so hard to hold
The alarm rings 
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop 
In the hot city 
Keep on working day and night

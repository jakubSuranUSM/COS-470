You’ve always been my alter ego 
I’ve always been your toy ! 
I always like to be where you go 
But you’re a free-living boy 

Ooh, you’re passing by 
But I ain’t gonna cry ! 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart beats with someone else 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart beats with someone else 
Your heart is with someone else 

I’ve never wanted to possess you 
You’ve never asked me to! 
It’s just that I’ve been getting into 
All of the things we do 

Ooh, you’re passing by, 
But I ain’t gonna cry 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart beats with someone else 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart beats with someone else 
Ooh your heart is with someone else 

Ooh, I’m breaking out 
cos I ‘ve changed my mind 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart beats with someone else 

I’d rather sleep alone 
Than feel that there’s no one home 
You tell me that I’m the best 
But your heart is with someone else 
Ooh your heart is with someone else

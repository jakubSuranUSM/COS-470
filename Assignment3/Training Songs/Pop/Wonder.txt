I used to wonder how it'd feel like
I looked to everyone for answers
Chasing round and down in circles, on purpose
In search of something
I spent a while trying to learn somehow
Some missing pieces will not stop me
I tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats, so fleeting, but cold feet
Iâ€™m sorry

And I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to clear my head when all I think about is you
But I'm only human
I found out, I know now

I still wonder how I'd have turned out
If I'd done everything I wanted
If I had lived like I feel like I could've, or should've
And I was younger
But I'm good now, I found out

That I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to catch my breath when all I'm breathing for is you

I can't keep holding down
But you keep showing me how
If you're only human
Oh, I think I found out, whoa
I think I know now

I used to wonder what love is
But ever since you've been around
I finally think I have it figured out, what I missed then
But see now, I found out
I know now

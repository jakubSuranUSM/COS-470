You better watch your step
You must be on your guard and take it slow
And promise me be careful of what you do
I know you're strong
I know you'll make it on your own without my help
But please make sure you won't be by yourself

Everytime I hear my song on the radio
I keep moving closer and closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side all night long

You gotta try much harder
Take it from the start and try again
You gotta be much faster if you can
You probably will fail
No matter how you try it's not enough
It takes so much to make it to the top

Everytime I hear my song on the radio
I keep moving closer and closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side all night long

Let's go down
To the dance floor if you dare
Now's the time
To show that you're not scared

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, my chocolate, my cigarette
I feel sick got to medicate myself

I want your love don't try to stop me
Can't get enough, still hanging on me
Your guilty heart don't let it break you
And if you pray well no one's gonna save you

I gave you all that you feel and everything you hold dear
If you feel broken and
You are the sun and the light you are the freedom I fight
God will do nothing to stop
The origin is you
You're the origin of love

Love is a drug and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, like chocolate, like cigarette
I'm feeling sick got to medicate myself

Well if god is a priest and the devil is hell
There's a reason for love
Like every word that you preach like every
Thing that you teach
And every rule that you breach
You know the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

Used to be Adam and Eve they found their love in a tree
God didn't think they deserved it
He taught them hate taught them pride
Gave them a leaf made them hide
Switched their stories aside
You know the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

Some love is pain, some love is a candy cane
Tastes so sweet but leave you feel sick pain
Your love is air I breathe it in and out dear
You're always there

Love, you're the origin of love
You're the origin of love
You're the origin of love love love love

Thank god that you found me
Thank god that you found me
Thank god that you found me

From the air I breathe to the love I need
Only thing I know is that you're the origin of love
From the god above to the one I love
Only thing that's true the origin is you

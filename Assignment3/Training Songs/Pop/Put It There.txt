Give me your hand I'd like to shake it 
I want to show you I'm your friend. 
You'll understand if I can make it clear 
Its all that matters in the end. 

Put it there if it weighs a ton, 
That's what the father said to his younger son. 
I don't care if it weighs a ton, 
As long as you and I are here, put it there. 
Long as you and I are here, put it there. 

If there's a fight I'd like to fix it, 
I hate to see things go so wrong. 
The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions, 
Is getting lighter sing a song. 

Put it there if it weighs a ton, 
That's what the father said to his younger son. 
I don't care if it weighs a ton, 
As long as you and I are here, put it there. 
Long as you and I are here, put it there.

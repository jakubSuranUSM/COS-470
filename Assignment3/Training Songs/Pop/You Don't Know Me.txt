Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me

Oh yeah, time is money so don't f*ck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe

See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

I mean, we can throw shapes together
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up

See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na yeah

Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, f*ck yeah

Move right here, just know, though
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want
Tell you what you don't know
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" Oh no, I'm just passin'
"Do you wanna drink?" No, thanks for askin'

Ooh, na na yeah

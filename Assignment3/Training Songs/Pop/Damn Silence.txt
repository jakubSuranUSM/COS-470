Please, let me in
Feel the pulse inside
Raise the speed of the beat

Take a chance with me
A way towards something
No one knows what’s to come

And I don’t know
The right tracks for this train
This is something I can’t explain
Could you say something?

And I don’t know
The right words I should say
I never felt anything this way
Can’t you say something?
And break the goddamn silence

Why do we stay
Here in the pouring rain
We didn’t make it to the last train

And Now it’s up to you
I might be a tough call
We play the game to reach it all

I feel the heat of the night, locked in your arms so tight
And everything says it's white, oh, she's so
And then you come around, my walls come tumbling down
And if it's love that I've found, now don't say no

I'll hold on, I can't go back
I'm too far gone

(Can't stop this feeling)
Oh no, and so I follow into where you are
(Can't stop this feeling)
And it's all about me loving you

(Can't stop this feeling)
Oh no, I can't stop falling with stuff to strong
(Can't stop this feeling)
'Cause it's really in control of me
And I feel that it'll always be, oh, oh

In the beginning I tried to keep my love in sight
So many times I've cried very long
But now you touch me this way
And say the things you say
I know I've got to stay on and on and on

Here with you
There's nothing else I wanna do

(Can't stop this feeling)
Oh, no and so I follow into where you are
(Can't stop this feeling)
And it's all about me loving you

(Can't stop this feeling)
Oh no, I can't stop falling with stuff to strong
(Can't stop this feeling)
And it's really in control of me
And I feel that it'll always be, oh, yeah, yeah

I can't go back
I'm too far gone

(Can't stop this feeling)
Oh no, and so I'll follow into where you are
(Can't stop this feeling)
And it's all about me loving you

(I can't stop this feeling)
Oh no, I can't stop falling with stuff to strong
(Can't stop this feeling)
'Cause it's really in control of me, yeah

(I can't stop this feeling)
No no, no no, no no
(Can't stop this feeling)
Girl, I wanna be where you are

(Can't stop this feeling)
Too strong, I wanna be where you are
(I can't stop this feeling)
And so I follow into where you are

Can't stop this feeling
I can't stop this feeling

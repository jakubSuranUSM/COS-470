I wake up smiling every morning
Yeah, I don't mind sleeping alone
People ask me if I don't miss you
But I ain't been thinking about

All the nights we've spent together
And how your skin felt on my skin
And I'm just calling to let you know
Uh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

(You)
(I ain't been thinking about you)
(I ain't been thinking about you)

I go out every single evening
I drink a little bit too much
People ask me if I don't miss you
But I ain't been thinking about

Nights when we went out together
When it was us against the world
No, I'm just calling to let you know that
Ooh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

(You)
(I ain't been thinking about you)

I ain't been thinking about you
(I ain't been thinking about you)
I ain't been thinking about you
(I ain't been thinking about you)
(I ain't been thinking about you)

(No, I'm just calling to let you know that)
Ooh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

(I ain't been thinking about you)
I ain't been thinking about you

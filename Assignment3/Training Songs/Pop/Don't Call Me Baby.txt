Don't call me baby
When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

You said forever
And then you went and changed your plans
You said some day I'd understand
But I still wonder

I wonder why we are not walking and fighting and asking for favours
Meeting at midnight while avoiding all the neighbours
Time is a distance that you can't retract by miles
If I saw again I'd smile

But I'd say don't call me baby
When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

I think she's pretty
And I think that you have done quite well
I still say you can never tell
I wouldn't be surprised

You never know we could be walking and fighting and asking for favours
Meeting at midnight while avoiding all the neighbours
Time is a distance that you can't retract by miles
If I saw again I'd smile

But Don't call me baby
When were notnot the way we were
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

Sometimes down town I think I see you 
But I don't say a word because there is somebody new
It's too late to matter
There's no such thing as true
You're in the shadows til you left me in the dark

Don't call me
Don't call me
Don't call me

Don't call me baby
Don't call me baby
Don't call me baby
Don't call me baby

Baby
Don't call me
Baby
Don't call me
Baby
Baby

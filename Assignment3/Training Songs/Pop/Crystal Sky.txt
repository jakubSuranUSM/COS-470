I wish it would snow
Wish it would snow so we could start over
I wanna lay down
Wanna lay down in white blanket fields

This time of year’s so beautiful
I miss you more than usual
I wish it would snow
So we could wipe out where we went wrong

It’s all I ever think about when the winter comes around
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes
Now there’s falling frozen dreams as far as anyone can see
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes

I wish it would snow
Wish it would snow to cover our footprints
I wanna lay down
Wanna lay down but no lines are drawn

The glimmer in the icicles
Reminds me of how nice it was
I wish it would snow
All through the day and all through the night

It’s all I ever think about when the winter comes around
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes
Now there’s falling frozen dreams as far as anyone can see
It used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes

All I ever think about when the winter comes around
Used to be a crystal sky when I looked into your eyes

Crystal sky, crystal sky
Crystal sky

Crystal sky, crystal sky
Crystal sky

Take me out of the mood I'm in
I don't care what you do
I'm just glad that the one I'm with is you
Ooh, I don't know what I want to say
Only know how I feel
Tomorrow's more than a mile away from here

Oh, don't stop the music
I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now
No, no, no, no
Don't stop the music
I need some romance
Don't stop the music, not now

Oh, I don't know where I'm going to
I don't know that I care
It's one of those nights
When the music takes me there
Ooh, take me out of the mood I'm in
Dance me out of my mind
It's one of those nights
That I just can't leave behind

Oh, don't stop the music
I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now
No, no, no, no
Don't stop the music
I need some romance
Don't stop the music, not now

Don't stop the music
I need it to dance
Don't stop the music, not now
Don't stop the music
I need it to dance
Don't stop, not now
Don't stop, don't stop
I need it to dance
Don't stop, don't stop, not now
Don't stop the music
I need it to dance
Not now

Step to me
Let me take you for a ride
(take you for a ride)
I'll take you where you can run but you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do

I can't believe what I heard yesterday
About your boasting and lying
Whispering words you has no right to say
And now there's no use denying (yeah)
Big words and small promises
You're living in your dreams (well)
Smell the coffee 'cause it's time to wake up
Sometimes the truth can be mean

Now it's time, come prove your words to me
If you think you've got what it takes
There's no time for your insecurities
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face

Why don't you step to me
Let me take you for a ride
(take you for a ride)
I'll take you where you can run but you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do

I'm tired of hearing from your cheap talking friends
Just how you run me around
I know you boys ain't got nothing better to do
Than try to keep your girl down
Small town big attitude
Is more than just a state of your mind
But you and me belong to me and you
'Cause honesty's so hard to find

Now it's time
Come prove your words to me
If you think you've got what it takes
There's no time for your insecurities
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face

Why don't you step to me
Let me take you for a ride
(take you for a ride)
I'll take you where you can run but you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil tell the truth
Fooling yourself makes a fool out of you

Why don't you step to me
If you think you've got what it takes
I heard the rumor
About your loving well it's fake
Ch-ch-ch-check yourself
If you think I'm gonna stand for that
What do you think I am some kind of pussycat?
Chit chat to the girls and the boys you call your friends
Tell then that you never been to the place where loving ends
You never graduated from the school of love you see
So come on boy why don't you step to me?

Now it's time
Come prove your words to me
So you think you've got what it takes
There's no time for your insecurities
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face

Why don't you step to me
Let me take you for a ride
(take you for a ride)
I'll take you where you can run but you can't hide
Come on and step to me
Shame the devil and tell the truth
I can tell you don't know what to do

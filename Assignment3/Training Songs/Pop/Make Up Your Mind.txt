When I get the nerve to walk on by
They come and get me
I never told the truth, I never lied
They listened to me

All the times I laughed at her
She never said a single word to me
Cause she knew me
Well I can't waste my time

Make up your mind
I lost determination fast
I was the loser
Getting sick of finishing last

I'm always the loser
Tonight I'm gonna try
I'm gonna ask the questions why
But I... can't decide
Make up your mind

I wish I could keep you from abusing yourself for no reason at all
Counting backwards, things you've injured
Tear down them all
I guess I've realised

That’s not the way to hurt me
That’s not the way to hurt me
Show you the way to hurt me

Say it to the soft sounds from another planet
Say it to the quiet place to lay this to rest
Striving for goodness while the cruel men win
There’s no part of me left that can feel or hear

They’ll never let you hurt me
They’ll never let you hurt me
I’ll never let you hurt me
(Hurt me)

Hey
Hey sister, how ya doin'?
This is the new world calling
Learn to shed your skin
Hey now the curtain's rising
I like the dancers here
I want the show to begin
I got so crazy - buy the politics
I lost my mind some days
No longer crazy by the fortune teller
Or my mistakes along the way
Bang!
Starting over without beginning
Don't you like it that way? (O-o)
Movin' faster like a roller coaster
Don't you like it that way?
Any season, any reason
You like it that way
Ah
Hey sister, in the jungle
I heard the quicksand laugh
The one-way river lose its flow
Look for the evil
Where the monkey's played
Just build a new garden today
'Cause
You don't have to rearrange your hair
Or the clothes you wear
And you don't have to compromise anything
Your independence is here...go
Bang!
Starting over without beginning
Don't you like it that way? (o-o)
Movin' faster like a roller coaster
Don't you like it that way?
Any season, any reason
You like it that way
You try and stand in the middle baby
But the center keeps shiftin' on you
You can't decipher every riddle baby
But there's just one thing that you can do
Go bang!
Starting over without beginning
Don't you like it that way? (o-o)
Movin' faster like a roller coaster
Don't you like it that way?
Go bang!
Oh sweet dreams are made of...(o-o)
Any season
Any reason
You like it that way
Bang!

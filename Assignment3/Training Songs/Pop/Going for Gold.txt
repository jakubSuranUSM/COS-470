I never said never ever
You took the words right out of my mouth
Is the sea your sunshine have we been told?
The sea is you lifeline 
You're going for gold
You took the words right out of my mouth
Time, and time, and time again
I look to me, my only friend
Time, and time, and time again
Are you here for my pleasure
Or are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?

I never said never ever
You took the shine right out of my smile
Is the moon your night time?
Have you been sold the moon?
Is your lifeline...
You're going for gold
You took the shine right out of my smile

While my mind is blind again
I look to me, my only friend
Time, and time, and time again
Are you here for my pleasure
Or are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?

Time, and time, and time again
I look to me, my only friend
Time, and time, and time again
Are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?
Are you going for gold?

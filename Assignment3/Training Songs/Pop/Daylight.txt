Standin' in the hurricane
Just to feel the midnight rain
It won't wash away the stain left on your heart
Starin' at a liar's moon
Hypnotized by your own gloom
Prayin' that the Daylight soon will rescue you

[Chorus]
Ah, she's callin' you
When will Daylight break through
Ah, she's beggin' you
Daylight, won't you come through
Daylight
Daylight

Another night what will you do
Caught between the sun and moon
Starin' out the window, when will Daylight come
And every moment moves so slow
Every move against the flow
Close your eyes and let it go, just let it go

[Chorus: x2]

Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on

She's got a wild heart
Born to run, born to come and just save my soul
I never thought it was worth saving
She stepped into something and I wish I could feel it
But I don't know what it is and I can't quite believe it

Always listen, always listen, always listen to the same song
I wanna know, I wanna know, wanna know what you're on

I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna be gone like you're gone
I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna listen, wanna listen, wanna listen to the same song

Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on

She has a kind heart
Kind enough to take the time to come save my soul
I'm so over misbehaving
She's optimistic 'bout the future of her planet
And the smile that's on her lips, oh, it must be the Xanax

Always listen, always listen, always listen to the same song
I wanna know, I wanna know, wanna know what you're on

I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna be gone like you're gone
I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna listen, wanna listen, wanna listen to the same song

Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on

Yeah, we're standin' on the same cloud
And we're never comin' down
Yeah, we're standin' on the same cloud
No, we're never, no we're never, ever comin' down

I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna be gone like you're gone
I wanna be on what you're on
I wanna listen, wanna listen, wanna listen to the same song

Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on
Wanna be on what you're on

Miss November Tuesday
Bend your rubber rules
Take your time, but don't take
Off your high heel shoes
She's in demand at dinner time (She's in demand)
She's on the factory wall (She's on the factory wall)
And when the gentlemen retire (When they retire)

Guess who's in control?
She blew your money on taking a cruise
If that isn't funny
Well, watch out, teacher

Oh, oh, when the chamber's empty
She said: "Oh, oh, meet el Presidente."

Dress in flimsy clothing
Use your lipstick line
To cover fear and loathing
With a pink disguise
You never refuse when she lies back

Put a stripe on the union and a star on the jack
She's on the case at dinner time (At dinner time)
She's on the evening news (She's on the evening news)
And if you dare step out of line (Step out of line)

You're going to be abused
You may not like it
You may not be scared
But hell has no fury like a
Young girl's ego

Oh, oh, when the chamber's empty
She said: "Oh, oh, meet el Presidente."

You might adopt an attitude (Attitude)
Look on the moral side (Looking on the moral side)
But if police are after you (After you)

Where's the best place to hide?
For this production
They gave her a gun
Ain't no director
So watch out, actors!

Oh, oh, when the chamber's empty
She said: "Oh, oh, meet el Presidente."

Oh, oh, when the chamber's empty
She said: "Oh, oh, meet el Presidente."

You know the time to act is now do-da-do
Before the sands of time run out do-da-do
I know that I could never
Fall from grace, I'm far too clever

I will achieve my destiny do-da-do
My stars assent a certainty do-da-do
I know that I could never
Fall from grace, I'm far too clever do-do

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Boy sees, boy takes, boy hooked
And the subject's closed
Worst case scenario becomes real
It don't show

No clever clevers can dissuade do-da-do
From tougher substance I was made do-da-do
I know that I could never
Fall from grace, I'm far too clever do-do

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Boy sees, boy takes, boy hooked
And the subject's closed
Worst case scenario becomes real
It don't show
You know the time to act is now do-da-do

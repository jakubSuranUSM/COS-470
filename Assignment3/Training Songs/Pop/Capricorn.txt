Capricorn
Man of war
Honour bright
The long midnight

In the hour before
You lose your head
The thief will paint
The sunlight red

Sunlight red 
Deep blue sea
Witnessed by
Flocks of ships

As they sail by
In a tower of strength
The sabre frail
Will take the brig
And raise the sail 

Caged until tame
Go-between is the name
Scaring death to the strains of their crying
Here lies the tale
Of escapists who sail
With assassins who kill for the morning 

Don't paint the sunlight
It's virgin bright
Don't paint the sunlight
Wait 'til the morning light

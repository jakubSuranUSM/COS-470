Feeling the kiss 
Enchanted by pain 
Burned by the touch 
Immortal by flame 
Out of control 
Released of the fear 
Tempted by thought 
Invoked by the fear 

Painted with the eyes of gloom 
Glorified with fate and doom 
Masked behind the idol Christ 
Blackened thoughts beyond our sight 

Injected with poison 
Craving for more 
Induced by the body 
Evening the score 
Wet by emotion 
Slippery in vain 
Joy in destruction 
Happiness in pain 
Sensitivity extreme with lust 
Accepting every inch 
Penetrate we must 
Eternal thoughts prevail 
Deep inside my head 
Driving beats through graves to dance among the dead

Through the summer
You can breathe the air
Rest forever
Because there's nothing else
See the way the valley
Starts to grow
Every movement
Seems to be for you
I can see your future in it
I can see it there
I can see your future in it
I can see it there

I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you

And all the things you might do
And all the things you might do
And all the things you might do

I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you

Through the summer
You will soon forget
Days get longer
But the sun still sets
You're so fair while
Love is yours to choose
Life is fragile
Don't you let it go
I can see your future in it
I can see it there

I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you

And all the things you might do
And all the things you might do
And all the things you might do

I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you

The world is precious, a gift to you and me
I suggest we treat her right, with love and dignity

Everybody's looking for some peace of mind
If you seek the truth then you will surely find
Everybody wants to have global peace
Whilst the press of a button can shake the world to its knees

[Chorus]
Can you hear what I'm saying, can you hear what I'm saying

Those who say might is right, I beg to disagree
I say we all unite and redirect our destiny

Everybody's looking for a quick solution
Our longs are choking from breating in air pollution
I say put down your guns and stop the revolution
And say this time we make a restitution

[Chorus: x2]

Can you hear me now, I am calling right out for you
(Can you hear me calling out to you, can you hear me calling out to you)

There's so much starvation, so much say untruth
So much prejudice, there's so much liquidation - oh how long, how long

Can you hear what I'm saying

Africa, America, Eurasia, Latin Africa

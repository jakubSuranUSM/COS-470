I'll take your time
I've used up all of mine
Down this road
Roll down the window
It's okay, we'll just follow the shine

'Cause sometimes you just know, you know, you know
Sometimes you just go, you go, you go
When it's right, it's right, it's right
Are we a star? Are we a satellite?

I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Love, you gotta let me
I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Gotta let me

I'll be your hero
If you need someone to save you
To the bone, to the marrow
When it's cold, I will lay with you

'Cause sometimes you just know, you know, you know
Sometimes you just go, you go, you go
When it's right, it's right, it's right
Are we a star? Are we a satellite?

I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Love, you gotta let me
I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Gotta let me
Gotta let me

'Cause sometimes you just know, you know, you know
Sometimes you just go, you go, you go
When it's right, it's right, it's right
Are we a star? Are we a satellite?
Are we a satellite?
Are we a satellite?
Are we a satellite?
Are we a satellite, ay yeah, ay yeah

I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Love, you gotta let me
I could love you if you let me
But love, you gotta let me
Gotta let me

Are we a satellite?
Satellite, ay yeah
Are we a satellite?
Satellite?

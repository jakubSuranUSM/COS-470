So freely, you curse my glance
This country's not seen insults so far advanced
But me, I saw you go alone

It's easy when you're not here
I just say the right words when you're not here
But me, I saw you go home alone

But still it's you
I will defend
Until times very end

I'm at my lowest ebb
So please don't take that tone
This doesn't feel like home
You still can't find the phone

My air is getting thin
I have good cause to moan
You still can't find the phone
And I'm left here on my own

Sat in a cornfield on her own
Christina sees the day go by
Or else she locks her self away
And no one thought to ask her why
She says nothing, rather than -
be part of a world she can't believe in

There is a time and place that I'd love to share
I wish that I could be in there - in Christina's world
There is a calm over her every night and day
She seems content in her own way
That's Christina's world

I wondered if she ever thought of
All the places she's never been
I guess she took a look outside
And didn't like what she had seen
She's says nothing, rather than -
be in a world that she can't believe in

There is a time and place that I'd love to share
I wish that I could be in there
- in Christina's world
There is a calm over her every night and day
She seems content in her own way
That's Christina's world
In her world

And her eyes they're in another place
They might be in another time
As a smile lights up her face
I think that I know why
She says nothing, rather than -
be part of a world that she can't believe in

There is a time and a place that I'd love to share
I wish that I could be in there
In Christina's world
There is a calm over her every night and day
She seems content in her own way
That's Christina's world

In her world

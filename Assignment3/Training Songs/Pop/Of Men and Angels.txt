Stop the press, everything's a mess
You can look alive, but you are not at rest.
And I-ideas are flowing through your head
A million miles an hour while lying in your bed 
A lucid life you never thought you'd lead 
Are you working everyday?
Are you working just to bleed?
I know 
I know 
I know 
I know 
I know 

You're staring at the ?
The feeling you deserve what you've heard 
But it doesn't go that way

Oh, the tongues of men and angels 
I speak but lack love. 
Oh, love, will I stab you in the back?
Working everyday, 
I'm afraid I forgot to show what's most important, love

[Chorus]
Here I am, dear Lord, tasting hints of fame
And I don't want it anymore 
If it's not you that I gain
Wanna fall at your feet 
Don't wanna fall from your peace
I understand 

Have you ever been the man that just ran
When you knew that God was talking? 
Have you ever heard his voice through the noise
But just let it go away?

Oh, the tongues of men and angels 
I speak but lack love. 
Oh, love, will I stab you in the back?
How can I go with mine instead of yours
When yours is always right 
I'm sorry just pour into me love.

Here I am, dear Lord, tasting hints of fame
And I don't want it anymore 
If it's not you that I gain
Wanna fall at your feet 
Don't wanna fall from your peace
I understand

A heart at rest is harder now 
Don't let it go away
A hard earned pay, a hard earned pain
Right now they're just the same 
What's the use, why work so hard
When it's not what you crave
When what you need is: love. 

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 

Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back

I didn't come here to party
In one touch, you got me
You was treating my head cocky
Everything that you said got me
I'm not that into drinking
But with you, I'm sinking
You was treating my head faded
Every sip that I get

Came for a fight, I let you in
Under my skin
You changed my mind and I give in
And it's always the same

You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back

Like I'm on pills and potions
You took the moment
But that doesn't know you want it
Got inside of my head, you stole it
Riding on automatic
And I get so distracted
All I hear is your body talking
Every sip that I take

Came for a fight, I let you in
Under my skin
You changed my mind and I give in
And it's always the same

You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back

Make you my focus
No interruptions, oh 
Run out of options, oh
I just gotta make you mine
I just gotta make you
Gotta keep you coming right back

You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh (keep coming right back)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh (keep coming right back)
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh (keep coming right back)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh 
Your whiskey kisses all on my lips
I keep coming right back

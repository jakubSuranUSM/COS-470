We were all wounded in some domestic war 
I found you to settle my score 
You looked like father 
You felt like mother 
My mind told my heart 
There is no other 

And I gave you my soul 
And every ounce of control 
I gave you my skin 
And my original sin 
I gave you my pride and my side 
Oh my pride 

Ain't that enough 
I turned your dreams into lightning 
Ain't that enough 
I held the world back for you 

Ain't that enough 
I loved you past the point of dying 
Ain't that enough of me for you 

I was so sure one and one gave you one 
My noisy love is coming undone 
Now you leave like father 
Disappointed like mother 
And I know in my heart 
There is no other 

And I gave you my soul 
And every ounce of control 
And I gave you my shame 
And my eternal flame 
And I gave you my need and my seed 
Oh my need 

Why can't you hold on

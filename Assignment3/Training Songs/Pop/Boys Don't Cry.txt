You sit there on the couch
Sipping your scotch and ice
You turn the t.v. on
And tune me out again

So what would you say to me
If you could talk to me
You could ask anything
I wouldn't mind
But you're okay with this 
Damaging awkwardness
So I'll just play it safe
And keep it inside

Boys don't cry

I used to hold your hand
Sometimes there was no question
But now even when you're near
I've never felt so alone

So what would you say to me
If you could talk to me
You could ask anything
I wouldn't mind
But you're okay with this
Damaging awkwardness
So I'll just play it safe
And keep it inside

Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

If you'll just stand beside me
I'll keep you in my life
Tell me how much you love me
And I'll be just fine

Don't be
Afraid of me

So what would you say to me
If you could talk to me
You could ask anything
I wouldn't mind
But you're okay with this
Damaging awkwardness
So I'll just play it safe
And keep it inside

Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

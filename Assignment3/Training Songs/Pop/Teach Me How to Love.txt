I don't wanna slip
I don't wanna trip
Fallin' in love again
'Cause that's the way it's always been

I wanna get it right
It's the time of my life
Pickin' up the pieces
That I know I left behind

I can feel it coming back again
Gotta give it one more try
Givin' up is not my style, no

The more I learn, the less I know
About this thing called love
The more I touch, the less I feel
It's hard to know what's real

I'm looking up
And every time I'm blinded by the sun
Can you teach me how to love

I don't wanna drift
From the touch of your lips
Feelings that I can't deny
When I look into your eyes

What am I to do
When I'm talking to you
Words are getting kinda hard
'Cause they're coming from my heart

I can feel it coming back again
Gotta give it one more try
Giving up is not my style, no

The more I learn, the less I know
About this thing called love
The more I touch, the less I feel
It's hard to know what's real

I'm looking up
And every time I'm blinded by the sun
Can you teach me how to love

Not giving up tonight
Not giving up, made up my mind
I'm not giving up

Not giving up tonight
Not giving up, made up my mind
I get lost sometimes

Not giving up tonight
Not giving up, made up my mind
Gotta give it one more try
Givin' up is not my style, no

I can feel it
I can feel it coming back again
I can feel it
I can feel it coming back again

I'm looking up
And every time I'm blinded by the sun
Can you teach me how to love

The more I learn, the less I know
About this thing called love
The more I touch, the less I feel
It's hard to know what's real

I'm looking up
And every time I'm blinded by the sun
Can you teach me how to love

I can feel it
I can feel it coming back again
I can feel it
I can feel it coming back again

I'm looking up
And every time I'm blinded by the sun
Can you teach me how to love

How to love
How to love
Can you hear me
Oh, how to love

Mmm, how to love
Can you hear me
How to love

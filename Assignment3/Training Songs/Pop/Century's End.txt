Those trucks in the street, is it really Monday?
Time to find some trouble again
Make a bid for romance while the dollar stands a chance
Dumb love in the city at century's end

We tap to this line, dancing on a mirror
There's no disbelief to suspend
It's the dance, it's the dress, she's a concept more or less
Dumb love in the city at century's end

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game
The name of which we used to know
It might be careless rapture

This kid's got the eye, call it pirate radar
Scooping out the roof for some trend
But there's nobody new, so she zeros in on you
Dumb love in the city at century's end

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game
The name of which we used to know
By now it's second nature

Scratch the camera, we can grab the locals
Let's get to the love scene, my friend
Which means look, maybe touch but beyond that not too much
Dumb love in the city at century's end
Dumb love in the city

Love in the city at century's end
Love in the city at century's end
Love in the city at century's end

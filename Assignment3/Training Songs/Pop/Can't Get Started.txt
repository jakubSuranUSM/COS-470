Can't get started
Need a little motion
Somebody push me
And keep me movin'
Over and over, I got the feelin'
Been knocked down
And my head is reelin'
Oh baby, hard to get started again

Need a little fire
Keep me burnin'
Need a little sparkin'
To keep my whole life turnin'
Little by little, I got the notion
I'm like a ship wrecked sailor
Lost on the ocean
Oh, baby, it's hard to get started again

I got caught in a blind mans bluff
Feelin' like the odd man out
Nine below zero with nothin' to lose
Just hangin' round the corner with these dead end blues
Late night, all night, dead end blues

Can't get started
Need a little motion
Feelin' so shaky
Come on baby
Can't you hear me callin'
Over and over, it don't seem fair
Runnin' around in circles
And I'm gettin' nowhere
Oh baby, it's so hard to get started again
Over and over, I got the feelin'
Been knocked down
And my head is reelin'
Oh baby, so hard to get started again

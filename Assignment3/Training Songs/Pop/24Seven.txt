I can feel it in the air
I like the truth but love to dare
Livin' life like it's a vacation

We are golden like the sun
Never never age, we all stay young
Cause we're the here and now generation

Try and knock us down
We'll get up every time
We can run this town
So let's do what we like, do what we like

All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/Seven
All day, every day all we gotta say
Is live your life, 24/Seven
24/Seven
24/Seven

We got no one to impress
Looking fly no matter how we dress
Standing up forever 'cause there is no wind

It doesn't matter where you're from
'Cause we're all together here as one
When tomorrow comes, we'll do it all again

Try and knock us down
We'll get up every time
We can run this town
So let's do what we like, do what we like

All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/seven
All day, every day all we gotta say
Is live your life, 24/seven
All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/seven
All day, every day everybody say
Is live your life, 24/seven

24/Seven
24/Seven

All day, every day's a holiday
We don't care what other people say
All day every day's a holiday
We don't care what other people say

All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/Seven
All day, every day all we gotta say
Is live your life, 24/Seven
All day, every day is a holiday
We're alright, 24/seven
All day, every day everybody's saying
Live your life, 24/seven

Come on and sing it baby
24/seven
24/seven
Wanna sing it baby, sing it sing it baby
24/seven

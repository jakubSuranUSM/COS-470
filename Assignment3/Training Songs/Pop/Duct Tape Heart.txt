It was in pieces 'til this adhesive
Stuck it together, now it beats again
It's working alright, and it looks tight
A little miracle I'd recommend

I could use another roll, another roll
I could use another roll right now

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best won't make it fall apart
Because I'll always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
'Cause no one's ever gonna tear that thing apart

A million uses, you know the truth is
There isn't any heart that it can't fix
When you went through one, just make a new one
And make a wallet out of extra bits

I could use another roll, another roll
I could use another roll right now

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best won't make it fall apart
Because I'll always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
'Cause no one's ever gonna tear that thing apart

Polyethylene gold, pressure-sensitive tape
It's tried, it's true, nothing it can't do
Fixed the Fender on the rover that was left on the moon
It's good enough for you

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best won't make it fall apart
Because I'll always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best won't make it fall apart
Because I'll always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
You know you never ganna tear that thing apart

You can't blame it on anybody
Some things they don't last
You can't blame it on anybody
I thought I'd entertain you
Let me take you to the heart of the city
Let me misunderstand you

Fallin' down I couldn't notice
She had some glasses on
Few broken bones in the process
I try to keep my attitude

Words of love in broken English
They have a lonesome tone
Didn't understand must be Italian
Must be good looking undressed

You can't blame it on anybody
Some things they don't last
You can't blame it on anybody
I thought I'd entertain you
Let me take you to the heart of the city
Let me misunderstand you

With lil' care and lil' practice
I got to know her well
Light baritone she sings in a choir
With a bunch of guys out of tune

Day is night, right is wrong
Failure notice, I'm giving up I'm tired
Day is night, right is wrong
Love is all, love is evil
Day is night, right is wrong
Love is all, love is evil
Day is night, right is wrong
Obsolete, odd is even
Failure notice, I'm giving up I'm tired
Day is night, right is wrong
Love is all, love is evil
Day is night, right is wrong
Failure notice, I'm giving up I'm tired

You can't blame it on anybody
Some things they don't last
You can't blame it on anybody
I thought I'd entertain you
Let me take you to the heart of the city
Let me misunderstand you

I said that I'd never leave you
I said that I would never let you down
I needed a chance to prove my love to you 
Until time is through

The promises I gave you
I never meant to see them left untrue
You were my everything, I give my heart to you 
To start anew

And all of the days just pass me by
So I pray, and I'm asking why
All that I ask is one more try
Because I never want to say goodbye

[Chorus]
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I'd never be untrue
Because all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do

You're looking for another
I'm looking for a chance with you again
I guess I never showed you
What you mean to me
Can't you see

Everything I told you
And everything I did I feel was wrong
I didn't know the words I said would make you leave, please believe

And all of the days just pass me by
So I pray and I'm asking why
All that I ask is one more try
Because I never want to say goodbye

[Chorus]

If only, if only, if only, all I do
If only, if only, if only, all I do
If only, if only, if only, all I do
If only, if only, if only, all I do

If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do

[Chorus x2]

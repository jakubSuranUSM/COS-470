She works hard
Does it all without complainin'
She believes
That sacred things don't need explainin'
And the mind is elevated
Though the body, devastated
The inner life of
Sweet sacrifice, yeah
And with nothing but a needle and a knife

Only your lonely love can devour you
But when when you're lonely, the same love empowers
you, yeah

She foresees
Apocalyptic curse will open
She believes
In something she can put her hope in
it's the holiest fixation
And it's taken cultivation
A pioneer in a foreign land, yeah
She's devoted to a real good man

Only your lonely love can devour you
But when when you're lonely, the same love empowers you, yeah

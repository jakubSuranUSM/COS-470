His fire goes
Into our minds
Creating further homes
Constructing it
Without plans
Damaging the soul

Violence unfolds
It's a beautiful design
Watch the light take hold
Its a beautiful design

If a wire runs from house to house
Does it mean we are connected
Destroying it
Specific plans
All strewn about

Violence unfolds

It's a beautiful design
Watch the light take hold
Its a beautiful design

This no love is what I need
But I want to want to love
I want to want to learn
This time no love is what I need
Yeah I want to want to love
I want to want to learn

This no love is what I need
But I want to want to love
I want to want to learn
This time no love is what I need
Yeah I want to want to love
I want to want to learn

But I want to want to learn
But I want to want to learn

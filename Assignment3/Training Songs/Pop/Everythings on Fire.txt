If I don't come home before midnight
And I call out your name in the dark
You'll know that I've been tempted
And I'll know that I've got no heart
And I'll know I won't be expected
And you'll think we're drifting apart
And I might as well be blowing at the top of the world
When my fingers find your body in the dark
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
So if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
Burn the place down
Make it glow like christmas
The tenderness that's burning in my heart
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire...
If you can't open your eyes in the morning

If some maniac has been and left his mark
I'll be round to sift through the cinders
Lift the lid and take the thing apart
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire
Everything's on fire...
So to all you feelers and fumblers
Waiting for the fireworks to start
Do it now--blow it up yourself
Unbutton the butcher in your heart
And if I don't come home before midnight
And I can't find the keyhole in the dark
You'll know, you'll know that I've been tempted
You'll know, you'll know we're drifting apart
Everything's on fire (x12)

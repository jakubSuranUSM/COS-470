Get up, put my makeup on, I know it's time to go
Sing along to a dumb pop song that they play on the radio
Time for a pic, 'cause I'm all dressed up
Don't make me look too typical
'Cause I'm ready for my close-up
I said I'm ready for my close-up

One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's make a video, oh-oh
One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's make a video, oh-oh

Action, I'm ready
Don't want to miss a frame
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're down
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action

I feel at home with my microphone turned up in the studio
Always know that it's time to go when we're done with the video
Time for a pic, 'cause I'm all dressed up
Don't make me look too typical
'Cause I'm ready for my close-up
I said I'm ready for my close-up

One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's make a video, oh-oh
One, two, three; oh, c'mon, let's go
Let's make a video, oh-oh

Action, I'm ready
Don't want to miss a frame
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're down
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action

One, two, three
One, two, three
C'mon let's go, g-g-go
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, let's go
One, two, three, three, three, three, three, three, three
Let's go
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, let's go

Action, I'm ready
Don't want to miss a frame
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're down
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
Action, I'm ready

Don't want to miss a frame
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're down
Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, action

Hush, hush
Don't say a word
Don't say a word

Each day passes by in a blurry haze, like a tape that's being played at the wrong speed, can't breathe, gotta run, gotta hide, From what we need
Like a fire that burns in my heart, like a siren screaming in the dark
Like the blood that's pounding inside of me, can't let them see

All the stars, they bow their heads in shame
'Cause they know, you cannot speak my name
You cannot speak my name

Hush, hush
Don't say a word
Sound carries in the night, carries in the night
Hush, hush
Don't say a word 
Sound carries in the night, carries in the night

Wrong place wrong time still we cannot erase all the pain that we have to face, 
each and every time we decide, no we can't stop, gotta walk
Across that line
We live this lie, and it's such a waste, living in denial
It's too fast, too slow, we'll finally know, right place right time
We have to try

I refuse, to hide my head in shame
'cause for now, you cannot speak my name
You cannot speak my name

Hush, hush
Don't say a word
Sound carries in the night, carries in the night
Hush, hush
Don't say a word 
Sound carries in the night, carries in the night

Don't say a word, Don't say a word
Don't say a word
Don't say it, say it No, No, No

Hush, hush
Don't say a word
Sound carries in the night, carries, carries
Hush, hush
Don't say a word 
Sound carries in the night, carries in the night

Don't say a word, Don't say a word, Don't say a word
Don't say it, say it, say it No
Don't say a word, Don't say a word
Don't say it, say it, say it, No

Hush, hush
Don't say a word
Don't say a word

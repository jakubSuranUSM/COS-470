Don't wanna talk to you today
Don't wanna play the games you want to play
I love you baby but I just don't know
What we have, what we have to do to change

Leaving you has crossed my mind
But I'm afraid another heart is hard to find
I love you baby but I don't know why
Why our love, why it's fallen so behind

Find me a mountain or any grand canyons
Just find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you
I'll climb any tower, take any grand notion
Just find us an ocean to swim into
Anyway, if we don't find a way, I'll have to get over you

Remember on our wedding day
I went to work after I dropped off my bouquet?
We should have figured it would be this way
Oh, our love, it has never had the time

Leaving you has crossed my mind
But I'm afraid another heart is hard to find
I love you but I don't know why
Why our love, why it's fallen so behind

Find me a mountain or any grand canyons
Just find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you
I'll climb any tower, take any grand notion
Just find us an ocean to swim into
Anyway, if we don't find a way I'll have to get over you

Find me a mountain or any grand canyons
Just find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you
I'll climb any tower, take any grand notion
Just find us an ocean to swim into

Find me a mountain or any grand canyons
Find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you
I'll climb any tower, take any grand notion
Just find us an ocean to swim into
Anyway, if we don't find a way I'll have to get over you
Anyway, if I don't find a way how will I get over you
You
You

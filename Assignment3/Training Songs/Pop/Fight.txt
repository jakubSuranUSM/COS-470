I wrote this song to make you feel alright today
I wrote it to make everything alright
And I would sing it every single day if you would say we're fine

I can feel your heart is beating careful
'Cause sometimes I pretend that I don't care
I can't believe I never let you know how much I need you here

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight will be alright if you would stay

It's times I feel like you don't know me anymore
And other times I think you know me best
I could love you better but I'd never wanna love you less

So run away and I'll be runnin' next to you
I'd never let you run away alone
Before you run too far away I think that I should let you know

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight will be alright if you would stay

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight will be alright if you would stay

So put your hand in mine
We'll be fine, I know
I know it, I
If you stay tonight
I promise I will show you

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight you will fight

'Cause I will fight and I will beg
I just want to hear you say
That tonight will be alright if you would stay

So put your hand in mine
We'll be fine, I know
I know it, I
If you stay tonight
I promise I will show you I will fight

So put your hand in mine
We'll be fine, I know
I know it, I
If you stay tonight
I promise I will show you I will fight

Alan Tarney & Leo Sayer
When we're round at a friend's house
You act so precious and cool
Tell her I'm nothin' special at all

Just somebody who's passin' through
Just sombody who's passin' through
And here I am tryin' to tell you again
But you just don't understand

That we could be somethin' special I know
If you'd only let go -- take a chance
Just try it once -- take a chance
But we're only -- we're only foolin'

You know that we are -- we're only foolin'
Tell me what are you gonna do
About a fool who's in love with you
What are you gonna do

When we go out on a Saturday night
Feel like I'm stringin' along
I ask you where are we going from here
You know but you're not lettin' on babe

Well you know but you're not lettin' on
So here we are at the crossroads
Between better or worse
You tellin' me I'm too serious babe

And one of use is gonna get hurt
Why do I always get hurt
But we're only -- we're only foolin'
You know that we are -- we're only foolin'

Tell me what are you gonna do
About a fool who's in love with you
What are you gonna do

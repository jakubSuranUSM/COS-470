You've got me reeling
As I'm hearing all the words you say
This ain't the way it's meant to be

You've got a feeling
There is more than living life this way
I want to show you reality
That you've never seen

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

Instead of dreaming
You're trying to keep yourself alive
And make it through another day

Though it's not easy
Believe me there's a reason why
He gave His life so you can live yours
That's what He came here for

To give us more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

More power, more mercy
More hope than ever thought possible
More life in me, because of You

There is more love

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before

There is more than you can imagine
There is more than you'll ever know
There is more than we've ever dreamed of
There is more, there is more

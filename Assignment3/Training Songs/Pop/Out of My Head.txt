Come on over, let me watch you
Let me hold you, let me touch you

Right or wrong I should have stayed up 'til the break of dawn
Ever since our eyes did meet
I long to see
Your eyes surprised me like a moon on a cowboy movie screen
I never found out what it means

I must be out of my head
It must be something I said
So come on I'll waste my life
You think I'm out of my head
But I'm romantically dead
So come on I'll waste my life on you

Come on over, let me watch you
Let me hold you, let me touch you

I'm right, you're wrong
You should have come to me before too long
You'll never leave my sight again
To keep you then
Your eyes deny me like the sun on a night sky movie scene
And I just don't care what it means

I must be out of my head
It must be something I said
So come on I'll waste my life
You think I'm out of my head
But I'm romantically dead
So come on I'll waste my life on you

And I hate to be the one
The one to drop the bomb
You wouldn't wait around
But I'll be watchin' you
Woooooo you! yeah you
Woooooo you! yeah you

I'll watch your every move
You can't know we can't hurt
You got no choice I got you

I must be out of my head
It must be something I said
So come on I'll waste my life
You think I'm out of my head
But I'm romantically dead
So come on I'll waste my life on you

I'll waste my life, I'll waste my life, my life on you

Sunday, Sunday here again, tidy attire
You read the color supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate, regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family around the table, to eat enough to sleep
Oh the Sunday sleep

Sunday, Sunday here again, a walk in the park
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past
He fought for us in two world wars, and the England he knew is now no more
He sings the songs of praise every week but always falls asleep
Full of Sunday sleep
(But he knows what he knows)

Sunday, Sunday

Sunday, Sunday here again, tidy attire
You read the color supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate, regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family around the table, to eat enough to sleep
And mother's pride is your epithet, that extra slice you'll soon regret
So going out is your best bet, then bingo yourself to sleep
Oh that Sunday sleep

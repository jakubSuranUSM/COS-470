They made you do it you didn't care
They made you do it
You teased your hair
They asked you why you did not know
They made you cry it didn't show
Going through commotion
Slipping on the steppin' stone
You came to the conclusion
You're playing in the fireball zone

They made you do it
That's what you say
They made you do it a night to play
They made you swallow you came around
It made you hollow
You stood your ground
They made you do it you couldn't fight
They made you do it to your delight

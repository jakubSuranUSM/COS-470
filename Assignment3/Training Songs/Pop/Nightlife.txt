When you're alone
There's no one around
Gotta get yourself out
Away from home
People know how to party

A permanent frown
Won't get you a lover
Gotta get yourself out
Way downtown
People know how to party

Nightlife, babe, it's always the same
Living the life every night
Night life, babe, it's always the same
Looking for light every night

Thank all your stars
There's someone around
Gonna get you out there
In streets and bars
People know how to party

Nightlife, babe, it's always the same
Living the life every night
Night life, babe, same old game
Looking for light every night

And when your heart has come around
You won't ever settle down
You won't ever
(You won't ever)
You won't ever say goodnight
(Say goodnight)
To love

Take it from me
I've been there before
And I'm gonna go back there
We all need
People who know how to party

Nightlife, babe, it's always the same
Living the life every night
Night life, babe, same old game
Leaving the lie every night
Nightlife, babe, it's always the same
Looking for light every night
Night life, babe, it's always the same
Living the life every night

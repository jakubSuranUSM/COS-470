I used to know you better, better than anyone
Now I don't know you at all
You used to keep my secrets, shallow has turned to deepness
Now I got someone else to call

Just 'cause I don't make a thing about it
Don't mean that I never think about it
'Cause I do
Just 'cause I learned how to live without you
Don't mean that I ever really wanted to
Oh-oh

I miss you, yeah, yeah
After all that we've been through, I never told you that I do
But I miss you, ooh
Even after all this time, I got your body on my mind

I miss you

This might seem out of nowhere, I get it if you don't care
Guess I just don't know what to say
Don't know if you remember that night in late September
For me, it feels like yesterday

Just 'cause I don't make a thing about it
Don't mean that I never think about it
'Cause I do
Just 'cause I learned how to live without you
Don't mean that I ever really wanted to
Oh-oh

I miss you, yeah, yeah
After all that we've been through, I never told you that I do
But I miss you, ooh
Even after all this time, I got your body on my mind

I miss you

Even when I'm not trying to, I keep doing the things we do
Are you missing me too, are you missing me too?
Like I miss you?

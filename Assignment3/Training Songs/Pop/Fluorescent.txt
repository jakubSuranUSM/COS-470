You walk in 
And you light up the room 

You’ve been living… in a looking glass scene 
Since you… were 17 
I can’t deny… you’ve made your move 
With a heavy cup to spend the occasional army cup 

Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn 
When you’re in this mood there’s no return 
Life’s a gamble, throw my dice 
Every scandal has it's price 
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn 
When you’re in this mood there’s no return 
Fluorescent 

Fluorescent 
Incandescent 
Fluorescent

You walk in 
And you light up the room 

At midnight it’s time for business 
But who… will bear witness? 
To your beauty and refrain 
But how well you’ve played the game? 
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game 
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game 
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game 
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game 
You’ve played the game 

Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn 
When you’re in this mood there’s no return 
Life’s a gamble, throw my dice 
Every scandal has it's price 
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn 
When you’re in this mood there’s no return 
Fluorescent

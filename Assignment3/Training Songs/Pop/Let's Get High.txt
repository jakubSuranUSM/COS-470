I feel like I'm undersea
I'm losing my breath
This is a kind 
Of little death

Some pictures from my past
Are coming back
Like flashes
You know somebody told me
That when you're gonna die
It's like this

I just wanna get high
With you
So come on
Take a drag

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

I know that I should never act
Like this
I was anxious 
Not to be equal of what I am
Now I'm scared of what I have done
I've got a feeling that I'm losing you

I just want to go far
With you
So come on 
Take a turn, with me

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

if you want to stay
Close to me
You know the place where I longs to be
Nobody can stop you my dear
Tears in my eyes, but I don't mind
Nobody can stop you my dear
Tears in my eyes, but I don't mind
But I don't mind

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

I just want to be
Honest with you baby babe
Let's get high
Let's get high

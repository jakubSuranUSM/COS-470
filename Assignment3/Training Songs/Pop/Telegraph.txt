Telegraph

Tell a friend I'm leavin'
Heard you left
Me at home
But I'm here still breathin'
'Cause she's in me
Tell me where you've gone
Could I meet you later on
Should I Let you be
I guess I'm letting you go
It's hard but it's just like they say
You had to be so
Hard on my heart and my head
But I left our past
On the telegraph
Telephone
Tell a friend I'm grievin'
Lift it up
And tear it down
See what you believe in
'Cause she's in me
Tell me where you've gone
Could I meet you later on
Should I
Let you be (I'm gonna let you)
I guess I'm letting you go
It's hard but it's just like they say
You had to be so
Hard on my heart and my head
But I left our past
On the telegraph
Am I just waistin' time
Trying to lose your mind
How do these things get done
So do you think it's true
When it comes out of you
Aren't we the lucky ones

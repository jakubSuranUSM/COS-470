And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby
And when the angels bring
You back here in my life
Then I know i'ts true
That I love you

I was so blind
I was so wrong
The day we met 
It never leaves my mind
I thought you play some foolish game
But now my heart tells me I was wrong

And when you come around 
I let you inside
Cause I'm ready 
I can't wait anymore

And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby
And when the angels bring
You back here in my life
Then I know i'ts true
That I love you

Each night I pray that you'll come back
I can't deny what I feel inside
The music plays one special song
The words that they say 
I hope can bring you home

And when you come around 
I let you inside
Cause I'm ready 
I can't wait anymore

And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby
And when the angels bring
You back here in my life
Then I know i'ts true
That I love you

I know I've cried so many times
I know I've said things 
I was running away
I was wrong

And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby

And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby
And when the angels bring
You back here in my life
Then I know i'ts true
That I love you

And when the angels sing
I want you by my side
I don't care how long 
I've been waiting for my baby
And when the angels bring
You back here in my life
Then I know i'ts true
That I love you

(Sha-la-la, dooby wah, dum-dum-dum, yeh-yeh, um)
(Sha-la-la, dooby wah, dum-dum-dum, yeh-yeh)

Oh blue angel, don't you cry just because he said goodbye
Oh, ah-ah-ah, no don't cry

Oh, blue angel, have no fear brush away lonely teardrops
Hey hey, whoa-whoa, oh (yeah-yeah, dum, wah-wah-wah-wah)

Well, love's precious flame can just burn in vain
But you're not to blame
You thought love was a game, is it?

Oh, such a shame but don't you cry, don't sigh
I'll tell you why, I'll never say goodbye
Blue angel (sha-la-la, dooby wah, dum-dum-dum)
(Yeh-yeh, um, wah-wah-wah-wah)

We'll have loving so fine, magic moments divine
If you'll just say you're mine
I'll love you till the end of time

Don't you worry your pretty head
I'll never let you down
I'll always be around
Blue angel (sha-la-la, dooby wah, dum-dum-dum, yeh-yeh, um)
Blue angel (sha-la-la)

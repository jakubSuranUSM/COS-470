Don't try to deceive me
By trying to please me
You found a new guy
Don't lie
I can't stand it

Why don't you come clean now
Excuses are weak
Don't speak
I can't stand it

[Chorus:]
You know I really feel
This hurt will never heal
I can't stand it
Oh no 
I can't stand it
It's how you planned it
Oh no 
I can't stand it

The way that you hold me
Says everything
Don't cling
I can't stand it

The way that you cheated
Started a fight
All right
I can't stand it

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

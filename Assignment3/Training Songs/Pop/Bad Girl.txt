I just take what I need, you've got to deal with it
Boy, I make you believe that it's love you receive
You're moving kinda slow, you got to keep it up

I'm just a bad girl therefore I have more fun
Look at the bad girl, my trip has just begun
I'll be satisfied, boy I got you shook up on your knees
I'm just a bad girl 'cause I stick to my guns

Oh boy, it's not my fault, I'm irresistible
The damage I have caused is not just fixable
I'm gonna leave you now and I don't care what you say

I'm just a bad girl therefore I have more fun
Look at the bad girl, my trip has just begun
I'll be satisfied, boy I got you shook up on your knees
I'm just a bad girl 'cause I stick to my guns

Shut up, babe, I don't have time, let me lay it on the line
I can find another guy, someone who will treat me right
Thought that you'll be all I need, your words have no way with me
Cause you are no chap, I see, that is how it's got to be
Aha, aha, aha, aha

I'm just a bad girl
Look at the bad girl
I'll be satisfied, boy, I got you shook up on your knees
I'll be satisfied, boy, I got you shook up on your knees
I'll be satisfied

I'm just a bad girl
Look at the bad girl
Look at the bad girl, oh yeah
I'm just a bad girl
I'll stick to my guns

Don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
A hint of the scent then it's gone
Look at the state of you, you're all fingers and thumbs
So who's your latest flame
Drivin' 'em wild in the fast lane
Won't say I told you so, but the boy has no shame
Once when my hands were full
We were double or quits then some
Nothin' at all to show for a love so precious
Gone and blown it all, how can you say
"It doesn't matter much to me?"
A dumb mistake too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris
Gone and blown it all and then you say
"This isn't happening to me"
A dumb mistake too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris
Don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
The thrill of the chase then it's gone
Only the hurt to prove that it ever went on
And life is a wonderful thing
When you're humming the words to a love song
Do what you want to do be who you want to be
When I'm in your arms I'm strong
There's nowhere I'd rather be
We shine for liberty, life and the pursuit of pleasure
Gone and blown it all, how can you say
"It doesn't matter much to me?"
A dumb mistake too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris
Gone and blown it all and then you say
"This isn't happening to me"
A dumb mistake too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris
And how the days have flown too few and fast
They said it wasn't meant to last
A dumb mistake too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris

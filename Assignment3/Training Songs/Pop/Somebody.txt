In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather

In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

Somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody

In my head I knew better (in my head I knew better)
I won't blame it on my faults again
I know I should forget her
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else

In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)

'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
You can stop tryna be somebody
You can stop tryna be somebody

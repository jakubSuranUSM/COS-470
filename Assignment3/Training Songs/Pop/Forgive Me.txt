Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
Forgive me now,
For all the Things I made.
Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
Forgive me now,
I hope itÂ's not too late,
Too late.
I really only need Reaction,
Tell me what rules my Mind,
Tell me more of it
Tell me what did you find.
Maybe itÂ's my Imagination,
That tells me how to kill Time,
I donÂ't have an Answer,
DonÂ't know how the Feelings strike -
To say...

Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
Forgive me now,
For all the Things I made.
Forgive me now,
For all the Things I made,
Believe me now,
I hope itÂ's not too late,
Too late.

Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
For all the Words,
For all the Words I said,
Forgive me...

Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
Forgive me now,
For all the Things I made.
Forgive me now,
For all the Words I said,
Believe me now,
I hope itÂ's not too late,
Too late.

Too late,
Forgive me,
Forgive me now,
For all the Words,
For all the Words I said,
Hey hey,
Forgive me,
Too late,
Forgive me,
Too late...

Forgive me now.

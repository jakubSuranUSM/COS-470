Innocent I thought you'd been
Don't come here to clean up your conscience
Closer now to me, but you're the same boy now and that's what I want
Innocent you'll always be
Who will believe in a boy like you
You're closer to my heart, but you're the same boy now and that's how I want you to be

Since the very start, you took control of my heart
And even at the end, you said we'd still be friends
And an innocent like me, is glad that it's over (it's over)

It' s not the city or this town
I'm not the only girl that needs your affection
To satisfy this need that you're the same boy now and that's what I want

Take everything don't just try to buy it
Did loneliness break your heart? 
Life has no guarantees
It's the same thing, listen now babe
You're no good but you should be

It's over
Since the very start you took control of my heart
And even at the end, you pretended to be my friend
And the innocence in me is glad that it's over

(Na na na na naa na na na na na)(X9)
Since the very start you took control of my heart
And in the very end you pretended to be my friend
But you could never see the innocence in me
The innocence in me

(Na na na na na na na na na na na na na) 
The innocence in me
(Na na na na na na na na na na na na na)

Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For love may come
And tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
And just in case
You feel you want to hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star

And put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For when your troubles
Start a multiplying
And they just might
It's easy to
Forget them without trying
With just a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

Never let it fade away
Save it for a rainy day

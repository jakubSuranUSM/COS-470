He`s a dream
See the manly way he moves
See the trendy kind he suits 
And his toothpaste-smile 
Doesn`t need to be proved
 
He`s so smooth
With the slimy things he tells
And his parfume everywhere
He will tell you all
You want to hear
 
He`s handsome
Like a piece of wood
Just a smile to be understood
He`s handsome
Like a piece of wood 
And the more that you see
The more you will be amused
 
He`s alone 
And he can`t believe in you
He is further from the truth
What`s best for him
Won`t be good for you
 
He`s a fake 
And the only things you see
Is a play for you and me
But his simple mind
Is mostly mean
 
He`s handsome
Like a piece of wood
Just a smile to be understood
He`s handsome
Like a piece of wood 
And the more that you see
The more you will be amused

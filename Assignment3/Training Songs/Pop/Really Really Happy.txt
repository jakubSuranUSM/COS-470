And I don't care what anyone thinks about me
I'm not afraid of what you say or do
It doesn't hurt me I'm telling you

that I'm completely over it and I don't care what you do

I'm really really glad and really really really happy
And I'm feeling good
I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm
Feeling good I'm feeling free and nothing's bothering me

and what I say is real and it's about time
I used to be so mad and crazy
Almost all of the time I'm telling you

That I'm completely turned around and feeling like I should

I'm really really glad and really really really happy
And I'm feeling good
I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm
Feeling good I'm feeling free and nothing's bothering me

what I say or what I do it makes me wanting to
Tell you everybody in a happy tune-yeah

[solo]

and I don't care what anyone thinks about me
I'm not afraid of what you say or do it doesn't hurt me I'm telling you
That I'm completely over it and I don't care what you do

I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm feeling good

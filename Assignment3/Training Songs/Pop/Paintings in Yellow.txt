I see a shining ocean,
I see the sky so blue,
I see a world in motion,
(Can you see this too ?)

A little piece is dying,
A little piece in you,
Why don't you understand,
Life is in your hands,
See the dream I have

[Chorus]
Paintings in yellow,
Keep shining in my mind,
Don't know why,
I just don't know why you're blind
Ah, paintings in yellow,
Keep shining in my heart,
Don't know how,
But I try to make you see

I feel a warm wind blowing,
I feel the sun and rain,
I feel the beauty we live in,
Do you feel the same ?

For the love that I'm feeling,
I rely, and I count on you,
Why don't you understand,
World is in your hand,
Can you hear me call ?

[Chorus: x2]

Ah, paintings in yellow,
(kKep shining in your heart)
Paintings in yellow,
(Keep shining in your mind)
Paintings in yellow
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
Paintings in yellow
(Keep shining in your mind) 
Paintings in yellow
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo (keep shining in your heart)
Paintings in yellow
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo+(keep shining in your heart)

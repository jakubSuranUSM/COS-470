Sittin' and sippin' and trippin' 
I'm loving the ticking and clicking of watches 
And touching the clutches of chickens
Choking the flipping of bodies, so sick 
I'm repeating to myself 

I'm quitting this dangerous living 
I'm quitting
I'm quitting

There is no way out of here 
There's no way out of here 
Who told you that?
There is a way out of here 
There was a way out of here 
You look better right now 
Two hundred feet underground 

I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

The Devil has taken my token and thought it was broken 
He took it to Brooklyn, where mama was cooking 
And daddy provoking and shouting obscenities 
Surely his gravity can't be depravity 
'Cause we're just quitting 
I'm quitting 
He's quitting 

There is no way out of here 
There's no way out of here 
Who told you that 
There is a way out of here 
There is a way out of here 
I'll take care of you now 
Two hundred feet underground 

I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 

You think that you're on your own way 
But you'll do what I say 
I'm twisting shadows 
Dancing in the moonshine 
You're bound to just obey 
But you'll be led astray 
By your unrepentant superstition 

I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 
I'm an alcoholic 
I'm an addict, but sporadic 

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 

I'm an alcoholic (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 
I'm an addict, but sporadic (You'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 
I'm an alcoholic (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 
I'm an addict, but sporadic (You'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say) 
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (you'll do what I say, you'll do what I say)

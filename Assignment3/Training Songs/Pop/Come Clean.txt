I'm gonna tell him everything
I'm gonna say I slept around
And when I finally tell him everything
There might be nothing left between us
But images of cunt and penis
Entered into evidence 
The blood is on my hands
The truth and nothing but the truth
I'm gonna come clean
I told him when and where and everything
I told him who and what and why
I went to bed not feeling anything
I heard some feet go pitter-patter
A window on my pickup shattered
Fucking really fucking matters
Blood is on my hands
The truth and nothing but the truth
I had to come clean
He held me when I had blood on my hands
He kissed me when I had blood on my hands

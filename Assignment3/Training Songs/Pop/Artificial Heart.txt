Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart, baby

Must have had a broken heart before
And found a way to fix it
By borrowing the love from other hearts
And never giving any back

Your father must have been a real stone cutter
And he molded you in his image
â€˜Cause you're a chip off a hardened heart
A heart with no feeling

All I ask of you love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me
Like you want me
But instead you're just a man with an artificial heart

Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart, baby

Baby, baby, baby

Must have been a lonely heart to start with
To be so cold
Artificial heart's cannot be broken
They can never love anyone

How can you expect someone to give love
When they're not receiving
Every person has a breaking point
A point of no return

That's all I ask of you love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me
Like you want me
But instead you're just a man with an artificial heart

Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart, baby

All I ask of you love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me
Like you want me
But instead you're just a man with an artificial heart

Love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me
Like you want me
But instead you're just a man with an artificial heart

Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Now break for me

Artificial-artificial-artificial
Artificial-artificial-artificial
Art-art-art

All I ask of you love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me
Like you want me
But instead you're just a man with an artificial heart

Artificial heart, baby

I don't need a whole lots 'a money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
Now, I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'cause I got me a sweet, a sweet lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right

[Chorus:]
Well my baby, she's all right
Well my baby, she's clean out of sight, don't you know that
She's
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful yes she is, she's a
She's some kind 'a wonderful yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I hold her in my arms
You know, she sets my soul on fire
Oh, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her lovin' arms around me
It 'bout tires me out of my mind

Yeah, when my baby kisses me chills run up and down my spine
Well my baby, she's all right
Uh, my baby, she's clean out of sight, don't you know that she's
She's some kind 'a wonderful
She's some kind 'a wonderful yes she is, she's a
She's some kind 'a wonderful yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now is there anybody got a sweet little woman like mine
Got to be somebody got a, got a sweet little woman like mine

Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness

[Chorus]

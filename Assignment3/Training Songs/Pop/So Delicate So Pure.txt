I'm loosing my mind I'm falling apart
I wanna feel your heart and all I see is you
I'm such a fool to treat you like I do
When I take my fears and throw them all on you
But it's you so delicate so pure
Enough to seem unreal
Yes it's you so delicate so pure
It's so hard to believe
I love your laugh the way you say my name
I want you to be hard I want to know your pain
I was so wrong but now I see the truth
I blame it on my youth and I'm coming back to you
But it's you so delicate so pure
Enough to seem unreal
Yes it's you so delicate so pure
It's so hard to believe
I love the way that you walk
And the music in the way that you talk
Anybody gonna tell me that I'm crazy
I know with all my jealousy it's hard to live with me
Here in the dark I need you like a drug
Take anything you want the part of me you need
Wash over me desire has a face
I wanna make you see I've nowhere else to be
But with you so delicate so pure
Enough to seem unreal
Yes it's you so delicate so pure
It's so hard to believe

When I saw you, you were not so happy
So I hung around a while
You said to me give me three good reasons
Why I should even raise a smile
Somebody told me they thought I was a sailor
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time could be for ever

The things I say may very well sound different
Depending on your point of view
Some kind of lovers give you creature comforts
Do anything you want them to
Somebody told me they thought I was much older
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time should be for ever

Never again I hear somebody saying
Will you break this heart of mine
But I can't wait not even for a moment
I'm drifting off the edge of time
You showed me things that should remain a mystery
Just like they were intended to
If I try hard and do some rearranging
I could find a place for you

You say you know but you might be mistaken
Taken for a ride again
Alone at last but this is not the first time
I hope it won't turn out the same
Somebody told me they never ever worried
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time will last for ever

Never again I hear somebody saying
Will you break this heart of mine
But I can't wait not even for a moment
I'm slipping off the edge of time
You showed me things that should remain a mystery
Just like they were intended to
If I try hard and do some rearranging
I could find a place for you

You told me once but say it again
It's nice to hear you say such sweet things
Hold me close closer than the last time
It's nice to feel you do such sweet things

Never again I hear somebody saying
Will you break this heart of mine
But I can't wait not even for a moment
I'm dripping off the edges of time
You showed me things that should remain a mystery
Just like they were intended to
If I try hard and do some rearranging
I could find a place for you

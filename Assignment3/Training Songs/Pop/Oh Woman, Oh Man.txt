I can see that you're giving up
It should not mean that much to me
And I don't know where the rest go
But everybody's been telling me no

But I'll always have a thing for you
I'd move the earth
But nothing made you want me better
There is nothing I can do
But steal the moon
But nothing made you want me better

Oh woman oh man
Choose a path for a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

And I can see that you're giving up
So tell me it should not mean this much to me
And I don't know where the rest goes
Everybody's been telling me no

But I'll always have a thing for you
I'd move the earth
But nothing made you want me better
There is nothing I can do
But steal the moon
And nothing made you want me better

Oh woman oh man
Choose a path for a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

Woman choose your man
Woman who understands
Do you really understand? 
Do you really understand?
Do you really understand?

Oh woman oh man
Choose a path for a child
Great mirrored plans
Oh woman oh man
Take a devil by the hands through
Yellow sands

(Oh woman, oh man) Woman choose your man
(Oh woman, oh man) Woman who understands
Do you really understand?
Do you really understand?

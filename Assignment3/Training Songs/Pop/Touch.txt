There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

I wanna touch you but I'm too late
I wanna touch you but there's history
I can't believe that it's been three years
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet

There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

You wanna touch me but you're too late
You wanna touch me but there's too much history
Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves
I only need you to be friends with me

There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind

There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
There's a love between us still but something's changed and I don't know why
I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over
And all I wanna do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
Never felt, never felt, never felt

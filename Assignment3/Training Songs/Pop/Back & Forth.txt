There's a special kind of person
Sometimes she's not all she seems
You only see what she wants you to see
And before you really know it always seems to go

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Our love goes

Take your chances if you will, those looks can kill
It'll make you go round and around, you got to know it by now
That the truth is you just can't win, loves funny like that
It'll make you blow your cap, sacrifice everything and money

Love has no guarantee's and always will it be

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth

Take stabs dip and dab, forever tryin' to find your way
It's a sellers lament for all the love you spent
You must have thought it was a bottomless pit
You can't do it like that, love will show you where it's at

What you put up you'll surely get back
'Cause there's no other way, if you play you'll pay

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth

Love has no guarantee's and always will it be

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth

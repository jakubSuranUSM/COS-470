We know you heard this beat many, many times
But bet you never heard it
With such a vicious rhyme
A rhyme with class and plenty of clout
To show all you sucker emcees what it's about
We hear the same stories everywhere we go
Hey it's not new who stole the show
So for all you party people who are in a state of shock
We're the New Kids on the Block

Chillin' on the corner the first day we arrive
From the looks of the hoods we didn't think we'd survive
Second day there we were walking down the street 
With a rhyme in mind and a funky beat
But when we turned into the alley, to our surprise
We seen a bunch of hoods right before our eyes
They looked us up and down 
Once, twice, and again
There musta been a hundred to a hundred and ten
So I looked over my shoulder right at my friend
He said "Nice knowing ya but this is the end"
So we battened down the hatches and prepared to fight
Then all of a sudden I've seen the light
'Cause the time was right, the time to rock
'Cause everybody knows we're the New Kids on the Block

We're also devastating when we're on a stage
The fans start screaming and yelling with rage
With mics in hand and rhymes with clout
So watch it sucker emcees or we're gonna turn you out
We never talk trash, our rhymes are clean
Our rhymes are never vague and we say what we mean

So any sucker emcees who wanna battle us
Can you go at least twenty lines without a cuss
'Cause one you start to jam you'll be in a state of shock
Move the way party people
We're the New Kids on the Block

Move it sucker emcees or you're gonna feel the wrath
So don't get caught up in the aftermath
'Cause we're the funky emcees of the hiphop craze
Our rhymes are never long and it's sure to amaze
We're the DJ cuttin' records
Straight across face
We'll leave you party people all stuck in a daze
We're fresh new and you know it's true
So let me introduce you to the rest of the crew

J Skee's first he's the master of mix
There ain't no rhyme that he can't fix
Spinster's next he's the king of the spin
And if you wanna battle you ain't gonna win
Then there's Popeye, but we call him Jord
The kid is so fresh that you'll never be bored
Next is Jon, his word is true, 
But party people know him as the one GQ
I'm Dexter P, the whiz of the word
I'm the greatest DJ that you ever heard
And now you know we're a gang 
And you know we don't play
We're the New Kids on the Block
And we're here to stay!

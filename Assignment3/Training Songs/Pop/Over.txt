'Sup baby?
Oh, holy shit

Does over mean it's over
Until we run into each other again?
On and off, hot and cold, back and forth
According to the mood we're in
We're back in bed again

We never seem to get to the end
We can't ever say never again
Tell me what does over mean?

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

I remember when over meant you felt
Real bad and cut up photographs
Never wanna see the son of a

Back with you again
Break up on a Sunday
Back on Monday
Ignoring everything that I said

We never seem to get to the end
We can't ever say never again
Tell me what does over mean?

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

We never practice what we preach
We're both guilty of being weak
Why say it's over when it ain't over?

Dysfunctionally raw
Emotionally backed up against the door
I don't trust us anymore
What's the meanin' of over?

Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again
Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again

Make up, break up, make up again
Break up, make up, break up again
Make up, break up, make up again
Tell me when it's over baby

Does it mean that it's over?
No more us that we want
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

Said it so many times
There's no reason, no rhyme
Why can't we say goodbye?
Why do we go back every time?

We begin where we end
This is where we came in
If we're gonna move on
We need a new word for over

Miracles happen
Miracles happen
You showed me faith is not blind
I don't need wings to help me fly
Miracles happen
Miracles happen

I can't imagine living my life without you now
Not ever having you around
We found our way out
(On you I can depend)

Don't have to look back
To realize how far we've come
There are million reasons
I'm looking up
I don't want this to end

Nothing
Nothing should ever bring you down
Knowing
What goes around will come around

You showed me faith is not blind
I don't need wings to help me fly
Miracles happen once in a while
When you believe
(Miracles happen)
You showed me dreams come to light
That taking a chance on us was right
All things will come with a little time
When you believe

There is no question
We found the missing pieces
Our picture is completed
It's fallen into place
(It's fallen into place)
This is our moment
You and I are looking up
Someone is watching over us
Keeping me close
Closer to you everyday

Nowhere
Nowhere on earth I'd rather be
No one
Can take this away from you and me

You showed me faith is not blind
I don't need wings to help me fly
Miracles happen once in a while
When you believe
(Miracles happen)
You showed me dreams come to light
That taking a chance on us was right
All things will come with a little time
When you believe

(When you believe)
The soul is a shining light
(When you believe)
The heart has the will to fight
You can do anything
Don't be afraid
We're gonna find our way

(Faith is not blind)
(I don't need wings)
(Miracles happen)(miracles can happen)
(Miracles happen)(miracles can happen)

You showed me faith is not blind
I don't need wings to help me fly
Miracles happen once in a while
When you believe
(Miracles happen)
You showed me dreams come to light
That taking a chance on us was right
All things will come with a little time
When you believe

You showed me faith is not blind
I don't need wings to help me fly
Miracles happen once in a while
When you believe
(Miracles happen)
You showed me dreams come to light
That taking a chance on us was right
All things will come with a little time
When you believe

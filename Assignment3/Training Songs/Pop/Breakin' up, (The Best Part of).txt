Baby, when we break up from a quarrel or a fight
I can't wait to have you back and hold you, oh, so tight
Tell me why (tell me why), I want to know (I want to know), oh oh
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so), oh oh

That the best part of breakin' up is when you're making up
Best part of breakin' up is when you're making up
But, after breakin' up
Be sure you're making up with me

Every time you leave, I get those teardrops in my eyes
But they seem to go away when you apologize
Tell me why (tell me why), I want to know (I want to know), oh oh
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so), oh oh

That the best part of breakin' up is when you're making up
Best part of breakin' up is when you're making up
But, after breakin' up
Be sure you're making up with me

C'mon, baby, c'mon baby
Don't say, "Maybe"
Well, it makes no difference who was wrong
Just as long as I'll be with you

Baby, I'll be lonely till you're back where you should be
But, baby, I belong to you and you belong to me
Tell me why (tell me why), I want to know (I want to know), oh oh
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so), oh oh

That the best part of breakin' up is when you're making up (tell me why)
Best part of breakin' up is when you're making up
But, after breakin' up
Be sure you're making up with
The best part of breakin' up is when you know
That you're making up with me

C'mon, baby, c'mon baby
Don't say, "maybe"
C'mon, baby
Ooh-eee, maybe
C'mon, baby
Don't say, "maybe"

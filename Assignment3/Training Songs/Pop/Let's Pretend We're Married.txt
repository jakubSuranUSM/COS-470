Excuse me but I need a love like yours
To help me forget the guy that just walked out that door
Funny, but it seems that you're alone like me
If you are then let's go see, see, see

Little darlin', if you're free for a couple of hours
And ain't busy for the next seven years
Let's pretend we're married and go all night

There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

Ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha, yeah
Everybody sing together
Ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha, yeah

Excuse me, but I need your tender skin
Don't you want to be my fantasy?
I don't care if you don't ever come

And if you go
(So what?)
C'mon baby, let's ball

And if you're free for a couple of hours
And ain't busy for the next seven years
Let's pretend we're married and go all night

There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

Ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha, yeah, everybody sing together
Ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha, yeah
Ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha, yeah
Everybody singing, ooh, we, coo-coo, sha-sha

What you heard about me is true
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with life, it's the only way

'Cause you and I know we gotta go some day
If you think I'm wild, you're probably right
'Cause I'm gonna rock 'n roll everyday and every night

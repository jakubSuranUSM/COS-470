Ain't it funny
How it may be a bad weather day
You can feel happy
In a most extraordinary way
Ain't it funny
Though it may shine all day long
You can feel down, wear a frown
And your face is as long,
As long as a mile

You have to give before you take
The choice is yours
So why not make it
It's easier than A.B.C.
If you really try
It's so easy, so easy

Ain't it funny
How you listen 
To things that you say
Makes you wonder what on earth
Made your mind work that way
Ain't it funny
How often things seem to go wrong
You can feel down, wear a frown
And your face is as long
As long as a mile

Ain't it funny
Now how long had I known you
Before I first saw, wanted more
For the first time
I knew what I had to do

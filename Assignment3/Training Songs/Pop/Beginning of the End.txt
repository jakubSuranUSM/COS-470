Happy days are here again
Its official, from number ten
We're movin' in, we're movin out
All change on the roundabout

Looking good, for the press
Gucci or Prada? Let me guess
The champion is a wonder horse,
Favourite to make it round the course

Is this the beginning of the end 
Or the end of the beginning
The way you got me goin' 
Tells me I don't know
I don't understand any 
Song that you are singin'
The jurys out, we're gonna let you know
Beginning of the end 
Or the end of the beginning
The way you got me goin' 
Tells me I don't know
I just can't believe all the records
You are spinning
The jurys out we're gonna let you know

Oo-la-la, a song and dance
Push to the front, and take a chance
Looking out for number one
See the picture in The Sun

New improved and feelin' good
Maybe a move to Hollywood
Party on, all of the time
Who cares about the mess you leave behind?

Is this the beginning of the end 
Or the end of the beginning
The way you got me goin' 
Tells me I don't know
I don't understand any 
Song that you are singin'
The jurys out, we're gonna let you know
Beginning of the end 
Or the end of the beginning
The way you got me goin' 
Tells me I don't know
I just can't believe all the records
You are spinning
The jurys out we're gonna let you know

From beginning to end
I just don't understand

Is this the beginning of the end 
Or the end of the beginning
The way you got me goin' 
Tells me I don't know
I don't understand any 
Song that you are singin'
The jurys out, we're gonna let you know
(beginning of the end) 
We'll let you know
(beginning of the end) 
We're gonna let you know
(beginning of the end)

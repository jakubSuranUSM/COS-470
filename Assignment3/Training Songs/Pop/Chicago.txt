So your brother's bound and gagged
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to chicago just to sing
In a land that's known as freedom how can such a thing be fair

Won't you please come to chicago for the help that we can bring
We can change the world rearrange the world
It's dying - to get better
Politicians sit yourselves down, there's nothing for you here

Won't you please come to chicago for a ride
Don't ask jack to help you `cause he'll turn the other ear
Won't you please come to chicago or else join the other side
We can change the world rearrange the world

It's dying - if you believe in justice
Dying - and if you believe in freedom
Dying - let a man live his own life
Dying - rules and regulations, who needs them open up the door

Somehow people must be free I hope the day comes soon
Won't you please come to chicago show your face
From the bottom of the ocean to the mountains of the moon
Won't you please come to chicago no one else can take your place

We can change the world rearrange the world
It's dying - if you believe in justice
Dying - and if you believe in freedom
Dying - let a man live his own life
Dying - rules and regulations, who needs them open up the door

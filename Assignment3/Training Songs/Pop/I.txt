I, I, I, iiiii. [x3]
What if I, had chosen to,
Make a left, when I should have made a right and,
What if I, followed though,
And chilled with my crew last night.
What if I, took the call and
Stayed on the phone when I should have been gone.
And What if I, hadn?t turned around and seen you there.

If I could go back in time,
To when the stars aligned,
Would I find the strength again to talk to you,
Walk up to you.
If I could do it all again,
I wouldn?t change a single thing.

Don?t need to compromise, what I feel inside,
Don?t need to clarify my position I,
Submit to destiny, so baby come with me,
Let?s take it for a ride,
Baby, baby, I, I, I.
And furthermore, if you?re looking for,
Someone to be around, baby I?m down,
Let?s take it to the point, no need to justify,
Baby, baby, I, I, I.

What if we, hadn?t been,
In the same place that very same time and,
What if we, hadn?t seen, all the possibilities.
What if he,
What if she, Stop!
I don?t want to think about it,
What if I,
What if I,
Ooh, Never mind.

If I could go back in time,
To when the stars aligned,
Would I find the strength again to talk to you,
Walk up to you.
If I could do it all again,
I wouldn?t change a single thing.

Don?t need to compromise, what I feel inside,
Don?t need to clarify my position I,
Submit to destiny, so baby come with me,
Let?s take it for a ride,
Baby, baby, I, I, I.
And furthermore, if you?re looking for,
Someone to be around, baby I?m down,
Let?s take it to the point, no need to justify,
Baby, baby, I, I, I. [x3]

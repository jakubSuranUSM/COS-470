Stand up
Head high
You can take it to the monkey
He's alright
Look up
Head high
You can do it for the money
It's alright
Listen to the legend she lives in your head
Floating in the wreckage her rockets are red
Say goodbye to mother cause nothing is fair
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone

Oh mirror, mirror
You are the dealer
Who is it I'm supposed to be?
Flesh, blood and fire
Saints on a wire
Animals trying to be free
From the chains that hold my tounge,
Free from a love that makes me run

Stand up
Head high
You can hold on to the monkey
He's alright
Get up
Let's fight
You can hit her till it's honey
She's alright
Now the one who feeds you is only a pest
A bridge over the water so you confess
Maybe she'll remember when you were the best
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone

Oh mirror, mirror
You are the dealer
Who is it I'm supposed to be?
Flesh, blood and fire
Saints on a wire
Animals trying to be free
From the chains that hold my tongue
Free from a love that makes me run

The only one you have can take you down
I want you, I want you
Water only amplifies the sound
I want you, I want you

Oh mirror, mirror
You are the dealer
Who is it I'm supposed to be?
Flesh, blood and fire
Saints on a wire
Animals trying to be free
From the chains that hold my tongue
Free from a love that makes me run

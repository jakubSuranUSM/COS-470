Kid can you wake up
Boy it ain't long till the warning arrives
And it's the shake up
That's got me waiting for your dynamite

I never knew your middle name
No need to play that game
I called your doctor up
And he promised me pain was fun

Tried a little bit of moving on
It lasted way too long
Dressed up as bubblegum
I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
Can you give me that

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Two timing in your state of mind
These feet got left behind
We dived so deep
We'd keep in touch with your buried bones

Can I get a little fading on?
Fade it, fade it, don't be long
Dressed up as bubblegum
I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
Can you give me that

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Did they mistake us
For an eight that's turning into a nine?
Said if I played the evil lover
Can I trade you for your alibi?

Done living like a runaway
Break those hearts so carefully
Done living like a runaway

Every time that I turn around
I let you down, you read my mind
Bring the beat back

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

You got that beep, that beep, that bop, bop
You got that beep, that beep, that bop, bop
You got that beep, that beep, that bop, bop
You got that beep, that beep, that beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

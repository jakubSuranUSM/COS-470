Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I know you know
That I know that you know
What we're both thinking
I know you know
That I know that you know
What our bodies are reading

And at this point it's kinda undeniable
And at this point it's kinda untryable
I can read your mind, it's incredible
Where it goes, where it goes, where it goes

I mean we could use vocabulary
To spell out everything that we feel
I mean we could use a dictionary
To define a feeling we know is real
But there's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I see what you see
Seeing what I see
'Cause our eyes just keep meeting
Lip locked on locked lips
Tongue tied just like this
'Til the muscle in our rib cage won't stop beating

And at this point it's kinda undeniable
And at this point it's kinda untryable
I can read your mind, it's incredible
Where it goes, where it goes, where it goes

I mean we could use vocabulary
To spell out everything that we feel
I mean we could use a dictionary
To define a feeling we know is real
But there's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Itâ€™s pretty self-explanatory
Pretty self-explanatory

Oh, I mean we could use vocabulary
To spell out everything that we feel (everything we feel)
I mean we could use a dictionary
To define a feeling we know is real
But there's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah
There's no words needed, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
There's no, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I mean we could use vocabulary
To spell out everything that we feel
I mean we could use a dictionary
To define a feeling we know is real
But there's no words needed

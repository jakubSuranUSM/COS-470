Out of cigarettes to smoke
Heavy heart, away from home
I just need a little bit of you
Making money, goin' broke
This one life is all I know
I can't say I'll give it up for you

And since I can't see you tonight
Tell me that you're doin' fine
Pictures aren’t enough across state lines
And since our hands can't intertwine
And I can't feel your skin on mine
I just need to hear your voice tonight

I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi
Feeling low when you're away, holding on to what you say
Just to stay high, stay high
I hope it's not too late, I hope you're still awake
I just want to say goodnight
I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi (say hi)

Say hi, say hi (say hi)
I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi
When you say hi, ooh
When you say hi, ooh

Out of patience, out of time
Out here waiting for a sign
I just need a little bit of you
Out of luck and low on gas
Counting seconds 'til I'm back
Say the world, I'll give it up for you

And since I can't see you tonight
Tell me that you're doin' fine
Pictures aren’t enough across state lines
And since our hands can't intertwine
And I can't feel your skin on mine
I just need to hear your voice tonight

I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi
Feeling low when you're away, holding on to what you say
Just to stay high, stay high
I hope it's not too late, I hope you're still awake
I just want to say goodnight
I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi (say hi)
Yeah

Say hi, say hi (say hi)
I love it when you call, I love it when you call
Just to say hi, say hi (say hi)

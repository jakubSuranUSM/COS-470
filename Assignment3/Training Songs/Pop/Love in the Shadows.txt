You saw me standing alone in the dark
Lost in the silence of my heart
Crying for angels crying for light
Crying for someone tonight

No time for wasting no time for truce
No time for innocent lies
Touch me like heroes straight from your eyes
Lead me to worlds far beyond

And I know it´s you for freedom
And I know you can fill the space in me

I need secrets in the dark love in the shadows
Passion burning out from under my skin
Take me for a ride until the night time's over
When daylight steals the magic of the dark

I´ll give no reasons and no border lines
Kill the fire that brakes the heart of love
No more crying for angels crying for light
Crying for someone tonight

And I know it´s you for freedom
And I know you can fill the space in me

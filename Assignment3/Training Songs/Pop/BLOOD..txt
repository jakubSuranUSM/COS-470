Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?

"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"

She replied
"Oh yes, you have lost something, you've lost your life"

Is it wickedness?

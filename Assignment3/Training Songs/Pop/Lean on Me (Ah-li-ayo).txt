Are we happy are we scared?
Are we shouting never heard?
Are we running, running brave?
Are we fighting, making waves?

The first man he gets up and he says
"Well, can I have a say?"

Singing 
Men on fire pray for rain
Who are madmen, who is sane?

So ten men they get up and they say
"Well, can we have a say?"

Have we lost the spoken word?

From the very very young to the very very old
Everybody now say aye
From the centre of the earth to the corners of the globe
Everyone of you say aye
Nobody better let me down
Mother earth on the other side

Sing on
Are we happy, are we scared?
Are we shouting, never heard?

The first man he gets up and he says
"Well, can I have a say?"
Cut of drama, power of sound
Are we progress, don't lose ground?

Ten men they get up and they say
"Well, can we have a say?"

Are we fighting, making waves?

From the very very young to the very very old
Everybody now say aye
From the centre of the earth to the corners of the globe
Everyone of you say aye
Nobody better let me down
We will see on the other side, lean on me

Ah-li-ayo!

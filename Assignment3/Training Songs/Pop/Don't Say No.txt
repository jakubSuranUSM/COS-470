I was walking down the street
When I saw a pretty boy
He was checking the beat on his radio toy

I've got the urge
I've got to let it find me
Won't do nothing like this
On Hollywood and Vine
He's from the south of the Bronx
He's from the lower East Side
He makes me crawl up the walls
He makes me run and hide

Don't say no if you don't know
Don't say no to love
Don't say no if you don't know how to love
Don't say no to love

People'll call you on the telephone
Numbers are falling all around my home
I love that boy
I love the man in the street
I love wild child smiles on the faces that I meet
I love Paris, I love Tokyo and Rome
I love the faraway places
But New York is my home

Don't say no if you don't know
Don't say no to love
Don't say no if you don't know how to love
Don't say no to love

I love the odor called life
I never watch TV
I make enough money
But I like what is free
I love New Orleans
I love the romance
I love Sydney, Australia
I love anywhere in France
I love Dublin, I love London and Berlin
But New York is the best of any place I've bin'

Don't say no if you don't know
Don't say no to love
Don't say no if you don't know how to love
Don't say no to love

Don't say no if you don't know
Don't say no to love
Don't say no if you don't know how to love
Don't say no to love

Don't say no if you don't know
Don't say no to love
Don't say no if you don't know how to love
Don't say no to love.

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers and your pearls, hey girl
(When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante)
(When I come through the door, I'm a debutante)

The jet set is freaking, the guest list is speakin'
We jet to Ibiza, the people are shrieking
The world kids are cravin', ravin' invasion
I come from the future of next school new wavin'

New York is so fly
My high rise is so high
The height of my high style
Comes right from the turnstile

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers and your pearls, hey girl
(When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante)
(When I come through the door, I'm a debutante)

The comic Guru Otaku, Tokyo
D.J. come, D.J. go, elevate electro
London is burning, turntables are turning
Nightclubs are discerning, my love is returning

[Incomprehensible]

Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers and your pearls, hey girl

When I come through the door, I'm a debutante
When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante
When I come through the door, I'm a debutante

All that you want, I'm debutante
All that you want, live wild and free

The comic Guru Otaku, Tokyo
D.J. come, D.J. go, elevate electro
New York is burnin', turntables are turnin'
Nightclubs are discerning

No one is wrong or right
I want to end our fight
Let's dance our way into the light
We never saw inside
Love is not what has failed
Why can't we both be saved?

For the older games we played
We have already paid

Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

Today is a new day
We'll throw our regrets away

For the older games we've played
We have already paid

Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

This day, this day

This day, this day
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

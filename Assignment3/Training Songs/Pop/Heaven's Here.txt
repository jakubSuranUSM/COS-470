This is your lifetime
No matter what time of life
There's wonder in the air if you stop to care.
Look at heaven
It's kissing clouds
Everybody's living
Everybody's proud.
Sweet dreams tonight and forever
Secret lives we live together
Feel warm inside
This is your time
Peace
Harmony and love divine.
Heaven's here
Heaven's here
We're playing gods and angels
Heaven's here
Heaven's here.
Summer rain on your face
You're touched by grace
Blue skies
White lies and cherry pies.
Lay me down and love me
Leave the light so I can see.
Angel mine
Let's dream together
Sacred hearts that love forever
Feel warm inside
This is your time
Peace
Harmony and love divine.
Heaven's here
Heaven's here

Why waste your time in a living hell ?
You can live in cloudland just as well !
Sweet dreams tonight and forever

Heaven's here
Heaven's here

Take a walk on a Sunday morning, 
Have a talk, be silent inside
Did you only want the shelter? 
What is turning round your mind?

Loreen, Loreen, 
They are down on you, 
Could you ever find again, 
Just what youÂ´ve been before? 
Loreen, Loreen, 
YouÂ´re so down and blue, 
ItÂ´s getting better every day 
But you are about to lose your way

Take a walk and I tail behind you, 
Range your thoughts look over your life,
And I know what youÂ´re reciting, 
What is turning round your mind?

Loreen, Loreen, 
They are down on you, 
Could you ever find again, 
Just what youÂ´ve been before? 
Loreen, Loreen, 
YouÂ´re so down and blue, 
ItÂ´s gettinÂ´ better every day, 
But you are about to lose your way

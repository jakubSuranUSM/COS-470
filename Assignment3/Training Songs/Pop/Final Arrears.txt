I don't know when to go out
I don't know when to stay in
I don't know how to belong
I don't know where to begin

[Chorus]
Reach out your hands
Where it lies is where it lands take home
The final arrears, it's the final arrears
Join all the hands take a photograph
And smile before the final arrears
It's the final arrears and I've used all my tears

I don't know where they are now
I don't know who I could call
Would they remember me now
My family

[Chorus]

I don't know who I am now
I don't remember the fall
All the gradual declines
Have taken their toll

[Chorus]

Hold onto the photographs
Hold onto your friends
Make hay with the memories
They're part of the pain I'm feeling now
They're part of the pain I'm feeling now
They're part of the pain I'm feeling now
They're part of the pain I'm feeling now
Feeling now

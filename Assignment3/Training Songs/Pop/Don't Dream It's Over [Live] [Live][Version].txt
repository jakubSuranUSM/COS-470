Breathe it out
I can hear you now
You think reality's shut you down
And you're locked away
Where you can't get out
Spent awhile on your back

And you know what it means to me, babe
In the course of a history, hey
It all makes sense to me somehow
And it's not what it used to be, no
We're suddenly free to let go
Look what's happening now

You will love this one
You will love this one
As if we create something magical, honey
There are times that come
These are times that come
Only once in your life
Or twice like mine

Do you wish to love
Can you give enough
Use your saving graces
In the heavy light
'Til the sky falls down
He can pray all he likes 

But you know what it means to me, babe
In the course of a history, hey
It all makes sense to me somehow
It's a course in philosophy, yeah
What is life is it just a dream, no
A perfect mystery but somehow I know

You will love this one
You will love this one
And if we create something magical, honey
There are times that come
These are times that come
Only once in your life
Or twice if you're lucky

And if the chance it comes around
Another time
You risk it all, you take the fall
For what you like
And sure enough before your love
Has taken flight
You make the revelation

You will love this one (Love this one)

You will love this one
You will love this one 
Dream in my head
Something magical, honey
There are times that come
These are times that come
Only once in your life
Or twice if you're lucky

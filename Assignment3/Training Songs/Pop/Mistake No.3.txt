You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow

Into strange and pretty faces
I don't know
Clutchin' to my lipstick traces
Watch them go

And make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

It's strange how much it changes
How they want to know
How cynical are people
That's where children go

Dragged into a conversation
They can't hold
It's so sad but
It prepares them for the mold

And make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
They make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Why is my love
Like an ocean run dry?
And why is my love
Such a struggle with life?

You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall into pieces
So we watch them grow

Make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Make Mistake No. 3, yeah
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

Make a mistake
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
Make Mistake No. 3, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's Mistake No. 3

Mistakes she make, mistakes she make
Mistakes make
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)
(Ooh, Mistake No. 3)

You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe
But you're back where you belong
Go get me my pistol, babe
Honey, I ain't tell right from wrong

Baby, please stop crying (stop crying) 
Stop crying (stop crying), stop crying (stop crying)
Baby, please stop crying (stop crying) 
(Stop crying) stop crying, (stop crying) stop crying (stop crying)
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please, stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind

Go down to the river, babe
Honey, I will meet you there
Crawl down to the river, babe
Honey, I will pay your fare

Baby, please stop crying (stop crying) 
Stop crying (stop crying), stop crying (stop crying)

Or if you just want some company
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to
Honey, come and see about me

Stop crying (stop crying), stop crying (stop crying)

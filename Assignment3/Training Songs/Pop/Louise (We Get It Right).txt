Oh, you never keep me waiting
Never need for complaining
You got a lot of understanding
Oh baby, you are amazing
And I like you a lot 'cause you do not make me are you-un
You're the best I ever had 'cause you take me as I co-ome

Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh La

I feel fine, got no sorrow
Why can't I wait for tomorrow
When I'm seein' my girl and we are gonna go on the town
I'm gonna hold her hands and look at her and shout
You're the one I like 'cause we get it right

Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, Lola

We get it right - get it all right
Oh-oh-oh, I hope it never goes wro-ong
'Cause we get it, 'cause we get it - ah, 'cause we get it right
We're in the groove (yeah) when we go out
(Ooh) show her off to my friends and crowd
And at the palindrome when we dance and have some drinks
And then she puts her arms around me and says that she loves me-ee
You're the one I like
'Cause we get it, 'cause we get it - ooh-ah-ooh-ooh, 'cause we get it right

Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you, oh Louise
Louise, I love you, I love you

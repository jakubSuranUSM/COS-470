And now the band is playing very slow
And once again, I'll get my coat and go
A lonely wallflower waiting by the wall
Without the will power to face the music at all

Please, won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone somewhere
Someone who dare take a chance with me

I feel so silly in my patent shoes
So many partners but one of them will choose 
A lonely wall flower feeling rather tired
Feeling undesired

Please, won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone somewhere
Someone who dare take a chance with me

May I have the pleasure of this dance?
Doo doo doo doo doo

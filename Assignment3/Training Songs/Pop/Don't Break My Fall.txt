What can I say?
When every word you won't believe anyway
No promise made
Just means there's nothing wrong today

What can I do?
Cause I could never make things up to you
And we both new
That if things don't change it'll all be thrown away

Don't break my fall
Cause things look better from down here
To lose it all
Just means another chance for you to
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh my friend

What can I hide?
When every feelings locked down deep inside
My hands are tied
But I'm hangin' on
And I'm hangin' in

Sure do like the sound of it

I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, honey
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

Cause there you stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on the map of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

So we built from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here, there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two-foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless, boundless, I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I just didn't know

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love (I just didn't know)
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love (Oh, I just didn't know)
Didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you...

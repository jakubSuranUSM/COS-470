Suddenly Mary fell in the water
Were not I weary I would have caught her
I watched for a moment and scrambled in 
after
Words of disownment were drowned out with 
laughter

I awoke from a peaceful sleep and found 
my clothes under the table
Aesop used to make me weep but now I'm 
part of Mary's fable

Suddenly Mary fell in the water
I found myself married to somebody's 
daughter
"Loving," she told me
"Is a question of bravery"
But when she started to hold me
It was closer to slavery
I got up for a bite to eat and found my 
clothes inside the icebox
I used to stand on my own two feet but 
now I sit when my new wife talks

Suddenly Mary fell in the water
She floated away with the ring that I 
bought her
She had convinced me that I was a failure
I burned all my clothing and found a new 
tailor
Suddenly Mary (repeat)
Suddenly Mary's fine (repeat)

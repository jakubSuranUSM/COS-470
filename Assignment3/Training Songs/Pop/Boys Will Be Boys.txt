La, da, la, da, la, da, da, da, da

Did you ever wonder how
How a boy can turn you around?
Well, their behavior makes no sense
They're never gonna be same as your girlfriends

Boys can sometimes be so strange
That's a fact, it's never gonna change
Even though they're a lot of fun
You just can't figure out where they're coming from

Boys will be boys
They're gonna make you crazy
Boys will be boys
They think they're so cool
They make a lot of noise
But I don't let it faze me
Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys

Boys, boys, boys
La, da, da, da, da, ooh, la, la
La, da, la, da

One boy said he liked me
When we're together he's so sweet
He listened to all my stories
He really cares, he never would ignore me

But when he got with his friends
I just couldn't recognize him
I can't believe how he had changed
I think the boy has really gone insane

Boys will be boys
They're gonna make you crazy
Boys will be boys
They think they're so cool
They make a lot of noise
But I don't let it faze me
Boys will be boys, will be boys

Boys will be boys
They like to burst your bubble
Boys will be boys
They gotta act tough
They make a lot of noise
Always making trouble
Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys

Now listen up, girls
We wanna make some noise
We wanna rock, gonna talk
All about the boys

And come on, all you boys
Come and join the girls
And we're gonna rock this party
Gonna take 'round the world

La, da, da, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
La, da, da, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Boys will be boys

Boys will be boys
(La, da, la, la)
Boys will be boys
(La, da, la, da, la, da, da, da, da)
They make a lot of noise
(La, da, la, da, la, la)
Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys
(La, da, la, da, la, da, da, da, da)

Boys will be boys
(La, da, la, la)
Boys will be boys
(La, da, la, da, la, da, da, da, da)
They make a lot of noise
(La, da, la, da, la, la)
Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys
(La, da, la, da, la, da, da, da, da)

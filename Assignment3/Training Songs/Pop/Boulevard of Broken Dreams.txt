I don't want to go to sleep and toss and turn all night.
I don't want to look up and see shadows - I believe alright.
Don't want to get lost on a road so long.
Your legs get tired, and you fall to the ground
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
Don't want to get drunk just to sleep at night.
My head starts spinning; a triple with wine.
Don't want to get up and go to work each day.
Come back home, on my knees, and pray
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
I wonder where you are;
Are you satisfied
To go through life with a chill in your soul,
And a memory that lives by your side?
Don't want you no more; heard enough one day.
So take me on down where that rock and roll plays.
Don't want you to vow; how could you lie?
With all my life I called you daddy,
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
I wonder where you are;
Are you satisfied
To go through life with a chill in your soul,
And a memory that lives by your side?
Don't want you no more; heard enough one day.
So take me on down where that rock and roll plays.
Don't want to get lost on a road so long.
Your legs get tired, and you fall to the ground
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
On the boulevard of broken dreams.

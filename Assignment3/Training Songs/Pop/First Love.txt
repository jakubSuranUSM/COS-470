Today my First Love has arrived
Did you see her? Did you approve?
What if I asked this of you?
Would everything you'd say be true?

When I was young I played with toys
Games were small then, not so involved
My toys meant most of all
You know how kids are when they're small

But now today I find a lot has come to change my mind
It took some time to understand
Older people play little games in another way
Their castles crumble to sand
A lonely hour to withstand

Today my First Love is alone
Do you miss her? Is it so sad?
The tears you cry should be glad
Remembering her is not all that bad

Today my First Love is alone

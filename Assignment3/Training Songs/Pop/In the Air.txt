Who's been fooling my emotions?
There's nothing you can say even if you're game enough
'Cause I've been holding on for so long
Honey, won't you say maybe we can change it up?

I can't say
Where will I be when the walls stop shaking?
I can't stay
Where will I be when my heart's still breaking?

It's in the air
It's something in the way she drifts up there

Who's been dreaming what I'm sewing
Honey, here's a time to stand in love
'Cause I've been hurting, oh, for so long
Tell me what you say, can we change it up? Ooh

I can't say
Where will I be when the walls stop shaking?
I can't stay
Where will you be when my heart's still breaking?

It's in the air
It's something in the way she drifts up there
It's in the air
Something in the way she drifts up there
Oh, it's in the air
Something in the way she drifts up there

Oh no, she don't need anything
Oh no, she don't need anyone
I could say she's been here for us
I could say she's been there for you
Oh no, she don't need anything
Oh no, she don't need anyone
I could say she's been here for us
I could say she's been there for you
Oh no, she don't need anything
Oh no, she don't need anyone
I could say she's been here for us

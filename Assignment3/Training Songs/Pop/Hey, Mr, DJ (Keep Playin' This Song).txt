Oh Backstreet, get set
One time, here we go
Oh oh oh oh
Get set, get set

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
By the way that your body moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you (leading me to you)
Lead me to you

So I stood there watching
I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of you body (uh)
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside your world with you (oh)
(Get set, get set)

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ
Mr. DJ play, play it for me (get set, get set)
(oh, oh) (get set, get set)

Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's movin' fast
How can we make it last? (make it last now)
Make it last somehow

As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in you eyes
I was lost inside your world with you (oh)
(Get set, get set)

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be (oh)
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ
Mr. DJ oh play it, play it, play it for me

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
And imagine (just imagine)
Let the music (let the music)
Put you in a zone (put you in a zone) (oh yeah)
I get lost (I get lost)
Lost inside a groove (lost inside a groove)
When you do the things you do
Come on and work you body, work your body

Hey! Mr DJ, jam all night long
Hey! Mr DJ, play that song for me
Hey! Mr DJ, jam all night long
Hey! Mr DJ, play that song for me (get set, get set)

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ
Mr. DJ play, play DJ oh

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
(she's gotta be)
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ (oh)
Mr. DJ play it, play it, play it for me

Keep it coming Mr. DJ

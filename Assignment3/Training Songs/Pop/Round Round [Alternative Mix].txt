Round round baby round round
Spend the night on me
I dont need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Round baby round round
Spinning out on me
I dont need no man
Got my kicks for free

When you stare at my face
You're messing with my brain
If you try to convince me
Then you better think again

If you move to the music
The music's got to give
If it's too complicated
That's the way I wanna live

If you hate me I will show you
How to break me into something new
If you want me run away now
If you stop me then I'll hit the ground
Round we go, here we go

Round round baby round round
Spend the night on me
I dont need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Explanations no you don't need one
Having a good time getting down to fun
And it's your time just tonight he'll be mine
Then he's gone yeah

People movin', bodies groovin'
Never ending players are changing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
All you need is a fierce sting

All my girls are here with me
Whiling out they've got their needs
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?

Round round baby round round
Spend the night on
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Round baby round round
Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Does it hurt when you see how I've done
Without you thought that I couldn't belong
Never thought that you could be so cruel
All you need is some friends won't be by yourself
Let's go round and round and round and round and round

Round round baby round round
Spend the night on
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Round baby round round
Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Round baby when I go
When I go, when I go, when I go
Round baby when I go
When I go, when I go, when I go

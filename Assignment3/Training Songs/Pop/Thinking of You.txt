Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

No matter how I try I don't find a reason why
Believe me it's no lie
I always have you on my mind
No matter what I see guess where I want to be
"Ove is the answer I will find

Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

No matter where I go
This is the only show
I'd like to be a part
Come on and take my heart
No matter where you are
Baby I can't be far
Cause I'll be with you all the time

Thinking of you
Think about you all the time

This feelin' deep inside
When you're right by my side
I'll always be with you
Believe me this is true
Whenever we apart
You're deep with in my heart
Cause you'll be with me all the time

Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

Come on and take my heart
No matter where you are
Baby I can't be far
Cause I'll be with you all the time

Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

Thinkin' of you I'm thinkin' of you
Whenever I'm blue I am thinkin' of you

You know he was the type that never left me alone
Until I really needed to reach him on the telephone
He was nowhere to be found, he was out with the boys
Driving all around the city in his pretty new toy

1:
Never gonna get it together, uh huh, uh huh
Never gonna get any better, uh huh, uh huh
Should I stay or should I go, cause I really need to know
Or do I stick around and cry, cause now it?s time to say goodbye
(please baby please, please baby)

2:
I ain?t got nobody, that I can depend on
Just me, myself and i
I ain?t got nobody, that I can depend on

Then there was the one that couldn?t make up his mind
He?s always checking every chicky at the check-out line
He told me "baby, I?m just looking, I never would
touch"
Then I catch him with alicia at the back of the bus

Repeat 1
Repeat 2 x2

2, 4, 6, 8, why don?t you appreciate..me?
 Adios, amigo, bye bye
(please baby, please baby)
Me, me, me, that?s the way it?s supposed to be
(please baby, please baby)
Can you believe this?

 Repeat 2 x3

If your heart could talk I wonder what it would tell me
If your mind could walk would it bring me a love never ending
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

All your days have gone a goin' to a go-go
Now the time has come, is it gonna be a no no, no no
I've got to know
I've got to know
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

Tell me every little thing that makes you happy, Oh oh oh
Every little thing that makes you glad
All of the secrets that you hide I got to know
Whoa, every little thing

You've gotta stop all your reservations
Am I for the chop or is it celebrations?
Yes, I've got to know
I've got to know
No secrets anymore
You've got to tell me

Tell me every little thing that makes you happy, Oh oh oh
Every little thing that makes you glad
All of the secrets that you hide I got to know
Whoa, every little thing

Tell me every little thing
Every little thing 

Tell me every little thing that makes you happy, Oh oh oh
Every little thing that makes you glad
All of the secrets that you hide I got to know
Whoa, every little thing

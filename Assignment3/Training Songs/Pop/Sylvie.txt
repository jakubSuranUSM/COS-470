Seventeen, high-school queen,
Yeah you're pretty cute, I can see.
Well you've come a long way since September,
But, Sylvie, you oughtta remember,

You know he's mine.
You know he's mine.
You know he's mine.

Sylvie, girl, I'm a very patient person,
But I'll have to shut you down,
If you don't give up your flirting.
Leave him alone, ''cause I know he loves me.
Leave him alone, ''cause he tells me he loves me.

Over and over and over and over again.
Over and over and over and over again.

Seventeen, high-school queen,
Yeah you're pretty cute, I can see.
Well you've come a long way since September,
But, Sylvie, you oughtta remember,

You know he's mine.
You know he's mine.
You know he's mine.

Sylvie, girl, although you're my little sister,
Well you're not without your charms,
I'm not sure that he'll resist you.
Give it all up, for we see you crying.
Give it all up, ''cause I know you've been trying.

Over and over and over and over again.
Over and over and over and over again.

Over and over and over and over again.
(repeat to fade, with backing vocals of 'Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl.'

Oh yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah
On and onOn and onOn and on

Rap1:
On and on, keep movin´ on, and keep on clappin ´til the beats stays on
On and on, a love so strong, I look into your eyes and my heart is gone
On and on, hear my song, I love you know, but for just how long?
On and on, a love goes on, don´t stop ´til you hear this song
On and on, a love´s not gone, I feel your touch in the rising sun
On and on, my heart beats on, whisper in my ear when I feel your tongue
On and on, a love so strong, weak in your arms, ´til the break of done
On and on, my love goes on, don´t stop until you hear this song
don´t stop until you hear this song

Chorus:
On and on it´s the time for me to run away
On and on, stay with me the whole night through
Just keep on to wright up my lonely days
On and on, on and on
Oh yeah, on and on, yeah yeah, oh yeah
On and on, yeah yeah

On and on
On and on
Oh yea-yeah, oh yea-yeah, yea-yeah!

Rap2:
On and on, keep movin´ on, and keep on clappin ´til the beats stays on

On and on, a love goes on, don´t stop ´til you hear this, don´t stop ´til you hear this

Saw you
That was all I had to see
Wanted you 
Had to have you next to me
And from that moment
I knew that you'd be all I'd ever need

And there's a place inside my heart
Nobody's touched before
And when I found you, 
I found all that I've been searching for
You turned my world around

[Chorus:]
All I know 
Is it feels like forever
All I know 
Is I love the way it feels
All I see  
Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
It's all I know

Hold me 
Love as you rush to me
Is telling me
Let's put our hearts in the hands of fate
Time will tell us
It what we've got was worth the wait
And there's a fire 
That's been burning deep inside of me
And I don't need nobody else 
'Cause now you're here with me
You turned my world around

All I know 
Is it feels like forever
All I know 
Is I love the way it feels
All I see  
Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
Its all I know

I might have never met you
In another time or place
Now I never could forget you
I could never walk away

It's all I know

'Cause there's a place inside my heart
That nobody's touched before
And when I found you 
I found all that I've been searching for
You turned my world around

[Chorus x3]

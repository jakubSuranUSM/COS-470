Something cool went down
As I was walking with a friend of mine
And I, I still remember,
How she was smelling like the summer time

And oh, how it changed my mind
Changed everything, about that, come on girl

It feels so good, loving you
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, and I need oxygen,
Little bit of heaven doin' 24-7 again
Yeah, again and again

Like I was sayin'
My little cupid was real super freak
By the time that I came down
I'll get locked up in a room for a week

And oh, how she changed my mind
Changed everything about this crazy world

It feels so good, loving you
Yeah, it's so good, the way you do the do
It feels so good, yeah and by the way
Little bit of heaven 24-7 times a day

A long hair
A double dare
And I swear
A Little bit will do you some good
Say where

And I swear
Can't get enough of you, oh yeah yah

Senses start to falter
My vision is altered
There's a blind wind running
Through the trees
My memories
They deceive so cunningly

With no reply
With no reprieve
I try to chase what I believe
Into my mind
Where I lie
That everything's fine

But if I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

But if I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

I don't want to tell you goodbye
But I don't want to tell you a lie
This thing
This aching
Tears my heart and
Cuts me down to size

I don't remember
A time when things like this
Weren't so amiss
This abyss
I can't believe
I'm so naive to this

If I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

But if I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

If I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

If I could
Turn around
And if I could
Hear the sound
And if I could
Feel the ground
Falling beneath
Falling beneath me

If I could
Turn around
Hear the sound
Feel the ground
Falling beneath me

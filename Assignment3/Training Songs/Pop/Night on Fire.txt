Suitcase packed on the side of the road
Rainin' down from my head to my feet
It seems so strange in the back of my heart
That these sounds were never meant to believe

I'm set free and I'm ready to go
You can't stop me and you already know
The best days of our lives have yet to come

Two times back again this is really startin' to grow old
Two times back again with eyes that just can't see
Where we're going to so I'm just leavin'

Back and forth through the city we'll go
New sounds comin' out of the streets
Don't look back to the parody show
Of sellin' your souls to the beat

No one saw the night behind the sky
I bet you never wondered why
You're sitting here in the midst of nowhere

Two times and back again this is really startin' to grow old
Two times back again we're leavin' this behind
And when you hear from you'll know it when it's time
We're listenin' believin' that it's true
I feel it, you know I feel it!!!

Put your hands together and we'll light this night
We'll light this night on fireâ?¦

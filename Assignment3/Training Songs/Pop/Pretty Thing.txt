It's half past when I pick you up
You say I'm early so I wait in the front
Headlights in the pitch black
Good hearts in the far back
I remember we were blurring the glass
Hot breath as the time passed
Slow, well you were flipping through the radio
Singing don't stop, don't stop

Go where we won't think about it

Pretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up
Making noisy dreams
Sneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing
Fifty hands in the air but it's all wrong
When their hearts all sink
I feel lowest on the top floor maybe
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing

You trace lines on my winter thighs
You make me nervous so you're flashin' a smile
You say this is what friends do
I'm all dolled up for you
There's a letter on the top of my dash
It reads "Jones, you're a real catch"
Well, I was hoping it would work out like that
But it's a damn bust, let's just

Go where we don't think about it

Pretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up
Making noisy dreams
Sneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing
Fifty hands in the air but it's all wrong
When their hearts all sink
I feel lowest on the top floor maybe
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing

How could we not not think about it
How could we not not think about it
How could we not not think about it

Let's go where we won't think about it

Pretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up
Making noisy dreams
Sneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing
Fifty hands in the air but it's all wrong
When their hearts all sink
I feel lowest on the top floor maybe
It's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing

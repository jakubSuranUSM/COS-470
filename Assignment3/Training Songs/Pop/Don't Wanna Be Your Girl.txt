I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more
I just wanna see your face at home
Home

You can't do me right 
So I decide that

I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more
I just wanna see you up and out
Out of the door

I'm not living right
So I decide that

I don't wanna be your girl no more
No more

I won't hide the ways I've tried 
It's just not right
It's killing me tonight

Life ain't sweet
Damn shol ain't peachy 
jus keep ya head up
(oh babe)

As I dig deep inside my soul
Look into my past
And all that I had through these glass windows
I find myself wanderin all alone
About the ways that yesterday
Changed the path I chose
Oh

[Chorus]
ain't no tellin where I'd be
Dead or in the penetentiary
From shootouts wit my enemy
Squeeze until my clips empty
But would they give sin to me
By the hands that was lent to me
Know that it was meant to be
To take over this industry

[Lloyd talkin:]
Yea
Its goin down
No more gettin left behind
Its time to shine
Mind on my grind
Look

And only the Lord knows
If I don't succeed 
Then my family's left out in the cold
So I gotta play my cards

'Cause if I fold
No superstar
Expensive cars
Or designer clothes
Oh

[Chorus]

[Lloyd talkin']
Never feelin bad
Situations gettin sad
Gotta move on
Sun gone shine

Just wait til mornin
Yea
Outta all the struggles
All the pain

All the hurt
It's alright
Gotta be strong
Time moves on

No matter what
When situations get bad
When times get sad
Gotta keep yo mind up

Gotta keep ya grind up
From 99
Never let it behind

Just gotta stay ahead of the race
Keep up my pace
It won't be long
When a feelinz all I can take

I see my heartbreak
Just makes me strong
No matter what nobody say 
I got rhymes to make

I'm reachin for the throne
'Cause I know that my yesterday
Been the best of dayz
Just take it slow

[Lloyd talkin']
See
I know
N though I'm young
Money don't grow on trees

Only 18
But I done seen some shit
You know
Yea I run wild

Live the fast lane lifestyle
I can't help I'm a ghetto child
Its all good
Now I see

I hear now
Reach 8 feet
You know
ain't gotta smell that piss in the project halls

I gotta new place to stay now nigga
Yea
But uh
I'm a focus still

In the hood
I'm comin' back
Takin' all why'all niggaz wit me
Gotta do this together

Say what you need now you're through
It's up to me, not to you
Now I'm asking you to leave
I can hardly breathe

Go away, go away
It's a magic
I jumped on board
I wasn't thinking about anything

You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out

There is no way I can compare
To this love affair
I know this is the last time
'Cause you will never be mine

Go away, go away
It's a magic
I jumped on board
I wasn't thinking about anything

You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out

Oh my God
I'm not in love with you anymore
Now this is our time
Oh I changed my mind

You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out
You know we've got to work it out
Life's too short, let's work it out

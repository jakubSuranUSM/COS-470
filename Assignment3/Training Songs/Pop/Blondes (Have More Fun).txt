Is it a matter of opinion 
Or just a contradiction
But from where I come from 
All the blondes have more fun
Well just watch them sisters on a Saturday night
Peroxide causing all the fights 

I took a rose in Texas
She gimme plenty of practice
But I couldn't touch the surface
'Cause of recent face lift
She had no idea what love's about
'Cept the one o'clock call on the casting couch 

Sissy from New York 
Was on the cover of New Vogue
I ain't supposed to be available
So completely untouchable
I got a limousine 'n' bodyguard and chaperone
But God knows Rodder just needs to ball

You can keep your black and your red heads
You can keep your brunettes too
I want to girl that's semi intelligent
Gimme a blonde that's six feet two boy
And that ain't all

I had a crush on Bardot
Fell in love with Monroe
Read about 'em in the nationals
All the juicy little scandals
But I never saw 'em dancin' at the county hall
With the short fat guy's prematurely bald

Dig this

You can keep your black and your red heads
You can keep your brunettes too
Don't want to subservient woman
Gimme a blonde that's six feet two boy
And that ain't all

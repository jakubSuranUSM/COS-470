Last chance to buy before you fly
Last chance to buy before you fly

Okay
In the morning, you came to me in your towel
From ZÃ¼rich to New York
I wanted to share this with you all
Because even to me, it sounded ridiculous
But in the morning, after a long, complicated night
I made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
Everything before us
And all that's about to unfold

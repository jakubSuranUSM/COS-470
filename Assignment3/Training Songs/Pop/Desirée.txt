Everything returns again
both the laughter and the rain

she is living somewhere for a while
still I ask her in my lonely way to stay

Desiree Desiree 
now she's 
leaving

Desiree you know
how it hurts me
living alone through all the years
nothing can hold the tears in me

Everything remains the same
yet she answers not her name
still If I could
look beyond these skies
standing here again before my eyes I'd see

Desiree Desiree 
now she's 
leaving

Desiree you know
how it hurts me
where do i run to 
is it real
nothing but pain I feel for real

Desiree you know 
how it hurts me

living alone through all the years
nothing can hold the tears in me

Desiree

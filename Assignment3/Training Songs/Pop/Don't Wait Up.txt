Tell me why you have to be watching me
Nearly all the time
'Cause even when I look in the mirror now
I see you standing behind
That's right, that's right
Had enough of accusations and fights
Got me wound up tight
So don't wait up for me on Saturday night

I don't know why you're feeling the way you are
But something made you change
I tried to re-assure you so many times
But now I'm tired of the games

That's right, that's right
If you keep telling me I have, then I might
You can say what you like
Just don't wait up for me on Saturday night

You keep on saying you've lost your faith in me
Keep on telling me where I'm s'posed to be
But now I've got to the point where I just don't care
Yeah yeah

Everytime I pick up the telephone
I hear you there on the party line
You ask me if I'm sleeping with all your friends
But they ain't no friends of mine

That's right, that's right
Had enough of accusations and fights
Got me wound up so tight
So don't wait up for me on Saturday night

You keep on saying you've lost your faith in me
Keep on telling me where I'm s'posed to be
But now I've got to the point where I just don't care
Yeah yeah

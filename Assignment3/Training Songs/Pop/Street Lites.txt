Doorways
Corners
And the street lights dance in your eyes
Behind the cinema
In the 
Rain
In the subway
Where the walls crumble and cover you in fine dust
''cause we 
Haven't got a home to go to
Touch me
On the back seat, on the top deck
Talk dirty

On the back row
Can you feel me
Against you?
Oh no
We shouldn't
We shouldn't

We shouldn't
I want to
...mmmm...
What you gonna do
If you go home and he's not 
There?
It wouldn't be the same if we didn't know it was wrong
Oh touch me
And then 
Go wherever he takes you
Oh yeah leave me
And I'll walk it off in the rain somehow

Someone wants to watch by the side of Alena Stores
In the doorway, in the rain
Did he 
See us?
Do you care?
Pull the night-time tight around us
And we can keep each other 
Warm
While the cars drive by
En-route to dried-up dinners
And strip-lit kitchens and 
The smell of gas and potato peelings
What you gonna do if you go home and he's not 
There?
It wouldn't be the same if you didn't know it was wrong
Oh touch me
And then 
Go wherever he takes you
Oh yeah leave me
And I'll walk it off in the rain somehow 
Yeah
We've got to go on meeting like this
I don't want to live with you or anywhere 
Near you
I want to catch you unawares
Undressing in front of a window maybe

Impressed with those things I drive by
Did you see me?
Could you tell that I was 
Watching?
Did it make it feel better?
Yeah, it was good for me too
Did you think 
About me?
Oh did you close your eyes?
Think that maybe
It was my hand that was 
Touching you
My breath against your face?
And when you opened your eyes
Did the 
World tip off its axis for a few seconds?
And you thought you'd caught a tiny glimpse of 
Someone?
Something here with it's shoulders moving towards you?
Yeah I did too
And 
It felt good
And it felt good
And it felt good
In a strange kind of way
In a way 
That things that aren't supposed to feel good
Sometimes do
Oh take it away
Yeah

What you gonna do if you go home and he's not there?
It wouldn't be the same if you 
Didn't know it was wrong
Oh touch me
And then go wherever he takes you
Oh yeah leave 
Me
And I'll walk it off in the rain somehow
What you gonna do if you go home and he's 
Not there?
It wouldn't be the same if you didn't know it was wrong
Oh touch me
And 
Then go wherever he takes you
Oh yeah leave me
And I'll walk it off in the rain 
Somehow.

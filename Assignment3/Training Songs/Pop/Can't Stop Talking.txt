His eyes, his nose, his fingers, his toes
His smile when he says please
And when he sneezes, his sneeze
His arms, chest, coat, vest
His everything is sweeter than sweet
I try and try but honest to Pete

I can't stop talkin' about him
And talkin' about him and talkin' about him
I can't stop talkin' about the man that I adore
I can't stop talkin' about him
And talkin' about him and talkin' about him
I can't stop talkin' about him and though I seem a bore
I can't stop tellin' about him and yellin' about him
And tellin' about him
I can't stop hollerin' over the moment that we met

He had a pinstriped whatd'yecallit
A beautiful smile, a barrel of money
I can't stop talkin' about him yet

He kissed me a bell went "boing"
A whistle went "whoo"
A trapped door opened and I flipped right through
And now I can't stop talkin' about him
And talkin' about him and talkin' about him
And if he was yours, well neither would you!

Stop talkin' about him and talkin' about him,
And talkin' about him and talkin' about him
Until your face turned blue
Talkin' about him and talkin' about him,
Talkin' about him and talkin' about him
The whole day through

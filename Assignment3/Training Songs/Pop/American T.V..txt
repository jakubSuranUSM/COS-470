He was born diseased with a twisted mind
His hands his feet his elbows tied
Sleeps by the day and in the night he crys
The bastard son of a travelling man
Conceived and born in a caravan
Lives where he could and comes out when he can
Death of a rock star played by an actor
Gotta make a film 'cause he died in a fast car
With lots of booze drugs and sex
Make him up a demi God invent all the rest
Like character john's been trying it on
To get his picture in the news
He took a leap from his pad
The same place that his dad
Choked on a video so blue

This is the land of the free tuning in to 6 15
We'll always want but we'll never need on american tv
Searching for our liberty fight the fight to succeed
Living out the american dream on american tv

V for victory you s of a
Always search for the american way
Take a bite of the big apple kick a coca cola can
All stand up salute uncle sam
Put a man on the moon now ain't too soon
Another russian spy puts a spanner in and boom
From washington to tennessee
We put the bullets in the kennedys

Everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do, except you

I told the stars above
About the one I love
I told the morning sun
Yeah I'm telling everyone
I told my mum and dad
They seemed to understand
And I'll get through to you
If it's the last thing that I do

Everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do, except you

Everybody knows that I live for you
Everybody knows that I adore you
Everybody knows that it's true, except you

I told all of my friends
Again and again and again
I drove them round the bend
So now you're my only friend
I told the passers by
I made a small boy cry
And I'll get through to you
If it's the last thing that I do

'cause everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do, except you

I'm going crazy baby
What do I have to do?
You know I love you baby
Maybe you love me too
Everybody knows that I live for you
Everybody knows that I adore you
Everybody knows that it's true, except you
Except you, except you, except you
How come everybody knows, except you?

Oh everybody knows that I love you
And everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do, except you

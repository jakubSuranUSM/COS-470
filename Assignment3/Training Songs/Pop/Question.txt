I used to hit you after midnight
You were over on the west side, west side
I was always on your best side
Giving you the best times, best times
Never thought we'd hit a red light
Then you had to go and switch sides, switch sides
Wait a minute girl, I think you're forgetting

Way more than material
You had all my affection, my attention, oh
Now you out here on the streets asking for blessings
Out here beggin', oh

And I tell you all the time
But you don't get it, you don't get it, no
So try to hit my guilty conscious with a text
Like who you texting, oh
Question

I thought I told you I don't mess with you no more these days, ooh
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days
So you can't come back to me, oh
Once you leave girl, then you leave
But now you can't come back to me
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days
 
I ain't playing if you say so
I was never unfaithful, faithful
Don't act up around your lame fall
And try to call me on your way home, way home
You took your heart off the table, table
So who the one to blame for, blame for?
Wait a minute girl, I think you're forgetting

Way more than material
You had all my affection, my attention, oh
Now you out here on the streets asking for blessings
Out here beggin', oh

And I tell you all the time
But you don't get it, you don't get it, no
So try to hit my guilty conscious with a text
Like who you texting, oh
Question

I thought I told you I don't mess with you no more these days, ooh
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days
So you can't come back to me, oh
Once you leave girl, then you leave
But now you can't come back to me
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days

No, baby I ain't coming back
Don't you think I'm ever coming back
I've been good on my own, now
I found somebody I can trust now

So baby I ain't coming back
I made a change and I stuck to that
Feeling better on my own now
I'm doing better on my own
My own, my own, my own, yeah

I thought I told you I don't mess with you no more these days 
(Thought I told you I don't mess with you no more)
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days
So you can't go back to me, oh
Once you leave girl then you leave, oh
No, you can't come back to me
I thought I told you I've been loving someone else these days

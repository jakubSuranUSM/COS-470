One day when I came home at lunchtime I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbor called Peter and a flux capacitor

He told me he'd built a time machine like one in a film I've seen yeah, yeah

He said
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great-granddaughter is pretty fine (Is pretty fine)

He took me to the future in the flux thing and I saw everything
Boy bands and another one and another one and another one
Triple breasted women swim around town totally naked

We drove around in the time machine like one in a film I've seen Yeah, yeah

He said
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great-granddaughter is pretty fine (Is pretty fine)

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Michael Jackson
I took a trip to the year 3000
this song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album

We drove around in the time machine like one in a film I've seen
Yeah, yeah

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great-granddaughter is pretty fine
She's pretty fine

He said
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your great, great, great-granddaughter is pretty fine

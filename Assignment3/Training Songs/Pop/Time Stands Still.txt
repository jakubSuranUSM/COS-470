Him and her
Life is turned.
The day I knew you would leave
I can barely breath
Can you hear me scream

O-o-o thrown in all directions
You epitome of perfection
She's lost her will,
Time is standing still

He walks, her, home
Now he walks a-lone
The days they turn into years
The eyes they drown in tears

Can you hear me scream

The way we are the way they were
(It's just a shadow of what's wrong)
The time with you the time is stirred
(I love you for , so long)
The hearts they turn, they turn away
(she says to go please don't you cry)
Love lost was found, night turns to day

Time is standing still

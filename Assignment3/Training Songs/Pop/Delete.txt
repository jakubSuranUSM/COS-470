Don't forget about the stars, the sky
Lucid as the air that blows and light, that shines
Just a way to figure out her when the night is long
Take a little wander outside through the rain and snow
Just a way to figure out her
Don't delete my baby, don't defeat her still
In the quiet of nothing, to the hands of grace
Don't delete my baby, don't defeat her now
Don't delete my baby, won't you always find
Gonna shine a diamond, like you never did
Gonna show you something, I can't be taught
Don't delete my baby, I find chrous now

You know that I belong to be, reflections of myself
Let it all out, just let it all out
To find, the feeling

Don't take it to the one, in mind
Always know it needs her to belong, to find
Know that when I do, watch it face the place
Take a little wander outside, through the rain and snow
Just a way to figure out her

Don't defeat my baby, don't delete her still
In the quiet of nothing, to the hands of grace
Don't delete my baby, don't defeat her now
Don't defeat my baby, won't you always find
Gonna shine a diamond, like you never did
Gonna show you something, I can't be taught
Don't delete my baby, I find chrous now

You know that I belong to be, reflections of myself
Let it all out, just let it all out
To find, feeling coming

So great, don't wait (Just let it all out)
Wait for me tonight, open the door

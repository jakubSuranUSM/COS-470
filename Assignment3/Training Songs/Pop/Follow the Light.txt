There are things in life that you can't explain.
Like the hands of time and the sunshine after the rain.
The sunshine after the rain.
You can the search the stars. You can roll the dice.
But you never know it until you look inside.
Until you look inside.

Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Into the corners of your mind.
Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Then you will find the truth in time.

You can hide away. Maybe close your eyes.
You can try to run but you're running out of time.
You're running out of time.
You can build the wall that may touch the sky.
But the night will fall and the truth is far behind.
The truth is far behind.

Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Into the corners of your mind.
Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Then you will find the truth in time.

You can search the stars. You can roll the dice.
But you never know it until you look inside.

Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Into the corners of your mind.
Follow the light. Follow the light.
Follow the light. Then you will find the truth in time.

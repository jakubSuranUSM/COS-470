Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Took a walk and passed your house late last night
 All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
 From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
 Oh what a lovely couple they made
 Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
 Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
 Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouettes on the shade
 I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
 "Let me in or else I'll beat down your door"
 Saw two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
 My heart skipped a beat I was on the wrong street
 Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
 Loved you like I've never loved you my sweet
 Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
 All of our days two silhouettes on the shade
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Two silhouettes on the shade

I thought so much about you that day
It was a perfect day but I couldn't enjoy it without you
I wish it didn't mean so much when I grabbed you by the hand
Sometimes I think too much about things

I think I gave you too much time
But it feels like I want to give to something back
For everything you mean to me
I want to give to something back for everything you mean to me

Jackie, Jackie spend this winter with me
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I just can't make up your mind
Tonight, tonight we fly

Oh, Jackie, Jackie I still wait by the phone
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I don't wanna be alone
So come along with me tonight

Why do I always end up in situations that are bad for me?
And how come I don't fall in love with normal people?
And why don't normal people fall in love with me?
I don't think I'm that strange, do you think I'm strange?

I don't intend to
It's just that things very easily get complicated around me
It's just that things very easily get complicated
Get complicated, get complicated around me

Jackie, Jackie spend this winter with me
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I just can't make up your mind
Tonight, tonight we fly

Oh, Jackie, Jackie I still wait by the phone
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I don't wanna be alone
So come along with me tonight

Hey, Jackie, please come with me
And you'll see that my love will take you high above, baby

Jackie, Jackie spend this winter with me
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I just can't make up your mind
Tonight, tonight we fly

Oh, Jackie, Jackie I still wait by the phone
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I don't wanna be alone
So come along with me tonight

Jackie, Jackie I still wait by the phone
Oh, Jackie, Jackie I don't wanna be alone
So come along with me tonight

Rose was having a problem
She held the answer in her hand
But on this auspicious occasion
She didn't really understand
I went to meet her at the station
Her famous hat was pulled down low
A crowd of people stood there laughing at her
Rose was a shadow of before
Keep taking those back roads
That's all I ever heard her say
Don't take no for an answer
Yet she slowly slid away
Keep taking those back roads
That's all I ever heard her say
Don't take no for an answer
Oh that's all she would say
Back roads, black rose, blues again
Now Rose was getting down forever
She never really ever stood a chance
I watched her life that's pilling out before her
Just like wine, just like wine
Spilling over the side
And every time I reach a crossroads
In my life and I don't know which way to go
A voice is stirring deep inside of me
It is the voice of old black Rose
She said
Keep taking those back roads
That's all I ever heard her say
Don't take no for an answer
Yet she slowly slipped away, yeah
Keep taking those back roads
That's all I ever heard her say
Don't take no for an answer
Hey, black rose slipped away
Back roads, black rose, you got the blues again
Back roads, black rose
Black rose, black rose

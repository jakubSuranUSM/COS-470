Happy, spinning, clapping, laughing, dancing
In the blackness of magic
Get it, have it, bag it, throw yourself on the aeroplane 
And fly like magic
 
No sleep, no chance, no need, forget about it
One life, live free, big dreams, we're all about 'em
You're finding it, take it, take it in, it's all here
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now
 
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I,
And it ain't me, it ain't you, it's only us, it's us right now
You're finding it, take it, take it in, it's all here
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now
 
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I
And it ain't me it ain't you its only us its us right now
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right here
You and I no one else, nothing else but you and I
 
You & I, you & I, you & I, you & I

Time is not a constant my friend
You can't talk me out of that one again
Yeah like when we gave ourselves the bends
To a land I'll never understand
 
Speed it up or if you mean it slow it up a little bit
Just to speed it back up again
Hand me up, oh sit me down, and I won't ham it up
Or simmer down with it bredrin
Nothing else but us right now
 
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I
And it ain't me, it ain't you, it's only us, it's us right now.
You're finding it, take it, take it in, it's all here
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now
 
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I
And it ain't me it ain't you its only us its us right now
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right here
You and I no one else nothing else but you and I
 
You & I, you & I, you & I, you & I

You & I, you & I
Oh-oh-oh, hard to find the words to tell
Oh-oh-oh, the story of you and I girl
Oh-oh-yeah, even though there's nothing left just
You and I, no one else, nothing else but you and I

You & I, you & I, (ain't nobody else) you & I, you & I
You and I no-one, else nothing else but you and I
You & I, you & I (to me ain't nothing else) you & I (yeah ain't nobody else) you & I
You and I no-one, else nothing else but you and I

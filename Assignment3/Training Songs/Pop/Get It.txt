At 1 a.m., we go for gold
At 1 a.m., when we, we lost control
At 1 a.m., oh yeah, god damn, god damn
We don’t want to go home

At 1 a.m., no wrong and right
Shades of grey
Black as the night

We all sing along
But the notes are wrong

Get it
Get it
Get it

At 1 a.m., let’s make mistakes
At 1 a.m., when we, we cut the brakes
At 1 a.m., oh yeah, god damn, god damn
We don’t want to go home

We all sing along
But the notes are wrong

Get it
Get it

Get it
Get it
Get it

We all sing along
But the notes are wrong

Get it
Get it
Get it

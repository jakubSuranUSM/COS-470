Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from a-far

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

And then they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little Boy was born

Hark now hear the Angels sing
A King was born today
And Man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

Oh my Lord
You sent your Son to save us
Oh my Lord
Your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord
That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord
When in the crib they found Him
Oh my Lord
A golden halo crowned Him
Oh my Lord
They gathered all around Him
To see Him and adore

This day will live forever
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
They had become to doubt you
Oh my Lord
He is the truth forever

What did they know about you?
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
But they were lost without you
They needed you so bad
His light is shining on us

Oh my Lord, oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
With the Child's adoration
Oh my Lord oh my Lord
He is a personation
There came great jubilation
Oh my Lord
So praise the Lord
That sin may not enslave us

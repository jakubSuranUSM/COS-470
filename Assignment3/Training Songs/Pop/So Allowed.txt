Under the sun sleeping
So we'd rehearse evenings
It was in every word somehow
And I was in return so allowed

How we began to see things
Seems in reverse sweeping
It was in every word somehow
And I was in return so allowed

I want to say you're mine
Oh I want to say you're mine
I want to say you're mine
Oh I want to say you're mine

Hoo-ah
Hoo-ah

I've been lyin' here so lonely
I've been wishin' you would telephone me
Oh, I just can't lose this desperation
Won't you bring around a new sensation?
Baby, you got lots of energy, yeah
Gonna give that energy to me, yeah
Tell you, we could have a real good time, yeah
Baby, I can make you mine, oh mine, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You don't have to knock on my door

Kick it right down
Kick it right down
Kick it right down

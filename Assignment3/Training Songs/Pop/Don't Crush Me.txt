He strokes her hair (but it doesn't really matter)
She says she cares (has no fealing at all)
She told herself to hold on tight when the green was there

All I know is, all I feel
But I'm afraid to feel it

Don't crush me
Don't break me
Been trying to turn the end around
But I can see it coming
Don't rush me
Don't break me
Make me forget

She hears his voice (but she doesn't really listen)
It's all just noice (feeling the air)
She has to tell him but she's waiting waiting waiting

But all I know, is all I feel
But I'm afraid to feel it

Don't crush me
Don't break me
Been trying to turn the end around
But I can see it coming
Don't rush me
Don't break me
Make me forget

It's all around me
It's all around me
It's all around me
But I won't see it
It's all around me
It's all around me
Make me forget

Don't crush me
Don't break me
Been trying to turn the end around
But I can see it coming
Don't rush me
Don't break me
Make me forget

Don't crush me
Don't break me
Been trying to turn the end around
But I can see it coming
Don't rush me
Don't break me
Make me forget
Make me forget
Make me forget

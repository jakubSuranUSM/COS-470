It is not too late to carry on
So you've made mistakes, and here's another one
Oh, but you deserve another chance
Chasing 'round until you phase yourself

[Chorus:]
The world is flat and we're insane
And we have fallen off again
It really helps to know the way
What if you take more than you deserve? 
(more than you deserve)
What if you give all and you get nothing back?
Sell your soul, nature's stereo
Take your favorite songs and sail away

The world is flat and we're insane
And we have fallen off again
The world is round and we are mad
And world opinion's where it's at
Don't make this so
Don't take the blow
The world is flat and we're insane

I won't be sad, I won't be sorry
I've no regrets and I don't worry
I'll roll this sail and I won't let go
I'd rather wait until tomorrow
There are some who do, and some do not (there are some who don't)
There are some who can't and we're the other ones
Shave your face, let your body go
Take your favorite songs and sail away

The world is flat and we're insane
And we have fallen off again
The world is round and we are mad
And world opinion's where it's at
Don't make this so
Don't take the blow
The world is flat and we're insane

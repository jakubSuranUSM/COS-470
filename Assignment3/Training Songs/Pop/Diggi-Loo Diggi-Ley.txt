Lightning and thunder, magic and wonder
I don't know how, but it did happen to me
(You felt your heart was set free)

What a sensation (You're flying up high now)
Sweet inspiration (You're going to the sky now)
Couldn't believe I was dreamin'
Couldn't believe it was true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, life is goin' my way
When I'm walkin' in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

Golden reflections givin' directions
Bringin' the best that I have right out of me
(How in the world could this be?)

Knowing' your senses (What burning desire)
Climbin' the fences (It's taking you up higher)
Now I believe I can make it
Ohâ€¦ what a wonderful world

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, life is goin' my way
When I'm walkin' in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of has suddenly come true

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

I know my dream was a fantasy illusion
But when I woke up, I came to the conclusion
I can be what I want to
Oh, oh

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

Please don't wake me up
I'm dreamin' of me in golden shoes

Right Said Fred: Stand Up (For The Champions)

I was built to be the best
Number one and nothing less
Leave me to my destiny
I have waited patiently
I have vision' oh I believe
I know I can count on me

(chorus)
So stand up for the champions
For the champions stand up
Stand up stand up
For the champions for the champions
Stand up for the champions
For the champions stand up
Stand up stand up
For the champions for the champions
Stand up

Here we go it's getting close
Now it's just who wants it most
It's just life that's how it is
Cause we have our strength and weaknesses

Oh I have vision' oh can't you see
I'm on the move make way for me

(chorus)

4x
And when I fall down
I have to pick myself back up

So stand up stand up for the champions
For the champions stand up
Stand up stand up
For the champions for the champions
Stand up

4x
Stand up stand up
For the champions for the champions

Stand up

This one way love affair ain't fair, it ain't fair to me
It's all give and take and you just take
I can't take it you see
Well, I'm givin' up on love this time
Me and my friends, we'll do just fine

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

You said someday I'd have a whole lotta money,
I'd be a millionaire
But when that didn't happen over night
I found out how much you really cared
Well, all you want is a whole lotta money
All the rest is just jivin' honey

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

Well, I'm going out on the town tonight
And get as wild as I can be
I'm gonna find out what it's really like to be lose, high and free
Well, I don't care what the people say
I'm changin' my mind, I'm changin' to stay

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
You've done nothing for me
You've done nothing
You've done nothing
You've done nothing for me

I'm in love with a girl I hate,
She enjoys pointing out
Every bad thing about me
I'm in love with a critic and a skeptic.
A traitor,
I'd trade her in a second

She's a backseat driver,
A drama provider,
An instant update of the world
Shes a first class liar,
A constant forgetter
(She's attractive, but bitter)

Did you scream enough to make her cry,
To turn around,
Turn around baby,
Don't return to me,
If you think that I'm not worth your time.

[Chorus]
She's a lady,
And ladies
Shouldn't be messed with.
She's a lady,
And ladies,
Shouldn't be messed with.

Take off your shoes,
Come in the room,
And baby let's try not to argue,
Turn out the lights,
Turn on the radio,
How can we fight when I'm too busy loving you,
I'm too busy loving you
I'm too busy loving you

Did you scream enough to make her cry,
To turn around,
Turn around baby,
Don't return to me.
If you think that I'm not worth your time.

[Chorus]

Here I am,
There you go again,
Again
And we will not ever be eighteen again, again

And I'm worn out of fighting,
And every night you leave crying,
And I could use some time.
And here I am,
There you go again. (Again)

So here I am I'm dying,
And I'm waiting for you,
Waiting for you.
Come back, come back to me,
And I'll take you gladly.
And I'll take you where to go.

Did you scream enough to make her cry,
To turn around,
Turn around baby.
Don't return to me,
If you think that I'm not worth your time.

Did you scream enough to make her cry,
To turn around turn around baby, don't return to me.
If you think that I'm not worth your time.

[Chorus]

Jacob's ladder
Like rusty old nails, at the bottom of the sea
Telling no tales, for the good of the Admiralty
You jump when you're told to, through the open door
And the King of Norway, hes the man you all died for

[Chorus:]
On this, Jacob's Ladder
The only way up is down
Three days in the water
Watching all the secrets drown
Jacob's Ladder

"And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain"

A thousand lifetimes, left standing at the docks
In the bar down in Whitehall, they're sure the boat won't rock
In a file marked secrets in a drawer kept closed
Nobody wonders, because nobody knows

[Chorus]

"And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain"

[Chorus]

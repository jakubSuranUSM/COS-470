When you find yourself alone
And when going out is coming home
You can count on the kid
'Cause there's nobody waiting around

Oh, oh, if you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know, I know when it's coming
I thought so anyway

Somethings stay the same
And some are due for a change
I thought I had them all nailed down

But you turned it around, boy
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

Well, I still can't say I know
When a love is real or touch and go
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes

Oh, oh, am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me
I say, I say, I say, I say
That I want it, I think so anyway

Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along

Oh, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it, yeah

I know, I know, I know, I know
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I didn't it really plan it
But you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I want someone that proves I am wrong
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

You're messing with my love life
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
You did it, you did it
You did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I'm hear to tell you that
I'm fleeting like a butterfly
There's no denying that
I always loved the highlife
 
Never needed real emotion
I get my feelings from a magazine
I don't know where you got the notion
I be the one fulfilling all your needs
 
I'm here to tell you that
I'm fleeting like a butterfly
There's no denying that
I always loved the highlife
 
Get physical tonight
The world's alive
Get physical in the light
This is our time
Get physical tonight
We're riding high
Get physical in the light
Going out - feel alright
It's a magical night 
It's a magical night 
It's a magical night 
It's a magical night 
 
You can't desert me
I'm always going when I just arrived
There ain't no memories gonna hurt me
'Cause all I live for is tomorrow night
 
I'm here to tell you that
 
Get physical tonight 
 
Sorry, I'm not a lady
I ain't afraid to pick a fight
I'm here to conquer the dancefloor
And the limelight delight
 
I'm here to tell you that
 
Get physical tonight
Get physical in the light
Get physical tonight
Get physical in the light
Going out feel alright
 
Get physical tonight
The world's alive
Get physical in the light
This is our time
Get physical tonight
We're riding high
Get physical in the light
Going out feel alright
 
Get physical tonight
Feel alright
Get physical in the light
Going out, feel alright
It's a magical night

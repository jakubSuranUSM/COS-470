You don't know when to stop
Making your demands
To meet you more than halfway I've done all I can
You're one of those whose hunger grows
You think my very life you own
I'll give you all I've got to give but I won't bleed for you
I can forget, I can forgive but I won't bleed for you

You may not understand me
So let me make it c1ear
If you think you can bend me, shape me
You'll never keep me here
You're one of those who craves control, but
That's not the love I'm looking for

I'll give you all I've got to give but I wont bleed for you
I can forget, I can forgive but I won't bleed for you
I'll take the bad, 1'11 take the good
But I need freedom
I said I need freedom

You snap your fingers and maybe some will come running
If you end up lonely, well baby, you've got it coming
You
You should learn to love me as I am
As I am

No, no, oh

You're one of those who craves control, but
That's not the love I'm looking for

I'll give you all I've got to give but I won't bleed for you
I can forget, I can forgive but I won't bleed for you
I'll take the bad, I'll take the good but I need freedom too
I'll give you all I've got to give but I wont bleed for you

I can forget, I can forgive but I won't bleed for you
I'll take the bad, I'll take the good but I need freedom
I'll give you all I've got to give but I won't bleed for you

Look at me I'm not the man I used to be
When she smiles at me
I live the light I used to see

There she goes and I know
On my own
I'm not whole

Can't believe
She can't see
That she's taken the best part of me

[Chorus]
I'm half a man with half a heart
With nothing left to tear apart
Half of me is walking 'round
The other half is on the ground
She mends me

What's to see I had it all in front of me
It's all on me
All in the name of vanity

There she goes and I know
On my own
I'm not whole

Can't believe 
She can't see
That she's taken the best part of me

[Chorus]

Tell me where I am
Nothing else can replace her
How do I go on the way I am

[Chorus]

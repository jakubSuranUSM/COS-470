In the name of...
In the name of...
In the name of...

Hey you,
I've seen your face before
It's you in the picture which hangs on my bedroom wall
Is it true? All of those things that they say about you
So tell me, tell me, tell me what am I supposed to do
(chorus)
In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
Well it's fun to think that I'm having the time of my life
And it's true if all this around us is paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
But now I want to be left here with nothing at all
Even the picture has fallen away from the bedroom wall
(REPEAT CHORUS x 2)
In the name of...
In the name of...
In the name of...
(REPEAT CHORUS x 2)
In the name of love
(REPEAT CHORUS x 2)

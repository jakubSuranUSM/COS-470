I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever to know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me wait too long
 
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
Can't you see I've waited too long to love you 
To hold you in my arms
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me wait too long
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me

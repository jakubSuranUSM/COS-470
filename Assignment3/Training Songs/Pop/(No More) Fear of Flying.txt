(Gary Brooker / Keith Reid)
There was no more fear of flying
Once the final word were spoke
There was no more tears of crying
It had all become a joke
Though they took a vow of silence
Still the rumours quickly spread
There was no more point in trying
For the great affair was dead
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more tortured brow
They had dropped the safety curtain
They had killed the sacred cow
There was everything to live for
There was nothing to explain
They had left the scene, triumphant
They would live to fight again
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain

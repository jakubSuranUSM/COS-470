I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I’m all alone
But I am nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
But she feeling low she feeling sad
I would take credit for what’s wrong
But I am nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

Now here you show up with the force of a wave
And so I'm setting my sail, I’m headed for the empire state
Hey hey lord, I don’t want to lose this one, she make me feel whole
You know, I am nothing without love

Oh baby show me a sign
Send up a signal, that everything’s fine
Come on slide up right here by my side
You know that I want to rest in your light

I am nothing without love
I’m just these thoughts without a pen
And I would take credit for this song
But I am nothing without love

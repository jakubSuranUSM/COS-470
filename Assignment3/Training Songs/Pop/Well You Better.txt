Heard your voice in my head too soon
Pass girl, say it
It all could come, oh baby make up your mind
Please make up your mind

So we let a stone unturned
Maybe that's a lesson learned yea
I didn't wish you'd turn that much
Please make up your mind

There's always more to see but it'll keep go another day hard
We can't have the light
And everything's fine now
Please make up your mind

But if it's up, it's up to me
Baby make up your mind 
Baby make up your mind
Oh baby make up your mind fore it's too late

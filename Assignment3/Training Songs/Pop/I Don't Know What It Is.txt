I don't know what it is but
It makes me feel I'm crazy
I don't know what it is but
It makes reality hazy
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love

I don't know what it is but
It's a feelin' that moves me
I don't know what it is but
It sends a shiver running through me
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
It might be love

I don't know what it is but
It makes my heart beat faster
I don't know what it is but
It has become my master
I don't know what it is but
It has a taken control
I don't know what it is but
It's taken my very heart and soul

I don't know what it is but
It's this feelin' that moves me
I don't know what it is but
It sends these shivers running through me
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love
I don't know what it is but
I got the feeling that it might be love

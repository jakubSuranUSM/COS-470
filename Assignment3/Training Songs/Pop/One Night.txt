Where are we now
I cant come down
I’m dreaming
And they scream so loud
I don’t know how
I’m breathing

I need one night, to get away from it all
I need one chance, don’t let me fall
I need one life, to get lost in the sound
Just for one night, I don’t wanna be found
I don’t wanna be found
(I need one night, one night)
(I need one night, one night)
I don’t wanna be found.

So far from real
But I want to feel
You near me
We’re moving still
And I wonder will
You hear me?

I need one night, to get away from it all
I need one chance, don’t let me fall
I need one life, to get lost in the sound
Just for one night, I don’t wanna be found
I don’t wanna be found
(I need one night, one night)
(I need one night, one night)
I don’t wanna be found.

My heart’s beating too fast
We wouldn’t want it to slow
Still we can make it to last
We’re perfectly out of control
One touch, with that one mind
On this one stage and this one mic
We’re all one heart in this one world
So all we need is just one night

I need one night, to get away from it all
I need one chance, don’t let me fall
I need one life, to get lost in the sound
Just for one night, I don’t wanna be found

I need one night (I’m dreaming)
I need one night, I need one, one, one, one
One night (I’m dreaming)
I need one night, one night
I don’t wanna be found

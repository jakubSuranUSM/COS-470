Your feet move just like a dancer
Your soul beats just like a drum
Tomorrow has all the answers
Today says we've just begun

Don't you feel the sun on your face?
Hopeful hearts of the human race
Shining down from above

We're golden
Burn like the stars, stay golden
Straight from your heart
With a voice sayin' "I'll never give in"
Get knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are

Live your life like you're stealing
Every little moment in time
Infinity goes on forever
Lay your life on the line

Don't you feel the sun on your face?
Hopeful hearts of the human race
Wrapped in the arms of love

We're golden
Burn like the stars, stay golden
Straight from your heart
With a voice sayin' "I'll never give in"
Get knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are

We're not young, and we're not old
We're the stories not yet told
Won't be bought and can't be sold
We are golden

We're golden (golden)
Burn like the stars, stay golden (golden)
Straight from your heart
With a voice sayin' "I'll never give in"
Get knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are
Golden

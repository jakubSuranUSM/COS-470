You shoot me glances and they're so hard to read
I misconstrue what you mean
Slip me a napkin and now that's a start
Is this your name or a doctor's eye chart?

I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart

Thanks for the book, now my table is ready
Is this a library or bar?
Between the covers I thought you were ready
A half-angel, half-tart

I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart

Do I read you correctly, you need me directly
Help me with this part
Do I date you?  Do I hate you?
Do I got a dyslexic heart?

You keep swayin', what are you sayin'?
Thinking 'bout stayin'?
Or are you just playing, making passes?
Well, my heart could use some glasses

Are you stayin'?
What are you sayin'?
Well are you swayin'?
Are you just playing, making passes?
Well, my heart could use some glasses

I try and comprehend you, I got a dyslexic heart
Do I read you correctly, I need you directly
Help me with this part
Do I love you?  Do I hate you?
I got a dyslexic heart?

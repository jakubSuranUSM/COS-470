We would like to resign somewhere along a wide mountainside
Sleep the street and sound of marching feet away or hide
We’ll give up on this town, the people who fill the air with their sound
Hear the noise of girls and boys abound. Rejoice
I love you for your wit, not for the shit you spout in your dreams
Brace the ground and love you finally found in me or leave
The wind won’t wait to blow you down
And leaves can change only so slow
So keep your legs on the concrete ground
The truth to find is in what we don’t know

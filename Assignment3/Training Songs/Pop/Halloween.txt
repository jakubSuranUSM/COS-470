Someone told me
The stars will fall only when I'm
I'm not looking
I'm not looking for anything tonight

The shape of these hands
That used to hold, grown over and wild
Whispered nonsense
Underneath the leaves like a child
In a pile

I would burn and heave
Sending ash into the eaves
Strip the paint with pounding rain
Here I'll make my home again and again
Again and again

See those searchlights
They'll never find a better life
Watch those taillights
Lend their red into my eyes

But I won't break this fall
Acting like a voodoo doll
Every move I don't intend
Here I'll make my home again and again
Again and again, again and again
Again and again

Someone told me
You came home last Halloween
Could it be you
Have a mask I haven't seen?
I haven't seen
I haven't seen
I haven't seen

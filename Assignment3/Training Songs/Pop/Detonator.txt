I'm so low, I hope you feel as low as I do
Now I'm down and I hope you're feeling just as down and out
And I'm so bored but not as bored as you are boring
I'm a bitch
But you've always known how to bring out my best

There's something you should know
I'm about to go
And this noise inside my head is like a detonator, detonator

I hate today, the night time hours is where I want to stay
I'm not confused, I know what I hate
I'm tired of the abuse
There's something you should know
I'm about to go
This noise inside my head is like a detonator
Detonator, detonator, detonator

I'm so low, I hope you feel as low as I do
Now I'm down, hope you're feeling just as down and out
There's something you should know
I'm about to go
And this noise inside my head is like a detonator
Detonator, detonator, detonator

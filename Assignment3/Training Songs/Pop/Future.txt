I feel like I'm penetrating water
And some quick sand rising to my knees
I'm breakin every room 
And attain everything what we said 
When we started out

And in church were praying
Cupid straight sprayin'
And I took my 5 shots in the heart

I don't need no medicine
All I really need is a touch from you
Girl I do see my future

When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future with you
I see my future
I see my future with you

I see me and you across the border
And the lights go on the water
Revealin' just for me
But with the drama that's been poppin' us
It would be a shame not to roll this

That fat lady ain't singin'
That news dollar ain't hangin
See she wanna take us back to the beginning

Another day was alright
We couldn't stand the fight
I just want you here with me
Please don't take away my future

When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future with you
I see my future
I see my future with you

You can catch me
Every day dreaming you
Any word that would be involved
Baby I wanna be more involved with you
And baby you're my future

When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
When I look into your eyes 
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future
I see my future with you
I see my future
I see my future with you

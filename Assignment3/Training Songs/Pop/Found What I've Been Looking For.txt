Always fine lines between us
They say our days don't mean much
Cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
But my ships have sailed and I'm here to tell that
I don't mean like the others
And I

I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

Should I wait, should I stay to see it
Arm fold 'cause I'm told, I need it
I'm not frightened to take off, step away
But my ships have sailed and I'm here to tell that
I don't mean like the others
And I

I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

I've been running round, running round, running round
Now I'm done and now I'm done now and now I'm done and now
Scared the magic might fade away

And I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

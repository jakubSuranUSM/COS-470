From the corner of my eye
To the back of my mind
I recognize what you mean to me
And all the corners of our pictures
Are a long time afraid
They still symbolize what you mean to me

You ask me to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
Well I'd be a fool to want more from you
And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do

I'll cry and you cry and we'll cry
Till the rain turns black
And the devil moves and clings to us
And for a moment there is beauty
It's not a simple yearning
Sometimes it feels like it's all I've gotten
It's all a dream

And I ask you to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
You'd be a fool to want more from me
And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do

From the corner of my eye
Through the back of my mind
I recognize what you mean to me

And the and promises captured in one kiss
We had and we seek and we squander
That there's more
Something more than me

And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do
It's all that I do
It's all that I do
It's all that I do

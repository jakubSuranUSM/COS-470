Met a girl and wrote a letter to get her
Asking her if she could fill a hole in my heart
Now I got myself all messed up just my luck
That she won't be buying and I should stop trying

Bought myself a brand new logo it's HUGO
But she don't notice me no matter how hard I try
Looked into a super hair do as you do
Kidding myself I'm a much cooler guy

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

Maybe she thinks I'm a loser to choose her
But I can't seem to get her out of my mind
Is it I'm dressed like a dummy, oh honey
I'm not that outdated just so underrated

Got a feeling like a phoney baloney
But I'd die for her if she would only be mine
Just one look this way would do me truly
You say hello before you say goodbye

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

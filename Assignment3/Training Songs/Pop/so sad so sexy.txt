Open your eyes
I'm right in front of you
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
I'm walking out on you for the last time

I keep on thinkin', why?
Do we keep makin'

I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm run down just like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lying with you one last time
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

Don't turn around
I'm not the one for you
Don't turn around

I keep on thinkin', why?
Don't have the guts to break it

I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm run down just like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lying with you one last time
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

All I want, just someone to stay
I can't spell it out, don't feel it

Darlin', I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm run down just like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lying with you one last time
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

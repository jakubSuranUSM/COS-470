You have to search high enough
What you couldn't never find
Took some time to gather some pieces of my mind
Feeling thankful every day for the love in my life

I wanna celebrate,celebrate all night
Celebrate,ohh,baby
I just wanna celebrate
Come a little night with me
Celebrate,uu,baby

You still belong to me girl,and so do I
We can take it slowly if you give it a try
...with my arms oopen wide
We can keep turning on like the wheel in the sky

I wanna celebrate,celebrate all night
Celebrate,ohh,baby
I just wanna celebrate
Come a little night with me
Celebrate,uu,baby

I wanna try it with you
Celebrate
I wanna celebrate,celebrate all night
Celebrate,ohh,baby
I just wanna celebrate
Come a little night with me
Celebrate,uu,baby

I wanna celebrate,celebrate all night
Celebrate,ohh,baby
I just wanna celebrate
Come a little night with me
Celebrate,uu,baby

I wanna celebrate,celebrate all night
Celebrate,ohh,baby
I just wanna celebrate
Come a little night with me
Celebrate,uu,baby
Celebrate the night
Celebrate

Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed.

Whatever colors you have in your mind
I show them to you and you see them shine.

Lay lady lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
Until the break of day, let me see you make him Smile.

His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.

Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.

Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you, ooh ooh

Lay across my big brass bed.
Stay lady stay

I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night

Stay lady stay, stay while the night is still ahead

Lay lady lay...
Stay... stay!...
Ahhh ahhhhhhh
Ohhhh

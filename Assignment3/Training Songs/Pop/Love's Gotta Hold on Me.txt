Here comes that same old feeling again
And I don't wanna let it go
Baby I just want you to know
That I love you so
I just wanna hold you
But if you wanna leave then I'll let ya baby
You know how I've tried to forget ya

Only love's gotta hold of my mind
Taking all of my time with you
I feel your skin next to me
I can hardly believe you're true
Don't say you love me if you don't care
But if you need me honey I'll be there
I'll always be there 'cause
Love's gotta hold of me love won't let go of me
Love's gotta hold on me

If I could wake with you every morning
See the sun shining in your eyes
I'd be so happy everyday
'cause you're here to stay
Like back in the old days
But if you wanna leave then I'll let ya baby
You know how I've tried to forget ya

Love's gotta hold of my mind
Taking all of my time with you
I feel your skin next to me
I can hardly believe you're true
Repeat to fade

Think I'll take a walk
And maybe it'll clear my head
Lord I'm so confused maybe
I'll just stay here in bed

'Cause I like when you invite
Your friends around
And I like it when we spend
The night on the town

I even like it when we're
Caught in a crowd
I don't know why but I can't decide
I just want to treat you right

But it ain't that simple
Every choice is hard to make
Baby ain't that simple
Hey Hey Hey

Since everything is
Comin' our way
Funny things start happening
Honey, when I see your face

A chemical reaction hits me
And I can't think straight
And I don't care if you
Want a weekend in Rome

And I don't care if you
Feel like staying at home
I'm even happy when we
Talk on the phone

I don't know why but I can't decide
I just want to treat you right
But it ain't that simple
Every choice is hard to make

Baby ain't that simple
Hey Hey Hey
Since everything is
Coming our way

'Cause I love you
Girl, I need you
And I don't care if you
Feel like hangin' around

I don't care if you
Want a night on the town
And lately I don't know
What's up from what's down

I don't know why but I can't decide
I just want to treat you right

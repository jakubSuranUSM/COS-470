***I could offer you a thousand things
But with a lot of them you wouldn't bother
I could buy ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another

*I could take a plane
And I could fly away
I could steal a car
And I could drive away

You have brought me a lot of things
But the main one that you brought was trouble
You put your finger to the trigger and you
Shot my heart
Well now, I'm really gonna burst your bubble

(* Repeat)

**(But I'm) in too deep
There's no gettin' out of it
In too deep
No doubt about it
In too deep
There's no gettin' out of it
In too deep
No doubt about it

Too deep, too deep
I could call you a lot of things
I could say there'd never be another
Every time the situation feels like getting hot
I gotta turn around and say don't bother

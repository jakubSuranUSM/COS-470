That's right
Yeah Carlprit, take it Let's go
Hey hey you're one in a million
And my heart feeling love you're so brilliant
Girl I've missed your love and your feelings hun
I never knew that you are my special one

Looking for that girl one in a million
To dance with you the night while we shouldn't hun
So I guess I've finally found my million

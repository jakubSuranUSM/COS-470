Yeah, oh yeah
Hey, girl, baby

I like the way that you're moving
Baby, don't stop what you're doing (yeah, yeah)
You know I came here for you, girl
I don't dance without you
I know you came for the music (for the music)
I know you came here to lose it (oh, yeah)
You got me so into you, girl
I don't dance without you

Last night I got too drunk
Last night I fell in love
It's not really like me
But girl, you surprise me
I got an open mind
If you wanna cross that line
You know where I'll be, I'll be

Slow down and just relax (slow down, down, down)
Hands on your waistline
Don't like to waste time
Sex written on your face
You never hesitate
I'll watch you all night, all night, yeah

Tell me what you want from me (tell me what you want)
Tell me what you need (tell me what you need)

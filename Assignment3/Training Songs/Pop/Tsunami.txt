For you my dear sister 
Holding onto me forever 
Disco dancing with the rapists 
Your only crime is silence 

Can't work at this anymore 
Can't move, I want to stay at home 
Tied up to all these crutches 
Never far from your hands 

Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk 

Doctors tell me that I'm cynical 
I tell them that it must be chemical 
So what am I doing girl 
Cry into my drink I disappear 

Eyes for teeth waving over me 
Bring down the shadows of my mind 
Sleep and breathe under our sheets 
Inhale the anxiety in-between, in-between, in-between, in-between 

Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Through September under the weather 

In-between, in-between, in-between, in-between 

Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Tsunami tsunami came washing over me 
Take the GI's I will have the spies

Moving at the speed of sound, you think I’d be slowing down
But I’m not losing my momentum
There are ways to turn around, so I don’t crash into the ground
I wish someone would invent them

Despite the pretty dress and curls
You don’t throw like other girls
You follow through

But I come on back, ’cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

Goin’ down but no one knew, I was losing altitude
I should’ve landed and I tried to
I never took my eyes off you, but I got dizzy and you threw
Me, you were right to

But I come on back, ’cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

I flew apart but they reattached me
I’m coming in hot, hope you catch me

But I come on back, ’cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

But I come on back, ’cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

Yeah, I would like to be your boomerang
Let me be your boomerang
I would like to be your boomerang

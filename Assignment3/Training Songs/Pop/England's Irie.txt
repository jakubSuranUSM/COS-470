(Okay, now some of this may sound stupid to some of you guys but I want you to hear me out. Now look, you know different people think about life in different ways. Lawyers think life is a big court room; Doctors probably thinks life is like a big operation; Bus drivers think life is...er...a big bus I guess. Who knows what the hell those guys think. Anyway, I've always thought of life as a big football game...) 

You get, I got goals 
You get, I get, the balls 

Cut the trigger, I fire like this 

England! 

Raise a glass, a perfect pass
and dribble around my socks 
Check my shirt and drink my shots 
And squeeze me in the box 
It's a digital football thing 
It's a football thing 
I live in a land of class hypocracy
We're going to win the national lottery 
E I Adio, I don't think so 

Now it's time, filling it up 
Into the net, never give up 
'Cause England's Irie 
England's Irie 

Cut the trigger, I fire like this 
Cut the trigger, I fire like this 

Hey diddle-diddle, there's a fella in the middle 
And I think he's pulling my string 
My wife's lactating and I'm spectating 
It's a football thing 
I live in a land of class hypocracy
We're going to win the national lottery 
E I Adio, I don't think so 

Win that ball, head for the goal 
Use your stealth, don't lose control 
Cross, into the box, we got the strength to take the knocks 
Gonna battle hard
Players on a mission, operation no-card
No free kicks or penalties to the opposition
Swift, strong, every old tacticians 

Now it's time, filling it up 
Into the net, never give up 
'Cause England's Irie 
England's Irie 

Cut the trigger, I fire like this 
Cut the trigger, I fire like this 

(England? Well it's the best kept village in Europe, isn't it?) 

Keep the game on the pitch 
Bung it in 
England! 

Now it's time, filling it up 
Into the net, never give up 
'Cause England's Irie 
England's Irie 
Now it's time filling it up 
Into the net, never give up 
'Cause England's Irie 
England's Irie 

Cut the trigger, I fire like this 
Cut the trigger, I fire like this

At eight o'clock we said goodbye
That's when I left her house for mine
She said that she'd be staying in
Well, she had to be at work by nine
So I get home and have a bath
And left an hour or two pass
Drifting in front of my TV
When a film comes on that she wants to see

It's Monday morning 5. 19
And I'm still wondering where she's been
'Cause every time I try to call
I just get her machine
And now it's almost 6 a.m.
And I don't want to try again
'Cause if she's still not back
And then this must be the end

At first I guess she's gone to Cannes
Her silver pack of cigarettes
A pint of milk, food for the cat
But it's midnight now and she's still not back

It's Monday morning 5. 19
And I'm still wondering where she's been
'Cause every time I try to call
I just get her machine
And now it's almost 6 a.m.
And I don't want to try again
'Cause if she's still not back
Well, heaven knows what then
Is this the end?

At half past two I picture her
In the back of someone else's car
He runs his fingers through her hair
Oh, you shouldn't left him touch you there

It's Monday morning 5. 19
And I'm still wondering where she's been
'Cause every time I try to call
I just get her machine
And now it's almost 6 a.m.
And I don't want to try again
'Cause if she's still not back
Well, heaven knows what then
Is this the end

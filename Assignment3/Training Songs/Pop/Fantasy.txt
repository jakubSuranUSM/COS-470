The walls so high and you
won't feel
The moon is always spying on
your fears
I make it to the golden gate
and fail
So then you throw your fantasy away
to fade

Oh and I take, 
take it in vain
So I fake, 
fake it again

To Tokyo network stocks
I stream
All of my wasted dreams on 
the screen

Oh and I take, 
take it in vain
So I fake, 
fake it again

Could I
not take it in vain? Oh,
could I
not fake it again?
Can't I
not take it in pain? Oh,
can't I
not fake it again?

I've sent my heart away, 
like heroes in the rain

I've sent my heart away, 
like heroes in the rain

I've sent my heart away, 
like heroes in the rain

I've sent my heart away, 
like heroes in the rain

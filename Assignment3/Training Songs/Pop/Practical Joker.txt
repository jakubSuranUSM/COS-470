I'm just a practical kind of joker, just a joker
Hey!...
Do you remember the time I tied your shoelaces together
And you tripped over and fell flat on your face and how we all laughed?
Ha-ha-hey!
[chorus 1:]
I don't believe in doing things by halves,
People think I'm crazy, but I'm really daft
I'll do anything to get a laugh
Daytime - nighttime - yeah I'm - practical joker. whoo-ooh!
I'll pull your leg if you pull mine
I'll laugh at your jokes if you laugh at mine
Ha-ha-ha...
[chorus 2:]
I do believe in my bag of tricks
I'll do anything to get my kicks
Everybody in laughing fits
Daytime - nighttime - yeah I'm - practical joker
Nin-nin-nin..... whoo-ooh
Come on now, join in, come on
Nin-nin-nin..... whoo-ooh
I'll scratch your back if you scratch back
I'll climb your tree if you climb mine
Ha-ha-ha...
Hey-hey! ok whose the wise guy?
I'm just a practical kind of joker, just a joker
I'm just a practical kind of joker, regular bloke yeah
Ha-ha-ha... whoo-ooh
Hey killjoy!
Do you remember the time your cigarette stuck in the gap
In your front teeth and I put it out
With the fire extinguisher and a cup of hot coffee?
Hey-hey! come on now
Nin-nin-nin... whoo-ooh
Daytime - nighttime - yeah I'm - Practical Joker
Daytime - nighttime - yeah I'm - Practical Joker

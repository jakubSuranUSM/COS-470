(Gane)

I know it's out of fashion and a trifle uncool
But I can't help it, I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine to watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

From 9 to 5 I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back on Echo Beach someday

On silent summer evenings, the sky's alive with light
And buildings in the distance, surrealistic sights
On Echo Beach, waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach, there's not a fool around

From 9 to 5 I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back on Echo Beach someday

Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time...

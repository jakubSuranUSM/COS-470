There's a brand new world around us
Lots of good news on the way
And for each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

There's a brand new kinda meaning
To the words that people say
And for each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
For each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

When the sun sets in the evening
There are people far away
Who awaken to the morning
Of a brand new day

So say goodnight to all your friends
And it isn't hard to say
When you know that come tomorrow
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
You know that come tomorrow
It's a brand new day

And if you're feeling lonely
Just look the other way
'cause standing right behind you
Is a brand new day

And he's leaning on your shoulder
And there's something he's tryna say
He's whisperin' softly in your ear
"It's a brand new day."

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
For each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
Ma-ma, it's a brand new day
For each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

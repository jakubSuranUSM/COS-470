It's my vision
A total one
Encompassing
The only one
A world complete
That's all my own
Exactly as
As it should be, oh

[Chorus:]
I lost myself
I lost myself
You can't see how
Because I am just a cloudâ?¦a cloud.

Everything adds up to a truth
Maybe now, I can know me too
I have you now
Where you should be
You are mine now
But I lost me, I'm a cloud

[Chorus]

Resplendent dream it overtook me
I had no choice but build it
I made it all
I built it up
Up

[Chorus]

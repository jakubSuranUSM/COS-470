Well, when I've questioned
All I could and come undone
And only sadness stands
Between me and the sun

When loving leaves and leaves me
Waiting on the one
And my heart can't hide
And when seduction separates me from surprise

I open my eyes and I let your love decide
I let your love decide
I let your love decide

Well, when I saw you in the spring
You caught my eye
Eluded me and made me wonder why
An unassuming, undermining kinda guy

Could not be on your side
And when your brown eyes
And my blue did so collide
I sat by your side and I shied away

And I let your love decide
I let your love decide
I let your love decide

Well, if the world was like I wished
When I was young
When all the things that I had thought
Could still be done

When we could win the wars
And wars could still be won and I didn't miss you
And when the world was opening up
Like a father to his son and I could kiss you

Well, let your love decide
Well, let your love decide
Let your love decide

So let your love decide

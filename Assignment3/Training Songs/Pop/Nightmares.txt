You keep stopping when you could be walking
Looking at the pictures on the wall
You keep quiet when you should be talking
You just don't make any sense at all
 
Remember when you were much younger
And you were lying in your bed
Among the satin sheets and pillows
Your mother there to ease your head

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tightly
Mama Mama Mama do you love me still?

But now it's different you are older
There's no one here to hold your hand
Your Mama's gone beyond the veil,joan
There's no one left who understands

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?

Do you love me?
Do you love me?

So your left standing in the corner
You keep your face turned to the wall
A fading dream A fading memory
A shooting star that had to fall

Mama Mama I keep having nightmares
Mama Mama Mama am I ill?
Mama Mama Mama hold me tighter
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama Mama do you love me still?
Do you love me?
Mama?

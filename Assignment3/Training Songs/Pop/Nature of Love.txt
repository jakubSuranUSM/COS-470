Love
Love is like an open hand 
Stings a little when it lands 
Hold me closer 
Hold me tighter 
Hold me so damn close that my heart's on fire 
It's a fantasy 
It's a nightmare 
And the whole damn world is walking round in theirs 

I said love 
Love is like a razor blade 
Double edge and double pain 
Hold me closer 
Hold me tighter 
When I rip your flesh and the pain is fresh 
It's a fantasy 
It's a nightmare 
And the whole damn world doesn't seem to care 
I said love 
Love is like a butcher knife 
Double sharp for single lives 
Hold me closer 
Hold me tighter 
As the lights go out and we start to shout 
It's a fantasy 
It's a nightmare 
With a big black bruise and a handful of hair 
I said love

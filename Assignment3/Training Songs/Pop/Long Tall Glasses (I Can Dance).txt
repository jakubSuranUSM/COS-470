I was travellin' down the road, feelin' hungry and cold 
I saw a sign sayin' food and drinks for everyone 
So naturally I thought I would take me a look insi-ide 
I saw so much food, there was water comin' fro-om my eye-eye

Yeah there was ham an' there was turkey, there was caviar 
An' long tall glasses, with wine up to yar 

Then somebody grabbed me, threw me outta my chair 
Said before you can eat, you gotta dance like Fred Astaire-aire

You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance 
You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance 
I can't dance 

I am a man of the road, a hobo by name 
I don't seek entertainment, just poultry and game 
But if it's all the same to you, then yes I will try-y-y my hand 
If you were as hungry as me then I'm sure you would u-understand 

Hmmm, now wait a minute
Of course I can dance of course I can dance 
I'm sure I can dance, I'm sure I can dance
I can dance 

I can da-hance, I really hit the floor 
Ah it feels good, look at me dancin' 

I did a two-step, quick-step and a bossa nova 
A little Victor Silvester, and a Rudy Valentino 
You should-a seen me movin', right across the floor 
Hand me down my tuxedo, next week I'm comin' ba-ack for more 

I can dance, oh yes, I can dance 
Look at me dancin', the floors movin' 
I feel good, I can dance 
I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance

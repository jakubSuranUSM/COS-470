The light of day is fading, you're asleep beside me
I'd give my life if you would stay
But this is where you leave me, closing the door behind you
Upon the secret of your day

Song of the night
I'm facing a night of loneliness
Song of the night
I'm lost in the emptiness
We never share your midnight melody
'cause she's with another man, instead of me
Song of the night
Oh help me to fight what lies ahead
I stand in my room and I look at an empty bed
I need her, I want her; I just can't take it
Oh what I would give, if you could make it
Be alright, song of the night

I will see you tomorrow, for one stolen moment
I'll be at peace, a part of you
Magic moments together, then the spell is broken
I'm in a dream that can't come true

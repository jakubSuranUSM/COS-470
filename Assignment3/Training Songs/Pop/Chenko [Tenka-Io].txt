we stand alone 
with your metal 
and our stones 
we're hybrid 
divided 
hide the wind and earth 
and fire forever 

and now we hone 
our fingers to the bone 
we're hybrid one sided 

what can we do... 
live our lives like you? 
we're hybrid misguided 

hide the wind and earth 
and fire for ever 

it's over 
chenko tenka io 

this compromise 
this village I despise 
we're hybrid 
collided 

hide the wind and earth 
and fire forever 

it's over 
chenko tenka io

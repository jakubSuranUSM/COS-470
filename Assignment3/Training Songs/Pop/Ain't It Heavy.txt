Sometimes I know that it's never enough 
Survival is fine but satisfaction is rough 
I try with an angel tonight 
Spread these wings and I'm on for the ride 
Cruise these streets where my innocence hides 
There's some things you can't deny 
What is it about this human condition 
I need some kind of promise 
Some kind of submission tonight

Heavy 
Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy
Heavy 
Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy

I'm feelin' kinda loose, I'm feelin' kinda mean 
I've been feeling kinda wild since I turned seventeen 
Or, is it madness 
Tell me where can a woman find any kind of peace 
When does the fury and the agony cease 
How long have I got to say please 
There's a hole in my jeans I only wanted to fade 
I've been ripping out seams 
Somebody else made tonight

Heavy 
Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy
Heavy 
Ain't it heavy 
Ain't the night heavy

So heavy
This woman needs
This woman needs some
please, 
please, please, is never enough
hm, you feel so, feel so
feels, so, so
tonight, tonight 
yeah

feels so heavy
heavy, heavy
oh so heavy
this night is so
night is so hard
it's so heavy
the night heavy
come on, come on
come on 
so heavy

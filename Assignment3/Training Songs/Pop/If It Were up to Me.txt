She doesn't have the answer yet, the answer yet.
I'm breathing down her neck. Maybe I should give her time.
If it were up to me, she would know that she'll be the one who, when I'm dead, will use my bed. 
And she'll spend her life thinking of us and making a fuss.
If it were up to me, she would know that our love, our love, is the best love, best love.
If it were up to me.
Our love, our love, is real love, so just let it be.
I want you to know I've done our charts and it says that we work as one. 
Like the Jackson Five and the Temptations. 
If it were up to me, she would know that our love, 
Our love, is the best love, best love, if it were up to me. 
Yes our love, our love, is real love, so just let it be. 
Well your mother likes my smile and your father likes my lifestyle. 
Should I ask them what I asked you to get the answer? Yes, to get the answer. 
It's easy. It's easy. It's easy.

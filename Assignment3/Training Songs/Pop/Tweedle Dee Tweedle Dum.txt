Do you recall
Some years ago?
Up in the mountains that were white with snow
Inside a cavern
Mcdougal he was plannin'
There's gonna be a showdown with somebody he knows.

Well he's been there
A year or so
Something will happen very soon I know
I hear him playin' his bagpipes every mornin'
I think that it's a warmin'
He's gathering the clan.

Soon you'll hear the sound of people shouting
You will see the claymores in their hands
If you knew the reason for their fighting
You would never understand.

Oh, tweedle dee
Oh tweedle dum.
The tune Mcdougal always used to hum
While he was fightin' his rival clan McGregor
Dishonour he would never
The tartan of his clan.

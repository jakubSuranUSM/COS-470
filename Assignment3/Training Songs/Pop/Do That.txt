I don't know what it is
I just know the way it feels
Catch the sunlight in a kiss
And just let it flicker over me

'Cause I don't know what's going on inside
I don't know if it's wrong or right
I just wanna know if I can make the
Whole night last with you

I would only do that for you
I could only do that for you
Only ever do that, do that
I would only do that for you

Tell me that you'll be there for me
You're always gonna be there for me
Tell me that you'll do that, do that
Tell me that you'll be there for me

I don't know what it means
I just know what it does for me
Just one hit and you won't miss
I just need another taste of it

And I don't know what's going on inside
I don't know if it's wrong or right
I just wanna know if I can make the
Whole night last with you

I would only do that for you
I could only do that for you
Only ever do that, do that
I would only do that for you

Tell me that you'll be there for me
You're always gonna be there for me
Tell me that you'll do that, do that
Tell me that you'll be there for me

I don't know what's going on inside
I don't know if it's wrong or right
I just wanna know if I can make the
Whole night last with you

I would only do that for you
I could only do that for you
Only ever do that, do that
I would only do that for you

Tell me that you'll be there for me
You're always gonna be there for me
Tell me that you'll do that, do that
Tell me that you'll be there for me

I would only do that for you
I could only do that for you
Only ever do that, do that
I would only do that for you

Tell me that you'll be there for me
You're always gonna be there for me
Tell me that you'll do that, do that
Tell me that you'll be there for me

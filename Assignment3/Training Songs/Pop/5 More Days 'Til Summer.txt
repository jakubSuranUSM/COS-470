I've worked in this factory far too long
Can't remember when I last had
Some time to breathe and be on my own
And to do things just for a laugh
To be a clown, to paint the town
Where the sunshine can heal my bones
In five more days I'll be on my way
Then my fantasies will unfold

'Cause there are 5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away
There are 5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away

I work on the night shift until the dawn
My whole life has been in the dark
I sleep all day 'til the moon's in play
Like a vampire in a box
Without a sound, no one around
I awaken to feel the cold
To do again just like yesterday
With this emptiness in my soul

But there are 5 more days 'til summer 
Takes me away
There are 5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

There are 5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away
There are 5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days 'til summer
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days 'til summer
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days 'til summer
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days 'til summer

5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
5 more days 'til summer
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away
Takes me away

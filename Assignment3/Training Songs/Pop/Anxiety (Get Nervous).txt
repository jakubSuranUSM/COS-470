Get nervous, get nervous
Get nervous, get nervous
Get nervous, get nervous
Get nervous, get nervous
Get nervous, get nervous
I feel a little shaky, I can't control my nerves
I know you think I'm fakin', but can't you feel the curves?
I swear to you I feel it, it scares me half to death
It gathers in my throat and it gathers up my breath

Anxiety, got me on the run
Anxiety, yeah, I just need someone
Anxiety, can't get nothin' done
Anxiety, spoils all the fun

I'm picking up the telephone, there's no one I can call
I need somebody bad tonight, can't find no sleep at all
I wish I could relax, I just can't stop my mind
I wish I could collapse but my body's not that kind

Anxiety, got me on the run
Anxiety, yeah, I just need someone

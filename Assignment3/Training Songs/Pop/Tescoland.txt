Jerry to aisle 5
'Peat, Jerry to frozen foods aisle 5
There's a clean-up needed
There's blood on the floor, there's been a suicide
Jerry
Jerry?
Jerr

I ain't gotta first line sing for whatever
Always in the heart beat a friend of mine
New York, New York in a hot, hot summer
Leaving the place low all of the time
"I just got my heart broke home in the winter"
Oh no he said Paul laugh and a cry
Don't ever tell them the old broke record
They won't understand or even know of this crime yeah

But it's hard for Americans
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walk through Tescoland

I wait on a long time friend undercovers
West 23rd words cursed in the wine
Doesn't matter how far in a bus I travel
I still feel the twist and the turn of mean time
I'm not gonna call her a thief or whatever
Breaking in the back doors of my mind
You look just like my old young lover
I relive the past in a last fast find

But it's hard for Americans
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walk through Tescoland

Tescoland
Oh it's a stand
Metro get ya let's go Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland
Get ya Metro let's go let's go

I was just a fool too singing a new low
What's new I've fallen from my old high street
Base can get you though I'm broader than Broadway
Broader than Broadway in my own defeat
Who am I kidding man I love to hate
Love to sail away like a rolling stone
Every plan I make's meant to take me further away
But I always end up back at
Home
Home
Back home

In Tescoland
In Tescoland
In Tescoland
In Tescoland
In Tescoland

I guess it's hard for an Englishman
To really understand
What it takes from a man
Livin' on shattered love
Walk through Tescoland

Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland
Tescoland

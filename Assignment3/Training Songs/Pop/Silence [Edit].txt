Give me release
Witness me
I am outside
Give me peace
Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up 
When the rage in me subsides

Passion
Chokes the flower
Until she cries no more
Possessing all the beauty
Hungry still for more

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up 
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave
I am sinking 
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence

I believe I can't help this longing
Comfort me I can't hold it all in
If you won't let me

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave
I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence

I believe I have seen you
In this white wave
You are silent
You are breathing
In this white wave

I am free

Nobody dares to speak against your word
So they just sit quiet
Do what you want, who cares if you get hurt?

No, I don't know why you wonder why
Wonder why, wonder why
You're surrounded by the type of people
That never say what you don't wanna hear
So they just stay quiet

Oh, everybody loves a show
Lights on, they all go home
You won't let anybody close
That high five is all you got
Ooh, they keep saying you're the best
You ask and they say, "Yeah"
Ooh, when you add up all that's left
That high five is all you got

You say it's hard, feel sorry for yourself
And I don't know why you
You take it out on everybody else

No, I don't know why you wonder why
Wonder why, wonder why
You're alone at night, when they're all up on ya
You know I tried, but you won't call me back
So I just stay quiet

Ooh, everybody loves a show
Lights on, they all go home
You won't let anybody close
That high five is all you got
Ooh, they keep saying you're the best
You ask and they say, "Yeah"
Ooh, when you add up all that's left
That high five is all you got

Oh, oh, oh, right
Don't you get tired of looking for high fives?
Oh, oh, oh, right
Don't you get tired of looking for high fives?
Oh, oh, oh, right
Don't you get tired of, don't you get tired of

And you wonder why, wonder why
No one's by your side, by your side
When the room goes quiet

Ooh, everybody loves a show
Lights on, they all go home
You won't let anybody close
That high five is all you got
Ooh, they keep saying you're the best
You ask and they say, "Yeah"
Ooh, when you add up all that's left
That high five is all you got

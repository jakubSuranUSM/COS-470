I had a walk the other day
To meet someone I think you know
The air was cold
Skies were so grey
Somebody lay on the ground below
All For You
All For You
All For You

Came face to face
Felt so uneasy
Oh so confused as what's going on
Just could not move
Feel so affaid
Whisper the words
The words were said

All For You
All For You 
All For You

Into the street
People can meet
Don't turn your back to the view
The silver blade can cut up your throat
I tell you now
'Cause I know it's true

All For You
All For You
All For You

I had to walk the other day
To meet someone
All For You

I got this feeling
I'm lost somehow
Sailing all them seas
I'm feeling holy
You make me alive
Driving on the wrong side

And I just feel I'm really losing my mind

We're in the moonlight
You take me again
You hold me like your own
I can't believe it
You make me begin
I slide in the game you're playing

And I just feel I'm really losing my mind
And I just feel I'm really losing my mind

This can't be right
This can't be fair
You make me do the dirty things I usually don't dare
This is not me
And it makes me mad
You have that something on your skin you know
You always make me bad

Yeah, pull my head right
You got me again
Sparks in the air around
You do it so damn fine
I'm being taken into the tunnel of dark

And I just feel I'm really losing my mind
And I just feel I'm really losing my mind

No, this can't be right
This can't be fair
You make me do the dirty things I usually don't dare
No this is not me
And it makes me mad
You have that something on your skin you know
You always make me

This can't be right
This can't be fair
You make me do the dirty things I usually don't dare
No this is not me
And it makes me mad
You have that something on your skin you know
You always make me so, so bad

You have that something on your skin you know
You always make me so damn bad
You always make me bad
You always make me bad, so bad, so bad oh so bad

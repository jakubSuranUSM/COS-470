If you don't love me, oh if you don't love me

You can tell me anything,
You can tell me anything,
I'll believe you, 
You know it too
Shame the truth with lies
Say the sun won't rise
Only realize

If you don't love me oh if you don't love me
I will know, I will know oh oh
If you don't love me oh if you don't love me
I will know
I will know

You can ask me anything,
You can ask me anything,
I will do it, 
You know it too
Nothing I won't do
If you want me to
But it's also true 

If you don't love me oh if you don't love me
I will know, I will know oh oh
If you don't love me oh if you don't love me
I will know
I will know

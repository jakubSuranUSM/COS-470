I trapped a spider underneath a glass,
I kept it for a week to see how long he'd last,
He stared right back at me,
He thought that he could win,
We played a waiting game,
He thought that I'd give in,

England made me,
England made me,

I had a dream last night that I was drunk,
I killed a stranger and left him in a trunk,
At Brighton railway station,
It was an unsolved case,
A famous murder mystery,
People love a mystery,

England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,

I need my privacy,
I lead a secret life,
Sleep with the enemy then betray both sides,
I traveled all my life,
But never got away from the killing job,
And the garden shed,

England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,
England made me,

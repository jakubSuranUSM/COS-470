Look...
Look at me,
I'm not just what you want to see.
Look at me,
I'm so young and I'm so old.

And God gave me a heart.
And God gave me a mind.
And God gave me my life, twice.

[Chorus]
And I... I feel deeper than any ocean
You could ever swim in.
I love bigger than any sky that you've ever seen
With your two blind eyes, baby; your so blind.

I'm a child;
I will remain so.
The spirit is the same, its the same,
In the same place I have my temple.
Nothing can take it away.

And I tried to be like the sun;
I'm of the sun.
I tried to shine through my life time.

[Chorus]

And I tried to be like the sun;
I'm of the sun.
I tried to shine through my life time.

[Chorus]

I... I feel deeper than any ocean
You could ever swim in.
I love bigger than any sky that you've ever seen
With your two blind eyes, baby; your so blind.

Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.

I... I feel deeper than any ocean...
(Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.)
You could ever swim in.
(Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.)
I love bigger than any sky that you've ever seen...
(Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.)
With your two blind eyes, baby; your so blind.
(Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.)

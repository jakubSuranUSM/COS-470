Tougher than Superman, smarter than Batman
Could be a thin man, could be a fat man
Got more lives than a motherfuckin' cat, man
Go! Follow that man! Go! Follow that man!

When that I was an a little tiny boy
(Heigh, ho, the wind and the rain)
A foolish thing was nothing but a toy
(Rain, rain, every day
Rain, rain, go away
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain)

Fool, kicks off the carnival
Wise man goes to church
Fool, fucks up the funeral
No respect, well what do you expect

He's the man who don't follow orders
Stands on one leg and plays the recorder
Gets out of jail and laughs at the warder
Break for the border! Break for the border!

He that has an a little tiny with
(Heigh, ho, the wind and the rain)
Better make sure that he uses it
(Rain, rain, every day
Rain, rain, go away
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain)

Fool, kicks off the carnival
Wise man goes to church
Fool, fucks up the funeral
No respect, well what do you expect

Hail the Prince in pink polyester
Burn the Priests and bomb the Protesters
Kill the King, but you can't kill Feste
Long live the Jester! Long live the Jester!

Fool, kicks off the carnival
Wise man goes to church
Fool, fucks up the funeral
No respect, well what do you expect

I was a fool to say the things I said 
I just lost my head 
Made you cry, made you go 
I didn't mean to be so cold 
I had no right mistreating you that way 
And oh, how could I know the price I'd pay?

Sorry I ever caused you pain 
Sorry I, sorry I said those hurtful things 
But baby, all that really matters now 
Is I wanna get back with you 
(Just give me one more try) 
I wanna get back with you 
(Just stop this hurt inside) 
I gotta get back with you 

I been walking down these cold and lonely streets 
I been losing sleep 
Had to prove I was strong 
But every night, every night just proved me wrong 
Had to think I had Heaven right here in my hand 
And oh, just let it slip away like sand 

Oh
Gimme one chance to make it right 
One more chance, one more chance back in your light 
'Cause, baby, all that really matters now 
Is I wanna get back with you 
(Just give me one more try) 
I wanna get back with you 
(Just stop this hurt inside) 
I gotta get back with you 

I wanna get back with you
(Hold me just like before) 
I wanna get back with you 
(Taking me somewhere warm) 
I gotta get back with you 

Baby, I'd give my soul 
Just to hold you one more time 
Just to look into your eyes 
'Cause right now I'm half alive 
No matter what I do 
There's no living without you 
Can't you see, baby?

I wanna get back with you 
(Just give me one more try) 
I wanna get back with you 
(Just stop this hurt inside) 
I gotta get back with you 
(Hold me just like before) 
(Taking me somewhere warm) 
I wanna get back with you, babe 
I wanna get back with you, baby 
I wanna get back 
I gotta get back with you
Oh, take me back
take me back

(Just give me one more try) 
give me one more try, baby
(Just stop this hurt inside)
can't you see how much I need you? I need you, babe
(Hold me just like before) 
take me back just one more time, darling
(Taking me somewhere warm) 
don't you close the door, no, no, no

(Just give me one more try) I wanna be back in your arms
in your life, in your heart
(Just stop this hurt inside) I need you, baby
(Hold me just like before) I need you right now, right now
(Taking me somewhere warm) can't stay away from you no more

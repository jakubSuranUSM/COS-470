It starts out with a kiss
Even though you're only friends
Now there's nothing wrong with this
But this is where his act begins
He'll hold you and tell you
That's what love is for
Oh but don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause he will only ask for more
You don't want to lose him
So you let him have his way
You don't dare refuse him
Because you know the price you'll pay
He's braggin' that he's never lost before
So don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause he will only ask for more
Baby, don't give in to him
No, no don't give in to him
Cause I'm the one who loves you more

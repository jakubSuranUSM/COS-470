Constantly girl, you're on my mind
And girl, I think about you all of the time
And even though words are hard to say
Girl, I miss you, never thought I'd feel this way

If you keep on takin', my heart you'll be breakin'
So why do you do this to me?
You know how I'm feeling, it's you I believe in
Baby, can't you see that I need you?

(You know that it's true)
Every time I see your face, I miss you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I want to let you know you're driving me crazy
I'd do anything to help you to see
I don't think you understand what you're doing to me

(You know that it's true)
Every now and then I want to call you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I say a prayer that you'll come back to me, lady
(Oh yeah)
Life ain't anything alone, can't you see?
You're an angel in my eyes, everyday you're closer to me

Nobody's there when I call your name
And nights are cold, girl, without your flame
But if I could, girl, I'd make you see
That I'm sorry and that I need you here with me

If you keep on takin', my heart you'll be breakin'
So why do you do this to me?
You know how I'm feeling, it's you I believe in
Baby, can't you see that I need you?

(You know that it's true)
Every time I see your face, I miss you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I want to let you know you're driving me crazy
I'd do anything to help you to see
I don't think you understand what you're doing to me

(You know that it's true)
Every now and then I want to call you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I say a prayer that you'll come back to me, lady
(Oh yeah)
Life ain't anything alone, can't you see?
(Oh yeah)
You're an angel in my eyes, everyday you're closer to me

Every day, reminisce with the past
Of a love that we thought would last
How we used to be when it was you and me?
How did it all disappear so fast?

There are days that I can't forget
There are things that I now regret
I was there for you when you were there for me
And I was thinkin' we were set

Every night when I'm laying in my bed
I hear your voice going 'round in my head
Think of all the things I could have done
And all those things I could have said

I really will make it up to you
I know now what I've got to do
It took time but now I've realized
How much I'm missing you

If you keep on takin', my heart you'll be breakin'
So why do you do this to me?
You know how I'm feeling, it's you I believe in
Baby, can't you see that I need you?

(You know that it's true)
Every time I see your face, I miss you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I want to let you know you're driving me crazy
I'd do anything to help you to see
I don't think you understand what you're doing to me

(You know that it's true)
Every now and then I want to call you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I say a prayer that you'll come back to me, lady
(Oh yeah)
Life ain't anything alone, can't you see?
You're an angel in my eyes, everyday

(You know that it's true)
Every time I see your face, I miss you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I want to let you know you're driving me crazy
I'd do anything to help you to see
I don't think you understand what you're doing to me

(You know that it's true)
Every now and then I want to call you, baby
(You know that it's you)
I say a prayer that you'll come back to me, lady
(Oh yeah)
Life ain't anything alone, can't you see?
You're an angel in my eyes, everyday you're closer to me

Livin'all alone in a big apartment
I got cash, I'm independent
But who am I?
And where's the magic?
I've asked all the questions
But I never find the answer
Not until I'm free, I can't stand it

I wanna make love to you
I'm tired of being told
(of) what to think or say or do
I wanna make love to you
I'm tired of it all
I just want someone to hold

Lovin' is a game in the year 2000
We've been told by the 90's trailers
You visit me, I visit you
In the future
We don't live together
All I gotta do is to read the paper
The monopoly of views, I can't stand it

I wanna make love to you
I'm tired of being told
(of) what to think or say or do
I wanna make love to you
I'm tired of it all
I just want someone to hold

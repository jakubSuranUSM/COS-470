Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away
Though inside my heart, I really want to stay
Believe the love we have is so sincere
You know, the gift you have will always be

[Chorus]
You're the apple of my eye
You're the apple of my heart
But now, the time has come to part

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to make a stand
Though we never meant to bite the lovin' hand
And now, the time has come to walk alone
We were the children, now we've overgrown

[Chorus]

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away
Though inside my heart, I really want to stay
Believe the love we have is so sincere
You know, the gift you have will always be

[Chorus]

Now, the time has come to part
Now, the time has come to part.

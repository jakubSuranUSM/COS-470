Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoaaa
Hey! Oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, whoa

Drop It!
Yeah, I'm a small town girl,
They try to change me
They hear that? That's my drummer 
I got my own beat
They try to package me but girl
I don't fit in that box
I see that look on your face
But girl I'm bout to wipe it off

Get, get, get real with me
I'm not wasting my energy
I'm not your puppet on a string
Yeah, yeah, yeaaaah!

Whoa!
They got me feelin' like a renegade
Whoa, whoa
Whoa!
Just tryin' to stay true to the inner me!
Oh!

They try to change me
They try to make me, break me
That just ain't me
They're not gonna phase me
This renegade's not changing!
No!

I know you think you know me,
But you don't know my story
You wanna shape and mold me
I'm sorry you don't own me!
I'm not gonna stop being who I am
Or stop doing what I love
Stop talkin' 'bout me
Take the words and throw em' right back to you
Yeah, wassup!
(Burn!)

Get, get, get real with me
I'm not wasting my energy
I'm not your puppet on a string
Yeah, yeah, yeaaaah!

Whoa!
They got me feelin' like a renegade
Whoa, whoa
Whoa!
Just tryin' to stay true to the inner me!
Oh!

They try to change me
They try to make me, break me
That just ain't me
They're not gonna phase me
This renegade's not changing! No!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no! (ohhh woahhhh)
No, no, no, no, no, no! (ohhh woahhhh)
I got faith, time and family
I got the strength inside that's good for me
No defeat - that's my reality
This is my testimony!

They got me feelin' like a renegade (got me feelin' like a renegade!)
Whoa!
Just tryin' to stay true to the inner me! (stay true to the inner me!)
Oh!

Just tryin' to stay true to the inner me!
Oh!

They try to change me
They try to make me, break me

They're not gonna phase me
This renegade's not changing
No!

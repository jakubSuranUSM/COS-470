This was not really meant to be 
But some things in the night were frightening me 
I hid behind a tree, hoped the things would go away 

My friends got worried, they were waiting for me 
Because we had to leave now - EMERGENCY 
I was still behind the tree 
And they just couldn't stay 
I'm all alone - E.T. phone home 
Now I'm on my own - E.T. phone home 

Please, I don't want to stay 
Don't leave me here, take me away 
Let me make one more call 
I saw my ship lift from the ground 
I heard shouting voices all around 
So I didn't make a sound 
And the things went away 

So here I am and I don't know what to do 
Should I try to contact someone like you? 
I'm all alone - E.T. phone home 
Now I'm on my own - E.T. phone home 

Please, I don't want to stay 
Don't leave me here, take me away 
Let me make one more call

I saw an angel looking at me
All she wanted was to go to the sea

Don't worry, ma
'Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, ma
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way to the ocean
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean

Wish I told you I loved you more
Maybe I was lost before
Showed affection to only gold
While the sunset made me cold
Swear I won't complain no more
Doesn't matter if we're rich or poor
Found out that we don't live to die
Even though there is no reason why

Don't worry, ma
'Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Don't worry, ma
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way to the ocean
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
To the ocean

To the ocean, to the ocean, to the ocean
To the ocean
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

To the ocean

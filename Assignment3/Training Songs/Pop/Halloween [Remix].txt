Well I live with snakes and lizards
And other things that go bump in the night
Coz to me everyday is Halloween
I have given up hiding and started to fight
I have started to fight

Well any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say 'why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene'

Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

Well I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay
Coz' Halloween is everyday
It's everyday

Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
I'm not the one that's so absurd

Why hide it?
Why fight it?
Hurt feelings..
Best to stop feeling hurt
From denials, reprisals
It's the same it's the same in the whole wide world

On the hills of fire the darkest hour 
I was dreaming of my true loves pyre 
Who will bring a light to stoke the fire 
Fear not for your still breathing 

On a windless day 
I saw the life blood drained away 
A cold wind blows on a windless day 

Hear the cry for new life the mourning's flame 
You were the brightest light that burned to soon in vain 
Who will bring you back from where there's no return 
Fear not for you just dreaming 

On a winters day 
I saw the life blood drained away 
A cold wind blows on a windless day

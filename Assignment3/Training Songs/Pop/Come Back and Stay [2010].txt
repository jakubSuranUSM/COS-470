Walk in the rain.
Trying to wash away the pain.
You went away.
I made you cry so many days.
(Where two broken hearts gone to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home?
When nobody cares about you, and you're feeling blue.)

Come back and stay.
Don't keep me waiting.
Baby. Come back and stay.
Don't say "goodbye".
Don't let my love die.
Come back and stay and try again.
Don't walk away for
I'm still your man.

Where are you now? Where did you go?
Come back and stay.
Don't keep me waiting. I miss you so.
Walk in the rain.
Thinking about the game I play.
I am to blame.
I lost my lovin' yesterday.

(Where two broken hearts gone to?
How can broken hearts find their way back home?
When nobody cares about you, and you're feeling blue.)

(Since I've been gone. I've missed you.
I missed your touch. Oh, baby.)

Hold on my love, Oh you don't know the truth
I can make you think, so just listen now and stop
And think what you're doing
Stop and think what you're losing for me.
Slow down my love, Oh I've got more to say
This is my defense, if only you would stop
And think what you're doing
Stop someone here is losing.
Oh I could withdraw but I know what I want
Been in trouble before
Oh help me God, I implore you
Oh please make her see for me.
Slow down my love, Oh you've not heard it all
I must have my say, if only you would stop
And think what you're doing
Stop someone here is losing
Oh I could withdraw but I know what I want
Been in trouble before
Oh help me God, I implore you, I'm down on knees

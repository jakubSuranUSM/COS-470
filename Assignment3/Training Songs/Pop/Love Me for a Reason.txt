Girl when you hold me, how you control me
You bend and you fold me, anyway you please
It must be easy for you, the loving things that you do
But just a pastime for you, I could never be

And I never know, girl 
If I should stay or go
'Cos the games that you play 
Keep driving me away

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses, are only minor tests, babe
Of love lead to stresses, between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting, isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl, I'm proud to take a stand

I can't continue guessing 
Because it's only messing
With my pride and my mind 
So write down this time to time

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

I'm just a little old-fashioned
It's take more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love (love me, love me)
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

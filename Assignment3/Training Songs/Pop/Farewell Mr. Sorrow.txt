Six o'clock, all the closing shops
And the rainbows on the pavements
Of a sleepy town.
October leaves were wept from the trees
In tears of grief and strange relief
And sympathy, all for me.
Do you remember walking out
The day it rained forever
And you were wondering
If I held dreams of wedding rings
Well, farewell Mr. Sorrow
Tomorrow is my own.

I believe we made a vow
Beside the fireside but I'm sure I lied
When I promised you
That I would never want sing
Along with anything
But for the strings of your guitar
Here you are

So this is how a Judas kisses
Well, this is my kiss.

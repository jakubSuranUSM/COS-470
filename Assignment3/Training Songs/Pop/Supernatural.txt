This love is supernatural
This world is unpredictable

Somethin really strange has got control of my dreams
I keep on howlin at the moon
What does that say about me
don't you notice that you never ever see me by day
there's no need to be afraid
'cause babe Ya made me that way

Now I can walk right
Eat right constantly
Hypnotized turn my life upside
Down inside out
What you do to me now
Sometimes I scream and I shout but
You know I could never be normal

[Chorus]
This love is Supernatural
You got me going crazy
This world is unpredictable
I'm loosing my mind baby
You know you're so sexual
We are supernatural

There's just something in the way you move 
That wants to make me
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Make you feel the way that you 
Make me feel
My friends keep tellin me I'm crazy
And I'm changing inside
I hang around with the freaks and
Fools just to make sense of my life

Now I can walk right
Eat right constantly
Hypnotized yurn my life upside
Down inside out
What you do to me now
Sometimes I scream and i shout but
You know I could never be normal

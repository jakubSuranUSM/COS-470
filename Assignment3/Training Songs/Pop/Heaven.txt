Much faster than the blink of an eye
Lightening will flash and He'll split the sky
Nobody knows the day or the time
The trumpet will sound and we will arise

When heaven calls, this life is over
We'll stand before our God and Savior
When heaven calls we must be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality
When heaven calls

For every man there is a time
To love and to laugh, to live and to die
So I'm living for the one who is love
And I'm dying to hear, hear Him say, "Well done"

When heaven calls and this life is over
I'll stand before my God and Savior
When heaven calls I will be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality
When heaven calls

Now behold the Lamb who takes away my sin
The splendor of paradise will welcome me
With arms opened wide

When heaven calls, this life it will be over
We?ll stand before our God and Savior
When heaven calls I must, you must be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality

When heaven calls
When heaven calls
When heaven
When heaven calls

It's written on the wall,
It's everywhere I go,
I've seen it on my TV,
Tell me don't you know
It's got my body zooming,
Baby the bounce is booming,

Everybody says that the beat is,
Everybody,
Everybody everybody,
But should we get it on

Do you wanna drop it,
Do you wanna drop it,
Do you wanna drop it,
Drop it

I heard the beat is,
Gonna take a ride,
Let's turn it up now,
Forget about the things we try to hide,
Go on and show me,
Go on and, go on and,
Go on and show me

Just go on and on,
Don't hit the brake,
Nothing's gonna stop,
The music that we make

But should we get it on,
Go on and show me

I heard the beat is,
Gonna take a ride,
Let's turn it up now,
Forget about the things we try to hide,
Go on and show me
Go on and, go on and
Go on and show me (x2)

Everybody says that the beat is,
Everybody,
Everybody everybody,
Go on and show me

Do you wanna drop it,
Do you wanna drop it,
Do you wanna drop it,
Drop it

I heard the beat is,
Gonna take a ride,
Let's turn it up now,
Forget about the things we try to hide,
Go on and show me,
Go on and, go on and,
Go on and show me

I heard the beat is,
Gonna take a ride,
Let's turn it up now, now
Go on and show me

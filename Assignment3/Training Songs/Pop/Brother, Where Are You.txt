A small boy walked down a city street
Hope was in his eyes
As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet
For one he could recognize

Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way

(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)

The eyes of the people who passed him by
Were cold and as hard as stone
The poor boy whimpered and began to cry
Because he was all alone

Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way

(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)

Now there are many who swear it's true
That brothers are we all
But yet it seems there are very few
Who will answer a brother's call

Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way

Now there are many who swear it's true
That brothers are we all
Yet it seems there are so few
Who will answer a brother's call

Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They told me you came this way

(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
They said you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
Said you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
I know you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
Know you came this way, I know you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)
(Looking for a soul brother all around me)

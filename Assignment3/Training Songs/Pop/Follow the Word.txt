Follow the Word
Follow the hope
Follow the dream
Willing to meet
Willing to go
Willing to share

Still grey skies will turn to blue
Under this banner of hope
Hidden stories on winding roads
I trust Your ways

Is Tú mo Dhia, is Tu tá lán
Do ghrá inniú domh
Is Tú mo Dhia, is Tu tá lán
Do ghrá inniú domh

Follow the Word (Your action)
Follow the hope (Your vision)
Follow the dream (You gave to me)
Willing to meet (the answer)
Willing to go (the journey)
Willing to share (my love for You)

You sent from the heavens
All that's precious from above
Your breath from the heavens
I will cherish all Your love

Sailing out in gathered haze
Calling gently a new way
This banner of hope

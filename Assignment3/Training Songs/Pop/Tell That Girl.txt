Try, try to figure
Out what it all means
That's a sunset song
It's still a suburbia in dream

You don't love her, no
You couldn't couldn't possibly
If you loved her
You'd had for her to be so free

And you know she's going out tonight
To this city where there are bright headlights
Maybe you go down and then make it alright
Or just stay home and cry

Why don't you tell her, tell that girl?
You said forever ever ohohoh

I'm taken over
Raise to show how you feel
But flowers died
And you could never know what's real

Oh why can't you see
How it's meant to be?
She says she loves you but
He couldn't couldn't possibly

And you know she's going out tonight
To this city where there are bright headlights
Maybe you go down and then make it alright
Or just stay home and cry

Why don't you tell her, tell that girl?
You said forever ever ohohoh

How is she suppose to know
That we're meant to be together
If you don't tell her
Tell that girl

You, you got tell her
You gonna leave her
You gonna leave her now

You, you got tell her
You gonna leave her
You gonna leave her now

Why don't you tell her, tell that girl?
You said forever ever ohohoh

How is she suppose to know
That we're meant to be together
If you don't tell her
Tell that girl

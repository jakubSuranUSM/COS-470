I used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn’t be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
'Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you’re with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be on the ground
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be lost in the fire
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
Couldn’t open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I’m a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you’re with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be on the ground
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be out of my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be lost in the fire
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
Couldn't open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)

Just one way for us now

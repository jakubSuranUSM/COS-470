Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door
And you'll know what love is for

I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, 
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
I'm a bluebird, yeah, yeah, yeah

Touch your lips with a magic kiss
And you'll be a bluebird too
And you'll know what love can do

I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, 
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird,
I'm a bluebird, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bluebird, ah ha
Bluebird, ah ha
Bluebird

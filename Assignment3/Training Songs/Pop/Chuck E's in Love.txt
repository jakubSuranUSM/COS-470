How come he don't come and PIP with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn off the TV?
And he hang that sign on the door?

We call and we call
"How come?" we say
Hey, what could make a boy behave this way?

So he has learnt all of the lines now
And every time, he don't stutter when he talks
It's true! It's true!
He sure has acquired this kinda cool
And inspired sorta jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
Well, this ain't healthy, it is some kinda clean

That means
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something that I've got to see

Is he here?
I look in the poolhall
Well, is he here?
I look in the drugstore
Is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sitting behind us down in the pantages
And whatever it is that he's got up his sleeve
Well, I hope it isn't contagious

What's her name?
Is that her there?
Oh, Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
Is that her?
Well, then what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same

But that's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E.'s in love
With the little girl singin' this song
Don't you know?

Chuck E.'s in love, yeah yeah
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love, my my
Chuck E.'s in
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love 
He's in love
Love with me

I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what life is,
I want to know everything,
I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what love is,
Is it something I do to myself.

All is fair in love and war,
Or so they say and so the saying goes,
But I've seen more broken hearts,
Than you can count the bullets in a war,
Oh what do I know,
There's gotta be so much I don't know.

I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what life is,
I want to try everything,
I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what love is,
Is it something I do to myself,
Something I do to myself.

What is life apart from memories or
Dreams and friendships we have known
And it smells childhood tales
Contemplating clothes that you have worn
Oh what do I know
There's gotta be so much I don't know

I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what life is,
Is it something I do to myself,
Something I do to myself.

Never wanted many things,
Except the chance to learn,
From my mistakes
Funny how you never learn,
But know them when they,
Come around again,
Oh what do I know,
There's gotta be so much I don't know.

I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what life is,
I want to try everything,
I want to do great things,
I don't want to compromise,
I want to know what love is,
Is it something I do to myself,
Something I do to myself,
Something you do to yourself.

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah I see you
I don't know I think I'm rolling
Yeah it's way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah I see him
I don't know I just keep on going

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say f*ck it, keep on drowning
You can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
Yeah you say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
You say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I think I'm rolling
If you see him, yeah I see him
I don't know I just keep going

Yeah I got way too many feels
Way too many feels
You came through so low-key
You came through so low-key
I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

Yeah I got way too many feels
Way too many feels
You came through so low-key
You came through so low-key
I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

I got way too many feels
Way too many feels

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say f*ck it, keep on going
I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
Yeah we pour up 'til we go up
And I got way too many feels, not enough to forfeit
So many fuckin' bands, so you know we finna blow it
We be faded when I'm sober, sober when I'm faded
Over scrutinized by all your counterparts there's no debating

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say f*ck it, keep on drowning
You can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
Yeah you say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
You say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real, I just say f*ck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah I see you
I don't know, I just keep on going

Yeah I got way too many feels
Way too many feels
You came through so low-key

I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

Yeah I got way too many feels

Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready and it's go man go
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-huh honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, steal my car
And drink my liquor out of my fruit jar
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes

And don't you step on my shoes
Don't step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

Well, it's down on beale street late one night
A woman got mad and started a fight
Split my chin and bust my nose
Tore out the back of my best suit of clothes

I said, "knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes"

And don't you step on my shoes
Don't step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

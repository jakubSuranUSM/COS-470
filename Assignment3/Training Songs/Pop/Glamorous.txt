She will live for her image
She will die for the money
She will coo for the right man
She will pray for her sins

She will dance for a penny
She will laugh, she will grin
She will beg for forgiveness
She's the original sin

Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous, li di di

He can drive a Rolls Royce
Crashed while combing his hair
He can drink and snort cocaine
All the people stare

We will live for today
It's a stage that we're going through
Are we fashionably late
For our own funeral?

Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous

Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous, li di di

You are the prettiest girl
In the parking lot
I'm sorry that I mentioned it
Maybe you're not

You're standing on my feet
Don't let anybody see
You can hurt me back at my place
For a reasonable fee

Love is alive and well
Write the address down
I'll meet you on Main Street
In any American town

You don't have to say it twice
I think you're very nice
Never mind if it's fiction or fact
I said never mind
I take it all back

Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us
Glamorous all of us

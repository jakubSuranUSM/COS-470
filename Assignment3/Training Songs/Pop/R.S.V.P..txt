Was our love built on solid ground?
There were so many ups and downs
I cannot count the times you'd end up crying.
I always thought I'd be OK
But then we went our separate ways

[Chorus] 
Since we parted broken hearted
Can't eat can't sleep can't do anything
I sent this letter hope you can get it
RSVP

I think I've finally realized
Love requires compromise
Maybe we were wrong to give up trying
And I would give most everything
If you could take me back again

[Chorus: x 2]

I always thought I'd be OK
But then we went our separate ways
Since we parted broken hearted
Can't eat can't sleep can't do anything
I sent this letter hope you can get it

RSVP [Repeat until fade]

Words and music by Mars Bonfire

You look so bored with your jet set mother

Standing there at the airport

You sure came alive when your eye caught the headline

And saw the picture of the rebel queen

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Everything that went through your head

Time to step in the danger zone

And start a fire of your own

Oh, Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw world?

Oh, Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw world?

Caroline, oh, Caroline

Are you ready for the outlaw

Ready for the outlaw world?

You talk so low in the back street cafe

Makin' plans with your mystery man
You pour out your heart and you tell him your story

Giving yourself just to save the whole world

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Every word that passed through your lips
Time to step in the danger zone

And start a fire of your own

Repeat Chorus

This generation they want a legend

Carol is that you?

The evening news an injection

And you can be that too

Repeat Chorus

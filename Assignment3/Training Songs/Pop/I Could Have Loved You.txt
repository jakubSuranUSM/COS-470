Far too many things have come between
Where we are now, where we, could have been
Sometimes a chance, comes once
And then it goes, right out the window
Now the truth, shines through
I could have loved you

Now I know what a terrible mistake IÂ've made
Now I know, this feeling's still around
Now I know just what a selfish little fool I've been
Now I know for sure this love will never go
Hey
There must have been a way that, I could have loved you more
Now I know, there must have been a day when, I could have you loved more

For too many times I let you down
With the behaviour, of a typical clown
Selfish through and through
I told more than a few sophisticated lies, without a grain of truth
But you could see, right through, I could have loved you

Now I know what a terrible mistake IÂ've made
Now I know, this feeling's still around
Now I know just what a selfish little fool I've been
Now I know for sure this love will never go
Hey
There must have been a way that, I could have loved you more
Now I know, there must have been a day when, I could have you loved more

Now I know, there must have been a way that, I could have you loved more
Now I know, there must have been a day when, I could have loved you more
Now I know what a terrible mistake IÂ've made
Now I know, this feeling's still around
Now I know just what a selfish little fool I've been
Now I know for sure this love will never go

Hey
There must have been a way that, I could have loved you more
Now I know, there must have been a day when, I could have you loved more
Now I know, there must have been a way that, I could have you loved more

Hey
There must have been a way that, I could have loved you more
Now I know, there must have been a day when, I could have you loved more
Now I know, there must have been a way that, I could have you loved more

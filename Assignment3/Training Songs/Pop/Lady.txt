Mmmm, I know that it's wrong with me To buy you hospitality But, baby, what else can I do? There's no other way to get through to you 
I just gotta set you free Out of this house of misery 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Love me tonight 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Make everything right 
They say that he's the one to blame He let you to the house of shame To sell your favour for a price I knew, no, baby, that ain't so nice 
Gonna lift you from that gloom And take you from this backstreetroom 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Love me tonight 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Make everything right 
And the past will be a bad dream To me you'll always be a queen 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Love me tonight 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Make everything right 
Lady Lady, my lady Be my lady Love me tonight

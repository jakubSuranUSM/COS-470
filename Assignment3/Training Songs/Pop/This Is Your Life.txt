Where is the purpose in your life
Where is the truth
Do you remember your hopes? Your dreams?
They are no longer your own

This day is for living your own life
Don't let this world capture your heart
Your passion lost to a thousand themes
Surrendered to the screen

This is not a story
This is not a book this is your life
And this is not a play some TV show you've seen
This is real life

You know that
This is your this is your life
This is your this is your life

You act like a child playing games now
Play and pretend the art of disguise
Alone and lost in all your lies
This is not a story

This is not a book this is your life
And this is not a play some TV show you've seen
This is real life
You know that

This is your this is your life
This is real this is real life

There is no rehearsal
No second chance
No false start no better circumstances

This is not a story
This is not a book this is your life
And this is not a play some TV show you've seen
This is real life

You know that
This is your this is your life
This is real this is your life
This is your this is your life
This is your life

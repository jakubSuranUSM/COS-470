Hello, what's up?
I called to say I got your message
And yeah I've been great
They say it don't rain in LA
Well, I was drowning, but now I'm okay
Took a couple weeks to surface
Let me tell you 'bout that sad champagne
You say you want the best for me

Well then, there's something I should say
You're gonna find out anyway

When I say I'm sorry for the pain I caused
I never meant to hurt you
God knows, I miss you
Something physical
No matter what you did to
When I say that I won't ever forget you (no, no)
It's killing me inside, but it's time that you knew
I met somebody new

It's killing me inside, but it's time, killing me inside but
I met somebody
It's killing me inside, but it's time, killing me inside but
I met somebody new
It's killing me inside, but it's time, killing me inside but
I met somebody new
It's killing me inside, but it's time, killing me inside but
I met somebody

He treats me how you wish you did
And I'm still holding back falling for him
I know it's soon and he's no you
But babe, I'm happy and I hope you are too
Took a couple weeks to notice
But time you got me past that sad champagne
You say you want the best for me

Well then there's something I should say
You're gonna find out anyway

Wasn't it yesterday I was eight years old 
A pocket full of rocks 
That I knew were made of solid gold 
There were girls to be hated 
Trees to be climbed 
Forts to be built, There was so much time 
It's good to be alive, It's good to be alive 

There's nothing in the world like being fifteen 
Your pockets are empty, but your head is full of dreams 
Of girls to be loved 
Of places to see 
It's the best and the worst 
Just my friends and me
And we're anything we want to be 

And it's good to be alive
To feel the wind in my face 
See the blue in the sky 
It's days like this I realize 
What a gift it is
It's good to be alive 

Well I wonder, what this day will see 
Will I find my dreams or stare in the face of tragedy 
Whatever may come 
Whatever may be
Of this I am sure, I'm forgiven and free 
And I will live like I believe 

And it's good to be alive
To feel the wind in my face 
See the blue in the sky 
It's days like this I realize 
What a gift it is
It's good to be alive

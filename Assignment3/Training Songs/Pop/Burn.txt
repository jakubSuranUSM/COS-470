Do you want to be a poet and write 
Do you want to be an actor up in light 
Do you want to be soldier and fight for love 
Do you want to travel the world 
Do you want to be a diver for pearls 
Or climb a mountain, touch the clouds above 

Be anyone you want to be 
Bring to life your fantasies 
But I want something in return 

I want you to burn 
Burn for me baby! 
Like a candle in my life 
Oh burn, burn for me, baby 
Burn for me! 

Are you gonna be a gambler and deal 
Are you gonna be doctor and heal 
Or go to heaven and touch God's face 
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps 
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps 
Or an angel under grace 

I'll lay down on your bed of roses 
Offer out my heart and soul 
But in return 

I want you to burn 
Burn for me baby! 
Like a candle in my life 
Oh burn, burn for me, baby 
Burn for me! 

Oh 
I want you to burn, baby 
Oh 

Laugh for me, cry for me 
Reach for me, lie for me 
Live for me, die for me 

I want you to burn 
Burn for me, baby 
Like a candle in my life 
Oh burn, burn for me, baby 
Burn for me 

I want you to burn 
I want you to burn... for me baby! 

Ohh...Burn for me

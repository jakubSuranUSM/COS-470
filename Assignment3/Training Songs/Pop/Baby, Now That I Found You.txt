[Chorus: x2]
Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you
I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me.

Baby, baby, since first we met (doot-doot)
I knew in this heart of mine (I wanna tell you, doot-doot)
The love we had could not be bad (doot-doot)
Play it right and bide my time

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
Darling, I just can't let you.

[Chorus: x2]

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
Darling, I just can't let you.

[Chorus: x2]

I've gotta beam my message to you
Straight from the satellite
Cause, girl, we're meant to be together
Yeah girl, we're meant to be together
I'm back out on the Riviera
It got so cold at night

I've gotta beam my message to you
I've gotta beam my message to you
I've gotta beam my message to you

I should've known from the call that you let out
You're not alone and you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love

I've got it bad
And now this heart beats black
So black
Oh yeah

Reliving 1992 here
Playing "Sleeping Satellite"
Playing Prince and Deacon Blue, yeah
Playing "I Will Always Love You", yeah
But when I think of me and you
Get shivers down my spine

I've gotta beam my message to you
I've gotta beam my message to you

I should've known from the call that you let out
You're not alone and you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love

I've got it bad
And now this heart beats black
So black
Oh yeah

I should've known from the call that you let out
You're not alone and you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love

I've got it bad
And now this heart beats black
So black
Oh yeah

You really giving me a hard time tonight
You really giving me a hard time tonight
Why you giving me a hard time tonight?

You really giving me a hard time tonight
You really giving me a hard time tonight
You really giving me a hard time tonight
Why you giving me a hard time tonight?

You really giving me a hard time tonight

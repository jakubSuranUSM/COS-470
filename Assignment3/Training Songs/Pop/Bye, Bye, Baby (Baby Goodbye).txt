If you hate me after what I say 
I can't put it off any longer 
I just got to tell you anyway 

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye (bye baby, baby bye bye) 
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry (bye baby, baby bye bye) 

You're the one girl in town I'd marry 
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free 
I wish it could be 

I could love you, but why begin it 
'Cause there ain't any future in it 
She's got me and I'm not free so 

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye (bye baby, baby bye bye) 
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry (bye baby, baby bye bye) 

Guess I never will know you better 
Wish I knew you before I met her 
Gee, how good you would be for me 

Should have told you that I can't linger 
There's a wedding band on my finger 
She's got me and I'm not free so 

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye (bye baby, baby bye bye) 
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry (bye baby, baby bye bye)

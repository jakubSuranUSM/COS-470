Grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leavin' all you cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody starts to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 

I've been working real hard 
For just one reason 
I've been waiting all year 
For just one season 
The season that reminds me of palm trees 
The smell,the ocean breeze 
And the sense or bein' free 
Barbecues and pool parties 
What I call fun 

Hangin with the honeys 
And enjoyin the sun 
Twenty four hours just to clean the Benz 
So you can cruise down the 
Boulevard with your friends 

Sights on the beach have got your mind blowin 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowin' 
Right here is where you belong 
So if your down with me 
Get up and come along 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leavin' all your cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody starts to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 

Had to take a sip of Ma's Homemade 
Freshly squeezed lemonade 
Check out the honeys in my brand new shades 
As they lay on the sand 
Toppin' up on the tans 
Take in the scenery 
The mood is fine 
Nobodys wearin their watches 
Nobodys checkin the time 
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mine 
That's the summer the summer 
The summertime 

Sights on the beach have got 
Your mind blowin 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowin' 
Right here is where you belong 
So if your down with me 
Get up and come along 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leavin' all your cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody starts to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters for the summertime 

Right now we're going to bring it to ya one time 

?? 
Touring your ride 
Leavin all you cares right behind 
Everybody is feelin the vibe 
Of the summer, of the summer 

Grab your bags and lets go back inside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
But didn't we have a good time? 

Destinations home,that's where we're going 
The drinks are gone and the cash stopped flowin' 
Say goodnight to all of your friends 
'Cause when tomorrow comes 
We're gonna do it all again 

So grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leavin' all your cares right behind

Everybody starts to feel the vibe

I don't care you can do most anything
I am on a string and you can lead me anywhere
I'll go there willingly
Some may say I'm for you to use and throw away
Yeah that's what they say
But they'll say most anything
To keep you away from me

How much love lovable me
How much more can you take from me
You'll never go to sleep
I'll swallow all your time
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are mine mine mine

Seasons change
They march through they leave wounds behind
Years are so unkind but
They could never rearrange
They can't change what I see

How much love lovable me
How much more can you take from me
You'll never go to sleep I'll swallow all your time
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are mine mine mine

Seasons change
They march through they leave wounds behind
Years are so unkind but they could never rearrange
They can't change what I see
What I see
Anything anything
I'll tell you what I'll do
Anything anything
All for you

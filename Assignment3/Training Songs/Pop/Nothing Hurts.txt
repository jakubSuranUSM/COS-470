Everything is beautiful, and nothing hurts
You at all, you at all.
Everything is beautiful, and nothing hurts
In your world, in your world.
Words plain with lullaby refrain
So sweet, sleep, enjoy the time you keep
All around is wonderful and nothing harms
Me at all, me at all.
All around is wonderful, and nothing
In my world, in my world.

Words plain with lullaby refrain
So sweet, sleep, enjoy the time you keep
And if you call, I will follow after all,
So sweet, calm we'll keep us safe from harm.

Everything is beautiful, everything is beautiful and nothing hurts.

Please, please, tell me now, please, please, tell me now,
Please, please, tell me now, please, please, tell me now.

I made a break, I run out yesterday,
Tried to find my mountain hideaway - maybe next year, maybe no go.
I know you're watching me every minute of the day, yeah.
I've seen the signs and the looks and the pictures
They give your game away, yeah.
There's a dream that strings the road with broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say:

Please, please, tell me now, is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say that would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same 'cause you don't let it show.

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums they all clear the way for me,
Can you read my mind, can you see in the snow?
And fiery demons all dance when you walk through that door.
Don't say you're easy on me, you're about as easy as a nuclear war.
There's a dream that strings the road with broken glass for us to hold,
And I cut so far before I had to say.

Please, please, tell me now, is there something I should know?
Please, please, tell me now, is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say, try to make you turn my way?
Please, please, tell me now, can you see what makes me blow?
Can you see how much I die every time it passes by?
Please, please, tell me now, what it takes to make you show?
Is there something I should know, is there something I should say?

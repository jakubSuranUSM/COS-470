Look around, it's like living in a ghost town
I'm sleepwalking, no easy way out
It's been too long, now I don't know what's right
It's so hard to remember

By the morning she was gone without a sound
The sun shone in and her things weren't all around
And the only thing she had left me was a line
At first I couldn't understand it

This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me

Now I spend most of my time moving around
But I always meet myself farther down the line
The stage is set, and the crowd is sitting down
Then the lights came on but I couldn't make a sound

I'm looking over my shoulder
But she's not there, no she's not there
She stepped out of the cycle and ran away

This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me

Look around, it's like living in a ghost town
I'm sleepwalking no easy way out
It's been too long, now I don't know what's right
It's so hard to remember

By the morning she was gone without a sound
The sun shone in and her things weren't all around
And the only thing she had left me was a line
The only thing oh the only thing

This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me

This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me
This wind ain't the right wind for me

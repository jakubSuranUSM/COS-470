Here's to memory, old age and every
Here's to the people who live in a shell
Here's to memory, one more for every
One for the road where pedestrians dwell

So self-assured, complacent and bored
Our hero opens a box on the shelf
Containing advice, so worldly and wise
Welcomes his children to help themselves

Here's to memory, old age and every
Here's to the people who live in a shell
Here's to memory, one more for every
One for the road where pedestrians dwell

He hasn't time for riddle or rhyme
Too busy fighting machines at the plant
He married young, his path is his pocket
Beginnings and endings escape from this end

Here's to memory, old age and every
Here's to the people who live in a shell
Here's to memory, one more for every
One for the road where pedestrians dwell

Baptized, materialized, no time to realise
Caught in the current and drown in the well
Went about fifty, stubborn and empty
Hands out the world for his children to sell

Here's to memory, old age and every
Here's to the people who live in a shell
Here's to memory, one more for every
One for the road where pedestrians dwell

Here's to memory, old age and every
Here's to the people who live in a shell
Here's to memory, one more for every
One for the road where pedestrians dwell

Go to bed, sleepyhead
The voice of all got away
You must be brave, ride the wave
See the world in a day

I`m sorry, she`s a lady
But a ghost from the past
Haven`t seen my honey lately
Said our love wouldn't last

Soldier blue, we've come for you
Half a crown for the chest
The little bird, she felt your love
Perhaps us all for the best

I`m sorry, she`s a lady
But ghost from the past
Haven`t seen my sugar lately
Said our love wouldn't last

Woah!
But a ghost from the past
Woah!
Hero
Woah!
Hero

Go to bed, you sleepy head
The voice of all got away
You must be brave, ride the wave
Save the world in a day

No, I`m sorry, she`s a lady
But ghost from the past
Where`s my honey been lately?
Said our love wouldn't last

Woah!
Hero
Woah!
Hero

I don't belong
I'm still around
Won't steal you like a radio
I'm still around
I won't be long
Gonna treat you like an angel

But don't say you love me
Strange things that make me die
Dance 'til we're high, you're shy
Don't say you'll cry

I told you lies
I'm still around
Won't steal your act my angel
I won't be long
It's still your round
Or serialize the radio

But don't say you love me
Strange things that make me die
Dance 'til we're high, you're shy
Don't say you'll cry

Don't go on
I see your eyes
I screw you 'round my angel
You're still my love
It's in your eyes
Our song is on the radio

But don't say you love me
Strange things that make me die
Dance 'til we're high you're shy
Don't say you'll cry

Don't say you love me
Don't say you'll cry
Don't say you'll cry, I'm high
Don't say you'll cry

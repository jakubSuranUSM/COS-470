I want to be your I want to be your
I want to be your I want to be your best friend
Giving love is easy to do
Especially when you're giving love to
somebody new

You want to take it slow
A step at a time
Being friends together For the rest of our lives
All of the times you wanted someone to turn to
And somewhere that you belong
I'd like to try to give you
The love that you need

I want to be your best friend
Give you love, happiness, everything
I want to hold you I can't pretend
To be cool when all I want to do is
I want to be your best friend
Standing here with you next to me

Living all our ever after happily
I want the world to know
How much I care
Sharing love and tenderness
Everywhere all of the time
You wanted someone to turn to
And somewhere that you belong
I'd like to try to give you

The love that you need
Whether the rain comes down
Whether the sun still shines
I will be there if you believe
And if you trust me now
I know that you will find
All the love that you need
All the love you need
All the love all the love that you need
I want to be your I want to be your best friend

You come back home, with a secret smile
A knowing look, and another lie
To blow my cool, and wreck my life
You're too corrupted, and totally destructive

When you've erupted, you're totally destructive
(Don't drop bombs)
I'd rather not have to hear about
Your other girls on your expense account

I know you carry on, behind my back
With your secretary, you'll have a heart attack
You're too corrupted, and totally destructive
When you've erupted, you're totally destructive

(Don't drop bombs)
(Baby!)
Don't drop bombs, baby, don't drop bombs
Don't drop bombs, baby, don't drop bombs

Just stay calm, baby, no more bombs
Life with you is all ups and downs
And when you're up, you're off downtown
I've had enough!
(Baby!)

Don't tell me about your lack of restrictions
Guilty records and previous convictions
Or I shall start playing rough
(Baby!)

You're too corrupted, and totally destructive
When you've erupted, you're totally destructive
(Don't drop..)
Don't drop bombs, baby, don't drop bombs

Just stay calm, baby, no more bombs
Don't drop bombs, baby, don't drop bombs
Just stay calm baby, no more bombs

I light your cigarette, I bring you apples from the vine
How quickly you forget: I run the bath and pour the wine
I bring you everything that floats into your mind
You don't bring me anything but down (3x)

When you come 'round
You are a raging sea, I pull myself out everyday
I plead insanity, 'cause I can't leave and I can't stay
You say won't you come find me and yes is what I say

You don't bring me anything but down (2x)
Everything is crashing to the ground
Well, maybe I'm not your perfect kind,
Maybe I'm not what you had in mind,

And maybe were just killing time
Here with your silky words
And your eyes of green and blue
Here with your still beliefs that don't match anything you do

It was so much easier before you became you
You don't bring me anything but down (2x)
Everything just crashes to the ground
And you come around (2x)

Well, no more playing seek and hide
No more long and wasted nights
Can't you make it easy on yourself?
I know you wish you were strong;

You wish you were never wrong,
Well I've got some wishes of my own

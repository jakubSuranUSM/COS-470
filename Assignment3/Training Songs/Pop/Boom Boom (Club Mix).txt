Hey baby I'd like to talk to you 
How about coming back to my room for a little boom boom 

You keep coming to me 
I can dig your dynamite 
Know the way you move 
Get in the groove 
You're driving me crazy, crazy for you 

Second time you moved me 
It's time for us to Boom Boom 
You can come right close to me 
And feel the burning fire 
All the time you got me 
It's fine for us to boom boom 
If you see the spark in me 
And feel my strong desire 

Boom Boom Boom 
Let's go back to my room 
So we can do it all night 
And you can make me feel right 

Boom Boom Boom 
Let's go back to my room 
So we can do it all night 
And you can make me feel right 

Do the honor to me 
Don't you know I like to bite 
Get to the view 
Closer to you 
You're driving me crazy, crazy for you 

Second time you moved me 
It's time for us to Boom Boom 
You can come right close to me 
And feel the burning fire 
All the time you got me 
It's fine for us to boom boom 
If you see the spark in me 
And feel my strong desire 

Boom Boom Boom 
Let's go back to my room 
So we can do it all night 
And you can make me feel right 

Boom Boom Boom 
Let's go back to my room 
So we can do it all night 
And you can make me feel right

Nearly every night I stay awake
And I don't understand it myself
Livin' on the edge--it's almost real
You can't depend on me
I'm breakin' away from sanity
Showin' the ghost inside of me
I'm running away
From you and me
Breakin' away from sanity
Breakin' away from sanity
I talk to myself when you're not there
Oh if you could read my mind
I'm chained to nothin'
But it's all chained to me
You can't depend on me
I'm breakin' away from sanity
Showin' the ghost inside of me
I'm running away
From you and me
Breakin' away from sanity
Breakin' away from sanity
Nearly every night I stay away
And I don't understand it myself

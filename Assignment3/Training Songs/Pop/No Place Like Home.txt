If you say it right
Say, "There's no place like home"
You'll be back there alone
In your room
(If you say it right)

I'm walking a line
I just want to say that you've been on my mind
We don't talk all the time
Still, I don't need to hear that it's all been a lie

I hope relief's delayed
I wish I knew the reason why she stayed
He made you so afraid
I just know that nothing could burn you out

When you say goodnight
But you don't want to sleep
'Cause the anger's too deep
If you say it right
Say, "There's no place like home"
And you'll be back there alone
In your room

You're too young to go
I'm too old to hear all the things that you know
You're too young to see
But you're too old and wise for the father in me

I know you feel betrayed
I wish I knew the reasons why she stayed
He made you so afraid
I just know that nothing could hurt you now

(repeat chorus)

When you say goodnight (when you say goodnight)
But you don't want to sleep
'Cause the anger's too deep
If you say it right (if you say it right)
Say, "There's no place like home"
And you'll be back there alone
In your room

I wish you could be brave enough to
Get into the mind of those who
Are capable of doing that to
Someone who will always love you
You escape into a world of blackness
To try and justify the hint of madness
To try and justify the hint of madness
To try and justify a world of blackness
Do you start when the kid's awake
Or do you lie and give them all a break?
Are you there because she asked you once to?
You'll regret it 'cause the money came through

It's all gonna change one day
It's all gonna change one day
It's all gonna change one day
It's all gonna change one day

From the moment that I heard you calling
To the second that I heard this morning
From the moment that you passed away
The only church you had was far away, and
We'll be there for you to throw the lifeline
We'll be there for you to see in the sunshine
Move slowly for your brother's sake
You said they need you: now it's all too much to take

Hm, falling rain
Hm, falling rain
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain.

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been.
I wish that it would go and let me cryin' rain
And let me be alone again.

The only girl I cars about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I cars about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Ah, falling rain
Ah, falling rain
Ah, falling rain
Ah, falling rain

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow.
Rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cryin' rain
And let me be alone again

Hm, falling rain

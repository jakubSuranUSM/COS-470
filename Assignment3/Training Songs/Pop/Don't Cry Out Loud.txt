Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
And she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lots about her 'cause you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember you almost had it all

Baby saw the day they pulled the big top down
They left be-hind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found 
Was nothing more than sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that's me

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember we almost had it all

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember you almost had it

Don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember we almost had it all

Don't cry out loud, just keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud

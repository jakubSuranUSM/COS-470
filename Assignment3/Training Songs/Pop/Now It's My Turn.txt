You broke into my life
And stole my heart
Without a single clue
You fell apart
Well, now you're back again
And say you've changed
Well, I've got news for you
You're guilty just the same

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again

Sweet surrender found me
On my knees
My eyes were full of love
I could not see
You left the scene of the crime
Hit and run
Don't think you'll get away
The pain has just begun

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again
Now it's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me you'll be
A casualty of your love

You have the right
To remain silent
Anything you say can
And will be used against you
In a court of love

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again
Now it's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me you'll be
A casualty of your love

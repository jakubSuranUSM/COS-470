All my things are packed in the car
I'm 'bout to drive away somewhere far from you
Gonna leave this place and hope I start
Anew
But pictures of you are frozen yet in time 
And every single fear of being without you
Closes in my mind
The colors fade
The edges grey
The dialog begins to play (of) all the things we should have done and now my heart must say goodbye
To all I ever wanted but I'm still haunted by you

I finally settled into a brand new place
And try to clear my mind put a smile on my face
And now the only thing I??I can't erase is you
But pictures of you still linger in my mind
Are frozen here I feel that they're still frozen after all this time
The colors fade
The edges grey
The dialog begins to play all the things we should have done and now my heart must say goodbye
To all I ever wanted but I'm still haunted by you
By you

Come over late, got your hands on my face
Candy, don't you see what you're doing
Oh, I lie awake another night put to waste
It's a shame you got me coming and going

It's a price I gotta pay
To spend a night at heaven's gate

Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window
Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window

Well, I'm holding my breath, hoping you'll put 'em to rest
All the stories about your notching your bedpost
And it rings true to me, there's a notch on there for me
Ain't I better than your cut rate Romeos?

Well, I'm a fool for your company
I know your loving, how you get to me

Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window
Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window

Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window
Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window

I never learned how I should choose
With situations often used in love
And all the masquerading ways

I'm living off my second chance
And finding out there's no romance
Around the world with eighty ways
To chip away it's so hard each day

Well you come over late with your hands on your face
I love to hear you tell all your stories
How you need me so much, yet you're cold to the touch
You got me up, down, coming and going, yeah, yeah

Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window
Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window

Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window
Chipping away at my heart every day
You got me hanging by my window

Chipping away
Chipping away
Chipping away
Chipping away
Chipping away

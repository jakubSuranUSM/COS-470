I'm begging, I'm begging, I'm begging
I'm begging you, please stay
'Cause that city, that city, that city
That city won't treat you my way
And I'm hoping your Uber breaks down on the way
As it speeds to our place
'Cause when you head downtown and they turn you around
This'll just be your place

So we keep holding on
You've had me all along

There's no love in the city
Just lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city
There's no love in the city
Just some lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city

Our history isn't the best
Let's not let it repeat, ay
I don't wanna wake up to photos of you
With a new date
'Cause last time this happened I ended up snappin'
And things turned sideways
Stayed up 'til the morning, I slept by the door
And you showed up the next day

So we keep holding on
You've had me all along

There's no love in the city
Just lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city
There's no love in the city
Just some lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city

Cop lights
That eviction notice in sight
Don't waste our time on one night downtown
Overpriced
Covers at night clubs I'll fight
Don't waste our time on one night downtown

There's no love in the city
Just lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city
There's no love in the city
Just some lights looking pretty
So don't run to the city
There's no love in the city

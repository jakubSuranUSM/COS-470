Isn't it wrong
And isn't is strange
That a man goes by the color of his face
And isn't it time
We've drawn the line
And decided to become a human race yeah

Behind that mother's eyes
What makes a man so tough
That he don't care if anybody lives or dies 
Give him some love
Give him some love
It might save your life

Night after night
I say the same prayer
And if anybody's listening out there
Give it a break
It's all give and take
But the taking and giving isn't fair yeah

Behind that mother's eyes
What makes a man so tough
That he don't care if anybody lives or dies 
Give him some love
Give him some love
It might save your life

I'm just a man
Who don't understand
Why is one man not just like another man
Nothing can change
Til we arrange
All of life's important fingers on one hand yeah

Behind that mother's eyes
What makes a man so tough
That he don't care if anybody lives or dies 
Give him some love
Give him some love
It might save your life

What makes a man so tough
That he don't care if anybody lives or dies 
Looking behind that mother's eyes
Looking behind that mother's eyes
What makes a man so tough

I could take you from the real world
I can take you to see the lights
But then you must go home
These are pleasant times

Such lovley times
A clever line in ruining lives
Exclusively for you and me
These are pleasant times,

Such happy times
These are rotten days
Such hostile days
A profitable way an ever changing face

Exclusively for you and me 
These are rotten days
Such frightening days

I remember how you caught my eye
The first time you smiled at me
Something kind of happened from the very start
Just like it was meant to be
Your love has taken hold of me
And now I've just got to let you know
Don't want to live without it
Now that I've found your love
There ain't no doubt about it
You are the one I love
Sometimes it seems like magic
When two people come together
I can't believe what you done for me
Our love keeps getting better
I feel like I've been born again
And I know that the best is yet to come
Don't want to live without it
Now that I've found your love
There ain't no doubt about it
You are the one I love

I picture the rain on windows
And I think of home
I wonder if you remember
Did you ever know

Walshie-walshie-walshie-walshie

Places I dream about
I will be getting out
Then I can follow the sun

You will be with me
I know you will give me a 
Hand to get everything done

Call me number one
Call me number one

Will I be afraid to tell you
That I'm coming home
I'm ready to take the highroad
I've been away to run

Walshie-walshie-walshie-walshie

Places I dream about
I will be getting out
Then I can follow the sun

You will be with me
I know you will give me a 
Hand to get everything done

Call me number one
Call me number one

Places I dream about
I will be getting out
Then I can follow the sun

You will be with me
I know you will give me a 
Hand to get everything done

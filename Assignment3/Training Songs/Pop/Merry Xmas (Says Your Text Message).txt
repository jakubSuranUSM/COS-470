I never know if you're coming or going
You say you love me, but don't know how to show it
And all the candy cane you got
It doesn't equal sweet when you're just plain nuts

Snow is almost seven inches deep
I'm feeling better than I think I have in weeks
I'm keeping cozy and warm
Without you all on my own

Merry Xmas says your text message
Merry Xmas says your text message
But you're late by a day or two
So mine says thanks a lot and f*ck you

Listen to the boy with a big lump of coal now
I guess you know where I think it should go now
There's so much more to it than this
You're not just at the bottom of Santa's list

Last December I remember when
You said you wanna give me everything
Now I so look forward to
To celebrate New Year without you

Merry Xmas says your text message
But you're late by a day or two
So mine says thanks a lot and f*ck you

Merry Xmas says your text message
Very Merry Xmas says your text message
Oh I never should have fallen for you
So mine says thanks a lot and f*ck you

No regrets,
Not for a moment
Facing forward
Next year's golden

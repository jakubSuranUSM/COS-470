I will fly away, disappear into air
I will fly away, disappear into air
I was there in my dream
You came closer and I moved away
I feel so bad after a night like that
I feel so bad after a night like that

So I will disappear into air
I will fly away disappear into air

Cannot wait to see
Cannot wait to see you
Do it again with me

Love has so much to say
We have to find a way
Love has so much to say
We got to find the way

I will fly away, disappear into air
I will fly away, disappear into air

Walking in the sunshine
Looking at the palm threes
Talking to a stranger
Waiting for a phone call
Driving in a taxi, it's showtime

Everybody
Is looking for the real thing
It's you all the time, you all the time
My mind is on you
It's you all the time, you all the time
My mind is on you

You blew my mind away
It happens every day
You know that life ain't easy
But I'm doing the best I can year

It's you all the time, you all the time
My mind is on you
It's you all the time, you all the time
My mind is on you, no coke

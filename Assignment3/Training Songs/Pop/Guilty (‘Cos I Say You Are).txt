You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are

You did it 'cause I say you did
You did it 'cause I say you did
What you did or didn't do
I can denounce you just because I can
I didn't have the life I wanted
I didn't do the things I dreamed
I'm filled with a hollowness undaunted
I took revenge to be redeemed

You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are

I didn't see the stars shine brightly (shine brightly)
So I used my words like a knife (like a knife)
I didn't reach the dizzy heights of success
So I decided I would end your life
I started with a little rumor (rumor)
And then a full-scale, all-out attack
Feels good to have your whole life in my hands
And I'll make sure you never get it back

You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are

I'll play victim in the spotlight
'Cause I've been too long in the dark
So I'm coming out to get you
I'm gonna blow your whole life apart

'Til now I've let resentment chip away
I drank to numb my bitterness
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
So confess, so confess
I don't need a trial, a judge, or jury
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
It doesn't matter what is true
I'll say the words and condemn you

You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty 'cause I say you are
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty, you're guilty
You're guilty 'cause I say you are

(Rossi Frost)
Waiting around for a miracle
Looking at me for a clue
I'm moving on, if it's the same to you
Too late for me, too late for you

On and on, changing like the weather
Close your eyes, no surprise is in store
Look me straight in the eye, when you tell me that lie
I can't have it though, I can't take it, no, over and over again.
Who's fakin' the blues?
Who's breakin' the rules?
While tryin' to fool
Fakin' the blues.

Isn't it time for a turnaround
Isn't it time that you knew
I never thought that I would say to you,
You carry on, I'll survive

On and on, changing like the weather
Close your eyes, no surprise is in store
Look me straight in the eye, when you tell me that lie
I can't have it though, I can't take it, no, over and over again.
Who's fakin' the blues?
Who's breakin' the rules?
While tryin' to fool
Fakin' the blues.

Maybe by now you'll be satisfied
Looking to me like you do
What do you feel burning inside of you?
Living a lie, don't have to try

On and on, changing like the weather
Close your eyes, no surprise is in store
Look me straight in the eye, when you tell me that lie
I can't have it though, I can't take it, no, over and over again.
Who's fakin' the blues?
Who's breakin' the rules?
Who's fakin' the blues?
Who's breakin' the rules?
Who's fakin' the blues?
Fakin' the blues

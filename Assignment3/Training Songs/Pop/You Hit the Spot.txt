This groove is Em D Em Bm7 and the other chord is A
Em D Em B7
You hit the spot send a heatwave through my brain
Another shot of an antidote for pain
When I get the fear gets down to the bone
 A briefly (groove continues)
When you're near I don't feel alone
 
You hit the spot everybody makes me cringe
It's worth a shot I'd rather burn than singe
When the walls close in I feel crushed
I'll take your calls I'll take your loving touch
A D 
Oh ooh baby your love gives me all
A Em
Even when this world makes my skin crawl
 
You hit the spot wipe out the rest of the world
Don't ask me what you're doing here my girl
A natural thing among these substitutes
You wear the ring I wear the monkey suit 

G see G see Em A
Oh yeah Oh oh yeah
 
You hit the spot look out look out look out look out
What you haven't got you always worry about
These tangled hours we just can't unwind
Won't interfere leaving them behind
A D 
Oh ooh baby your love gives me all
A Em
Even when this world makes my skin crawl
 
You hit the spot don't do this again
You seem to blot out all the pain
When I get the fear gets down to the bone
When you're near I don't feel alone
 
G see G see Em A
Oh yeah Oh oh yeah

Spot spot spot Yeah you hit the spot
Spot spot spot You just seem to blot out all the pain
Spot spot spot But don't miss again You hit the spot
You hit the spot Hit it hit it hit it REPEATS AND FADES

Walking through the past
But I don't think of some other boys
Sometimes I just found
That they keep sticking up from the hives

Closing at the wims
I suppose it's supposed to take some more time
Then why do I find
That they've closed every door on our lives?

Cause I know you're the only one for me
Quit standing in my sleep

Never going back and forth
I'm only going forward
That's what I keep saying
Never going back and forth
I'm only going back
That's what I mean

Something haunts my dreams
Don't know what it means

Itching at the scabs
Only makes my troubles run high
Cause scratching in the sheets
Makes the bark much worse than the bite

Itching for a fight
It's your nasty running over my spine
Cause the doors are open
And they keep floating back to my mind

And I know you're the only one for me
Quit standing in my dreams

Never going back and forth
I'm only going forward
That's what I keep saying
Never going back and forth
I'm only going back
That's what I mean

Something haunts my sleep
Don't know what it means

Never going back and forth
I'm only going forward
That's what I keep saying
Never going back and forth
I'm only going back
That's what I mean

I squeeze my wrists
My arm just snapped
I'm melting back and forth
I'm inbetween

I squeezed my wrist
My arm just snapped
I'm melting back and forth
I'm inbetween

Baby, I believe in you, and every little thing you do. 
Every time we kiss, it always feels like this, I believe in you. 
Baby, I believe in us, and every little inch of our trust. 
Whether I'm around, you never let me down, I believe in you. 

Maybe I might sound crazy, for the way I feel about you, 
But baby, you're just so amazing, and I'm so in love, girl, with you. 
I believe in you. 

Maybe I might sound crazy, for the way I feel about you, 
But baby, you're just so amazing, and I'm so in love, girl, with you. 

Oh, girl, there's something about you. 

Maybe I might sound crazy, for the way I feel about you, 
But baby, you're just so amazing, and I'm so in love, girl, with you. 

I believe in you, I believe in you, 
All the things you do, I believe in you.

I believe in you
I believe in you

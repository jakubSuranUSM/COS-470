I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on 
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long 
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau 
Yeah, oh yeah 
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know 
Trading pieces of my heart 'til I feet shallow 
I had so many empty rooms inside the chateau, oh

But ever since I met you 
No vacancy because of you 
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms 
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you 
No vacancy because of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 
Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 

No vacancy, no vacancy

Prima di te solamente vuoto 
Ora tu riempi ogni spazio 
Prima di te solamente vuoto 
Ora tu riempi ogni spazio 
Ogni spazio 
Ogni spazio

I used to be the type to never take a chance, oh 
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle 
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know

But ever since I met you 
No vacancy because of you 
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms 
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you 
No vacancy because of you

Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 
Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 

No vacancy, no vacancy

Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah 
Ogni spazio (oh, yeah)
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah 
Tu riempi ogni spazio 
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell  
So no vacancy (ooh, yeah) no vacancy (tu riempi ogni)

Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 
Used to be that I felt so damn empty 
Ever since I met you, no vacancy 
(No vacancy) no vacancy (vacancy) no vacancy

Prima di te solamente vuoto (come on, come on, listen) 
Prima di te solamente vuoto (oh yeah, oh)
Ogni spazio (ooh yeah)
Ogni spazio (no vacancy)

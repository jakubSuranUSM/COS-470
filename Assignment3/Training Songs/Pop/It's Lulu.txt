Now she wants to grow up ''cause she can't get about
The words in her head can't seem to get out

She gets all her facts from the latest Smash Hits
She can't seem to buy any clothes that fit
The books that she reads
aren't the ones from the school
She dreams of the day she can leave

Here she comes now
IT'S LULU, she'd dancing close to the flame
IT'S LULU, you better remember her name
IT'S LULU, sing your song
Sing your song, your song, again

There's a tear on her cheek when she's talkin' on the phone
When she has to tell her friends that she's gotta stay home

Her parents both hate her
They don't want her to grow up
The pain in her head makes her want to throw up
The ones who understand are the posters on the wall
She finds her favourite tape and puts it on
Here she comes now

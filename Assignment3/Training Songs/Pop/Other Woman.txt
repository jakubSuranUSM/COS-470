Oh, yeah

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine (Life was fine)
Till she blew my mind, oh, shucks

I'm just the average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl whose love was so tough

Who'd have though a one night stand
Could turn into such a hot romance
Mmm, well she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine (Life was fine), yes, it was
Till she blew my mind, mmm

I know the rules of the game
You hit once, then break away clean
I should have never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more

My friends laugh, but that's alright
I may be a fool, but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak, oh

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine (Life was fine), yes, it was
Till she blew my mind, somebody help me

I'm in love (I'm in love), oh
With the other woman (With the other woman), hey, hey
My life was fine (Life was fine), yes, it was
Till she blew my mind, mmm, hmm, whoa, oh

Oh, this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps going strong for so long
When I get home it's all gone

Makes me want to grab my guitar
And play with it all night long
Oh

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine (Life was fine), yes, it was
Till she blew my mind, mmm, tell me

Has anybody else out there
Ever fell in love (Fell in love)
With the other woman (With the other woman), oh
With the other woman (With the other woman), oh

Said I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
With the other woman (I'm in love), ooh
With the other woman (With the other woman)

I'm in love (I'm in love)
Sho' â€˜nuff in love

My world is upside down from a passive drug
Still creeping through my body like an ocean slug
I'm in a witch-filled trial with a cast of thugs
I've stationed everybody so it don't get rough

You're taking off like a runaway
They're catching up with a drive to make you pay
So keep enough for a rainy day
While keeping up with the styles that brought you fame

Shake down, it's all she wrote
It was a love tap for all we know
You're safe now, I saw you gloat
It was a love tap for all we know

You've got to leave right now pick up all your stuff
Stop digging through your money don't you push your luck
Your blood is still so blind 20/20 don't come free to everybody
Who's been kicking what they've caught

You're taking off like a runaway
They're catching up with a drive to make you pay
So keep enough for a rainy day
While keeping up with the styles that brought you fame

Shake down, it's all she wrote
It was a love tap for all we know
You're safe now, I saw you gloat
It was a love tap for all we know

The stars are filled with holograms
They're fueled with love and carved with elegance
The stars are filled with holograms
They're fueled with love and carved with elegance

Shake down, it's all she wrote
It was a love tap for all we know
You're safe now, I saw you gloat
It was a love tap for all we know

Shake down, it's all she wrote
It was a love tap 
It was a love tap

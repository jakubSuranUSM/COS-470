Red rose out of the East, 
Tell the love I love least 
Who knows! 
Red rose out of the West, 
Tell the love I love best 
Love is a rose. 

Only a rose I give you, 
Only a song dying away, 
Only a smile to keep in memory, 
Until we meet another day! 

Only a rose to whisper, 
Blushing as roses do, 
I bring along a smile or a song for anyone, 
Only a rose for you! 

Only a rose to whisper, 
Blushing as roses do, 
I bring along a smile or a song for anyone, 
Only a rose for you!

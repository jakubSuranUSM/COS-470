I need an overdose of life
My secret to survive
To get a big kick out of live
I always go against the tide
I burn so fast but bright
And never see the red light

Don't keep your eyes on every step I take
Don't restrict me in every move I make
I want to be free
Just take your hands off me
I gotta be free
No-one else can live my life for me

Despite of any consequence
Whatever makes no sense
I hold the whole world in my hands
And when I feel I'm out of sight
The chemical delights
Will lead me safely through the night

Don't tell me what I'm supposed to do
I am the only one who pulls me through 
I want to be free
Why don't you let me be
I gotta be free
Oh, why can't you just see
I want to be free
Just take your hands off me
I gotta be free
No-one else can live my life for me

Don't steal the air from every breath I take
I don't give a shit for all the rules I break
I want to be free
Why don't you let me be
I gotta be free
Oh, why can't you just see
I want to be free
Just take your hands off me
I gotta be free
No-one else can live my life for me

And even left alone one day
Ain't gonna change, it's not my world
Before me there's a road I know
The one I chose myself to go

Yeah, perfect forever, always clever
Should I be and I should feel
Super cool but then I am a fool
But then it's not me

And even left alone one day
Ain't gonna change, it's not my world
Before me there's a road I know
The one I chose myself to go

See, I like the evenings
Like to get hidden for quite some time
And yet, I like against my nature with ostentation
To stay alone, climb to a tree top
And keep looking skyward
No sensation, but I know that right here
For another time
Can't be who I want to be

And even left alone one day
Ain't gonna change, it's not my world
Before me there's a road I know
The one I chose myself to go

Nights, some nights I awake to
Go out though I hate it
Look at this chemical world
Smelling like grayness, like paper love sadness
With you and me and someone else
Don't know who, wants to be
For several years
With obsession and with ostentation
Left alone a while I've seen that guy

And even left alone one day
Ain't gonna change, it's not my world
Before me there's a road I know
The one I chose myself to go

I was wrong to keep you underneath my finger
I was wrong to try and change you like I did
Oh I was a fool, I was to blame
And I put myself to shame
Now you and your love can show me the way
(You gave me your heart and one last chance)

Now I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
And I, I won't make the same mistakes I used to make
*It was love and evolution
It was tearing it us apart
I prayed for a solution and I found it in your heart
Now I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
I can fly,

It's true, I loved taking you for granted
I was deaf and numb and blind to who you were
Now I'm gonna show you and you're gonna see
Everything you mean to me
I am going to be there whenever you need
(I'll protect you, I'll respect you)

Now I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
And I, I won't make the same mistakes I used to make
It was just another emotion
It was running through my veins
But you gave me your devotion and something in me changed
Now I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
I can fly

(I'll protect you, I'll respect you)
Now I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
Yes and I, I won't' make the same mistakes I used to make
Oh I feel like aeroplane above the rain
Yes and I, I won't make the same mistakes I used to make

Some questions have no answers
Some answers have no truth
The Truth is my religion
And I seen the truth in you
And I, I feel like an aeroplane above the rain
I can fly

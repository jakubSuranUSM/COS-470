You think all it takes is a kiss on my cheek and I’m yours 
I guess appealing to my inner man you’ll ignore 
You’re not the first girl I’ve met who comes in like the wind 
You come on strong, leave then start again 
You start all over again
You start all over again

I didn’t think I’d wind up in second place 
Or that you’d leave me without a trace 
I watched it happen again 
I watched it happen again

I thought all it took was a little spontaneity and you’d melt 
I guess telling you I (blank) ed you didn’t help 
Your agenda was not to get that close 
I messed that up when I let my feelings show 
I let my feelings show
I let my feelings show

It’s not the first time that I’ve made that mistake 
But when you’re single those are the risks that you take 
I let it happen again 
I let it happen again

For me it takes more to sustain a relationship than lust 
I guess thinking I could change you was a bust 
It seems to always end up this way 
They get all steamy then it all gets strange 
Hey, then it all gets strange 
Well, then it all gets strange

It’s not the first time that I’ve played that game 
But you’ll be the last woman who’ll put me through a change 
It won’t happen again 
It won’t happen again

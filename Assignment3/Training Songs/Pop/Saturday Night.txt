I got my cup filled up, on my way to the brim, brim, brim
Back on black Cadillac with the custom trim, trim, trim
Smoked till in up my lungs so I'm blowing blubble, blubble, blubble(?)
It's Saturday night so let's get in trouble, trouble, trouble

So it's about to go down, me and my girls bout to run this town
So where we're planning to go, don't matter cause we gonna take control
Now we got the head on, got the pink and white,
And we're all gonna see what the fellows are like
Got the top top town on a tv night
Wishing night all the ? so we can gonna make it time

Then we go ride, ride, ride, on a Saturday night
All the girls they just came in cause they know we got time

So we ride, we ride, on a Saturday night
We all, we all fly, we go high (x2)

We all, we all fly, we go high

They going high hill shoes, me and my girls rocking Jimmy Chus(?)
They think that benzel's fun, we roll out like we're the girls James Bond

Now we got the head on, got the pink and white,
And we're all gonna see what the fellows are like
Got the top top town on a tv night
Wishing night all the ? so we can gonna make it time
Then we go ride, ride, ride, on a Saturday night
All the girls they just came in cause they know we got time

So we ride, we ride, on a Saturday night
We all, we all fly, we go high (x2)

We all, we all fly, we go high

If we ride, we go, and we rock, we roll
And we pop like ?. ?
And my mission for tonight is just to get into some action
Wake up tomorrow morning and I don't even know what happened
So we ride, we ride, on a Saturday night
All the girl, they just hate it because they know we got time

So we ride, we ride, on a Saturday night
We all, we all fly, we go high (x3)

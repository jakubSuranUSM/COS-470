All that's lost was not in vain
Burning like a memory what's left inside of me
Sometimes you want to change
The chapters of our history, but we cant go back

If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
I'd have nothing to prove, I've got nothing to lose
I'd be all lost at sea, with no reason to make it through
If it wasn't for you

Ooh

I can you feel you on the wind
Running through the universe, and across my mind
Time to claim a victory
Its down to us to lift the curse, bring it back to earth

If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
I'd have nothing to prove, I've got nothing to lose
I'd be all lost at sea, with no reason to make it through
If it wasn't for you

If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
I'd have nothing to prove, I've got nothing to lose
I'd be all lost at sea, with no reason to make it through
If it wasn't for you

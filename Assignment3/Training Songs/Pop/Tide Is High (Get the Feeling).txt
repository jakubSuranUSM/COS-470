Never give up, never give up
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

It's not the things you do to try to hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one (number one)
Number one (number one)

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here, 'til it's my turn
I'm not that kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one (number one)
Number one (number one)

Every time that I get the feelin'
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a life time's pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here, 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one

Every time that I get the feelin'
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a life time's pleasure

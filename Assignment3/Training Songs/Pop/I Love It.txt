Why do I push myself until I can't relax?
Why do I smoke so much my lungs just might collapse?
Why do I back away before I get a touch?
Yeah, I'm always doing that

Well, I've been drinking every night because I love it
And I'm wearing off, why, because I love it
And I'm spending all the money in the budget
Oh, easy does it, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've been drinking every night because I love it
And I'm wearing off, why, because I love it
And I'm spending all the money in the budget
Oh, easy does it, oh yeah oh yeah

Why do I call you when I need some type of loving?
Why do I feel the need to leave you like it's nothing?
Why do I back away before I get a touch?
Yeah, I'm always doing that, ooh

Well, I've been drinking every night because I love it
And I'm wearing off, why, because I love it
And I'm spending all the money in the budget
Oh, easy does it, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've been drinking every night because I love it
And I'm wearing off, why, because I love it
And I'm spending all the money in the budget
Oh, easy does it, oh yeah, oh yeah

Because I love it, yeah
Why

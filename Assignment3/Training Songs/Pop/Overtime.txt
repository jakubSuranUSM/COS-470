Sometimes the looks I get
From people that I've never met
It's cruel
Poor hard done by you
Sometimes I hear remarks
Like he's a snake out in the grass
It's cruel
Poor hard done by you

Well, I beat around the bush alot
Don't let my felings show
'Cause if I did, I'd surely hit the roof
Maybe if you'd listened
You'd've known something was missing
What I say surely is the truth

Well I've been working on this overtime
You might think that I don't care
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

Some lovers won't admit
That all the pieces just won't fit
It's cruel
Poor hard done by you
So tell me that I'm blind
To let my heart go rule my mind
It's cruel
Poor hard done by you

Well I've been working on this overtime
You might think that I don't care
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

I've been working on this overtime
What's been done I can't repair
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

My wanderlust betrayed your trust
Don't want forgiving
All things must change, it ain't so strange
Life's for the living

(Baby, baby please)

Well I've been working on this overtime
You might think that I don't care
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

I've been working on this overtime
What's been done I can't repair
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

Well I've been working on this overtime
You might think that I don't care
But if you look inside this heart of mine
You'll still be there

Poor hard done by you

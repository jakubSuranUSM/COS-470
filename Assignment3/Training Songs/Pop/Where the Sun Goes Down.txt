You and me got to be where the sun goes down, 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 
You and me got to be where the sun goes down, 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 

I'm in love again 
Easy to explain 
No more lonely days 
And lonely nights 
Can't forget the time 
Can't forget your smile 
No more lonely days 
And lonely nights 
Let's stop that rain for a while 
Get dressed in a holiday style 

You and me got to be where the sun goes down, 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 
You and me got to be where the sun goes down, 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 

There's no better place to fall in love 
Where the sun goes down 
You're the only one I'm dreaming of 
Where the sun goes down 

Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 
Oh oh hey oh, oh oh oh 

Hold me in your arms 
Make me feel so warm 
I don't want to feel cold inside again 
Put your hands in mine 
Leave it all behind 
I don't want to feel cold inside again 
You mke me feel my desire 
You set my body on fire

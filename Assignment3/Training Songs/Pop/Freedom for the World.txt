Look at the madness
The faces of sadness
The people who try to survive
Why is it so
The children are wondering why

We've broken the promise
The truth is upon us
Somehow we're living a lie
And why don't we start
The start being smart, you and I

Just look around, what do you see
Is this the way we want it to be
I can't believe the way we carry on, are we wrong
Ev'rybody all over the world
We've got to get along
If we don't get together, we'll be gone

Talking 'bout freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
I said freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
Got to have freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world

Look at tomorrow
Think of the sorrow
Think of price we'll pay
Look to your heart
And love will lead the way

People are praying
People are saying
How long can this go on
It just isn't right
To fight for the right to belong

Ev'rybody all over the world
Raise your voices in song
If we don't get together, we'll be gone

Talking 'bout freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
We need freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
We need freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
I said freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world

Ev'rybody wants freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
We got to have some freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
Ev'rybody needs it for the world
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
I said freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
Ev'rybody said you got you got to have freedom
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
We've got to have it
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
For you and me
And freedom for the world
Ev'rybody wants it
Freedom for you and me
Freedom for the world
Talking 'bout freedom for the world
Freedom for you and me

Planned a great escape
Keep the wolves away
Together we can hide like runaways
We can find a way
See the sun again
You and I are meant for better days

We're not the enemy
Tired of saying we're sorry for our love

We are bound 
To a place where they won't follow
Where we are bound
Our hearts will take us there
It's just a game of truth or dare

Leave the broken dream
Find the missing key
Nobody told us how hard this would be
Keep the memories
Only what we need
Until we find sometime that we can believe

We're not the enemy
Tired of saying we're sorry for our love

We are bound 
To a place where they won't follow
Where we are bound
Our hearts will take us there
It's just a game of truth or dare

Promises fade
Well, I promise that ours will remain
Don't be afraid
To walk down this path that we've made

We are bound 
To a place where they won't follow
Where we are bound
Our hearts will take us there
It just a game of truth

We are bound 
To a place where they won't follow
Where we are bound
Our hearts will take us there
It just a game of truth or dare

Planned a great escape
Keep the wolves away
You and I are meant for greater days

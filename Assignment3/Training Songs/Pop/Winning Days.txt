All the time

I'm just seeing it right
'Cause it could be the lights that's over me
So I just want to let it be

Get up and go outside
It can help your mind too
Get up don't hide away

'Cause I know where there's gold
I didn't know when I was flying 
I'm sinking like a stone
I can dream 
I've been trying

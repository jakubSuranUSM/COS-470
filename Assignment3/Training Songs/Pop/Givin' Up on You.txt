Silence and quiet
Again in my life
Far from these moments
I wish I was

Passion and truth
We were about
Before these shadows
Stole the beat of our hearts

After all we have been through
I can only look at you
Through the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up
I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love 
There is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight

Undo this leash
You say I tied
When only our fears are to
blame this time
And what am I to you
Just spit it out
I'm not afraid of the words that you hide

After all we have been through
I can only look at you
Through the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up
I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love 
There is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight

Where do we go
Where did it all crash
When did it start to fall apart

Silence and quiet
Passion, the truth
Shadows, only shadows

After all we have been through
I can only look at you
Through the eyes you lied to
I'm givin' up, givin' up
I'm givin' up on you
After all if there is no way out
If you cannot stand beside me
If there isn't love 
There is only pride
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up this fight

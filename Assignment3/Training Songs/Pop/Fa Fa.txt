When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else 
Just a perfect reflection, you and no one else 
Minutes run into hours, hours run into days 
You're still waiting for someone who never ever came 

Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 
Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 

You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again 
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again

Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 
Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 

Go and run through the hallways, and find your way to the door 
You will end up like always, back where you were before 
Can you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else 
But it's still your reflection, you and no one else 

You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again 
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again 

Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 
Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 

No matter where you go, you'll never find your way home 
You'll never find your way home no matter where you go 
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again 
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again 

Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again 
Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa 
Never be the same again

(Willcox/Darlow)
The lovers are dancing like a fairy tale
Their public romancing seems so unreal
But they don't need it, can take or leave it
It's too easy, they won't believe it
Don't fall in love with a free spirit
She'll disregard your heart and make you pay for it
So just leave it, and just retrieve it
She'll abuse it, and trash and tease it
Don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Every legend has a broken heart, every game has a go back to start
So don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Euphoria is a silver state until you wake
She'll burn and deceive, starve your very needs
Provoke, tease, coax you onto your knees
All the lies and innocent cries
That divide everything that has ever been
Don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Every legend has a broken heart, every game has a go back to start
So don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Euphoria is a silver state until you wake, until you wake, until you wake
She'll take your spirit and cage it
She'll take your soul and kill it
She'll take your love and spill it
Scoop up the debris and swallow it
So don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Every legend has a broken heart, every game has a go back to start
So don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Euphoria is a silver state until you wake
So don't fall in love, I said, don't fall in love, I said
Every legend has a broken heart, every game has a go back to start

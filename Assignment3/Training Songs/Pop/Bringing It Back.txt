Saturday, last September
In a jailhouse I remember
Well, I got caught with too much soul
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico

Spanish lights and pretty faces
Trip you out to where the place is
Load you ub and let you go
Brining it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico

Across the border is where you'll get her
And when it's good there ain't no better
I think I'll get me some to go
A-brining it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico

I was not the kind'a guy to sit and dream
I knew the facts of life
Just hated philosophy
And rekconed reality was the game for me.
Now you've turned my heard around into the light
My feet have left the ground
Here is how
Here and now gonna show you all my love.
And it's just for you I'll try to fish up the ocean
Just for you I'll try to colour the stars.
And it's just for you I'll try to water the desert
Just to make our flowers grow.
And it's just for you I'm slowing down the rotation
Just for you I'll stop the earth and I'll try-I-i.
Because of you and we are so in love.
I think how it used to be and how it seemed
I was so big and free
How did I not realize
All the things I despised were so good foe me ?
Now I can just fly away into your arms and know I'm gonna stay
Here is how
Here and now gonna show you all my love.
And it's just for you I'll try to fish up the ocean
Just for you I'll try to colour the stars.
And it's just for you I'll try to water the desert
Just to make our flowers grow.
And it's just for you I'm slowing down the rotation
Just for you I'll stop the earth and I'll try-I-i.
Because of you and we are so in love.
Love is like a river running to the seashore
Flowing on through night and day.
You can be my river and I can be your seashore
Get your lovin' flowing
I get my lovin' showing
I
I love you.
I will be forever near to lend a hand
So
Darling
Never fear
If you are walking so tall
Or if you stumble and fall. I'll be holding you.
Life will never be the same because of you
Good-bye to lonely pain
Here is how
Here and now gonna show you all my love.
And it's just for you I'll try to fish up the ocean
...
And it's just for you I'll try to fish up the ocean

A place and a time 
Do you remember mine 
Fading ink on a dotted line 
And would you understand 
How the very best laid plans 
Fall apart as the stars align 
The lengths we will go to 
Now it's "if we only knew" 
So you pray for yours and I'll pray for mine 
It's startin' to feel that way 

What is this life really for 
'Cause I don't know anymore 
You hold the key, you know the score 
Leave my name at your door 

Don't you know your own mind 
Well I can be unkind 
Didn't I tell you so long ago 
Far be it for me to say 
When I'm faking every day 
Reaching out from so far below 
It's startin' to feel that way 

What is this life really for 
'Cause I don't know anymore 
Throw the key, hold the door 

Well I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know anymore 
Here we go 
Here we go 
Here we go, down that road once more 

Ask and you receive 
Not easy to believe 
Empty handed out in the cold 
Turnin' on your heel 
Knowin' how it feels 
Knowin' you're only growin' old 
You're startin' to feel that way 

What is this life really for 
'Cause I don't know anymore 
Turn the key, unlock the door 

Well I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know anymore 
Here we go 
Here we go 
Here we go, down that road once more

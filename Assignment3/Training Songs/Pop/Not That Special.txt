How many times can I walk home alone
In the dark, down a backstreet?
I've seen what trouble looks like
I ought to know, I don't thrive so well on safety
Making plans for a month ahead
A day in Newquay to look forward to
When it's not about love or trust, it's not about us
It's just having something to do
Having something to do
But I like you

Don't you know we ain't special?
Not to me
When people see us walking down the street
They don't feel no envy
Don't you know I'm not that special?
Never pretended to be
But the only thing that matters is
You feel right to me

My guitar's where I left it at your place
Yesterday when I still liked you
I guess now wouldn't be the time to take a break
You know it won't talk back like I do
That's the downside of getting drunk sometimes
All the liquor makes me bitter
Swear one day I treat you better
Like I should

Don't you know we ain't special?
Not to me
When people see us walking down the street
They don't feel no envy
Don't you know I'm not that special?
Never pretended to be
But the only thing that matters is
You feel good to me

Probably won't make it
Never gonna make it
Don't look ahead, there's trouble there
Let's stay blind and take it
Probably won't make it
Never gonna make it

Don't you know we ain't special?
Not to me
When people see us walking down the street
They don't feel no envy
Don't you know I'm not that special?
Never pretended to be
But the only thing that matters is
You feel right to me

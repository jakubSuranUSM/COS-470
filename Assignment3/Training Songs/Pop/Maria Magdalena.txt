You Take My Love
You Want My Soul
I Would Be Crazy To Share Your Life
Why Can't You See What I Am
Sharpen Your Senses And Turn The Knife
Hurt Me And You'll Understand

I'll Never Be Maria Magdalena
(You're A Creature Of The Night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're A Victim Of The Fight
You Need Love)
Promise Me Delight
(You Need Love)

I'll Never Be Maria Magdalena
(You're A Creature Of The Night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're A Victim Of The Fight
You Need Love)
Promise Me Delight
(You Need Love)

Why Must I Lie
Find Alibis
When Will You Wake Up And Realise
I Can't Surrender To You
Play For Affection And Win The Prize
I Know Those Party Games, Too

I'll Never Be Maria Magdalena
(You're A Creature Of The Night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're A Victim Of The Fight
You Need Love)
Promise Me Delight
(You Need Love)

I'll Never Be Mariaâ?¦

I'll Never Be Maria...

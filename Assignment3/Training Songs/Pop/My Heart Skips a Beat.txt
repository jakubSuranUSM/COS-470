My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat
Feel it beat
Something in your eyes
Seems to hypnotize
Every time I look at you
I get butterflies
Something in your smile
Brightens up my day
I just can't help myself
You make me feel this way
And there's nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
Everything would be so fine
Baby, baby, baby if you only knew
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat
Feel it beat
Everytime we meet
I just can't believe
How everything I plan to say
Disappears from me
I'm thinking of you now
And, baby, there's no doubt
You are my fantasy
The one I dream about
And there's nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
Anything you want from me
Anything you want is what I'll give to you
That's why
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can'why you feel it beat
I can't believe how I feel for you
The fire is burning
And my heart is churning
Tell me, tell me
Can you feel it beat
Ooooooh, and now
I can't believe how I feel for you
The fire is burning
And my heart is churning
Tell me, tell me
Can't you feel it beat
[My heart skips a beat]
[Everytime we meet]
Oh, oh

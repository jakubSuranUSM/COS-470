(Kemmler/Lohr - Hirschburger/Kemmler)
Child
A child plays in silence
Runnin' wild
He's never comin' home
King for a night
For a night
Children of England
Why do you run for your lives
When you need someone
I'm gonna show
My children of England
Don't have to stand here aside
This reign has started long ago
Mother I'll go far away
Cause my heart is young
I find a way into their souls
An' understand
They're lookin' out for love
Cry for the moon
For the moon
Children of England
Why do you run for your lives
When you need someone
I'm gonna show
My children of England
Don't have to stand here aside
This reign has started long ago

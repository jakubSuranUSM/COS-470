I candy-coat and cover everything
But I'm still hiding underneath
It's been a long time,
It's been a long time
A thousand faces looking up at me
Hands all pointing to the ceiling
Oh what a feeling

I've got friends in highly low places
I'm standing on post, and im posted up
Cant afford to lose them
I've got friends and highly low places
I'll go inside when I wanna party
Grab a girl and dance (don't touch me)

[Chorus]
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh,
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh,
I keep pushing myself even though
I can't take it at all, whoa

Girl, who taught you how to move like that?
At this pace you're at you're moving way too fast
I, I saw you from across the room
It's me vs. every guy
It's your choice, you choose

I've got friends in highly low places
It's been a long time it's been a long time
And maybe baby you can rise above the rest to meet me

[Chorus: x2]

You're worth,
Losing my self esteem
Your clever words mean
Nothing more to me than
Than a line I heard in a movie
You're worth,
Losing my losing my losing my self esteem
You're not worth,
Putting myself in these situations

[Chorus: x2]

Jealousy's provoking feelings,
Inner fears will make you sweat,
Advice in your ears,
Marm and helping hands,
All these good ideas are moving
Round and round and around your head.
Fantasy let it grow,
The truth is playing somewhere else.
Advice strokes your fears,
Warm and helping hands,
All of these good ideas are moving
Round and round and around your head.
(M:Maile / Meyn, T:Meyn)

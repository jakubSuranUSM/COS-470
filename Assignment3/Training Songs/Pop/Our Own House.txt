Came in like the breeze,
I felt it in my knees
Never will it leave
Each day it is retrieved

Seems like yesterday
Your eyes craved this way
Into my soul you stared
And bored down every fear

We built our own house, own house
With the hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it'll never fall apart
Will never fall apart-art-art
Will never fall apart-art-art
With our hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-art-art

Wake up to the sun
Clouds always come undone
You give the light I need
Like water to a seed

Wading in until
One to talk to be real
And prove me wrong it seems
A heart can truly gleam

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it'll never fall apart
Will never fall apart-art-art
Will never fall apart-art-art
With the hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-art-art

Take it all, take it away
We'll still have the sun dying
And the love that is beating
'Till our lungs stop breathing

Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our riches,
No need for stitches
'Cause love melts the pain

Take it all, take it away
Take it all, take it away
Take it all, take it away
Take it all, take it away
Take it all!

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore on that day
That it'll never fall apart
Will never fall apart-art-art
Will never fall apart-art-art
With our hands over our hearts
Will never fall apart-art-art

[Sarah Brightman]
Fell from the grace of heaven's prow

[Chris Thompson]
Listening as the abyss calls our name

[Sarah Brightman]
Descending stars from golden clouds

[Chris Thompson]
Falling to the rage of angels

[Sarah Brightman]
Bringer of light from on high
Bound to the earth and unable to fly...

[Chris Thompson]
I don't know?
I don't know?
I don't know?
How can heaven love me

[Sarah Brightman]
You don't know?
You don't know?
You don't know?
How can heaven love you

We loved in a time before the fall

[Chris Thompson]
Welcome to the arms of solitude

[Sarah Brightman]
Beneath us the heat that hearts exude

[Chris Thompson]
Is this really heaven?

[Sarah Brightman]
We'd fight with the gods for our dreams
Where paradise falls eternity screams

[Chris Thompson]
I don't know?
I don't know?
I don't know?
How can heaven love me

[Sarah Brightman]
You don't know?
You don't know?
You don't know?
How can heaven love you

[Chris Thompson]
Die Welt ein Tor
Zu tausend WÃ¼sten stumm und kalt
wer das verlor, was do verlorst
Macht nirgends halt

[Sarah Brightman]
Crystallized as starlight
Lost in paradise

[Chris Thompson]
I don't know?
I don't know?
I don't know?
How can heaven love me
I don't know...

How can heaven love me?

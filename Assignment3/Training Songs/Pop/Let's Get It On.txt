Baby move me
Groove me baby, move baby

Ya know , we're movin' and groovin'
And humpin' and pumpin'
And movin' and groovin'

Let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's get it on, here we go
Let me tell ya somethin'

You know I've been watchin' you
Wonderin' how to make you mine
And you know I want a piece of you
Cause girl you really blow my mind

You say I've gotta buy you roses
Before I even get a chance
But if only you knew what's in store
My middle name is romance
Here we go

Let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's get it on, here we go
Let me tell ya somethin'

We're movin' and groovin'
And humpin' and pumpin'
And movin' and groovin', ah yeah
We're movin' and groovin'
And definitely gotta be
Humpin' and pumpin'
And movin' and groovin', yeah

Let's get it on,
Let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's get it on
Let's get it on, let's get it on

You know I want to touch you baby
I want to hear you call my name
You may say the whole thing's crazy
But two of us can play that game

Gotta hold on tight
Let's make it happen
I'll take you to a place so fine
(that's mine)
Ecstasy is where you'll be
I'll hold you in my arms
I'm gonna blow your mind

We're movin' and groovin'
And definitely gotta be
Humpin' and pumpin'
I said we're moving and groovin'

You got it goin' on
From your head to your toe
I'd like to take you to the crib
And dim the lights down

And then show or rather prove
That I'm a real man
By the end of the night
You'll be my number one fan
Cause I can comprehend
Understand how you feel
I know you've had others
Now try the real deal
The mood is set, oh girl tonight's the night
I think this could work out just put your trust in me
I won't let you down
I'll be the man you wanted
I'll reverse the frown

You got up on your face, no time to waste
Oh girl you're so delicious
All I want is taste
Of that sweet, sweet love
See man you know I don't bluff
With a woman like you
I just can't get enough
They say true love is hard to find nowadays
But if you try my love
I'll be around with you always

Hump, pump me baby
Hump, pump me baby
I'll be around with ya always
Hump, pum

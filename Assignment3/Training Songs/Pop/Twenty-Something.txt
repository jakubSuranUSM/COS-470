Twenty-something
Good as new
Expectations
Got a few
Find an issue
Get ahead
Got it sorted
Like you said
You’re twenty-something
Join the queue

Twenty-something
In the mix
Always that
Ironic twist
Got a start-up
Good to go
When the money
Starts to flow
Oh, Twenty-something
Up to tricks

That’s how you are
Or have to be
In a decadent city
At a time of greed
You can make believe
That it’s all you need
Sometimes it’s hard
Day to day
To pay your way

Twenty-something
Quite a catch
Think you'll ever
Meet your match?
You’ve always been somewhat choosy
But you’ll love her for the length
Of a good movie
Oh, Twenty-something
Call her back

That's how you are
Or have to be in a decadent city
At a time of greed
You can make believe
That it’s all you need
Take your smart phone
And make your way home
On your own

Twenty-something
Hard to beat
Check your reflection
Walking down the street
Thirty’s calling
Round the bend
Will your ideas
Ever trend?
Oh, Twenty-something
Feel the heat

Find an issue
Get ahead
Got it sorted
Like you said
You’re twenty-something
And so to bed

That’s how you are
Or have to be
In a decadent city
At a time of greed
You can make believe
That it’s all you need
Sometimes it’s hard
Day to day
To pay your way

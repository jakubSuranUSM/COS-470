Fields of fire burn in my sleep
I hear screaming and thunder and cries
Devils crowd under my feet
Scream so loud

Under here lies a different face
In a hungry lonely soul
I guess it ain't easy
When you don't know which way to go

Don't let me die young
I'm begging you
Don't let me die young

I never liked the thought of pain
And time is all we have to gain
Gotta play anyway
Win or lose

Who's to say who's to blame
When everybody wants to run away
They ran by night
They can't face to in the day

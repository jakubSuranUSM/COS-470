I remember when you once said
It's not about the regrets
It's not about the mind-set
It doesn't happen all the time

I got the key to unlock
Working for the non-stop
Heading for a big rock
It happens every time

Breathe and take the next step
Buy a ticket to the shipwreck
We need some time to reflect
Now the weather's fine

I remember how you started
I remember how you once felt
The world was always too much
For you to take, your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Yo yo yo your time

You need to kick the habit
You need to reach and grab it
You know that being humble
Will only get you so far

Stand upon your own feet
Pick the one that looks sweet
Enjoy the taste of fresh meat
And take your time

I remember how you started
I remember how you once felt
The world was always too much
For you to take, your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Yo yo yo your time
Your time
Your time
Your time
Yo yo yo your time
Your time
Your time
Your time

When something in the deepest part of you
Is telling you the things you need to do
When something in the very heart of you
Is showing you the things you know are true
You can hear it now
Growing stronger now
Reaching out to grip the heart in you
And you know it's right
And you know that you need Him tonight
And you know you've been running away too long
And you know it's right
And you know that you owe Him your life
Cause you know that He's given his life for you 
Somewhere deep inside when you know it's right
There's just no other place for you to run
And when something inside your very soul and mind
Is begging you to do what must be done
You can hear it now
Growing stronger now
Reaching out to grip the heart in you
And you know it's right
And you know that you need Him tonight
And you know you've been running away too long
And you know it's right
And you know that you owe Him your life
Cause you know that He's given his life for you
And you know you gotta give it up
You gotta give it all
And everything you are
'Cause everything you want
You know you'll find it all in Him, in Him
And you know it's right
And you know that you need Him tonight
And you know you've been running away too long
And you know it's right
And you know that you owe Him your life
Cause you know that He's given his life for you

Summertime of our lives 
Summertime of our lives, our lives

Hey girl the feeling is right
You've gotta get out in the sunlight 
Hot sand holding your hand
You keep me jamming in the morning until the moonlight

[Chorus]
We'll have the time of our lives 
Time of our lives 
There's a boy for every girl come on

Summertime of our lives, our lives 
Summertime of our lives, our lives

Cool breeze kissing the sea
I've got a sunbeam shining on me 
Blue skies I see in your eyes
Let the groove move my people all around me

[Chorus]

Summertime of our lives, our lives 
Summertime of our lives, our lives
Come on

Summertime summertime
Sugar candy cherry world
Summertime summertime
There's a boy for every girl
Summertime summertime
Sugar candy cherry world
Summertime summertime

Summertime summertime, Summertime summertime 
Summertime summertime, Summertime summertime

We'll have the time of our lives 
Time of our lives 
Come on

Summertime of our lives, our lives 
Summertime of our lives, our lives 

Baby get ready get down
Are you up for it get down with it
Baby get ready get down
Are you up for it get down with it (x2)

Summertime of our lives, our lives 
Summertime of our lives, our lives

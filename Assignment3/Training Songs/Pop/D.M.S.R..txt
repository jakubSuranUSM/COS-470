Everybody, get on the floor
What the hell'd you come here for?
Girl, it ain't no use, you might as well get loose
Work your body like a whore
Say everybody, get on the beat
We're gonna show you mothers how to scream
People everywhere, loosen up your hair
Take a deeper breath and sing along with me, yes
Are you ready?
Everybody everybody ooh (ooh), alright (alright)
Dance, music, sex, romance
Oh, everybody say ooh (ooh), alright (alright)
Dance, music, sex, romance

Everybody (everybody) loosen up
Shake it like you just don't care (shake it like you just don't care)
Nevermind your friends, girl it ain't no sin
To strip right down to your underwear
I say everybody (everybody) screw the masses
We only want to have some fun (have some fun)
I say do whatever we want, wear lingerie to a restaurant
Police ain't got no gun, you don't have to run
Everybody, ooh (ooh), alright (alright)
Dance, music, sex, romance
Everybody say ooh (ooh), alright (alright)
Dance, music, sex, romance, oh

Everybody clap your hands now

All the white people clap your hands on the four, now
One-two-three, one-two-three, one-two-three
One-two-three, listen to me, I don't want to be a poet
'Cause I don't want to blow it
I don't care to win awards
All I want to do is dance
Play music, sex, romance
And try my best to never get bored, oh
If you feel all right lemme hear you scream (aah)

Somebody say dance (dance), music (music)

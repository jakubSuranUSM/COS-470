I thought it would be easy
To forget you
For after all it's been
Such a long time

And yet the memories of you
Still hurt me
They've been inscribed
With needles in my mind

I'm sure I could convince you
If only you would let us meet again

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

Think back
To when we were together
How long we thought
Our mutual love would last

How hard it was for us
To leave each other
Is all of that now
Buried in the past

I'm sure I could convince you
If only you would let us meet again

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

You feel my anger radiate
My brutality, oh disseminate
Still feels empty 'round me
But now, now I can bear that they can see

I am in danger to be the danger
The quiet anger that troubles water
Smile on my face, I'm going under
Fear radiates, lights up a fire

You feel my anger radiate
My brutality, oh disseminate
Still feels empty 'round me
But now, now I can bear that they can see

If you rise with the sun, we will rise together
Battle's only just begun and I'm going under
If you rise with the sun, we will go together
Battle's only just begun and I'm going under

I used to feel sorry
Mainly just for myself driving myself down
So deep in love, sorry
But I know from the radio, the world's changed, alright

And I am in danger to be the danger
The quiet anger that troubles water
Smile on my face, I'm going under
Fear radiates, lights up a fire

You feel my anger radiate
My brutality, oh disseminate
Still feels empty 'round me
But now, now I can bear that they can see
Still feels empty 'round me
But now, now I can bear that they can see

"Carving﻿ my initials on your forehead"

Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love you'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own

Won't dance, not without you, small steps, they lead only to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
What's wrong, you cannot lose, my eyes only see to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark

"Carving﻿ my initials on your forehead"

Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love you'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own

I know you hear me but can you reach me
Feel free to touch me and we can play hard
With buddies jerking, but still I'm working
I'm new to moving, and we can play hard

Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love you'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own

We can play hard, hard, hard,
We can play hard, hard, hard,
We can play hard, hard, hard,
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard, hard, hard

[Repeat x2]
Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love you'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own, still dancing on my own

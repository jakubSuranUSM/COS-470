I'm tired
Of waking
And thanking the fates
That I'm even alive
You take what you know
You can take him
And you throw me aside
Lately, it's like I can't wait
For the afterlife
I know that you know that
You're wasting my time

You told me you might never leave
But everything goes eventually
You know that you have to take this more delicately

Your love
Is like waving a gun
Now I'm learning my lesson
You know you're heart is a weapon
Your love
No, it's never enough
But it's burning me up and
You know you're heart is a weapon

Sure
I hate this but have to admit that
I've been here before
I'm waiting now
To have for whatever is in store
Hit after hit you with suicide
I fall on your sword
I know that you know that I'm making from home

Maybe though I'm just way too late
You're already set to detonate
The tension is only more inching the longer we wait

Your love
Is like waving a gun
Now I'm learning my lesson
You know you're heart is a weapon
Your love
No, it's never enough
But it's burning me up and
You know you're heart is a weapon

We may well be wrong
But I think we still got something
You say that we're done
But I think we still got something
Yeah I think we still got something

Your love
Is like waving a gun
Now I'm learning my lesson
You know you're heart is a weapon
Your love
No, it's never enough
But it's burning me up and
You know you're heart is a weapon

Your love
Is like waving a gun
Now I'm learning my lesson
You know you're heart is a weapon
Your love
No, it's never enough
But it's burning me up and
You know you're heart is a weapon

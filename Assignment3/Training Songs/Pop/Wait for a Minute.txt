Wait for a minute
I

Monday I wake up with disgust in my head
Could not forgive myself another moment spent in the bed
Monday the mirror always disappoints
I pinch my skin until I see the joints

Today I'm feeling like I live on the ledge
Any moment I just know I'm gonna fall off the edge
They say, "hang on"
I promised them I will but I don't know for how long

Wait for a minute
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
I'll wait

Why do I spend the [sole/soul?] of my day
Looking for any way to waste away?
The pain is in the empty time
Just twiddling my thumbs and hoping for the words to rise

Today I couldn't stand to be all alone
And sick of hearing my voice on the telephone
A thousand roads to injury
Most of them so smooth it doesn't feel they are hurting me

Wait for a minute
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
I'll wait

Oh, I'll still try to leave the higher violence behind
I'll wait for relief but the illness is my mind
Why should I worry? I'm already too late
Why should I wait?

Not knowing what the future will bring
Is always wrecking my day
I guess I'll drown my fear and seal my fate
A haze of cravings, easier to do it then to just sit here and wait

Easier to do it then to just sit here and wait

Wait for a minute
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
I'll wait

Easier to do it then it is to just sit here and wait!

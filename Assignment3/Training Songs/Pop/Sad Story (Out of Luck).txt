A sad story, might find it boring
Lost his mum to a drug named Heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy f*ck
Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grow out of it

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds
A small west, small things
Make the small things feel so tall
Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case
Oh, I couldn't ever say

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

But wait my life's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt, a few fights
Now kicked out clubs, shit the suns up
One look's all it took for his girl to cuss at another
Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fists
And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit other man is dead

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

And now he's locked away
Twenty-one years of age
How many lives must go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change
And I don't even know how
We continue to
Fight one another now

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
 
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

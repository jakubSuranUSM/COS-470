You're wide awake, your heart beats
Sister Mary in her burning dress with god at her feet
They take and take, but no more
'Cause now you're gonna show em what the night is really for
And leave your heart out on the dance floor

Put your hands up, it's all right
Saying "oh ho oh oh", until the sunrise
And if you can't sleep, do it all night
Saying "oh ho oh oh", and don't you ever fade away

Your life is full, of hard days
You try to hold it down but it's more than you can take
Those flashing lights, they shine down
It's hard as hell to try to keep your head in this town
So we're gonna burn the place down

Put your hands up, it's all right
Saying "oh ho oh oh", until the sunrise
And if you can't sleep, do it all night
Saying "oh ho oh oh", and don't you ever fade away
No don't you ever fade away, yeah
Until the sun rise
Saying "oh ho oh oh"
Saying "oh ho oh oh"

Put your hands up, it's all right
Saying "oh ho oh oh", until the sunrise
And if you can't sleep, do it all night
Saying "oh ho oh oh", and don't you ever fade away
No don't you ever fade away, yeah
And don't you ever fade away (better put your hands up)

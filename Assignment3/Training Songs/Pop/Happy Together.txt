Imagine me and you I do
I think about you day and night 
It's only right 
To think about the girl you love 
And hold her tight 
So happy together 
If I should call you up invest a dime 
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind 
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine 
So happy together 
I can see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life 
When you're with me baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice 
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together 
I can see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life

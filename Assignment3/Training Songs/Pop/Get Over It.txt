Doing time in my mind
For another petty crime
It's a sign
Don't think I'll ever fall in line
To the system
I'll just diss them
I'm on a mission
Tryina get a bit of recognition
Lack of nutrition
I feel half dead
Got a lot of ambition
But I never go to bed
And I'm bored of comparisons
Jumping the gun
People need to learn
To have just a bit of fun
F*ck those who said I wouldn't make it at school
Going round saying rat boys a fool
Well I never been caught never played by the rules
And spent my time hanging out in the halls
Contemplation and a messy situation
In in like a nation with no imagination
Felling on my own never been a clone
Not much to do and all my mates are stoned

They call up in my mind but I'm over it
If you're in to it I'll go with it
They call up in my mind but it's over
They call up in my mind but I'm over it
If you're in to it I'll go with it
They call up in my mind but it's over

They say looking is a curse
But curiosity and not knowing makes it worse
Reversed in my mind but I'm with it every day
Couple seen it but I look at my self and I'm just a beginner
You ever feel like you're minds playing tricks on you
In a situation you don't know what to do
Keep struggling it on and I know it's in my head
It's been feed once
But this lead just dread

Can you hear them coming for us now

They call up in my mind but I'm over it
If you're in to it I'll go with it
They call up in my mind but it's over

And all the people wait in line
To see the next crucify
Love a life if pain and shame
Our lives are owned by fame this game

Yeah ok we gonna go one last time around
I wanna see you put your hands in the mother fucking air

They call up in my mind but I'm over it
If you're in to it I'll go with it
They call up in my mind but it's over
They call up in my mind but I'm over it
If you're in to it I'll go with it
They call up in my mind but it's over

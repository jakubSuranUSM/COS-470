I gotta reputation
People know who I am
Rules are made to be broken
Can't kill what you don't understand
I see you runnin' scared
I never knew you cared
Go and hide your head in the sand

Been to hell and back
I survived and that's a fact

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna do

My New Year's resolution
Is a always the same
Gonna do what I like
We're gonna do what I want
'Cause it's just my way, yeah
I don't live for tomorrow
'Cause at the end of the day

Gonna shout it from the roof
Better face up to the truth

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna do, yeah

Don't need a invitation
I don't play hard-to-get, no
Well, I'm fame they claim
I can't be tamed
You know it doesn't matter
I swear if I like
I wear what I want

It's my life
(Oh yeah)
And I'll do what I wanna
(It's my life)
Do what I wanna
Do what I like
(Oh yeah)

It's my life
And I'll do what I wanna
(Do what you like)
Do what I wanna
(Do it, do it, do it)
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

It's my life
(It's my life)
And I'll do what I wanna
Do what I wanna
Do what I like

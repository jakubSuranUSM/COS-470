We can't contain what's inside
Thunder and lightning can't hide
Freed from the past
Destined to win
Taking the Gospel where it's never been

Chorus:
We're on, we're on, we're on a mission
And we'll go
Where the brave
Dare to fly
We're on a mission
And we know
It's a race
Do or die
To know Him and make Him known is our creed
Letting the fire be freed
Mission 3:16

We don't know what we will find
Deep behind enemy lines
We are the called
We are the few
Ready to serve Him and willing to do

Chorus

He did not come into the world
But to save us
He came so He could set us free
Not enslave us
Freely we received
Freely we must give
The message of salvation to live
Yes, to live

Chorus

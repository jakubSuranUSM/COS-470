Lying in darkness i'm lonely and confused 
I try to feel bitter 
I know that i've been used 
Words so close to me 
A moment to forget 
Touching me now leaves me empty 
and then regret 

Goodbye to you 

Conviction, faith and logic are properties you lack 
People round you suffer when you shut your eyes 
turn your back 
You're not as i imagine 
I'm lonely and confused 
Our bodies never tingled 
Our minds they never fused 

Goodbye to you...

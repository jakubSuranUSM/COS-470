Don't know if I believe in a God
Don't know if I believe there's not
Don't know if I believe in fate
Don't know if I believe we make our own way

I love, I lose, I scar when I bruise
Well, dear life

Sometimes I feel you carry me
And then I feel you're letting go
No ties, I'm wild, running free
Am I a fool to think I'm in control?
Should I lay back, and let the tide wash over me?
All the fight, dear life
What do you hold from me? (hold from me?, hold from me?, hold from me?, hold from me?)

Maybe I should believe what I'm told
Maybe I should believe what glitters is gold
Maybe I should say what's on my mind
Maybe if I keep my mouth shut I'll be fine

I hate, I burn
I bless and curse
Well, dear life

Sometimes I feel you carry me
And then I feel you're letting go
No ties, I'm wild, running free
Am I a fool to think I'm in control?
Should I lay back, and let the tide wash over me?
All the fight, dear life

The only thing I know for sure when I get enough of this life
The only thing I know for sure, we're gonna be alright
The only thing I know for sure when I get enough of this life
The only thing I know for sure, we're gonna be alright

Sometimes I feel you carry me
And then I feel you're letting go
No ties, I'm wild, running free
Am I a fool to think I'm in control?
Should I lay back, and let the tide wash over me?
All the fight, dear life
What do you hold from me? (hold from me?, hold from me?, hold from me?, hold from me?)

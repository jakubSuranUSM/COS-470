I got some money in my pocket, I got the car keys in my hand
I got myself a couple of tickets, to see a rock'n rollin' band
Come on girl just get on your shoes, we're gonna hear some sounds
Come on babe you know there ain't no time to mess around-round-round....

Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down

You got the body of a woman, the way you move it like a queen
You got the face to raise a riot, and still you're only seventeen
But little girl you're oh so shy, you hardly make a sound
Come on babe you know there ain't no time to mess around-round-round...

Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down
Aaaahhhhhhh

So won't you try it baby, I'll take you by the hand
'Cause there's a world out there for you, you're goin' to understand
You've got the chance so take it, you've just gotta pick and choose
Why don't you give it just one try, I know you can't lose

The body of a woman, you nearly make me lose my breathe
You know you give me such a feeling, you almost scare me half to death ow!
But little girl you're so reserved, you hardly make a sound
Come on baby, don't you be so shy, don't mess around (round, round, round, round)

Ow, Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Evie (yeah), Evie, Evie let your hair hang down (Aaaahhh)
Evie, Evie, Evie let your hair hang down
Evie, Evie - let your hair hang down
Let your hair hang down, let your hair hang down..(fade to end)

Backgroud:
(Come on baby, there's a world out there for me and you to share. Try it girl, let your hair hang down)

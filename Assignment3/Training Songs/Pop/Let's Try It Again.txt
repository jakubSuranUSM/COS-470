I've heard of true loves that lasted forever
I guess there is a way
And I've heard of true loves that needed each other
More and more each day
What is love when there is no one that cares
Next time you need my love I'll be there
Be right by your side

[Chorus]
Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again
My love for you it has no end
Let's try it again till the end
All because I love you

I've heard of true loves that stayed with each other
Didn't wander through the night
And I've heard of true loves that prayed for each other
Didn't argue, fuss, or fight
Now I know just what love's all about
Next time you need my love I won't doubt, doubt your love again

[Chorus]

You got to try it again
My love fro you it has no end
You know and I know
It's all because 
I love you

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

I love Tokyo, I've never been
See I'm looking for somewhere that my journey could begin
And now maybe Cairo, guten tag Berlin
But I know cause I ain't leaving Paris without a French kiss
We're on a trip around the world
Let's make it wonderful

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Hey Ibiza, give me the groove
I'ma party 'til I black out, and wake up in Cancun
If I sleep in Seattle, plan the next move
I'll be having a ball over in Ayia Napa too
Now we're on a trip around the world
Let's make it wonderful

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go (so let me see)

Atlas on the dancefloor (your body)
Round the world like a merry-go (like a merry-go)
Atlas on the dancefloor (oh-ooh-oh)
Round the world like a merry-go-merry-go-merry-go

New York City, London Town
There's a moment somewhere out there
You'll never know, what's waiting outside your window

I'm taking off, oh-oh-off, oh-oh-off
Lifting me up uh-uh-up, uh-uh-up, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-up
I'm taking off, oh-oh-off, oh-oh-off
Lifting me up, uh-uh-up, uh-uh-up, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-up

One moment to another
A world to be discovered
And now it's my turn to fly
Let this be the last time I say goodbye

Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go, merry-go (you can't bring us down)
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go, merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go, merry-go
Atlas on the dancefloor
Round the world like a merry-go, merry-go

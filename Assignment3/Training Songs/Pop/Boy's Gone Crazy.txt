Boy's gone crazy...Ooo, ooo, ooo
Boy's gone crazy...Ooo, ooo, ooo

Johnny's on top of the shopping mall
Pretending like he's gonna fall
Just throwing stones at a neon sign
Saying over and over "She was mine all mine"

The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time

Can't keep his mind on his schoolwork
Won't tell anybody just how bad he's hurt
Keeps popping them quarters in a pinball game
Doing all he can do to forget her name

The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time

Well he did see her face in the dark
And he did see that in the moon
With every beat of his heart
He knows his life is ruined, whoa yeah

Out on the highway doing ninety-eight
Radio blasting as he's tempting fate
He swears he saw an angel in a black Corvette
She was blowing him kisses through her cigarette

The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line, yeah, yeah
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone, really gone for good this time 
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's really just one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time, oh
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line, yeah, yeah
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone, really gone for good this time 
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's really just one step over the line, yeah, yeah
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time, boy's gone crazy

Oh, next light bust a right
It's not gonna be too hard
If there's no parking on the street
Pull up on their front yard

Don't bring no vodka or whiskey
We've got everything you need
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes
And get down to this beat

Let's go down, wash that sugar down
You gotta realize

That there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be
The biggest night of the year

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better
If you were only here

Mmm, oh, that's right, mmm
Prom night, Oscar night, got all that BS beat
There's twenty girls for every single boy
And their crazy from this heat

We'll take you up and down
And everywhere in between
Mom and dad are out of town all week
So you better get on your feet

Let's go down, wash that sugar down

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be
The biggest night of the year

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better
If you were only here

Mmm, oh, I think it's gonna get hot tonight

Brothers and sisters moving in together
So, so nice and tight
Everything you ever wanted from this life
Is gonna happen right now

Ooh, those girls tend to hide [unverified]
And the temperatures rise
Better reach for the sky
And raise up the ceiling

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be
The biggest night of the year

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better
If you were only here, if only you were here

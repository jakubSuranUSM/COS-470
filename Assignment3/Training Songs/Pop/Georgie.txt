Georgie, your love reminds me of a songWhen it's near you put it onAnd its refrain you'll rememberGeorgie, but when the song's been often playedAnother song that has been madeMakes you forget that you lied the other dayGeorgie, there was a time you played our loveRemember, I'm not a record you can play and turn it offGeorgie, like many songs you will returnEvery minute I will yearnAnd when it comes you can see me standing thereGeorgie, there was a time you played our loveRemember, I'm not a record you can play and turn it offGeorgie, like many songs you will returnEvery minute I will yearnAnd when it comes you can see me standing thereGeorgie, I'm telling you I'll be standing thereTo hold your hand, to kiss your lipsTo say: "Please love me"

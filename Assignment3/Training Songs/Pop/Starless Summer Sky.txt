The heat of the day begins to die 
The faintest breeze comes drifting by 
And you and I we watch the clouds roll by 
All alone beneath the starless summer sky 

Each night we talk about the day 
When we run out of things to say 
We sit and gaze into each other's eyes 
So alone beneath the starless summer sky 

Sometimes the best words are left unspoken 
Sometimes the best words are left unsaid 
Sometimes it's nobody else's business 
Well together, tonight, you know that it's right 

We sit and gaze into each other's eyes 
And we kiss beneath the starless summer skies 
Sometimes the best words are left unspoken 
Sometimes the best words are left unsaid 
Sometimes it's nobody else's business 

Well together, tonight, you know that it's right 
The heat of the day begins to die 
The faintest breeze comes drifting by
 
And you and I we watch the clouds roll by 
All alone beneath the starless summer sky 
'neath the starless summer sky...

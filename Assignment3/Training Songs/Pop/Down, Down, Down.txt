Little bo peep didn't lose any sleep
Trying to make it with the sheep of the town
What she did instead was to lose her head
While attempting an assault on a human catapult

(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down

Stanley had a girlfriend
Who was given to him
Which would take him on a journey aground
Yet all he had to do was to see
I presumed to a fella who was known as doctor Livingstone

(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down

You better listen to me girl
I've got nothing to say
You better watch your step cause baby
It could very easily run away

Mary had a lamb chop for her dinner
But by suppertime she felt a bit browned (off)
So every day since then Mary's had to spend
Every penny that she's got in and out the you
Know what

(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down

You better listen to me girl
I've got nothing to say
You better watch your step cause
Baby it could very easily run away

Little bo peep didn't lose any sleep
Trying to make it with the sheep of the town
What she did instead was to lose her head
While attempting an assault on a human catapult

(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down
(Going) down, down, down, down, down

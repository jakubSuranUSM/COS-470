If I could reach the stars
I’d pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It’s only in my dreams
 
That I can
 
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world
 
If I could be king
Even for a day
I’d take you as my queen
I’d have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom that we had made
’til then i’ll be a fool
Wishing for a day
 
That I can
 
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world

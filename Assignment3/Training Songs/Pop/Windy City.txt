Listen to you
Listen to me
No one knows the reason
Why they want to be free

Workin' all night
Workin' all day
Waitin' for my money
And I can't get away

I want to be rich man
But I'm only poor man
I got to get away

Waitin' for the risin' sun to shine on windy city
You can find a place to hide yourself in windy city
I've got to get away from windy city

Your dad's in the slam
Your mama's a whore
No one understands you
Couldn't help bein' poor

But when I get rich
I'll get my kicks
From givin' it all away
Want to be free

'Cause livin' ain't easy
Want to be free
Cause that's how it's gonna be
I gotta be free

Waitin' for the risin' sun to shine on windy city
You can find a place to hide yourself in windy city

Gotta be free
Now I'm a rich man
Gotta be free
Don't want to be this man
I gotta be free

Waitin' for the risin' sun to shine on windy city
You can find a place to hide yourself in windy city
I've got to get away from windy city
I don't want to be a poor man
Don't want to be a rich man
I gotta be free
I want to be free

See the view from my window,
This place is under my skin,
I watch the beautiful people,
Then I begin.

Looking out through the key hole
I’m gazing up to the stars,
Of all the places that we know
This place is ours.
And while the world is still waiting,
Relaxing under the sun
The future's ours for the taking
Our time has come.

‘Cause we come back to welcome home
All the dreams we've never known.

They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
Your eyes are as deep as the sea
I can tell you I see another way
They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
Yeah, yeah.

The smoke that drenches this landscape
Is never far from my heart
I’m holding out for a new day
A place to start
Perhaps a room with a sea view
Give me a chance with this girl
A chance is all that I ask for to change the world.

‘Cause we come back to welcome home
All the dreams we'll ever known.

They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
Your eyes are as deep as the sea
I can tell you I see another way
They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
Yeah, yeah.

I'm calling to nowhere
I'm calling.

They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
This town is as deep as the sea
I can tell you I see another way
They say it’s a matter of time
Before our love is lost on the motorway
Yeah, yeah.

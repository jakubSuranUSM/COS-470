Love in space and time
There's no more feeling
Automated lover
Cold and unappealing

Longing to be touched
Longing for a kiss
Whisper words of love
Tell me that you miss me

See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me

Nothing to caress
Not a hand to hold
I don't need her touch
Cause her body's cold

She's programmed to receive
Automatic satisfaction
After love is done
Where's the true reaction?

See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me

Can you see me?
See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me
Can you feel me?

See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me, love me

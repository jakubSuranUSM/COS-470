It seems so easy in the light of day
And when we're there it always feels OK
But then again
I'm so alone when I am by myself
And can I ever count on someone else?
And then you say

[Chorus]

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Why don't you listen to your heart
Listen to your heart

This kind of thing keeps me awake at night
It gets so I can't sleep without the light
And then again
I wonder what I'm really wondering for
Cause where we'd be I never felt so sure
And so you say

[Chorus]

Oh, it's not as bad as it seems
Oh, it's not as crazy as my dreams
As my dreams

Alright I know that I can make it through
I have no doubts here as I talk to you
But then again

[Chorus: x2]

You gotta understand

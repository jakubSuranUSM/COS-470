I don't need nobody
tell me what to do
You can't wear me out baby
I ain't gonna live like you

I don't need nobody
Sayin' their party speaks for me
Keep your lies and your compromise
I got enough of my own personality

Everybody's waitin'
Everybody's prayin'
Everybody's sayin' we have had enough
Ain't nothin' getting better
But nothin' lasts forever
We got to stand together

No more party's
Got my own party right here

(They try to tell you)
Don't ask no questions
Don't try to use your mind
Don't take responsibility baby
Just follow the party line

Like sheep to the slaughter
We keep the fat cats fat
What people need what people want
When we gonna start talkin' 'bout that

Everybody's sellin'
Ain't nobody helpin'
Ain't nobody tellin' us the truth
Everybody's runnin'
Ain't no savior comin'
Promises mean nothin'

No more party's
Got my own party right here

Are you a Democrat? (Do you know where you're at?)
Are you a Republican? (Look at the shape you're in)
Are you a Communist? (What do we mean by this?)
What do we mean by this? (I can't even guess)

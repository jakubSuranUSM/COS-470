So I guess I'll give it up
Yeah I guess I will
What's the use in pushing
When it's all uphill

I can't be appointed
Keeper of the flame
Without two to carry
It won't burn the same - oh
It seems obvious to me 
But then again 
Could be 
You just never felt that way

[Chorus:]
I wish you believed in life
Believed in fate
Believed you were lucky
And worth the wait
'Cause life could be lovely
Life could be so great

It gets so embarrassing
So I acquiesce
And I'll change my mind again
You change your address - oh 
It seems logical to me 
But then again be	
Could be I was simply not that smart

[Chorus]

There must be some other door that they are saving
Behind which my happiness lies
I won't be wasting my words
To tell you hopes that I had 
We can just leave it alone for now 

I wish you: Believe in life
Believe in fate
Believe you are lucky
And worth the wait	
'Cause life could be lovely
Life could be fucking great.

Turn out the lights stay here always
One endless night near you always
We keep it to ourselves about our love affair
If no one ever knows about it we don't care

I fall apart near you always
Open up your heart give me always
Sometimes I don't even have to call her name
We don't make promises it's just a game

Always never-ending always no pretending
We know our love is forever
Always never-ending always no pretending
We know our love is forever

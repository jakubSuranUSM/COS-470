I dreamed she came back home last night
Asked her where she'd been
She said I've been around the world and
It almost did me in
She said I hope you didn't wait too long
I have no sense of time
I see you've written one Last Song
And I realized it's mine
Think of all the times we talked
Sing a nursery rhyme

Close your eyes 
I'm right beside you
Run for miles you know I'll find you
Cause it's all the same 
Change your lovers 
Change your name
If you need a friend 
Close your eyes 
I'm back again

She really came back home last night
Seemed as if she'd changed
Said that she go back to school
And try things once again
But you know it didn't take too long
Till she lost her way
And all the reason in the world could see 
She couldn't stay
As I helped her pack her things
It didn't hurt to say

Close your eyes 
I'm right beside you
Run for miles you know I'll find you
Cause it's all the same 
Change your lovers 
Change your name
If you need a friend 
Close your eyes 
I'm back again

Cause it's all the same 
Change your lovers 
Change your name
If you need a friend 
Close your eyes 
I'm back again

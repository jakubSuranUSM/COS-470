Embracing, the thought of tasting
My mind's a labyrinth, my heart is racing
I am waiting to escape in
A strange reality, a page I wanna paste in

Why don't you hold my hand 
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

What I wanna, what I wanna feel, feel

Surrender, I won't defend ya' 
Translation overload, return to sender 
Are you mistaken, I won't partake in
I really wanna but I promise I'm not faking 

Why don't you hold my hand

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

What I wanna feel, what I wanna feel

Feel, feel, feel
I really wanna, don't don't you wanna?
Feel, feel, feel
I really wanna, don't don't you wanna?

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
La la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

I think I wanna, do you wanna
Uh Uh Yeah Yeah

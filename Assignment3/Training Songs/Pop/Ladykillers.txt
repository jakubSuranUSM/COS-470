Here we go, I'm hanging out in Camden
Drink with my girlfriends on a Saturday night

This guy says, "come and meet my girlfriend"
She's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight

So I say "hello" and I try to be nice
But I see he's feeling itchy
Trying to play us off each other,
"Girls, girls, please don't fight" (you get the picture)

Hey you, the muscles and the long hair
Telling me that women are superior to men
Most guys just don't appreciate this
You just convincing me you're better than them

So he talks for hours about his sensitive soul
And his favorite subject is sex
I don't think he even wanted it
But, Christ this guy's too much (I want to tell him)

I'm as human as the next girl,
I like a bit of flattery
But I don't need your practiced lines, your school of charm mentality so
Save your breath for someone else and credit me with something more
When it comes to men like you,
I know the score,
I've heard it all before

(Here comes the next one)
Blondie was with me for a summer
He flirted like a maniac but I wouldn't bite
I'm weak and he was so persistent
He only had to have me 'cause I put up a fight

Oh God, the boy had such an ego
He liked to talk about himself all day and all night
You think you're such a ladykiller
But you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light

When he's nice to me he's just nice to himself
And he's watching his reflection
I'm a five foot mirror for adoring himself
Here's seven years bad luck (I want to tell him)

When you say you love me you're just flattering your vanity
But I don't need your practiced lines your, your school of charm mentality so
Save your breath for someone else and credit me with something more
When it comes to men like you,
I know the score,
I've heard it all before

Ooh, you're such a ladykiller, always on a winner, thinking that you're in there
Oh boy, you're such a ladykiller, super sexy mister, call it what you will, oh
You think you're such a lady killer, I just bet you're still there, posing in the mirror
Hey girls, he's such a ladykiller, but we know where he's coming from and we know the score.

In a room with both of your rivals
You would always turn it around
Once ya go, once ya get started
Always had that look in your eyes

You would always reach without trying
________________ out for love
Watch me take my chances on the weekends
You could always read me by heart

I know you're still green, but I'll start you a scene that you can write about 
When you come around
I know you're still green, girl
I'll start you a scene, girl

Always on the go, keep your head up now
No, no not quite that high
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

You would be no shock just to heal up
You would always question my kind
Watch you go, watch how you go run off
Watch you go, watch you get back

I know you're still green, but I'll let you go queen on these 25's
Enough tonight
I know you're still green, girl
I'll let you go queen, girl

Always on the go, keep your head up now
No, no not quite that high
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

Always on the go, keep your head up now
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right

D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance, d-d-dance, d-d-dance-dance-dance-dance-dance!

Always on the go, keep your head up now
No, no not quite that high
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

(I said dance!)
Always on the go, keep your head up now
No, no not quite that high
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

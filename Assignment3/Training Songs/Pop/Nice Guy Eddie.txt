So I'll admit that it all started as a scam
'Cause every girl wanted you and a year round tan
We know you're old but you're kind
You're rich and your heart is dicky
Yes I knew that you wanted me
And he said

Hey love how are you fixed
We'll meet at ten past now it's quarter to six
We'll spend the whole night making love on the sofa
It may sound funny but he wasn't supposed to

And then we both settled down to our favourite meal
D'you fancy veal parmesan and a case of warm Chianti
Pass my bag I picked up that bra you fancied
Yes I knew that you wanted me

Oh we knew it couldn't last
And we should have left it long before
One great year and one for luck
And like all good things you soon wanted more
You were always so polite
I think I loved you

And I said

Hey love I'm making it easy on us
I'll leave and a few of our dreams turn to dust
All night making love on your sofa
And it may sound funny but he wasn't supposed to
Summer '92 I remember it clearly
When he choked on the olive in his dry martini
There was dismay from friends he was close to
And it may sound funny but it wasn't supposed to be

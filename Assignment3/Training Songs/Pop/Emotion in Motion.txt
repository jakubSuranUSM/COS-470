I would do anything
To hold on to you
That's just about anything
Until you pull through
I'd hold on to you
'Til the stars no longer wink
I'd hold on to you
'Til you figure out
Just what to think
'Cause

[Chorus]
You're emotion in motion
My magical potion
You're emotion in motion
To me

I would go anywhere
To meet up with you
That's just about anywhere
For one rendezvous

I'd hold on to you
'Til the mountains crumble flat
I'd hold on to you
Until you figure out

Just where you're at
'Cause

[Chorus]

I would do anything
To hold on to you
That's just about anything
That you want me to

I'd hold on to you
Until you take it all in stride
I'd hold on to you
'Til you want to stay here

By my side
'Cause

[Chorus: x2]

(You're emotion in motion)
Emotion in motion
You're emotion in motion
To me

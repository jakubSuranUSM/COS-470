On your free day
All your friends have gone
To find a change of pace again
Leaving you alone
To talk to your own face again
So what else is new?
There's nothing new to say nothing new to do
But you're still breathing
Just like always
Can't manage to spend any time alone
So you call someone
You don't really want to see
But they'll understand
They'll just let you be the hollow man you are
If you want to break
On the freeway
You are being driven
To another place
And as usual about half way there you don't want to go
Anywhere anymore
Just want to go home again
On this free day
Nothing could be better than oblivion
Can i have it now
Need to have now
Let me have it now
On your free day
On this free day
On this free day

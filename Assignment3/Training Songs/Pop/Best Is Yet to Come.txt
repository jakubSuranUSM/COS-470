The Best Is Yet To Come (Luba) released on 9 1/2 Weeks soundtrack 1986
When love's astray
There's nothing you can do about it
But who can say?
I won't be better off without it
I might be down
But don't count me out
There's a world
I want to know all about
You can say I'm just dreaming
I've always been an optimistic one
I can't help feeling
That the best is yet to come
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
There comes a time
Ain't nothing you can do to stop it
Right now is mine
I'm gonna make the best time of it
Don't hold your breath
If you're waiting for me
Today is just
Tomorrow's history
Repeat chorus
You say I'm being foolish
Well, maybe that's so
But I'm not afraid
Of letting go...
There's nothing you can do about it
(Hey Hey) I know you'll say
I won't be better off without it
I'm gonna take
My heart off the shelf
I made a promise
To be good to myself
Repeat chorus
The best is yet come
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Best is yet to come
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Repeat and fade

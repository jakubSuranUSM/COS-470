Keep on walking
I'm talkin' about your street
Don't let nothin' or nobody
Throw you off your beat

Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City
Don't look down

Watch your brother
Give the man a hand
Come to know that
And you'll come to understand

You've got to
Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City

Don't look down

(Do like you do)
(Do like you do)

Do like you do in New York City

Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City
Don't look down

Do what you do
When you do what it is in the big town
Do what it is whatever it is
Do what you gotta do
To take care of biz in the big town

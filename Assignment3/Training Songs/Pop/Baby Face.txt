Rosy cheeks and turned up nose and curly hair
I'm raving 'bout my baby now
Pretty little dimples here and dimples there
Don't want to live without her
I love her goodness knows
I wrote a song about her and here's the way it goes

Baby face, you've got the cutest little baby face
There's not another one could take your place, Baby face
My poor heart is jumpin', you sure have started somethin'
Baby face, I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace
I didn't need a shove, 'cause I just fell in love
With your pretty baby face

When you were a baby not so long ago
You must have been the cutest thing
I can picture you at ev'ry baby show
Just winnin' ev'ry ribbon with your sweet baby way
Say, honest I ain't fibbin', you'd win 'em all today

Baby face, you've got the cutest little baby face
There's not another one could take your place, Baby face
My poor heart is jumpin', you sure have started somethin'
Baby face, I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace
I didn't need a shove, 'cause I just fell in love
With your pretty baby face

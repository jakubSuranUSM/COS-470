See you in my life
I see you on the screen
An ascending socialite
Orbiting the scene

And everybody wants you now
Everybody wants to be a part of your crowd
Ooh

Baby it seems sometimes you're lost in TV
Lost in a dream [instant sunshine]
Baby

We wandered through our minds
With images and scenes
And with animated lives
Rehearsing for our dreams

Everybody wants it now
Everybody wants to be a face in the crowd
Ooh

Baby it seems sometimes we're lost in TV
Trapped in a screen
Lost in a scene
Lost in TV [instant sunshine], baby

Everybody wants it now [sunshine]
Everybody wants to be a face in the crowd
Ooh

Baby it seems sometimes we're lost in TV
Lost in a dream [instant sunshine]
Baby

Oh, daytime
Night time
Anything I say
Any time of day and she's mine

There's no doubt about
She can't do without, my love
Each and every day

She looks good
Feels good
Walking down the street
Everyone we meet says we should

Go a long, long way
And should always stay in love
Each and every day

We got a feeling going for each other, yeah
I could never leave her for another girl
All these miles and we were in another world
And I love her, yes, I love her

Daytime
Night time
Anything I say
Any time of day and she's mine

There's no doubt about
She can't do without my love
Each and every day

We got a feeling going for each other, yeah
I could never leave her for another girl
All these miles and we were in another world
And I love her, yes, I love her

She looks good
(I talk about my baby)
Feels good
(I talk about my baby)
Walking down the street
Everyone we meet says we should

Go a long, long way
And should always stay in love
Each and every day

Each and every day
Each and every day
Each and every day

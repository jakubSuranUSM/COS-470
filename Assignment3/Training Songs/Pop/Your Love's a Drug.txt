I like it, I want it
The way you make my body move
I think I'm addicted
I'm high off everything you do
I'm going to call you baby
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cos you're all I need

I'll become a slave to my habit
Feigning for your love
Gotta happen now

You're all I need
Your love's drug
Can't get enough your love's a drug
And I can't sleep
Can't get enough your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug

I hate it
That feeling rushing through my veins again
Whenever you leaving
I feel withdrawal kicking in
I'm going to tell you how I feel
How I couldn't breathe
When you're not with me

I'll become a slave to my habit
Feigning for your love
Gotta happen now

You're all I need
Your love's drug
Can't get enough your love's a drug
And I can't sleep
Can't get enough your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug

'Cos I miss you when you're gone
So right what feels so wrong
That I need to have you all the time

You're all I need
Your love's drug
Can't get enough your love's a drug
And I can't sleep
Can't get enough your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug

You're all I need
Your love's drug
Can't get enough your love's a drug
And I can't sleep
Can't get enough your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug,
Your love's a drug

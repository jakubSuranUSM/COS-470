I used to feel so sad
And think too slow and drink too fast
Life had me blue and black
Till someone came and changed me back
Now you see life
These colors shimmering around you
You must decide
To risk your heart for love to find you

Hey, don't falter
You know we ought to be together
Strange, I saw ya, I sorta knew it was for ever
Please, stay with me
And never miss a chance to kiss me
Babe, I love yah
When you're with me its always summer

Now everything is fine
Because he is officially mine
And as long as we've got each other
It's gonna be officially summer
You're hypnotised
By these colours all around you
You must decide
To risk your heart for love to find you
It's only right
To have a little love around you
You must decide
To risk your heart

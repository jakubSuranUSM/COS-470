Why we gotta go so far down different roads?
Now I wonder if I want it at all
Is this how it's gotta be? 
Your love away from me?
Now I wonder if we had it all

All I know, if you could only see that
California dream that I've been living
Say you'll come, you're leaving New York City
It's just a state of mind, we'll leave it all behind

We walk around, all we hear is
The sound of our lonely heartbeats
And when we dance, all we feel is
The beat of these lonely cities
We walk around, all we hear is
The sound of our lonely heartbeats
And when we dance, all we feel is
The beat of these lonely cities

Broke each other's hearts
Three thousand miles apart
Seems so long now, we watch the summer go

All I know, if you could only see that
California dream that I've been living
Say you'll come, you're leaving New York City
It's just a state of mind, we'll leave it all behind

We walk around, all we hear is
The sound of our lonely heartbeats
And when we dance, all we feel is
The beat of these lonely cities

You and me are further than we should be
Let's escape from the lonely cities
You and me are further than we should be
Break away from the lonely cities

We walk around, all we hear is
The sound of our lonely heartbeats
And when we dance, all we feel is
The beat of these lonely cities
We walk around, all we hear is
The sound of our lonely heartbeats
And when we dance, all we feel is
The beat of these lonely cities

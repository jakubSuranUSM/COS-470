Lyrics: Michael B., di Lorenzo & Pete Smith

Verse 1
There's a voice inside us all
Calling out so we don't fall
Nothing's lost that can't be found
Ain't a thing you can't get round

Chorus 1
Turn it into something good
There's a chance you really could
Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
Gonna find you'll never lose
Turn it into something special

Verse 2
When your calm is broke into
And you don't know what to do
Hold your fire and look about
Take the flame, don't put it out

Chorus 2

Just believe in something new
We all have our part to do
Turn it into something special
And you'll still be standing strong
Hold your ground and carry on
Turn it into something special

Bridge
When you know right from the start
Gonna play it from the heart
Take a chance and make things better
Leave your fears and doubts behind
Don't give in, just keep trying
Turn it into something special

Chorus
Turn it into something good
There's a chance you really could
Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
Gonna find you'll never lose
Turn it into something Â¨C just believe in something

Don't hold in, just let it out
Keep believing there's no doubt
Take a chance and make it special
And you'll still be standing strong
Hold your ground and carry on
Turn it into something Â¨C just believe in something

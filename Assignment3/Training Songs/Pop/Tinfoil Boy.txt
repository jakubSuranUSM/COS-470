True, you're my true
My hangman true, ha-ha-ha-ha

You use the life to keep you here
You break your heart to make sure that I'm aware
Sometimes you feel like a trick
Like a hangman would, you know he never gives

The tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil, it's times like this I feel tricked into waking up

Sometimes you feel like a child
The bitter taste, it makes a mess inside your mind
Swallow down to get it out
It's like a key, it sets you free from all the mess and stress I found

I don't think I know who you are anymore

The tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil, it's times like this I feel tricked into waking up (boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy)
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil

I don't think I'll ever
Make it up to you
And I don't think I'll ever
Make it up to you

The tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil, it's times like this I feel tricked into waking up
It's times like this I feel tricked into waking up

Dragged me down, used me up, he cracked my lips, he burned my chest
He slapped my ar-, slapped my ar-, he slapped my arms, he cracked my lips
I pray you never see me cry, I don't wanna give you the sati-
Dragged me down, used me up, he cracked my lips, he burned my chest
He slapped my arms, and sucked my ki-
Bartered for like an accolade
He slapped my arms, he sucked my kiss

The tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil, it's times like this I feel tricked into waking up (boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy)
He's a tinfoil boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
For the tinfoil

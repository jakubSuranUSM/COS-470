These friends of mine live their lives
Spend their time, hoping to find
But who they are and how they're made
They may be there, hope you find your way

These friends of mine, they have wife's
They work hard to love and write
And when they left, it makes me high
To take a trip ten thousand miles before they fly

These friends of mine, they feel alone
When the shows are over, don't know where to go
In Philadelphia at Christmas time
They question those, wonder why they try

And when the show is over
How I hope that they discover the joy that they bring
And I hope they remember this bond we have together
And oh, they love to sing

These friends of mine, they're from New York
They were raised in Michigan
They don't know things, they don't hold hands
They guard their hearts the best they can

And when the show is over
How I hope they discover the joy that they bring
And I hope they remember this bond we have together
Oh, they love to sing, they sure love to sing

Maybe I needed this time to be reminded for myself
Maybe I needed this time to be reminded for myself
How I love to sing

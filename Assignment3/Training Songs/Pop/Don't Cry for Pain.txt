Hey man, here's my plan,
I'm gonna break it
Hey you, don't be sad,
Here's your chance, so take it,
If you slap my face, if you don't go,
Honestly I don't care at all

Maybe I'm a bit complicated, all I know is

I don't cry for pain,
Don't cry from fear,
You know that
I don't cry the rain,
No not a tear,
You know that
Before you leave,
When you go,
I think you oughta know,
Don't cry for pain,
I only cry for love

Hey now, dry them tears,
You know we'll never make it
'Cause you caught my eye,
Not my heart,
And play it safe,
No, I'm not that smart

I've never meant to be this complicated, all I know is

I don't cry for pain,
Don't cry from fear,
You know that
I don't cry the rain,
No not a tear,
You know that
Before you leave,
When you go,
I think you oughta know,
Don't cry for pain,
I only cry for love

I need something making me defenseless,
I don't want another waste of time
You can't hurt me, so I'm sure this can't be right

I don't cry for pain,
Don't cry from fear,
You know that
I don't cry the rain,
No not a tear,
You know that
Before you leave,
When you go,
I think you oughta know,
Don't cry for pain,
I only cry for love

I don't cry for pain,
Don't cry from fear,
You know that
I don't cry the rain,
No not a tear,
You know that
Before you leave,
When you go,
I think you oughta know,
Don't cry for pain,
I only cry for love

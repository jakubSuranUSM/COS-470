Da da da da da da do do do do da da da da da do do
You can't by stand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow
Into strange and pretty faces
I don't know
Clutching to my lipstick traces
Watch them go

And make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)

It's strange how much it changes
How they want to know
How cynical are people
That's where children go

Dragged into a conversation
They can't hold
It's so sad
But it prepares them for the mold

And make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)

Why is my love like an ocean run dry?
And why is my love
Such a struggle with life?

You can"t by stand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow

Ooh
Make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah (ooh, mistake number three)
Make mistake number three (ooh, mistake number three)

Make a mistake (ooh, mistake number three)
Ooh
Mistake number three, yeah yeah (ooh)
That's mistake number three 
Mistakes you make, mistakes you make, mistakes you make (mistake number three)
Mistake (mistake number three)

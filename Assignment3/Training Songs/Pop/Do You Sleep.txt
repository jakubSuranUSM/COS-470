Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?

Do you take plight on my tongue like lead?
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore?
I saw you as you walked across my room
You looked out the window, you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed and you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head

Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there

Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you keep me anymore?
You kick my foot under the table
I kick you back can't say that I'm able
To stand for you or fall for you ever again

Wish for a perfect setting
Wishing that I am letting you
Take me where you want me all over again
You can't give yourself
Absolutely to someone else

Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there

I saw you as you walked across my room
You looked out the window, you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head

Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?

I don't know (do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?)
And I don't care (do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?)
If I ever will be there (do you sleep anymore?)
Will be there

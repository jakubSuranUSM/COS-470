I'll clear if it's alright with you
Maybe I should go and see about you
Collect some love, if you don't mind
Collect some love, if you want mine, oh

My heart, it grows
My heart, it grows, oh

I'm fallin'
I've fallen in
I've fallen in love with you

I smile for a second, then it's gone
When I realize I'm all alone
Why is this so hard' I won't cry
Oh-so-hard, but I won't cry, no
Oh

My heart, it grows
I think it shows, oh

I'm fallin'
I've fallen in
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen
I've fallen in
I've fallen in love with you

Carry home, the night is dark and alone
I think I'm done with all the peoples taking part
So move a little closer, if you don't mind
And I leave a mark on your face, if you don't mind, no
Oh, oh, oh

I'm fallin'
I've fallen in
I've fallen in love with you
I'm fallin'
I've fallen in
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you
With you
With you
With you

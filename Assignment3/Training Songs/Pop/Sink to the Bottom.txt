I want to sink to the bottom with you
I want to sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just want to sink to the bottom with you

Cars on the highway, planes in the air
Everyone else is going somewhere
But I'm going nowhere, getting there too
I might as well just sink down with you

I want to sink to the bottom with you
I want to sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just want to sink to the bottom with you
I just want to

Out on the highway, up in the air
Everyone else is going somewhere
They're going nowhere, and I'll be there too
I might as well go under with you

I want to sink to the bottom with you
I want to sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just want to sink to the bottom with you
I just want to sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just want to sink to the bottom with you
I just want to
I just want to
I just want to

Four o'clock in the morning
Guess who's early and bright
Four o'clock in the morning
Guess who's still win it right, so right
Practice all trough the night

Four o'clock in the morning
Guess who's happy and sweet
Four o'clock in the morning
Checking, finding it complete, complete
There's no need for a fight

It's a crazy situation
When you notice you get used to all the pain
It's a crazy situation
When the moist under your eye brows
Taste like rain, never being sane

One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate
One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate

Four o'clock in the morning
I've just finished my spell
Four o'clock in the morning
Magic no one can tell, can tell
You'll be sorry as hell

Four o'clock in the morning
Guess who's early and bright
Four o'clock in the morning
I've been painting trough the night, the night
Nothing left I can sell

It's a crazy situation
When you notice you get used to all the pain
It's a crazy situation
When the moist under your eye brows
Taste like rain, never being sane

One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate
One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate

It's a crazy situation
When you notice you get used to all the pain
It's a crazy situation
When the moist under your eye brows
Taste like rain, never being sane

One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate
One minute early, one minute late
This is what they're calling fate

One wild childhood scheme
One impossible plan
A summer song, a lifetime long
A dream we built in the soft sand
The tide rolls in
Wait for your wave
There'll be another
And we will sing
I love you still like a brother
A voice soars to the night
And a million hearts take flight
The crowd still roars, the cheers are yours
But you're not there in the spotlight
The tide rolls in
Wait for your wave
There'll be another
And we will sing
I love you still like a brother
Til the beat begins
Til the voices ring
I will wait til then
Like a brother
The tide rolls in
Wait for your wave
There'll be another
And we will sing
I love you still like a brother

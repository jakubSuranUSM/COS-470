Well c'mon everybody 
And let's get together tonight 
I got some money in my jeans 
And I'm really gonna spend it right 
Been a-doin' my homework all week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
C'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' 
From my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside 
If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide 
There'll be no more movies for a week or two 
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew 
Who cares C'mon everybody

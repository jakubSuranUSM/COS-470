Don't tell me lies
When you talk about friends you've been doing
It's no surprise
To discover the tricks you've been brewing
When you turn and run away
Take a look at how you've give up your fantasy

And if you can't stand the heat
Keep out of the kitchen
If you can't stand the cold
Don't sleep on the floor
If you can't, if you can't bear to look
Wonder what you're missing
If you can't stand the heat
If you can't stand the heat
You're no competition

Can't stand the heat
Can't stand the heat

Don't play it down
When you don't have the power to hold it
Don't play the clown
If the joke gets no laugh when you've told it
Take a look at how you've give up your fantasy
When you turn and run away

And if you can't stand the heat
Keep out of the kitchen
If you can't stand the cold
Don't sleep on the floor
If you can't stand the heat
Wonder what you're missing
If you can't, if you can't bear to look
You're no competition
If you can't stand the heat

Can't stand the heat
Keep out of the kitchen
If you can't stand the cold
You're no competition
If you can't stand the heat
If you can't stand the heat

Can't stand the heat, ah

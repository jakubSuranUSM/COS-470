Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Faded red short sleeves
I can't forget the way you looked without your jeans on
It's in my drawer and you're all I dream, so
I had to let you know you left it here with me

It kills me to admit that I still want this bad
And I try to forget all the feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt, do you want it back?

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it, but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learned karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

I'd burn it in a fire if I didn't know the smell
I'd bury it six feet deep if that would help
I'd hold onto it longer, but you don't like being held
So, I'd really like to see you so that maybe I could tell you

It kills me to admit that I still want this bad
And I try to forget all the feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt, do you want it back?

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it, but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learned karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

Maybe this time, you could take one of mine
And maybe this time, everything would be fine
So, maybe tonight, we could wrong all our right's
So, maybe it's time we should give it a try

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it, but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learned karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this stupid, fucking t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

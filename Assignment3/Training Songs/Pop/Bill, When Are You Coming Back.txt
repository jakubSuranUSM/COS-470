Every morning waiting for the mailman to come.
But again he shook his head and said maybe tomorrow there'll be one.
He said, better than a letter, some guys just arrived.
I felt so much better that I ran to catch the 3:45.

I got to the station, oh, just a little bit late,
When I spotted a soldier turning through an exit gate.
Oh, I pushed through the crowd until I reached his side
And got the strangest look from a strangers eyes.

I cried, Bill, Bill, Bill when are you coming back.
I cried in a stranger's arms standing there by the railroad tracks.
Oh, yes I did.

The day you left me remains in my mind so clear.
You were saying you loved me, but the train made it hard to hear.
So, we moved by the Coke machine, oh, so we could say goodbye.
The people were staring, but I couldn't keep the tears from my eyes.

As the train departed your loving mother held me close.
We cried together, yeah, trying to keep each other host.
Oh, wherever you are you know you need it too, 
Ã¢??Cause no one in this world needs you like I do.

I cried, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill when are you coming back.
I cried in a stranger's arms standing there by the railroad tracks.
Oh, yes I did.

standing there by the railroad tracks. 
Oh, yes I did.

No news is good news; at least, that's what your mama said.
But, I could see in her eyes, she too, is so afraid.
Now, I've got nothing to cling to except what I felt inside, 
When I cried I loved you and looked into that stranger's eyes.

Oh, I miss you, Bill. 
I can't stand the pain of knowing if I'll ever see you again!

I cried, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill when are you coming back.
I cried in a stranger's arms standing there by the railroad tracks.
Oh, yes I did.

Billy, baby! 
Billy, baby, when are you coming back?
I cried in a stranger's arms standing there by the railroad tracks.
Oh, yes I did.

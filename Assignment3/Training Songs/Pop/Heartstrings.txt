Doing fine all on my own.
'Cause I know that's right for me.
Now you're feeling all alone.
I bet you're sorry now but that's what you wanted.
You took me for granted all the time.

Had to save my heart
Save it from all your evil games
And now it ain't the same
You will have no such luck to try to come inside
And then to be denied

Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh
Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh

Now you know I'm doing well.
You try to catch me when I'm finally free.
You only did this to yourself.
I bet you're sorry now but that's what you wanted.
You took me for granted all the time.

Had to save my heart
Save it from all your evil games
And now it ain't the same
You will have no such luck to try to come inside
And then to be denied

Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh
Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh

Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh
Tie my heartstrings
I tie my heartstrings oh

I was fighting, for you
Now I'm fine, but you
(For you)

Have a new

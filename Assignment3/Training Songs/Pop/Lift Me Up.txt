Love is what I want
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby
Talk is what I want What I want
Oh, yeah What I want
And all you gotta do is bring it to me, baby

Talk Come on, let's talk about it
Talk Can't seem to do without it
Talk Don't want to be one of the broken hearted

So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken hearted
River's deep and wide

All I want is love What I want
Oh, yeah What I want
And all you gotta do is listen to me, baby What I want

(Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think)

You got to think about it
And do something about it
No use complainin' when it's over

So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken hearted
River's deep and wide

Life 'Cause life gets tougher every
Day Day if you can't afford to
Pay Pay, even so you got to carry on carry on

So lift me up, finish what you started
Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken hearted
River's deep and wide
Lift me up

Take me on for a ride
Lift me up from the broken hearted
River's deep and wide

Lift me up
Lift me up
Lift me up
The river's deep and wide

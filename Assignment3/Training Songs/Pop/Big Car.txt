"All the way to the bottom, Maggie! You made it! AAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!!"

Here are words I may not read
(Big Car can be seen) 
Shine headlights on me
Here are paths I may not tread
(Big Car can be seen) 
Shine headlights on me

If you ever thought to calm down
Come down and see me / It's now I need you
and never an unkind word need be said
about your life overhead

Here are calls I may not hear 
(Big Car can be seen) 
Shine headlights on me
Here are sights I may not see
(Big Car can be seen)
Shine headlights on me

"Look out, buster, you're about to be run over by some guru."

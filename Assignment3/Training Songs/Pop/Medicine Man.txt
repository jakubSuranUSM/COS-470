Hot in the night, cold in the morning
The spirit alive is calling my name
The healer inside will pray for the lonely
Remember the time you stole me away

You didn't know me but once in my veins
You had a whole but nothing to say
You got it all now the spirit alive is calling my name

I don't know what you do but it's making me better
Can we lay down, lay down together?
I'ma take you like a drug
Can you take me to heaven?
Can you love, can we love, can we love, can we love forever?

'Cause I want you
I want you
I want you, medicine man

Send me a sign, send me no warning
I never know why my heart's on a chain

You didn't know me but once in my veins
You had a whole but nothing to say
You got it all now the spirit alive is calling my name

I don't know what you do but it's making me better
Can we lay down, lay down together?
But I'ma take you like a drug
Can you take me to heaven?
Can you love, can we love, can we love, can we love forever?

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you, medicine man
'Cause I want you
I want you
I want you, medicine man

Oh you got me in your loving arms
Oh you got me in your loving arms

I don't know what you do but it's making me better
When we lay down, lay down together
I'ma take you like a drug
Can you take me to heaven?
Can you love, can we love, can we love, can we love forever?

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you, medicine man
'Cause I want you
I want you
I want you, medicine man

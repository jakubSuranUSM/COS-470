Warning there's a storm approaching
I see it is moving our way
I can't reach you
The wind hurts my eyes

And we've got to hide
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane
We have go to run 

From the island
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane
Hold out your hand

I cannot see you
Warning there's a storm approaching
You, like a bolt of lightning
We were strangers on a train

Thinking that we'd never meet again
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane
We have go to run 

From the island
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane
Hold out your hand

I cannot see you
Screaming, is a silent whisper
Find me, I won't let you go now
I can't reach you

The wind hurts my eyes
And we've got to hide
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane

We have go to run 
From the island
We have got to run
Away from the hurricane

Hold out your hand
I cannot see you

Sh-sh-sh-shut up
Nobody cares what you have to say
Eh, eh
Shut up, (shut up)
Nobody's listening to you anyway eh

You got your eye liner done wrong
Fake nails to long
Fingers all up in my face
Tryna put me in my place but
You think you
Can just say what you wanna
But tonight I'm gonna gonna
Smack you
Right across your lips
Gonna lose your lip stick
'Cause you keep on talking shit
I'm gonna kick you
Right between your hips
'Cause your such a catty bitch
And for me it's such a switch
'Cause I'm usually such a lady

Woah

But tonight I'm gonna smack a bitch
Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
Tonight I'm gonna smack a bitch
Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 

Speak up, (shut up)
I know it's hard to talk with swollen lips
Eh, eh
Now get up, 
Oh wait
Let me take my heels up between your hips
Hey ey ey

You got your eye liner done wrong
Fake nails to long
Fingers all up in my face
Tryna put me in my place but
You think you
Can just say what you wanna
But tonight I'm gonna gonna
Smack you
Right across your lips
Gonna lose your lip stick
'Cause you keep on talking shit
I'm gonna kick you
Right between your hips
'Cause your such a catty bitch
And for me it's such a switch
'Cause I'm usually such a lady

Woah

But words don't work 
And you can't walk away
You brought out a side of me

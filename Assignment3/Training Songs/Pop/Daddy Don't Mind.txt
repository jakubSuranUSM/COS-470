Sass E. Frass and Joe D. Glow
Headin' out to the picture show
Sweet innocence, not yet eighteen
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see

Heavy Chevy soft top down
One-arm driver, the other arm around
Switched on hi-fi rock 'n' roll, roll, roll
Gunnin' the engine, headin' for the open road

Given strict instructions
Not to fall for no seductions
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see
Joe had no such orders
Gonna try and cross the border
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see

Sass makes the move, she straightens her seams
Joe checks in the mirror, he thinks he's James Dean
He pulls on over, says he's got a flat
Sass is no fool, she knows where he's at

Given strict instructions
Not to fall for no seductions
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see
Joe had no such orders
Gonna try and cross the border
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see

She's had love, and she's had kissin'
Knows what she's been missin'
No turnin' back for little Sass E. Frass
Will they be standin' side by side
If their love they cannot hide?
No turnin' back for little Sass E. Frass

Sass E. Frass and Joe D. Glow
Never made it to the picture show
Sweet innocence thrown out the door
She'll never be the same no more

Given strict instructions
Not to fall for no seductions
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see
Joe had no such orders
Gonna try and cross the border
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see

Ooh, Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see
Ooh, Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see
Ooh, Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see

See her at the carnival
Where she comes from nobody knows
Now that you ask me
I guess I like the way she wears her clothes

The way she smiles at me
My heart just swells it grows and grows
You think I'm telling you fairytales
I suppose

Don't you know it's magic
Ah baby it's magic
Look in her eyes they're a little bit hazy
Paradise coming to a sweet little lady

Well don't you know it's magic
Oh baby it's magic
Magic carpet ride for a woman in love

Take a gun and shoot your friend
As long as you take your turn
When you're only six years old
You own the world you've got friends to burn

If you want to be an Indian chief or a sherrif
Respect you've got to earn
Fairytales, you gotta learn

Don't you know it's magic
Ah baby it's magic
See the little boy just standing there
A bow in his hand, a feather in his hair

Well don't you know it's magic
Ah baby its magic
Magic carpet ride for the little boy's dream

When you're dealing with your brother
Man to man 
And you need a helping hand
All you gotta do
Is take a positive view

Oh you know you can
Please, believe you can

Don't you know it's magic
Ah baby it's magic
Take the hand of your brother and do what's best
Give a whole lotta lovin' and happiness, well 

Don't you know it's magic
Ah baby it's magic
Magic carpet ride for you and me

It's been said many ways
Feliz Navidad and Happy Holidays
Don't matter if you're nine or ninety-eight
Everyone's waiting for the chance to say

Finally it's Christmas, yeah, feels good
Around this time of year
You can't deny there's something in the air
If you're in London or in Santa Fe
You'll hope for snow to fall on Christmas day
Finally it's Christmas

Don't delay
Santa's on his way
So get your stockings up
In time for Christmas day
Don't dismay
Throw your cares away
It's gonna be okay
Finally it's Christmas
Finally it's Christmas
Feels like we've been waiting all year
Finally it's Christmas
Can't you feel the Christmas time cheer

All of the plans are made
So tell your urgent call that it can wait
Just sit back and listen for the reindeer on the rooftop
Flying North Pole to Tulsa on a non-stop

I hear the church bells ring
The chorus welcoming the newborn king
Good will and love is what the savior brings
Now the world comes together and sings

Finally it's Christmas
Feels like we've been waiting all year
Finally it's Christmas
Can't you feel the Christmas time cheer
Finally it's Christmas

(Shake your Christmas bells)

Don't delay
Santa's on his way
So get your stockings up
In time for Christmas day
Don't dismay
Throw your cares away
It's gonna be okay
Finally it's Christmas day

Shake your Christmas bells

Finally it's Christmas
Feels like we've been waiting all year
Finally it's Christmas
Feels like we've been waiting all year
(Finally it's Christmas)
Shake your bells like you mean it now, let's celebrate
Finally it's Christmas
(Finally it's Christmas)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!

I have flowers in my garden
You have never seen
The devil grows his blood red roses
Just for me

And I know that nothing lasts forever
So this can't last forever
Give me your deadline
Tell me the time
Won't you please
Let me go home ?

Days of sunshine
Is this all mine ?
So ungrateful now
Sang my own song done nothing wrong
I wouldn't know how

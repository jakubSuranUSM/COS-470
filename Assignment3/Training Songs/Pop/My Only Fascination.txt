MY ONLY FASCINATION

You'r my only fascination, my sweet inspiration
Everything i hoped could be
You're the dawn that rises for me
My summer breeze from the sea

Some lucky day you came my way and sharedMy joy and sorrow
With words so true, your coloured blue the clear sky of tomorrow
I touched your hand once again you gently sayYou need me
You’re more than spring, my love you bring is laughter everyday

(chorus)
You're my only fascination, my sweet inspiration
Everything i hope would be
You're the dawn that rises for me
My summer wind from the sea
Your my only fascination, my sweet inspiration
You’re my tender harmony
If it rains it’s music I  hear, 
only because you are near

For what you say 
in your way 
can fill my heart with sunshine
Somehow i know 
this love will grow 
and that you'll always be mine
The morning new 
can talk to you
When you awake each morning
The friendly wind 
will stop and sing
The moment you say hello

(chorus)
You're my only fascination, my sweet inspiration
Everything i hope would be
You're the dawn that rises for me
My summer wind from the sea
Your my only fascination, my sweet inspiration
You’re my tender harmony
If it rains it’s music I  hear, 
only because you are near

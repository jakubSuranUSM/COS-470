I can't believe that I ever let you go
And assumed your heart was broken
I wanted love where I could come and go
Now the door's no longer open
Why don't you take us back to then,
No I'll never hurt you again,
Now I know you're all I need.

You gotta come on and rescue me
Tell me what I should be, yeah,
You gotta come on and rescue me,
What do you want me to be.

I realized that it's hard to be apart,
You discovered it could be easy,
And all I think of is why get together, to break apart,
You wonder why you loved me.

You gotta come on and rescue me
Tell me what I should be, yeah,
You gotta come on and rescue me,
What do you want me to be.

Oh, you're meaning the world to me,
And I just wanna get up, and make up,
Only you know how to save me,
I need you now, I need you baby

We'll live forever, under the light,
Of the moon, the stars, and all things bright,
We go together, heart and mind,
We go together, don't you find,

And if you're ever stuck someday,
Turn around, call my name,
Shout it out, in to the air,
I will be, I will be there.

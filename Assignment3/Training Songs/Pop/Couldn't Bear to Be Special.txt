Bo bo bee, bo bee, bo bo-bo bee, bo bee, bo
I couldn't bear to be special, 
I couldn't bear, couldn't bear. 
I couldn't bear, right? 

Bo bee, bo bee, bo
So don't look at me and say, 
That I'm the very one, 
Who makes the cornball things occur, 

The shiver of the fur.
Don't expect so much of me, 
I'm just an also-ran,
There's a mile between 

The way you see me and the way I am.
So, don't stare at me that way, 
Of course it gives me pride,
But I won't take on the risk, 

Of letting down the sweet sweet side
Did you mean to humble me? 
So you did it unsuspectingly!
Oh words are trains, 

For moving past what really has no name.
Bo bo bee, bo bee, bo
I couldn't bear to be special, 
I couldn't bear, couldn't bear.

So, don't look at me and say, 
That I'm the very one, 
Who makes the cornball things occur, 
The shiver of the fur, right?

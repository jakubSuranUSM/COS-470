[Chorus:]
Why does your love hurt so much? 
Why? 
Why does you love hurt so much? 
Don't know why 

You know I loved you baby 
But all the while you just betrayed me 
In the world of a day 
All the things that you said were 

Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 

[Chorus:]

You said our love was secret 
But you left me alone to make it 
You want to come back someday 
But darling here's what I say 

Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 

[Chorus:]

Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 

Why,Why does your love hurt so much? 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 

You say you come back again someday but darling here's what I say 
Ladidadida 
Ladidadida 

Why does your love hurt so much? 
That's what I say 
Why? 
You say you come back someday but darling here's what Isay

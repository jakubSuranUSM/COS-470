Late again today, he'd be in trouble though he'd say he was sorry, he'd have to hurry out to the bus 

Horace was so sad, he'd never had a girl that he could care for, and if he was late once more, he'd be out 

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door,
Well he just stood there mumblin and fumblin' 
Then a voice from above said-
Horace wimp,this is your life,
Go out and find yourself a wife,
Make a stand and be a man,
And you will have a great life plan   

Horace met a girl, she was small and she was very pretty, he thought he was in love, he was afraid 

Asks her for a date, the caf√© dowm the street tomorrow evening, his head was reeling, when she said   Yes, O K   

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door,
Well he just stood there mumblin' and fumblin' 
Then a voice from above said-
Horace wimp,this is your life,
Go out and find yourself a wife,
Make a stand and be a man,
And you will have a great life plan  

Horace, this is it, he asks the girl if maybe they could marry, when she says  gladly,   
Horace cries 

Everybody's at the church, when Horace rushes in and says   Now here comes my wife,for the rest of my life,   and she did 

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door,
Well he just stood there mumblin and fumblin' 
Then a voice from above said-
Horace wimp,this is your life,
Go out and find yourself a wife,
Make a stand and be a man,
And you will have a great life plan

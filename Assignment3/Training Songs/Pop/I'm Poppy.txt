P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, that's me!

Welcome to the new world, I'm your internet girl
Open up and you'll see, everyone is happy
I like your technology, can you put it on me?
The future is so pretty, we're livin' in harmony

But Poppy, how do I live in your future paradise?
All you have to do is follow these steps
Say

P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, that's me!

Pop, pop, pop, Poppy
Pop, pop, pop, Poppy-y
Pop, pop, pop, Poppy
Poppy-y-y, that's me!

Life can be like a dream if you let me be your queen
You know where to find me, on your telephone screen
Please electrify me, power my battery
I need your energy to store all your memory

But Poppy, how can I be like you?
I'm having trouble figuring you out
All you have to do is follow these steps

P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, that's me!

Pop, pop, pop, Poppy
Pop, pop, pop, Poppy-y
Pop, pop, pop, Poppy
Poppy-y-y, that's me!

Internet, computer, camera, vlog
Now you're starting to get it
Let's sing it again

P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy
P-O-P-P-Y, I'm Poppy

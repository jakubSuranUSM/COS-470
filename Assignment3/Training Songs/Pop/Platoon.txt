Ooh brother
Ooh it's funny
How good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell who you
Want to

Under the rocks
Down by the beach
No, I'm not, not where you
Want me

Ooh brother
It's how good you are

Ooh brother
It's how good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell who you
Want to

I see the snake
Down by my feet
Walk on just you
Watch me

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell who you
Want to

Behind my back
And the love beneath
Whispered into nothing

Captain's telling me that I am welcome
He's saying that soon this bird will fly
He says the forecast's looking fine.
'Cross the runway I can see you
Looking lost and trying not to cry.
I see you getting smaller

I wish that I could stail her
Leave this pane but
L.A. Goodbye
Oh
Oh
Oh

L.A. Goodbye -
L.A. Goodbye
Oh
Oh
Oh

Two hearts in love that will die.
In just a minute says the captain
We'll take off from here and ride the sky.
He says it's still "No Smoking".
All along we knew that this would happen

We just tried to hide it from ourselves
We tried to stay together
As if it was forever

Oh
Forever.
L.A. Goodbye
Oh
Oh
Oh
. . .
L.A. Goodbye
Oh
Oh
Oh

From way up high -
L.A. Goodbye

Two hearts in love that wiil die.
L.A. Goodbye
Oh
Oh

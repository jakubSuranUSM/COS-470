It's just another, testimony
That you are my, my one and only
You're my kind, my perfect find
And you are mine

It's just another, testimony
Make me believe, in matrimony with you baby
You're my kind, my perfect find
And you are mine

Everybody knew that I'd never be the one
To give my love no I'd turn and I'd run in the other direction
Now nobody can believe just what they see
But they see you and they see me give all my love and affection

Another testimony
That you are my, my one and only
You're my kind, my perfect find
And you are mine

Now well, I can't explain it
Thought I'd never entertain it
I'm picturing a ring on my finger
And now that I'm alone at home I hold your favorite cologne
Sometimes I'll spray it and let it linger

You're my kind

(Everybody knew that I'd never be the one
To give my love no I'd turn and I'd run)

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

(Now nobody can believe just what they see
But they see you and they see me love)

Whoa whoa whoa

It's just another, testimony
That you are my, my one and only
You're my kind, my perfect find
And you are, and you are, and you are hey

It's just another, testimony
Make me believe, in matrimony 
You're my kind, my perfect find
And you are and you are mine

You're my kind, my perfect find
Hey
You're my kind, my perfect find

Just another, testimony 
Just another, testimony
Just another, testimony

Mmmm, Mmmm, Mmmm

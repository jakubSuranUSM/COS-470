Oh, God, I haven't read your book 
I'm sure it was divine 
Especially the part where you turned water into wine 

Oh, God, I want you to clear my mind 
It's covered up with dirt 
And I want to taste your skin 
One time before I taste the earth 

Oh, God, I apologize 
I didn't knock when I arrived 
Oh, God, I apologize 
I didn't say goodbye last night 
Oh, God 

Now I guess you have your way 
As I taste the earth today 

Now I guess you have your way 
As I taste the earth today 

Now I guess you have your way 
As I taste the earth today 

Now I guess you have your way 
As I taste the earth today

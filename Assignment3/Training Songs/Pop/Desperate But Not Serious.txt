If I ask you difficult questions
If I make improper suggestions
Would you find that a risk to your health
Would you put me up on the bookshelf
With the books and the plants?

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious

If I were kind and adoring
How would that be? 
Very boring Mister Pressman 
With your penknife always asking about my sex life
and who with and how many times?

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious

All the advice seems so unkind
"If you don't stop, you will go blind!"
They tell you it's none of their business
and console you with a big kiss
on the lips and on the back of your neck
(oh heck!)

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious

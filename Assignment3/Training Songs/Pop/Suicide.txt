[Unverified] something's happening
Out there on the street
Always something turning
Every time I'm near
Every time I'm near

Looking through the night
Always something cooking
Looking for a fight like this

I know there's something out there
Feels like suicide
Always something turning
Something going through my mind

I know there's something out there
Feels like suicide
Always something cooking
Something going through my mind
My mind

Always something happening
Feels like suicide
Always something turning
Going through my mind

I know there's something out there
(Trying)
To die
Always something cooking
Something going through my mind
Through my mind

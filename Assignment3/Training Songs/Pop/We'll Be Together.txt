Days in blue
An' nights in fever
Fall in Chinatown
Flames an' light
A silent fire
Not a single sound

Who used to cry for love
Time an' time again
I used to cry for some love tonight

An' we'll be together
With a little luck a little luck
We'll be comin' out of the dark
Say you will
Say you'll come my way

An' this means forever
With a little luck a little luck
We'll be comin' out of the dark
Say you will
Say you'll come

Night is cold
An' moon is flashin'
In a lonesome dance
I don't care
'Cause you're beside me
I can take my chance

It's like a wave
That touched my skin
An' I'll let you stay

We'll be together

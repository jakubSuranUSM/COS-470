When the one thing in your life comes crashin'
What you gonna do?
When naievety was my energy
Like power was you tool
And you broke me down like diamonds
Turned my blood to rust
Abuser of an innocence
Your real love was lust

'Cause you had to be something
Be someone
And play, play, play, play games with heads
Got the chill when you passed go
You had me like a remote
All you wanted was control

'Cause you had to be something
Be someone
And here are the terms on which you'll live:
I'll hate who I want, and I'll give when I give

And just because you're insecure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure

One lie for one lie
And now I bet you're happy
And you let it go so soon
Always at the back of my mind

You had to be something
Be someone
And here are the terms on which you'll live:
I'll hate who I want, and I'll give when I give

And just because you're insecure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure

Mmm 
Don't'cha think I'm like a spider
Spinning lies
Won't'cha step inside my parlour
Little fly

My oh my, my, my
My oh my, my my, my my, my, my

Mmm
Flying like a paper glider 
Round and round 
Won't you let me try and softly 
Guide you down

My oh my, oh, my
My oh my, my my, my my

And it was all night
I was wondering what I could do
And it'll be alright
When I get together with you
We've got a lot of ooooh to do

Mmm, 
Now my eyes are open wider
Little fly (hey)
Won't'cha step inside my parlour
Or die

My oh my, oh, my
My oh my, my my, my my

And it was all night (all night)
I was wondering what I could do
And it'll be alright (all)
When I get together with you
We've got a lot of ooooh

All night (all)
I was wondering what I could do
And it'll be alright (all night)
When I get together with you
We've got a lot of ooooh to do

All night (all night)
I was wondering what I could do
And it'll be alright (all)
When I get together with you

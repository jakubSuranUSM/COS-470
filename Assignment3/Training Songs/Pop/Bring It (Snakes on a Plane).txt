Times are strange
We've got a free upgrade
For snakes on a plane
F*ck 'em, I don't care
Pop the cheap champagne
We're going down in flames, hey

Oh! I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it! [Repeat: x4]

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye

It's time to fly
Tonight the sky's alive
With lizards serpentine
Lounging in their suits and ties
Watch the whore's parade
For the price of fame, hey

Oh! I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it! [Repeat: x4]

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye

Ladies and gentlemen,
These snakes is slitherin'
With dollar signs in their eyes
With tongues so reptilians
This industry's venomous
With cold-blooded sentiments
No need for nervousness
It's just a little turbulence

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye

Oh! I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it! [Repeat: x4]

We seem to be losing altitude at an alarming pace
From midtown to downtown
Snakes on a blog
I suggest you grab your ankles and kiss your ass goodbye

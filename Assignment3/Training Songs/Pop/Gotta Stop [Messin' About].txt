Sittin' outside your door
About to break down
Fourth time this week
Somebody's come around
Who's it gonna be tonight
Who's the lucky man?
Where you get the attitude
I'll never understand
Uh-oh, here he comes now
So happy that he came
Hey, was it good, boy?
Thoughts on, of her aim

What goes on inside your head
That makes you want to take them all to bed?
Gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
You know you gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
Ow!

Uh-oh, yeah
When I call you on the phone
You act so unconcerned
(I wanna) I want to get you all alone (ooh, baby)
To show you what I've learned
You won't give me the time of day
You won't give me some time
You won't give me anything
God, you think you're too fine

Can't you see?
All I want is a little time
Been playing with my toy so much I'm gonna go blind
Gotta stop, gotta gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta gotta stop messin' about
Ooh, ow!
Uh-oh, yeah
You, oh, gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
You do it too much
You gotta stop, gotta-gotta stop messin' about
Ooh, stop!

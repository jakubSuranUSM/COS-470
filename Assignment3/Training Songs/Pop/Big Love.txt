Lookin' out for love
In the night so still
Oh I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill

Lookin' out for love, ah, ah ho
Big, big love, ahh ho

You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill

Lookin' out for love, ah, ah ho
Big, big love, ahh ho

Woo, woo
Woo
Yeah, yeah

I wake up alone
With it all
I wake up
But only to fall

Lookin' out for love, ah ho
Big, big love, ahh ho

Lookin' out for love, ah, ah ho
Big, big love, ahh ho

Huu ha
Huu ha
Huu ha
Huu haee
Huu haee
Huu haee
Huu haee
Huu haee
Huu haee

Yeah
Woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo

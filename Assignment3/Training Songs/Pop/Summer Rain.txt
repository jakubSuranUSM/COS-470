Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for a train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him saying "nothing will change"
Come dance with me baby, in the summer rain

I remember the rain on our skin
And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds
Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for a train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain

I remember laughing 'till we almost cried
There at station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

I can hear the whistle military train
I was dancing with my baby, in the summer rain
I can here him singing "Ooh "Love Is Strange"
Come dance with me baby, in the summer rain

I remember the rain pouring down
And we poured our hearts out as the train pulled out
I can see my baby waving from the train
It was last time that I saw him in the summer rain

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Every time I see the lightning
Every time I hear the thunder
Every time I close the window
When this happens in the summer

Oh, the night is so inviting
I can feel that you are so close
I can feel you when the wind blows
Blows right through my heart

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Every night and every day now 
Though I know you've gone away 
Somewhere in my heart I'm always 
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always

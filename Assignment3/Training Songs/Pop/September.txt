Hold me down 
Let me drown 
I don’t want 
To have any of it

Flow my cloud 
On the ground 
I don’t want 
To have any of it

We could run all you want
We could talk 
Like you never knew it
There was never anyone to talk to me 
Like you ever knew it

You don’t mind 
You don’t mind where you want it
And you could talk loud, 
You could talk loud if you know you want it

I just want you to remember
Before you get carried away
What happened just is September
You know you want it baby

Hold your head up
Reach for the sun.

Reaching for the sun
Reaching for the sun you know

I just want you to remember
Before you get carried away
What happened just is September

Yeah, I just want you to remember
Before you get carried away
What happen just till September
You know you want it baby.

When I make it, I'll be on time
Gonna take what I want and give you a piece of my mind

Your black hearts waited too long,
Just to see me fall down, fall down, fall down
Your black hearts won't be around, just to see me fall down

Your hearts on fire, so come on, burn brighter
Your hearts on fire, so come on, burn brighter

Your hearts on fire, but your cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your hearts on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever giving up

When I make it, I'll be on time yeah
Well you might say I'm crazy, but oh I'm out of my mind
Well excuse me black hearts, will you tell me who is up and who is down?
Are you waiting for me to fall down?

Your hearts on fire, so come on, burn brighter
Your hearts on fire, so come on, burn brighter

Your hearts on fire, but your cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your hearts on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever giving up
So come on, come on, come on, hey yeah!

Your hearts on fire, but your cold to the touch
I know you want it but you love yourself too much
Your hearts on fire but your head is a rut
You best believe it, I ain't ever give'n' up
Hey hey hey

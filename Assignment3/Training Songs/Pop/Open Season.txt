We used to have it all planned
We thought we knew what it all looked like
We were looking out on the greatest view
We were raised to take a stand
We were raised to keep an open mind
We believed we'd just sail on through
Now I'm a hundred miles an hour
Sitting in my palace without any power
Alone in the dark
We're alone in the dark
Thought we could always try a bit harder
But if the dice don't wanna roll in your favor
It falls apart, the fantasy falls apart

And this is open season
Time is up, time to be leaving
Head on down this very arbitrary road
Armor up, and say your prayers
From underdogs and millionaires
I heard you better off on your own
But I ain't gonna face this hunt alone
So I'll be needing you
And I know you'll be needing me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
And I believe in you
And I know you believe in me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together

All the faces we've forgotten
All the tracks we've given up
Only saw you for a moment
No it was nowhere near enough
But I take it as it comes
I take it as I only can
I take it all, and run where it goes

'Cause this is open season,
Time is up, time to be leaving
Head on down this very arbitrary road
Armour up, and say your prayers
From underdogs and millionaires
I heard your better off on your own
But I ain't gonna face this hunt alone
So I'll be needing you
And I know you'll be needing me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
And I believe in you
And I know you believe in me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
So I'll be needing you.

We're only at the start

So I'll be needing you
And I know you'll be needing me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
And I believe in you
And I know you believe in me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together

So I'll be needing you
And I know you'll be needing me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
And I believe in you
And I know you believe in me too
We're in this game together
We're in this game together
So I'll be needing you

I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm
I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars
But I had a great night 'cause you kept rubbing against my arm
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm

Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip 
Just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town 
Just so I can be alone with you
Now go when your ready my heads 
Getting heavy pressed against your arm
I adore you

All of my money is spent on these nights just so we can hang out
Spacing in and out of these dresses I wanna be found
By you, found by you

Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip 
Just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town 
Just so I can be alone with you
Now go when your ready my heads 
Getting heavy pressed against your arm
I adore you, I adore you

I kick the gutter in tight shorts, basketball courts
Watch me, watch him talk to girls
I'm known as a right hand slugger
Anybody else wanna touch my lover

Get me a drink I get drunk off one sip 
Just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town 
Just so I can be alone with you
Now go when your ready my heads 
Getting heavy pressed against your arm
Just to adore you, I adore you

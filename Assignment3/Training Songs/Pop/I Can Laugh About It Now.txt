I can laugh about it now,
But couldn't then
You made me ache,
So I went for a run
In the driving rain
Through your neighbourhood streets
And then there you were,
A shilouette in the wet night air.
Me in my pumps in
The pouring rain in
A kind of despair
Upon finding you there,
Couldn't whisper your name.
So, I can laugh about it now
By your side
Oh I can laugh about it now
By your side
Oh, sha la la la,
We're all in trouble,
Is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?
And the very next day,
Through the shrieks of the crowd
Came your careless self
Your oh-so-couldn't careless self.
And you just pass me by,
Your friends catch my eyes
"we know you love her,
We saw you dancing with her shadow".
And I couldn't disagree,
And for the life of me
I could call out your name,
And call out your name,
And call out your name.
Oh, I can laugh about it now
By your side
I can laugh about it now
By your side.
Oh, sha la la la,
We're all in trouble,
Is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?
Sha la la la,
Oh we're all in trouble,
Or is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?, on earth?
I can laugh about it now
I can laugh about it now
By your side.
Oh, sha la la la,
Oh we're all in trouble,
Or is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?
Sha la la la,
We're all in trouble,
Or is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?
Sha la la la,
Is there room in the sky
For all of us angels here
On earth?, on earth?

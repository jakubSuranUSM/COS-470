Though it's hard to admit it's true
I've come to depend on you
You and your angelic shout
Loud enough for two

And that is why
I'll confide in you the truth this time
That is why
I just can't go on and live this lie

Yesterday all was right as rain
Now the forecast's not
It's partly cloudy with trouser stains
In his copy of inquiring minds

But that never meant that much to her
She chose to keep her nose too clean
She rather keep it pointed anyway
In the spine of a magazine

And that is why
I'll confide in you the truth this time
That is why
I just can't go on and live this lie

And when I say I trust in you
I promise you the truth
And when you say I bet you won't
You know I will
And it'll be better in the end

So when you think you got it figured out
Then you know you don't
Like all the rest you'd like to sit and pout
But of course you won't

And that is why
I'll confide in you the truth this time
That is why
I just can't go on and live this lie

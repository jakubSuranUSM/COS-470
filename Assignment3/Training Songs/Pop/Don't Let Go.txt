When you're school shy and the world it ain't easy to find
And it's breakin' your heart
'Cause you know you were no good from the start
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go,
Don't let go oh oh oh

When you're headin' nowhere
And those friends who you relied upon don't care
And your room is a cage
Ain't nobody gonna help you ease your rage
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go,
Don't let go oh oh oh, oh oh

I know that it's so easy to advise
But I hear someone callin'
And I feel somethin' fallin'
Through the money in your eyes
When all faith has gone
And you ain't got the strength to carry on
Like a child bathed in me
Hide away from the lovin that you seek
But don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go

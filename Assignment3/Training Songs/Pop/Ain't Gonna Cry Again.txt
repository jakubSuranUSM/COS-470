You're a mystery to me
You make your own reality
And I wonder who you are beneath your skin
Guess I'll never know for sure
But I was save behind my door
Can't think how I let you talk your way back in
Should have known better then
But I know better now..

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
And I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I ain't gonna cry again..

You think I need you - but I don't
You think I'll break down - but I won't
You've had everything you're gonna get from me
Saw your pleasure in my pain
And it release me from my chains
And I woke up to my own insanity
Waiting for changes that were
Never gonna come...

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
And I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell 
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I ain't gonna cry again..
Now that I see you're twisted
I don't know how missed it before
Maybe that's what drew me to you
But this was now and that was then
You'll never make me cry again..

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
And I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I ain't gonna cry again

The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear

No don't disappear
Ever had that feeling
Almost broke in two
Said that you were leaving

Like you do you do
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more

In tears in tears
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near

Never had that feeling
Until i first met you
Never felt like kneeling
Now i do, yes i do (yes i do)

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near
Ooh be near me, be near, be near

The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear

No don't disappear
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near

Be near me, be near
What's your reputation? (ecstasy)
What's your destination? (next to me)
Be near me

What's your reputation? (ecstasy)
What's your destination? (next to me)
What's your reputation? (ecstasy)
What's your destination? (next to me)
What's your reputation?

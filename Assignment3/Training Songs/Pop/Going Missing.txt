I sleep with my hands across my chest
And i dream off you with someone else
I feed my body with things i don't need until i sink to the bottom

Don't act like it came as a surprise
don't believe me?, then look into these eyes

This can't go on so i should just regret it regret it regret it
And even though i led you on forget it forget it forget it

I'm going missing for a little while 
i've got nothing left to loose
I don't listen to anything

I still remember how you move
And i taste your scent upon my lips
Well how it started, i will never know
But now i've reached my limit

Do you ever want to wear your body out?
until there's nothing left to take?
The rain began to push you away
Has midnight come too soon again?

I've got nothing in defence
I've got nothing left to loose

I sleep with my hands across my chest and i dream of you with someone else

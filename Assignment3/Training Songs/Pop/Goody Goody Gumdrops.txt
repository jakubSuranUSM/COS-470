I'm gettin' weaker, weaker, 
Ev'ry time I hear her name. 
Ah she's gettin' sweeter, sweeter, 
This girl is driving me insane. 

[Chorus]
Goody Goody Gumdrops, 
My heart is doin' flip-flops, 
Gee, what love can do. 
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, 
Goody Goody Gumdrops, 
With a girl like you. 

Ev'rything is good about her, 
I just couldn't live without her, 
'Cause when I kiss her, 
My words come out this way. 

[Chorus]

To look into her baby blue eyes, 
Right down to her dainty shoe size. 
The way I see her, 
there's nothing left to say, but. 
Goody Goody Gumdrops, 
My heart is doin' flipflops, 

Gee what love can do, 
I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops, 
Goody Goody Gumdrops, 
With a girl like you.

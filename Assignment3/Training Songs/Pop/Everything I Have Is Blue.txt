You can walk with your head in the clouds
You won't find the place to hide
You can lie through your teeth in the night
You can't hide the hurt inside

You can think 'bout the lies that you told me
It won't be the only one
Alibis, someday I will forgive you
When everything is said and done

See me walking with someone new
It makes no difference
'Cause everything I have is blue

You will write, I don't know what I'm doing
I won't last a day without you
In the night contemplating my doing
Things you said have now all come true

Wanna go, wanna stay with you, baby
Either way going crazy, I know
Wanna be someone else in my dreams
There's a much better place I can go

See me walking with someone new
It makes no difference
'Cause everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

You can walk with your head in the clouds
You won't find the place to hide
You can lie through your teeth in the night
It won't help the hurt inside

Wanna go, wanna stay with you, baby
Either way going crazy, I know
Wanna be someone else in my dreams
There's a much better place I can go

See me walking with someone new
It makes no difference
'Cause everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

Everything I have is blue

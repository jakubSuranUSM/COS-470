We can talk, you can make your demands
We can cry, catch the tears in our hands
We can laugh and dance
Under this fading moon

And when the morning comes
I'll still be holding you

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our hearts be synchronized

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

I know you would catch me
Should I fall from grace
If I heard you drowning in the dark
I'd dive into the waves

We can make a vow and seal it with a kiss
The moments that we shared will matter more
Than those we missed

Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night (this endless night) is no goodbye (is no goodbye)
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

In another place, in another time
In another space, in another life
In another world you could still be mine
We'll shine, we'll shine

Shine, brighter than a rain of fallen stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night, there's no goodbye
Shine brighter than a rain of falling stars
Time stops to let our heartbeats synchronize 

This endless night, there's no goodbye
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever
This moment will last forever

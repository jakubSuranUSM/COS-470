Everybody wake up
If you're living with your eyes closed
See the man with the bomb in his hand
Everybody wake up

Oh baby it's not easy sometimes
They build these walls ever higher and hide behind them
Seems an odd way to make things right
Oh I feel crazy sometimes

Our finest hour arrives
See the pig dressed in his finest fine
The believers stand behind him and smile

Everybody wake up
If you're living with your eyes closed
See the man with the bomb in his hand
Everybody wake up

Remember the words of the misguided fool
Do unto others as you'd have them do
Not an eye for an eye as the golden rule
Just leaves a room full of blind men

Our finest hour arrives
See the pig dressed in his finest fine
The believers stand behind him and smile
As the day lights up with fire

Everybody wake up
If you're living with your eyes closed
See the man with the bomb in his hand
Everybody wake up
(repeat to fade)

Oh, I, I had the strangest dream
And they made a deal and they drew the line
And they built a wall right across the town
We ran, but we could not hide
We were fifty years marching round and round
We were fifty years when the wall came down
Anything is possible in this world

Oh, I, I had the strangest dream
Where they wasted days on the borderline
And they saw themselves living underground
And they ran, but they could not hide
They cut the rocks and they laid the stone
They made themselves a tower, here in Babylon
Anything is possible in this world

Hey yeah, I never could explain
We`re all playing a game we could never win
Hey yeah, I`ll never understand
We just wander all over the same old ground

Oh, I, I had the strangest dream
And you shook your head and you looked at me
And said `open your eyes and maybe you will see...`
Anything is possible in this world

Anythni-ooh!

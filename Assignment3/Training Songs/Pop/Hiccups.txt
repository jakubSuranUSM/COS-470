Someday, without trying
You'll find something that's rare
Like an eight-letter word
On a triple-word square

and I knew a girl
Who thrived on secondhand news
She wore clips in her hair
And she judged boys by their shoes

call it coincidence
But whenever we're together
You're on top of the world
While I'm under the weather

a thousand ideas
I try to tell crossword girl
How do I get one across
When you're always too down?

and if things get hard
Will you throw in the pen?
But if you are unsure
You can pencil it in

call it coincidence
But whenever we're together
You're on top of the world
While I'm under the weather

[spoken] hold your breath for up to ten seconds. ask a friend, a good friend, to scare you when you least expect it. and if that doesn't work, stand on your head and drink a glass of water.

call it coincidence
But whenever we're together
You're over the moon
While I'm under the weather

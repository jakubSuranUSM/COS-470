I've been looking for about an hour, for a place to drink
Trouble with this town, everyone's asleep
Me and my girlfriend, had another fight
Now she's gone and left me, in the middle of the night

It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night
It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night

If I've been looking for about an hour, for a place to drink
If I had a number, I'd give her a ring
I've got to, got to tell her, how sorry I am
If I get to see her, I know she'll understand

It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night
And just you, and I, maybe we can make it right
If you're sure your answer's no,
Take you where you want to go
It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night

I've been trying for an hour, to find the right words
I know what she's thinking, I know how it hurts

It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night
And just you, and I, maybe we can make it right
If you're sure your answer's no,
I'll take you where you want to go

It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night
It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night

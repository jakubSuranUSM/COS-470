I'd a dream that we were rock stars
And that flash bulbs popped the air
And girls fainted, every time we shook our hair.

We were songbirds, we were Greek Gods
We were singled out by fate
We were quoted out of context - it was great.
Grander than Castles, Cathedrals or stars
Electric Guitars !
Riots in airports - everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown - hysteria-a-go-go
Electric Guitars !

Riots in airports - everywhere that we go
Mascara meltdown - hysteria-a-go-go
Electric Guitars ! Electric Guitars !

When I woke up I was laughing
Well what else was I to do
Every details of the dream I had was true

We were songbirds, we were Greek Gods
We were singled out by fate
We were quoted out of context - we were... great

Well there's no more sleepless nights for me
Now it's easier from now on
'cause I've realised exactly where I've been going wrong
Well I've been lying awake at night
Worrying about the Russians
But the Russians are my friends
'cause we've got a love that will never end

'cause now I've learned to love the bomb
Now I've learned to love the bomb

Well once we had a plan to go to Greenham Common
And steal a Polaris missile
And we'd put it on the back of a lorry
Now I keep it in my bedroom
And it's yellow black and grey
And I'll polish it every day
And I don't care what the neighbours say

'cause now I've learned to love the bomb
Now I've learned to love the bomb

Don't you be so stupid
No no no

You should like the bomb like you love your mum

And if you want to live in a peaceful world
There's only one thing to do
You've gotta choose Cruise

'cause now I've learned to love the bomb
Now I've learned to love the bomb

Don't you be so stupid
No no no

What the hell do you take me for?
If you going to make bombs you're longing for war

Don't you be so stupid
Now I've learned to love the bomb

[_____] the days I've spent on CND campaigns
Just walking, just walking in the pouring rain
Time and time again

How I learned to love the bomb

I've been thinking 'bout it
I've been thinking 'bout it when I'm with you
It's always underrated, never complicated when I'm with you

I only wanna give enough
Of something that you know I got plenty of
I only wanna keep it real
Trust me, you don't have to understand it
This is how I planned it

If you, if, if you
Only for the night
Work you, work, work you
Only for the night
Don't you, don't, don't you
Only for the night
Don't you get it twisted
Not addicted, I just love it, oh!

I've been thinking 'bout it
I've been thinking 'bout it when I'm with you
It's always underrated, never complicated when I'm with you

I've been thinking 'bout it
I've been thinking 'bout it when I'm with you
It's always underrated, never complicated when I'm with you

I only wanna give enough
Of something that you know I got plenty of
I only wanna keep it real
Trust me, you don't have to understand it
This is how I planned it

If you, if, if you
Only for the night
Work you, work, work you
Only for the night
Don't you, don't, don't you
Only for the night
Don't you get it twisted
Not addicted, I just love it, oh!

I've been thinking 'bout it
I've been thinking 'bout it when I'm with you
It's always underrated, never complicated when I'm with you

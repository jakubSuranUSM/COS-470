I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable 
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle
I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable 
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle

Face your fears, save the tears
You're were you're going to be in the next ten years 
You got a speedy clock, you thought it wouldn't stop
It did, and now it's Pop goes the Weasel

Nothing gets me high, (nothing gets me high)
So I don't even try no more (I don't even try)
Nothing gets me high, (nothing gets me high)
So I don't even try no more (I don't even try)

I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable 
(Save me, save me)
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle
(Leave me alone)
I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable 
(Save me, save me)
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle
(Just leave me alone)

Think of all the days that you been gone
I've been trying to find my spot
Peaking from the window out at the cars in the dark

(Leave me alone) Relax
(Leave me alone) Relax
(Leave me alone) You'll be fine, Relax

Nothing gets me high, (nothing gets me high)
So I don't even try no more (I don't even try)
Nothing gets me high, (nothing gets me high)
So I don't even try no more (I don't even try)

I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable 
(Save me, save me)
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle
(Leave me alone)
I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable, I feel unstoppable
(Save me, save me)
I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle, I'm burning my candle
(Just leave me alone)

(Save me, save me)
(Just leave me alone)

(Save me, save me)
(Just leave me alone)

(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)
(Leave me alone)

So much i had to tell you
I've saved it for you, tonight
But this thing's going nowhere
I can see it in your eyes
Even now the worst fool
Says that I'm a fool

Don't think just because I
Came here tonight
I still need you, need you
Can you hear my voice
Coming to you on the radio
Do you hear me
Do you know it's all for you
Are you listening now
Am I coming through

Do you think about me
I just want to know
It doesn't really mean anything
It's part of letting go
Fighting with the feeling
Stirring up the fire

Don't think just because I
Came here tonight
I still nee you, need you
Can you hear my voice
Coming to you on the radio
Do you hear me
Do you know it's all for you
Are you listening now
Am I coming through

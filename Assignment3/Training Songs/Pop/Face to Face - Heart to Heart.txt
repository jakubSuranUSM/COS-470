I thought it would be easy to forget you
For after all it's been such a long time
And yet the memories of you still hurt me
They've been inscribed with needles in my mind

I'm sure I could convince you
If only you would let us meet again

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

Think back to when we were together
How long we thought our mutual love would last
How hard it was for us to leave each other
Is all of that now buried in the past

I'm sure I could convince you
If only you would let us meet again

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart
Face to face, heart to heart

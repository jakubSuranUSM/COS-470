I have got no money - I'm prostituting
This situation's a mess
And I get this feeling I'm turning trendy
I can't stand the sight of my face.

Be realistic - just think it over
'Cause I'm sure you'll make the right move
I think its better - come from the inside
I'm sure there is room to improve.

And it seems kinda hard thinking like I am
Seems like it is started again - oh no
I better get my head between these knees
Just as fast as I can - seems like a comfortable end
And I want to be happy again.

And then your thinking bout of the why's you need
And the why's you bleed and you better believe
Your gonna walk fast, walk through the middle
Try yourself then your gonna find out

That you've tried it all before and it don't work
You cry it out but you're here and it won't work
You try a little more and it all works out.

And it seems kinda hard thinking like I am
Seems like its started again - oh no
I better get my head between my knees
Just as fast as I can - seems like a comfortable end
And I want to be a hippy again.

To take away the end is over turn and run to me
Because you need a spastic taxi for the cow milk.

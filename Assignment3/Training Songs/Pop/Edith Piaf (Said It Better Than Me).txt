It's a heartwarming song
For the easily moved
The effect is all wrong
Plain to see I'm not moved

As I stand in the light
Of a shop that is closed
God, I'd love me a fight
There's no poem just prose

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some muzak on

There were no smoky dives
Few amours, fous or not
There were no petty crimes
Foreign substances bought

There were no midnight drives
With a crime boss's wife
Need a sentence at most
When assessing my life

Drunken and short-lived flings
Montparnasse lights
Holding a hand of kings
My hunch was right
When's that night?

Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Too late for that
Too late for that

Think of one single night
Wants so strong you're aflame
Well I'm sorry time's up
Sorry, nothing will change

I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
Not this time
Not this time

Mirror, mirror
Who's the happiest
Is it the lover or
Is it the peel of them
Mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
Sadden heartbreakers came around

You shot my heart like a bullet all along
But when you leave me just carry me slow home
Mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
Sadden heartbreakers came around

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow the chiefs
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow the chase
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
And all I can do is to follow

Let's present to you this old friend of mine,
We've been working together for a long time
Do you want to know what all this screaming is about

Do you want to know what all this writing is about
Do you want to know what all this singing is about
Come on, just hear me, come on

Over and over again let's present to you, the black mask, my best friend, hey
Put it on baby, this mask against our skin, there's no way we can't win
Put it on honey, feel the fabric, it feels so sweet
Over and over again let's present to you, the black mask, my best friend, hey

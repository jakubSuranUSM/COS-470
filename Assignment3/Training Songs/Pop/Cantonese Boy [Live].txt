We're pushing through these farming towns 
We've worked hard ploughing over grounds 

Red army calls you 
The call of the crowd 
Red army needs you 
It calls you now 

Cantonese boy 
Bang your tin drum 
Cantonese boy 
Civilian soldier 
Cantonese boy 
Bang your tin drum 
Cantonese boy 
Red army calls you home 

We're singing 
Marching through the fields 
We're changing 
The lives we've led for years 

Red army calls you 
Red army needs you 

Gentlemen you heard this call 
Raised your glass and called for more 
Only young men broke the wall

Dirrty
Filthy (filthy)
Nasty, you nasty (yeah)
Too dirrty to clean my act up
If you ain't dirrty
You ain't here to party (woo!)
Ladies (move)
Gentlemen (move)
Somebody ring the alarm
A fire on the roof
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)
Oh, I'm overdue
Give me some room
I'm coming through
Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
DJ's spinning (show your hands)
Let's get dirrty (that's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat until my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are pumping
Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are mashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (can you feel it)
About to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Want to get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Want to get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Want to get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Ah, heat is up
So ladies, fellas
Drop your cups
Body's hot
Front to back
Now move your ass
I like that
Tight hip huggers, low for sure
Shake a little somethin' on the floor
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat until my clothes come off
Let's get open, 'cause a commotion
We're still going, eight in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hot rocking, everyone's talking
Give all you've got (give it to me)
Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Want to get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh sweat dripping over my body
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Want to get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Here it comes, it's the one
You've been waiting on
Get up, get it up
Yup, that's what's up
You can just put your butt
To the maximum
Uh oh, here we go 
Here we go
You can tell when the music
Starts to drop
That's when we take it
To the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna
Call the cops
Uh oh's, here we go, here we go
Want to get rowdy (rowdy)
Gonna get a little unruly (ruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (hurry)
Want to get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party (party)
Sweat dripping over my body (body)
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Want to get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Want to get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh sweat dripping over my body
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Want to get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Dance and getting a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Let's get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Want to get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival
Uh, what

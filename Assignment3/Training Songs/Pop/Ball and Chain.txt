I went down to the valley, just to find out who I am, Lord.
Down home in the valley, I've got to get myself back together again, now.
I looked all around me, but everything was still the same.
People, you can't climb that mountain carrying a ball and chain, no. 

Because it takes all the love that your give to get to the other side.
It makes all the life that you can live so satisfied, yeah, so satisfied.

Come, come, comin' together, that's the only way we can go.
Children, you better turn around, take a look where you been before, now.
Come, come come on people, don't you know that we're all the same;
You know we ain't gonna climb that mountain carrying a ball and chain.

That's no lie, no déjà vu
Oh you trying, trying, trying to steal my heart away
Away
Oh, baby just tonight you're so good to me
My number one
90 ways to fight with no guarantee
We can't go wrong
My heart is a lonely number - baby, I'm more than a lover
Kiss me, maybe my love will drive you crazy
It's no déjà vu (déjà vu)
Oh it's like a dream to me (déjà vu)
Baby can't you see 
I'll hold you forever - I can make it better
You get what you want out of me
It's no déjàvu (déjà vu)
You are still a mystery (déjà vu)
Baby can't you see
My heart is in motion - I'll give you devotion
Oh, baby you're too good for me
Baby I'll be there for your lonely heart
God only knows
Baby I do care - never tear apart
Heaven will show
My heart is like a thunder
Baby, you can't stop my feelings
Kiss me, maybe my love will drive you crazy

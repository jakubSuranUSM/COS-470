This feeling can't be wrong
Like it's so good it hurts
I've never heard this song
But it's like I know the words
Woke up in a dream
That I've had a thousand time
I held on real tight
Never got what I need to survive

Don't forget what it feels like
All the walls I caved in it and took it in
So we can let em fall

Climb on top and we'll get higher
Higher
Get on top and take it higher

And never wake me up
We can watch this world
Spin from above
Both eyes shut tight
Don't wake me up
If it's in my head, that's real enough

Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for
Yeah we're swinging from the stars
And never wake me up

Can't find the way to say
Without a thousand words
What sparks is all it takes
Let it free and let it burn
And if it's a dream
I don't want to leave again
I'll give it all I've got
I'll look around, take it in

We've got it all
So let em fall
Let your walls fall down
We've got it all
So let em fall
Let your walls fall down
Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for
Yeah we're swinging from the stars

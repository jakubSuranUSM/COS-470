(Chilton)
Thank you, friends
Wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you
I'm so grateful
For all the things you helped me do
All the ladies and gentlemen
Who made this all so probable
Thank you, friends
I rejoice up to the skies
Dear ones like you, the best I do
As far as can see my eyes
All you ladies and gentlemen
Who made this all so probable
Without my friends I got chaos
I'm off in a bead of light.
Without my friends I'm swept up high by the wind
Thank you, friends (thank you, again)

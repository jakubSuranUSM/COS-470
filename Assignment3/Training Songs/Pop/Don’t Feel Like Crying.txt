I know I should be ordering takeout
Sitting on my couch, that's what you do
I know I should be all in my feelings
Staring at the ceiling
But here's the truth

Wallowing in it would be such a waste
That isn't gonna fix it anyway
No, oh

Ooh, yeah
I dry my eyes 'cause I don't feel like crying
Ooh, yeah
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying (Crying)

Hope you don't blame me
For what I'm saying
My heart is aching
Do you feel it too?
I hope you understand that I'm dealing
It's my way of healing
But here is the truth

Wallowing in it would be such a waste
That isn't gonna fix it anyway
No, oh

Ooh, yeah
I dry my eyes 'cause I don't feel like crying
Ooh, yeah
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying

Ooh
(It hasn't hit me yet)
(And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset)
(Yeah, it hasn't hit me yet)
(And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset)
Ooh
(It hasn't hit me yet)
(And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset)
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying (Crying)

Wallowing in it would be such a waste

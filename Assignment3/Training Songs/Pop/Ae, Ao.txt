(Ae ao ae ao, ae ao ae ao)

Everybody
Come on dance and sing along
Everybody feeling right
Never going home tonight

Feel the rhythm under your feet
Moving on with every beat
Everybody's dancing out in the street
Forever

Keep on moving, painting the town
'Cause tonight you can't slow down
Come along and keep on singing our song
Together

(Ae ao ae ao, ae ao ae ao)

Everybody
Come along and sing our song
Party till the morning light
Never going home tonight

(Ae ao ae ao, ae ao ae ao)

Everybody
Come on dance and sing along
Everybody's feeling right
Never going home tonight

Everybody
Come along and sing our song
Party till the morning light
Never going home tonight

Everybody
Come on dance and sing along
Everybody feeling right

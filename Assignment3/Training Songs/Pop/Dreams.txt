Dreams 

Oh I, I believe in magic and I believe in dreams
Until I heard the thunder rumble
I saw the mountains crumble -
Then came the circus so I followed it's parade

With all the fancy lion tamers, high-wire fiery flamers
Ravers of every kind
I saw those high-stepping sexy witches
Sons of satin, sons of bitches - all were there in my dreams
all in my dreams
Sodom and Gomorrah
I see you're back in town.
And though you build a wall around you
The multitude still found you
Just like a circus to start with a parade
Oh but a parade of the

Fancy lion tamers, high-wire fiery flamers
Ravers of every kind
I saw those high-stepping sexy witches
Sons of satin, sons of bitches - all were there in my dreams
all in my dreams
Now I can see the whole world is just a circus
And I can tell that the circus why it's just hell
And then I heard a drummer rolling
I found my seat's been stolen
Then a spotlight hit me going wild in center ring for all you

Fancy lion tamers, high-wire fiery flamers
Ravers of every kind
I saw those high-stepping sexy witches
Sons of satin, sons of bitches - all were there in my dreams
all in my dreams

My dreams my dreams
Well I, I believe in magic and I believe in dreams
I said I, I believe in magic and I, I believe in dreams
I believe in dreams
I said I, I believe in magic, I believe in dreams
I believe in dreams, magic, magical dreams
I wanted to sing that I believe in dreams
Magical dreams, oh I believe in dreams
I said I, I believe in magic, I still believe in dreams

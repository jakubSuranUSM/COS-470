Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody sawin' to the beat
Keep on trackin' with me
Can't stand still gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody swingin' in the heat
Keep on trackin' with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

Get on the dance floor baby
It's time to get it on
So you've had some troubles lately
You better deal after dawn
Let the music take you somewhere
Give yourself some room
If you wanna catch some air
You're gonna have to show all your moves

Girls move your body right or left
Find your partner
You're gonna have to break a sweat
To be on it...listen baby

Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody sawin' to the beat
Keep on trackin' with me
Can't stand still gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody swingin' in the heat
Keep on trackin' with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

Oh Oh Oh Ooh
Oh Oh Oh Ooh

No pride in bein' a shaker
Work it out on the floor
This rhythm shows no flavor
Better check your ego at the door
Just let me be the leader
Keep your eyes on checkin' me
You won't need to take a breather
Sliding into motion naturally

Don't let your body miss a beat
Don't be slackin'
If you're keepin' up with me
You'll be trackin'

Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody sawin' to the beat
Keep on trackin' with me
Can't stand still gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody swingin' in the heat
Keep on trackin' with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

Oh Oh Oh Ooh
Oh Oh Oh Ooh

Girls move your body right or left
Find your partner
You're gonna have to break a sweat
To be on it...listen baby

Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody sawin' to the beat
Keep on trackin' with me
Can't stand still gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody swingin' in the heat
Keep on trackin' with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody sawin' to the beat
Keep on trackin' with me
Can't stand still gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin' with me
Everybody swingin' in the heat
Keep on trackin' with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

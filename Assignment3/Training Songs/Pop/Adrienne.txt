Think I got me an angel,
Somebody to love.
Feel a trace of emotion.
Ooh! Can't get enough!
I'm singin'

Oh, Adrienne. Oh, Adrienne.
Oh, Adrienne. Oh, Adrienne.

Touch every good thing.
Take 'em one by one.
Feel scarlet together.
Me an' Adrienne.
I'm singin'

Think I got me an angel,
Somebody to love.
Feel a trace of emotion.
Lord! Can't get enough!
I'm singin'

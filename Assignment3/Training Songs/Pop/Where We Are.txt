Stay where you are
Don't let me go, don't let me go
We made it this far
Oh baby stop, stop right there
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Into thin air
We survived a crash
Made it through the wreckage
Standing here at last
So perfectly written

Now where we are
Is where we're suppose to be
Where we are
Keeps the breath in me
Where we've been
We've risen from the deep
Where we're now no one can tear us apart
That's where we are

Don't, don't turn around
We gotta let, we got to let
Go of the past now
Feel me by your side
We're out of danger
No reason to hide
We survived the storm
Made it through the hurricane
Standing here at last
Dry despite the rain

Now where we are
Is where we're suppose to be
Where we are
Keeps the breath in me
Where we've been
We've risen from the deep
Where we're now no one can tear us apart
That's where we are

That's where we are
Stay, stay where you are

Now where we are
Is where we're suppose to be
Where we are
Keeps the breath in me
Where we've been
We've risen from the deep
Where we're now no one can tear us apart
That's where we are

That's where we are

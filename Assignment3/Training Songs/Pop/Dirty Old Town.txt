Well, there are 16 people in Danny's apartment
16 people are living in there
Remember the days of rent control
Grandpa remembers rock and roll

These days won't last forever
These days won't last for long
You know, somebody somewhere owes us a favor
That's how things really get done
In this World of Opportunities, it's a Land of Possibilities

We want to live in a dirty old town
Building it up, tearing us down
With our head in the clouds and our feet on the ground
We want to live ? dirty old town

Now when the ladies come from Kansas
They wear their traditional colors
Today the fabrics are ragged and torn
The clothes on their backs is all that they own
They say, "Don't draw attention to yourself
They'll tear you apart for a couple a bucks
Keep your head down and keep your nose clean
'Cause people who're scared do dangerous things"

These days can't last forever
These days can't last for long
You know someday things will get better
Somehow things will get done
It's a World of Possibilities, 
It's a Land of Opportunities

We want to live in a dirty old town
Building it up, tearing us down
Head in the clouds and our feet on the ground
We want to live ? dirty old town

These days shoes are worn only on special occasions
Battles are fought for fam'ly and nations
Maybe you pray, but God isn't home
And there's no guarantee that justice be done

We want to live in a dirty old town
Building it up, tearing us down
Head in the clouds and our feet on the ground
We want to live ? dirty old town

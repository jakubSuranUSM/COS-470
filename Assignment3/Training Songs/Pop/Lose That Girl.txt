She walked out on you last Saturday
Under the wheels
Of a crowd on Main Street, USA
Know how it feels

She said cancel everything
And like a fool
You never see what's happening
She dropped out school 

Get away, let her go
Let her go now
Hey, in your brain
Yeah you know
Let her go now 

I should have told you
To lose that girl
I should have told you
That's not your world 

On her radio she turned the disco down
Disco down

She thought she'd look good in purple jeans from Santa Fe
And she overdosed on magazines 

Just fade to grey

Get away, let her go
Let her go now
Hey, in your brain
Yeah you know
Let her go now 

I should have told you
To lose that girl
I should have told you
That's not your world

On her radio she turned the disco down
Disco down

I should have told you
To lose that girl
I should have told you
That's not your world

[Repeat: x2]
I should have told you

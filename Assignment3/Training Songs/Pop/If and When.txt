If and when you come
I will see you there
I submerge your face
Blood all in your hair
I'll be true and I won't know
If and when you come
I'll go slow

Walk, we'll walk the town
The dirt and the debris
We won't have to think
You won't look at me
I'll be true and I won't know
If and when you come
Where we'll go

There are many thoughts
We will never speak
As I hold your hand
Pour another drink
We'll be true but if we're not
If and when you're cold
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
I'll be hot
Oh so

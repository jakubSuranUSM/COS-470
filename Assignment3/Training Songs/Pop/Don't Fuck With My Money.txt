I saw you in a bad place acting like a freak
Went up to you after, will you come home with me?
I know what your thinking that ain't my concert
We can be together but your gonna have to learn

You f*ck with my money oh, you'll be sorry, no no no 
You got what you wanted oh you got what you wanted no
I did what you told me oh I did what you told me no

You f*ck with my money oh

You though me out the building, the middle of the night
Momma tried to tell me something wasn't right
Now I've got a problem, I need to do the math
Something goes wrong now your gonna get half

You f*ck with my money oh, you'll be sorry, no no no 
You got what you wanted oh you got what you wanted no
I did what you told me oh I did what you told me no

You better start to run if it happens again 
Everything you want it will happen again 

You f*ck with my money oh, you'll be sorry, no no no 
You got what you wanted oh you got what you wanted no
I did what you told me oh I did what you told me no

You better start to run if it happens again 
Everything you want it will happen again

I know I can't resist

I believe that you told me
A promise laced with lies
Such a tease as you hold me
There's hunger in your eyes

That's the way that I remember you
When the sun was high and the nights were cool
It seems that lately, I just dream of days
In the silver skies that I can't erase

I know I can't resist
I never wanna fall asleep
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

I am scared of what I missed
But don't you know this tastes so sweet?
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

That's the way I remember
The summer sun was high
To the cold of November
I'm still in silver skies

That's the way that I remember you
When the sun was high and the nights were cool
It seems that lately, I just dream of days
In the silver skies that I can't erase

I know I can't resist
I never wanna fall asleep
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

I am scared of what I missed
But don't you know this tastes so sweet?
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

I'm falling for your sentimental charms again
I'm finding it so hard to break it
But every time the pleasure turns into pain
I'm more inclined to stand and take it

This is the way I remember you
The sun was high and the night was oh so cool
It's how I remember you

I know I can't resist
I never wanna fall asleep
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

I am scared of what I missed
But don't you know this tastes so sweet?
I only wanna dive in deep
And I've tried and I've tried
I've tried to walk away

I know I can't resist
I know I can't resist
I know I can't resist

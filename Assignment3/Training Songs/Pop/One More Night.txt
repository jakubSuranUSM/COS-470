One more night, one more night with you
Close your eyes I'll give you my love
One more night, one more night with you
Please hold me once again 'cause I love you

Here I stand and I can't even cry
My heart is breakin' up inside
You say goodbye, you found somebody new
Wherever you go I'll be with you

One more night, one more night with you
Hear me now I can't let you go
One more night, I'll open my heart to you
Please hold me once again 'cause I love you

Before you leave, just take me in your arms
And let me feel you once again
Can't help myself, I still depend on you
Whatever you do, I'll be with you

One more night, one more night with you
Close your eyes I'll give you my love
One more night, one more night with you
You know how long it gonna last, it's up to you
I wanna hold you once again 'cause I love you

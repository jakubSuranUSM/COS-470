It's the sound of lonely days
Falling down like rain on this place
Please don't count the lonely days
Let this town fade to gray

Endless rows of houses fuse
And there's never any news
Because there's nowhere to go but crazy
So we go

We just hang around in malls
Up until the army calls
Because there's nowhere to go but crazy
As you know

Nothing good is on TV
No one falls in love with me
And there's nobody to fall in love with
So I don't

Don't forget to stop and smell the glue
No one falls in love with you
And there's nobody to fall in love with
Just the phone

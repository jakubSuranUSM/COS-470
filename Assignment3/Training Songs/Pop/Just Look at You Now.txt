I’ve known you since you were a girl
When things just didn’t work out for you
I said don’t crack up and see both sides
But you kept on blaming the world for everything

I tried to tell you that you were in control
But you didn’t seem to listen to a word I say
But I’m never giving up, giving up on you
I try to help you see the world in a different way

Hey, yeah, just look at you now
Riding on a silver wave
That keeps on going

Through the sun and through the rain
Through the good and the bad times
Through the joy and through the pain
Hey, look at you now
See what you’ve become

Now look me in the eye, now and tell me straight
Did you find it hard to tell me everything
I said things can only get better dear
But they won’t if you don’t lift a finger to help me

What’s the point in taking this human form
If we can’t understand the point of living here
Who would ever want to live alone
Without sharing this world with everyone and everything

Just look at you now
Riding on a silver wave
That keeps on going

Through the sun and through the rain
Through the good and the bad times
Through the joy and through the pain
Hey, look at you now
See what you’ve become

See what you’ve become
See what you’ve become
Hey, look at you now
See what you’ve become

Hey, just look at you now
Riding on a silver wave
That keeps on going

Through the sun and through the rain
Through the good and the bad times
Through the joy and through the pain
Hey, look at you now
See what you’ve become

Riding on a silver wave
See what you’ve become
Riding on a silver wave
(Riding on a silver wave)

Riding on a silver wave

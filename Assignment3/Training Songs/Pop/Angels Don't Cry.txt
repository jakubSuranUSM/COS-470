i try to remember a kiss
and i only get sorrow
and yesterday's faded away
now there's only tomorrow
and everything passes and changes
and comes to an end i know
but nothing is written but old news
again and again
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry
now i see a face in your eyes
but you don't remember my name
we're always a step out of time
now ain't that a shame
and you've been alone for too long
and nobody cries
if you want to see all of my tears
take a look in your eyes
i know that it's true
believe it or not
but angels don't cry
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry
i could walk away
or i could walk on by
or make it all come true
or say it's all a lie
there's no more tears
when you're out of time
and i might fade away tonight
if you close your eyes
i know that it's true
believe it or not
but angels don't cry
i know that it's true
there's too many tears
but angels don't cry
i could walk away
i could walk on by
or make it all come true
or say it's all a lie

They say don't trust,
You, me, we, us.
So we'll walk,
We must,
â??cause of you, me.
And it's all about,
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

If they hurt you,
They hurt me, too.
So we'll rise up,
Won't stop.
And it's all about,
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'cause you know - us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

They don't know.
They can't see
Who we are.
Fear is the enemy.
Hold on tight,
Hold on to me,
â??cause tonightâ?¦

It's all about us
It's all about, all about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

It's all about us

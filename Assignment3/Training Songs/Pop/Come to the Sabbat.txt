Help me in my search for knowledge,
I must learn the secret art.
Who dares to help me raise the on
Whose very name near stills my heart?
Astaroth
Discard your clothes and come on foot,
Through streams and fields and moonlit moors,
Your bodies soaked in secret oils,
Perfumed herbs will heal your sores.
Join me in my search for power.

Wives and husbands bring your kin.
WeÂ´ll be as one within the hour.
Let the sabbat now begin.
Come, come, come to the sabbat.
Come to the sabbat, SatanÂ´s there!

Wish you knew I'm not the one for you
You're not the one for me, and I can't stand it
After all I put you through, you're still just stuck like glue
Why don't you run from me, 'cause I can't leave you
Before I break your heart release me

Oh, mine is such a sorry state, I gave my heart away
When I could love with grit and gut and reckless unrestraint
Those were the days

I wish you knew I'm not the one for you
You're not the one for me, and I can't stand it
After all I put you through, you're still just stuck like glue
Why don't you run from me, 'cause I can't leave you
Before I break your heart, release me

Oh you're a boy that I could love, and all I do is run
But still I keep you hoping someday soon our day will come
And it never does

I wish you knew I'm not the one for you
I'm just a sad excuse for what you long for
And after all I do, you're still just stuck like glue
Why don't you run from me, 'cause I can't leave you
Before I break your heart release me

Nothing ever changes, people never change
So passion turns to sheer complusion, then love turn to hate

I wish you knew I'm not the one for you
You're not the one for me, and I can't stand you
After all you put me through, I'm still just stuck like glue
Why don't you run from me, 'Cause I can't leave you
Before I break your heart, before it breaks my heart
Before you break my heart
Release me

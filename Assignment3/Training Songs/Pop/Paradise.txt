Is it so far out of touch?
Like a million miles away
When it all becomes too much
Is there somewhere inside to escape?

You're hurting
Wanting
Needing
Longing
Looking
For that something
You will know

Don't turn around
Don't give up on your feelings
Get what you need then you'll find the release
Start to believe and you know love is deep
Make your own paradise

If you let your demons go
Let them walk right out of mind
It will purify your soul
And out of the flames you will rise

Hurting
Wanting
Needing
Longing
Ever looking
For that something
You will know

Don't turn around
Don't give up on your feelings
Get what you need then you'll find the release
Start to believe and you know love is deep
Make your own paradise

Never look back
Just get up on your feet
'Cause this life is a game and it's so bitter-sweet
Start to believe and you know love is deep
Make your own paradise

Don't turn around
Don't give up on your feelings
Get what you need then you'll find the release
Start to believe and you know love is deep
Make your own paradise

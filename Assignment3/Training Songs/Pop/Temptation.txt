Temptation in my heart,
I'm burning, I fall apart!
When the night falls,
My heart calls for love and devotion.

Temptation! I Want you
Can you be my only one
When the night falls,
My heart calls, for the touch of your hands

To asemoneshqam to bodi (You have been my love from heaven)
Setareye man to bodi (You have been my star )
Esme to hast setare, (Your name is star )
Biya pisham dobare (Come back to me again )

Un moohaye meshkit mano kosht (Your dark hair is killing me)
Chesh maye zibat mano kosht (Your beautifill eyes is killing me)
Bia bia pishe man dobare (come come back to me again)
Yalla bego are, setare (yalla say ok, my star )

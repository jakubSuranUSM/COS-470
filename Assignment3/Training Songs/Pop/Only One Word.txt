Deep down inside me
So close to my heart
There lies a rumour
That tears us apart
Deep down inside me
So close to my soul
Unspoken secrets
Betraying us all
Time goes by so slow
Since you had to go
Only one word
Can define the feeling
That bridges between 
You and me
Only one sound 
Can express the meaning
That lasts until we...
As I close my eyes
I think of the past
My fate awaits me
The die has been cast
Deep down inside me
Where dreams come alive
With you beside me
I'll always survive
Time goes by so slow
Since you had to go
Only one word 
Can define the feeling 
That bridges between
You and me
Only one sound
Can express the meaning
That lasts until we meet
Only one word
Only one word 
Can define the feeling 
That bridges between
You and me
Only one sound
Can express the meaning
That lasts until we meet
Only one word

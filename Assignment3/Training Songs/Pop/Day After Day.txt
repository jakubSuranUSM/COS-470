WAY UP IN THE SKY 
OVER THE CITY, OVER TOKYO 
SILVER LIGHT, SUMMER MOON 
YOU'LL BE OVER SOMEBODY'S WINTER THIS AFTERNOON 
WHILE THE DOLPHINS SWIM IN THE SEA 
YOU'RE GOING GREY, MY BABY 
STILL THE WAR IS WAGING ENDLESSLY 
DAY AFTER DAY, DAY AFTER DAY

WAY UP IN THE SKY 
OVER THE CITY AND LAKE ERIE 
YOU REMEMBER THE FLATS, YOU WERE THERE 
OUT EVERY NIGHT MR MOONLIGHT

ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND WE GO 
JUST LIKE YESTERDAY

WAY UP IN THE SKY 
OVER THE CITY WHERE YOU SLEEP TONIGHT 
THE LIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW BLINKS 
"HOTEL, HOTEL, HOTEL" 
OPEN THE BLIND AND DREAM IN A MOONBEAM

WHEN THE WAR'S FINALLY OVER 
WE'LL MEET AGAIN 
AND PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF

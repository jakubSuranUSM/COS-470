Well the crunch is coming
And it won't be long
You think you know the future
But you're so, so wrong

For love and comfort
You can lean on me
But your life's your own
Your own responsibility

You sit there wasted
And you drink all day
You cruise the kennels
And go all the way

Please, please, please
Don't disrespect yourself

Well the crunch is coming
You abuse your brain
Your God given body
And your own good name

Take the risk of winning
Stand up, be strong
To those brutal losers
You gotta prove them wrong

You've been mistreated
And you've been abused
But that's all over
If you only choose, I said

Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Don't disrespect yourself

Relax, every thing's alright
Right here, right now
In this room tonight

Take a great leap forward
Walk on, be free
I believe in you
Can you believe in me?

Take my arm
I wanna touch your hand
Wanna hold your shoulder
I can be your man

Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Don't disrespect yourself

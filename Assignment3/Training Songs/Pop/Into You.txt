[Into You]
Giant Steps
From their album "The Book Of Pride"

Girl, we live in a world that goes too fast
People don't give a love a chance
You have to say wait - stop and communicate
And girl, now thaat you're here and we're alone
It's time for a little one on one
I've got to say this I know we can't miss

I'll never let you down
And I can be, all that you need

[Chorus:]
I'm into you (into you)
I'm into you tonight
I'm into you (helplessly)
'Til you get into me

Girl, your laugh is the sweetest sound I've heard
Baby I hang on every word
You say that you care, I'm walking on air

It's stronger everyday
And all I do, is only for you

[Chorus X 2]
I'll be a fool if I should hide
'cause' it's all that you see and want it to be
Baby, please stay and feel the same way I do

I'll never let you down
'cause' I can be all that you need

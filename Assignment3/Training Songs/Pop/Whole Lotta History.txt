I can't talk, I've gone the wrong way 
Looking up for what's fallen down, yeah 
I can't talk, I've gone back the wrong way 
What is the use in what I say? 

I hear myself complain so I can do it again, do it again 
I give myself the blame, so I get back up again, get out of the rain 
Baby, I miss you, so tell me, is she really that beautiful? whoa whoa
Each time, she's kissed you, tell me, is it really that good for you? 

And does she love you like I never could? 
Hold you tender, tell you everything's good, whoa whoa
Would she hurt you, cause I never could 
Does she, hold your body tight all night baby? 

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history, I 
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me 
I'm falling all around when you miss me, I 
I don't know what to do, so tell me baby 

Hello? Did you call me? 
I thought it didn't matter that you're gone and 
I know, end of story 
Now there's nothing but a shadow where my heart shone 

I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't, 
But you cost me so much love, yeah 
So finally I just decided to go, 
I know I've had enough, so tell me that you're not alone 

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history, I 
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me 
I'm falling all around when you miss me, I 
I don't know what to do, so tell me baby 

I'm talking bout a whole lotta history, I 
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me 
I'm falling all around when you miss me, I 
I don't know what to do, so tell me baby 

And it keeps me spinning and controls 
What happens till Monday, till Monday 
And it might sound crazy but your voice 
Still leaves me all funky, all funky 
And it keeps me spinning and controls 
What happens till Monday, till Monday 
And it might sound crazy but your voice 
Still leaves me all funky, all funky

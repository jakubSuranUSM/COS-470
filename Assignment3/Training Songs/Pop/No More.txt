You say your gonna work it out
Then I see your having doubts
Tellin' me you'll walk away
But then you go and stay
You're callin' me day and night
Sayin' He don't treat you right
Then you always turn round and give one more try
Baby you know it isn't fair
You expect me to be there
But we never get nowere

I got one foot out the door
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
I'll make a long story short
Time to make up you're mind girl
No more bake and forth
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
If I'm not what you want
I don't want to hear no more

Stop tellin'n me you need more time
Tired of the same old line
Better make a move or you are gonna find
I ain't taking it, 'cause you know it's wrong
Better let him know or it's time to go, you're moving on
Baby you know how close I am to being gone
Waited on you long enough
I can only take so much
Tell me if I have you're heart
I got one foot out the door
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
I'll make a long story (no,no) short
Time to make up you're mind girl
No more back and (oh, oh, oh) Forth
If I'm not what you want
I don't want to hear no more

I don't want to hear no more
If you're sure that you really love me
I don't want to hear no more
Out the door
If you still don't know
I've been there for you and you know it's true
You belong with me, what you gonna do
I don't want to hear no more

I got one foot out the door
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
I'll make a long story short
Time to make up you're mind girl
No more bake and forth
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
If I'm not what you want
I don't want to hear no more

I got one foot out the door
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
I'll make a long story short
Time to make up you're mind girl
No more bake and forth
I don't want to hear 'bout him no more
If I'm not what you want
I don't want to hear no more

Turn off your mind
And go back with me to a better time
Do you see the same moon as me
When I'm thinking of you?

Well that's okay
We can try again another day
Do you feel the same breeze I feel
Lifting me up
Lifting me up

'Cause everyone can fly
Everyone can fly
Everyone can fly
You just have to try

Turn off the light
And don't be afraid of another night
Do the promises you couldn't keep
Make it hard for you to sleep?

Well that's okay
Everybody makes the same mistakes
As the stars shine the night away
Let them lift you up
Let them lift you up
Let them lift you up

Did you ever stop and think
When you were twenty
You'd be where you are today?
Isn't it funny how things change
Some things never stay the same
What a shame

Forget the grades
I can see you turning a greener shade 
But do you feel the same faith I feel?
Let it lift you up
Let it lift you up
Let it lift you up

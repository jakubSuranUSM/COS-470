My love, now you're lyin' lonesome
With visions of blue, vision in you
Again, you let your heart go
And whenever you do, it's hurting me too

When damage is done I watch you run
It's me you call, to me you come.
Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, I'm right here

Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
To a good thing, it's so clear
Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
That we created with our love

Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, don't you run
You know, how our heartache ends
With visions of blue abandoning you

I know that we're more than friends
You, you know that it's true, it's long overdue
No more to run, no damage done
Now here my call, to you I come

Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, I'm right here
Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
To a good thing, it's so clear

Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
That we created with our love
Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, don't you run

Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, I'm right here
Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
To a good thing, it's so clear

Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, I'm right here
Kisses and tears will turn a bad dream
To a good thing, it's so clear

Kisses and tears, you worth waiting
That we created with our love
Kisses and tears my one and only
Don't be lonely, don't you run

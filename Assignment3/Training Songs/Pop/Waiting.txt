My friends keep telling me the same
But in the night I call your name
And then I turn around just to find
An empty space
Where you used to be thinking of me

[Chorus:]
I've been waiting so long
Just to show you the way
I've been crying for you
So please won't you stay
I've been down on my knees
Just to show how I care
So please don't leave me
Crying here
The thing called love won't be the same
When you're not here, I'm so in pain
Well, life goes on, I just can't seem to find my way
Without you by my side
I can't live my life

[Chorus]
It's all so wrong, our love was meant to be forever
I can't believe that you won't stay
I know some day you'll come running back to me
I just don't know if I can wait

[Chorus]

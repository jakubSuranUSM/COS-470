You had better run from me
With everything you own
'Cause I am gonna come for you
With all that I have

I am gonna break you down
To tiny, tiny parts
I never believed, but I see it now
I'm learning your lesson, I’m learning your lesson

Did it make you feel so clever
Did you wear it on your sleeve
Did you see another picture
Where I was not a part so far entwined

There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me, and everything is even
So finally, we agree, no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun, and it's you I'll come for
I, I, have never felt so easy
I will be a gun, and it's you I'll come for

Who are you to tell me how
To keep myself afloat
I tread the water all the while
You stuck in the knife that you held at my back

Did it make you feel so clever
Did you wear it on your sleeve
Did you see another lifetime
Where I was not a part so far entwined

There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me, and everything is even
So finally, we agree, no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
Now I'll be a gun and it's you I’ll come for
Hide hide never felt so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for

There is no other way never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide I, have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I’ll come for

Hide, hide have never felt so easy
I will be a gun and it’s you I'll come for

(Oh oh) and it’s you I'll come for
(Oh oh) and it’s you I'll come for
(Oh oh) and it’s you I'll come for
(Oh oh) and it’s you I'll come for

And I’m gonna see that you won't go far (oh oh)
And I’m gonna see that you won't go far (oh oh)
And I’m gonna see that you won't go far (oh oh)
And I’m gonna see that you won't go far (oh oh)

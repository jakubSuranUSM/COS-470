[Chorus]
Can't get no booty can't get no booty
Can't get no booty can't get no booty

I can't see it anyway
Because I've always been such an easy prey
Can't get no booty can't get no booty

Trying and trying again
No matter how hard I shake my tail feather in your face
All I can think of it's such a disgrace
There's so much good man going to waste

Maybe it's because of the clothes I wear maybe it's the 
Palming on my hair
Can't get no booty can't get no booty

Is it the way I talk maybe it's the way I walk
Is it the way I think maybe it's just the way I speak

[Chorus]

Having trouble seeing through your shades
What you been reading `bout me in the trades?
Trying to make myself perfectly clear
It's not the inches, it's the engineer

And when I'm running my strongest way
What is the feeling that you can't fake
Maybe it's the tattoo on my face
Maybe it's that I just know my place

[Chorus]

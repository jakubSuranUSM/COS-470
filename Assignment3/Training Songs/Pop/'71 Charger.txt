Though you lay your head, on my head
On my head, on my couch
I ain't got the time
Won't waste time on your insights and mood

He says, "that don't concern me
That's not my sexy worries
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself"
Though you lay your head, on my head
On my head, on my couch

Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger

Rolling back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth with your words
I ain't got the time
Won't waste time whilst you mess with my nerves

Your trouble isn't worth it
You're talk it like it's dirty
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Rolling back and forth, back and forth
Back and forth with your words

Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger

Live by the black road, it's my cup with me
Craving the comfort from that empty seat
I ride on my own

Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
Bite your tongue honey, keep it to yourself
To yourself
I, I'd rather kill myself in a '71 Charger

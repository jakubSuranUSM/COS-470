What's your reason to kill or not
This has come a long way
Too fake for the season, is it real or not
Totally in this I'll stay
Too many sensations now for a good feeling
I'll take a step back
Let's go under and hold our breath
Who's got the reason now
In one little mouth it goes
Never will surface
Too many sensations now for a good feeling
I'll take a step back
Too many sensations now for a good feeling

(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye)

In the firebreak, in the vaults
Lost memories get old
Tiny love left unsaid
Like grains of sand left in my bed

I've been trying, oh
Dancing away the dead gone days
I've been flying, oh
The moment that I see your face

I remember, I remember, I remember goodbye
Insulted brain running from your eyes
I remember, I remember, I remember the fights
Burning deep into the night

I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right

(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye)

I couldn't sense a trap
A special moment or a slap
Tiny love will attack
As it gets bigger behind your back

I've been trying, oh
Dancing away the dead gone days
I've been flying, oh
The moment that I see your face

I remember, I remember, I remember goodbye
Insulted brain running from your eyes
I remember, I remember, I remember the fights
Burning deep into the night

I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right

(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye)

I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember

I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right

(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye, leave, leave)
(Crying, leave, goodbye)

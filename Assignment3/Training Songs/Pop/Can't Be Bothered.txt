What's the fucking point?
When I'm a lazy sod
I won't go to college 
And I won't get a job
I sleep right through the day
I won't even get dressed
My parents go to work and 
Try and put me to the test

I can't be bothered with my life 
It causes grief and too much strife 
It's not my problem and I don't care
But I have to fix it, it's just not fair

Leave me alone now
Please get off my back
You shout at me too much and
I've lost track of that
I'm going for a walk
To get away from you
So I can have some quiet
To do the things I do

I can't be bothered with my life 
It causes grief and too much strife 
It's not my problem and I don't care
But I have to fix it, it's just not fair

I can't be bothered with anything
It's getting to my brain
So you gotta leave me
Before I go insane

Darkest night
Candlelight
Your hands were soft
Your skin too pale
White on white
I had to turn away
From your light
 
I could see you
Laugh at me
You knew what
I was thinking inside
With one look
Of your all seeing eyes
 
Wear the disguise
I'm lost in your eyes
 
Your glance felt
Like a knife
So clear, so blue
I was swimming inside
I was swimming inside
 
You'll always be
Real to me
I took one look
I could fly away
Stare, stare
In your all seeing eyes
'Till starlight
 
You wear the disguise
I'm lost in your eyes
 
Amedio,
Gli occhituoi
Mi anno fatto innamorare

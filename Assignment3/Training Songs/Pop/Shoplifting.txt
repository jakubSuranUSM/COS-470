Let me make a fashion statement.
I don't like that shirt you're wearing.
You stand around here looking vacant.
It seems to me you're way past caring.
I'm trying hard to save your bacon.
Time and time again you're taking taking.
Taking me shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
A starring role in crown court.
Shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
A starring role in crown court.

When you make your opening statement.
You've got to let me hear a suspended sentence.
Let me make a closing statement.
You get me off and I'll make the payments.
Payments by taking you shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
Shoplifting you go.
A starring role in crown court.
Shoplifting we go.
Shoplifting we go.
Shoplifting we go.
A starring role in crown court.

When I'm looking for the perfect things
Some fantasies they save me with the grace - it's a precious land
All around me little things are shining like they are one - are we sisters?
When I'm looking for the perfect things I stand up and put on another face
You're all exploring all you see you should live everything

I'm waking up in a good day so happy walking into the sun

perspiring deeply watching these fears as big as planets I'm hot
See you are living all you are in your eyes is there an end?
I really want you see me the way I am the way I am
Just gimme some time sister gimme some trust sister

perspiring deeply watching these fears as big as planet I'm hot
Wild wise earth keep on turning...
Yellow sun keep on burning

yellow sun

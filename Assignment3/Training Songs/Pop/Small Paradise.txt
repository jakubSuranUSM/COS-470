Two veteran lovers french kiss in the doorway
Their ears are cold, but their hearts are so warm
A country band playin' down the street just a little ways
They're whiskey wild; they keep it up until dawn

[Chorus]
Small paradise
I'm glad to see everything's alright with you
Alright, then hold me tight; kiss me
Small paradise

A neon sign blinks outside in the pouring rain
It's ladies night; free drinks until ten
Some people walk on by; hey, girl, don't I know you?
Won't you come on in?
Well it ain't love, but it ain't bad

[Chorus x 2]

I've been around and I'm just wishing on a star
I've traveled a long ways but I've never been this far
I've seen the world with my eyes never did I know
But I'm gonna find a way no matter what they say

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy of the world

I've been around and I'm just wishing on a star
I've traveled long ways but I've never been this far
I've seen the world with my eyes never did I know
But I'm gonna find a way no matter what they say

There are times when I just wanna lay down on the ground
And never rise again no matter what's been found
But then I realize I have to carry on
And I try to move along to the rivers full of joy

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, of the world

So many people pass me by without a sign
I try to catch them but I don't know if it's right
As far as I can see I still got much to learn
I have to find a way no matter what they say

It's time to wake up now 'cause much is still undone
I made up my mind and nothing gets me down
And I won't stop this time until I'm really through
I have to move along to the rivers full of joy

In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I believe
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, I will find
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, all the happiness
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy, of the world

In the rivers of joy
Rivers of joy oh

And now when I know myself
I see it all so clear there's nothing more to fear yeah

You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm you come across
So hear me when I say you're here to stay
Hold on tight and I'll be right
You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm just happiness
You just take a look deep down in the rivers of joy

In the rivers of joy joy, the rivers of joy
In the rivers of joy joy
In the rivers of joy joy, hey
In the rivers of joy joy

In the rivers of joy hallelujah
In the rivers of joy
In the rivers of joy hallelujah joy - all the happiness
Hallelujah joy - of the world
In the rivers of joy

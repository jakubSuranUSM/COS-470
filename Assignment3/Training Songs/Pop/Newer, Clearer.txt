Tomorrow the sun will shine
Love is rationality
Feel with greater clarity
Tomorrow the sun will shine

The pious will tell a lie
The sane will lose his mind
We are born, then we die
Tomorrow the sun will shine

The forest will burn away
The river will soon run dry 
As sure as the sea meets the sky
Tomorrow the sun will shine...

So you've paid your dues
Those Elvis frauds, how they'll applaud
Farewell my friends 
So in your rock'n'roll
And pretty soon those pretty girls
Will find your home 

We'll pay you handsomely (But you see)
Don't steal our sun
Don't steal our sun 
(You're just killing fun) 

I said you felt so good
Well I'm amazed
Hey what a show 

I heard you're dating Sue (yeah your welcome to)
I'd love to talk
But don't we know
That don't ring true 

We'll pay you handsomely (But you see)
Don't steal our sun
Don't steal our sun 
(You're just killing fun)

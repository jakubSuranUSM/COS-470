I don't know why
I love you like I do
But baby I love you
And always I'll be true
I know sometimes
You treat me like a fool
Try to bend me to your rules
But I love you all the same

Cause when we're together
And everything's alright
I'm a king for the day

I don't know why
I fall but don't fall down
But I never touch the ground
Whenever you're around
I don't know where
We may be tomorrow
If you lead I will follow
And we'll get there just the same

I'll always love you
Every day and night
Come and take me away

Can't you see that you're the only one
And I'm open wide
You saved me from being a lonely one
You caught me inside
With a feeling I can't resist
You take me away
And I'll never get over this
A king today

River
I'm swimming in a deep river
I hope that river
Is a long river

Well I know sometimes that you like to play
Messing with my mind but I love you anyway
I don't know why you say what you say
Every night I pray that you never go away
Well I know sometimes that you like to play
(it's a game you play)
Messing with my mind but I love you anyway
(i love you anyway)
I'm trying hard to say that I love you every day
(despite the things you say)
But I'm hoping and I'm praying that you never go away
(never go away)

Cause when we're together
And everything's alright
I'm a king for the day

And I'll always love you
Every day and night
Come and take me away

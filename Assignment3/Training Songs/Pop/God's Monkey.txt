One push
You fall in
Born in darkness
Built on shame
And hurting
Filled with silence
Filled with silence
And stars
Stars
Stars
Find the ladder
Climb the ladder
To god's monkey
No songs
To sing
That I believe in
That I believe in
Can't breathe the air
It's too thin
This far from heaven
This far from heaven
And stars
Stars
Find the ladder
Climb the ladder
To god's monkey.

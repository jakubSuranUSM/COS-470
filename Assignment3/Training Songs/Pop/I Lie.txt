I lie
I steal
I never show what I feel
I never cry
I never could
I lie
And it ain't no good

I take
Never give
It's just the way I have to live
Since you left me here
So high and dry
Left me here to wonder why

I lie
I lie
But I wouldn't lie
No I wouldn't lie
If I had you

Time passes slow
When you've got nowhere to go
I'm hot and cold
I'm young and old
I'm left and right
But for tonight

I lie
I lie
But I wouldn't lie
No I wouldn't lie
If I had you

Why don't I want you
Why don't I want you
Why don't I want you

I been lost
And I been found
Been all around this one-horse town
And there are no thrills anymore
That can get me high
So I just lie

I lie
I lie
But I wouldn't lie
No I wouldn't lie
If I had you

Why don't you want me
Why don't you want me
Why don't you want me
Why don't you want me

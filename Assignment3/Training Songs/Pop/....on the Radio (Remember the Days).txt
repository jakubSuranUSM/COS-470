You liked me til you heard my shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain't going solo
You liked me til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you
You liked me til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so low below then why you watching
You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days 
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less than I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face, the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you expect from me, like that's what I'm about

I remember the days 
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less than I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

It's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
Than sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight, turn in the spitfire,
Scream without making a sound, be up here without looking down
Because we're all afraid of heights

I remember the days 
When I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less than I was 
Just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away 
I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself 

Myself

Why ya hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me so,
Leave me down down down down low 
Leave me down da down down da down da down down down low

You don't knock, ring, punch a hole
The door's wide open waitin' for your soul
You don't knock just walk on in

I've walked life's winding road
'Cause I'm tryin' to bear the load 
And I traveled both night and day 
So tired I could hardly pray
Jesus, my light and guide 
Is ever on my side.
I'm just a waitin' and a knockin' in the heaven
With fire

You don't knock
(You don't knock you just walk on in)
The door 
(The door into heaven's inn)
There's love 
(There's love and joy for you
To share 
(To share the whole day through)
And I know 
(I know my friends are there)
To rest 
(To rest in heaven's nest)
You don't knock, ring, punch a hole
The door's wide open waitin' for your soul
You don't knock just walk on in

I'll have no need to fear (Oh, yeah!)
He is ever near (Oh, yeah!)
He knows my work was true (Oh, yeah!)
So glad the day is through (Yeah!)
Well it wasn't for me to say (Oh, yeah!)
I didn't think I'd make my way (Oh,Yeah!)
So, I'm a-walkin', not a-knockin', to heaven with pride

You don't knock
(You don't knock you just walk on in)
The door 
(The door into heaven's inn)
There's love 
(There's love and joy for you
To share 
(To share the whole day through)
And I know 
(I know my friends are there)
To rest 
(To rest in heaven's nest)
You don't knock, ring, punch a hole
The door's wide open waitin' for your soul
You don't knock just walk on in

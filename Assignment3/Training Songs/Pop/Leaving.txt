I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

Our love is dead, but the dead don’t go away
They made us what we are , they’re with us everyday
Our love is dead, but the dead they’re still alive
In memory and thoughts, and the context they provide

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

Our love is dead,(our love is dead)
But the dead are here to stay (don’t go away)
They made us what we are (that’s what we are)
They’re with us everyday (oh everyday)
In darkest nights (in darkest nights)
The memory keeps us strong (it keeps us strong)
And if our love is dead (our love is dead)
It won’t be dead for long (no not for long)

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
Believe in love
Don’t go away

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love

I know when enough’s enough and you’re leaving
You've had enough time to decide on your freedom
But I can still find some hope to believe in love
Believe in love

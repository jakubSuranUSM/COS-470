(a.bell/v.clarke)
I don't suppose it's gonna do any good
If I sit down and write you a letter
You made it plain and I guess I understood
There's no way that things can get better

I was never so wrong
I thought we would go on forever
Always together
Now it's hard to believe you would walk out
And leave me crying
Feel like I'm dying

Dream maker, heart breaker
I would do anything you say
Dream maker, heart breaker
You could take everything away

I've never felt like I feel lonely tonight
Like a river so deep filled with sorrow
I won't be sleeping I won't turn out the light
I've got heartache enough for tomorrow
And I know I should learn
But wherever I turn you find me
Always remind me

Dream maker, heart breaker...(chorus)
And I want you to know
That it's hurting me so inside me
Need you beside me

Dream maker, heart breaker...(repeat till fade)

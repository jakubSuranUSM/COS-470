Whenever I think of you
Wherever my inquisitive heart
Wants to lead me to
I will follow no matter how far
I can't leave these thoughts behind me
They catch my every breath
They turn me into someone
That I haven't met yet
I wish you were here
Here in england
The weather is fine
Here in england
And I wish you were here
Missing you is easy
It's all I can do
And wishing you were with me
Its a pointless wish to choose
It's my heart that's feels abandoned
It's the heart that takes the strain
It all seems so hopeless
But I love you just the same
I wish

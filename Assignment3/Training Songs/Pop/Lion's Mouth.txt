Take away my prime from the mouth of the lion
Savage jaws are the price we pay

Take away their lies
Let me see you with my own eyes
Walk along the narrow way

Oh what a waste
Your sword is no use when you're standing face to face

Oh what a waste
Harvest the human race
Your sword's no use to you when standing face to face

Hey fool watch out
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
Hey fool watch out
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth

Take away my chains
Don't want to see 'em again
Take away my misery
Take away my blindfold
Don't want to belong to the old.
Take it up and set me free

Oh what a waste
Your sword is no use when you're standing face to face

Oh what a waste
Harvest the human race
Your sword's no use to you when standing face to face

Hey fool watch out
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
I don't think so

Hey fool watch out
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
I don't think so

I know I ask
Too much of you
And I'm pushing
You away

I've got nothing to say to her ghost
Hoping she'll fade away
I've got nothing to say to her ghost
Love does not live this way

Take your words and put them in my mouth
Help me say the things that never come out
I forgive you

So afraid, I'm scared you'll walk away
Eyes are tired but I'm wide awake
I forget you

My love
I'll learn to let go
Of all the things I thought we had

I've got nothing to say to her ghost
Hoping she'll fade away
I've got nothing to say to her ghost
Love does not live this way

Take your words and put them in my mouth
Help me say the things that never come out
I forgive you

So afraid I'm scared you'll walk away
Eyes are tired but I'm wide awake
I forget you

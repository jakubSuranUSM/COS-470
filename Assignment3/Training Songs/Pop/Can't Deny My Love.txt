Open up, till the night our bed is
Underneath a heavy moon
Cast a doubt like a shadow walking
Through the corners of the room
I always thought I have a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're not alone)
I always thought I'd find my own way

What's going on in your head now?
Was it something I said?
I know that you've been living in the past
What's going in your head now?
Maybe something I said

It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie

But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

The eyes of God are watching over us
So we don't break the golden rules
The seven seas, have we learned or
Are we sailing on a ship of fools?

I always thought I had a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're not alone)
I always thought we'd get there someday

It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

When you close your eyes, tell me what you see
Locked up in your room is there any room for me?
In the spoils of your mercy
In the reverence of your bed
In the cradle of the morning
What was it that you said?

What's going in your head now?

You're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside,
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love, my love

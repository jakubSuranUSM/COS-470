I'm what You're looking for
No need to search any more
I'm in need of Your saving

You, You can give me hope
Rescue my wretched soul
You are the one I am praying

I am just like the alien
The fatherless and the widow
I am just like the alien
The fatherless and the widow

Keep Your watch over me
Sustain the life in me
Frustrate the ways of every wicked man

Let me inside Your home
Father defend my cause
Plead for my case and my innocence

I am just like the alien
The fatherless and the widow
I am just like the alien
The fatherless and the widow

Just like the alien
I'm a stranger in a strange land
Just like the fatherless, I am in need
Of someone to take my hand

Just like the widow
I need You right now
To understand and save me

Won't You save me?
Won't You save me?
Won't You save me?
Save me, save me

I am just like the alien
Fatherless and the widow
I am just like the alien
The fatherless and the widow

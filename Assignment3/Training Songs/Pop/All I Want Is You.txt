It's been a long day, I'm absolutely aching
To lie down next to my girl and tell her all about it
I had to stop at every single red light
I couldn't get a word in when I finally saw the bars

And all I wanted was you, you
All I wanted was you, you
Well, how 'bout that?

Oh, they say they have grave doubts 'bout anything I do
They huddle and discuss me, well, maybe I should leave, oh
But in ten years, come and see where I am
I'll be standing with my girl and you will all be lonely

And all I wanted was you, you
All I wanted was you, oh-oh-oh

It's been a long day, I'm absolutely aching
To lie down next to my girl and tell her all about it

(One, two, three, four) Shout!
Alright, ahh, now
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-oh, oh-oh
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-oh, oh-oh
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-oh, oh-oh
Mmm, ah

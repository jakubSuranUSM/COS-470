Wake up, already in my head
Yeah, I'm in my head, I'm already in my head
Shaking hands and my world is changin'
Down on my knees, I'm beggin'
Can't take another day

Is it over? Is it over yet?
Can't I let, just let myself forget?
Everything keeps pounding in my head
Can't free my soul 'til I

Learn to let go, oh-oh
I'm losing control, say it ain't so
Throw my hands up, learn to let go, oh-oh
Good at goodbyes but bad at hello
Throw my hands up, learn to let go

Made up millions of reasons
Made up million little pieces
Yeah, still seems the skin won't shed
Tired (Tired) of holding on tight
So tired (Tired) of tryna make it all alright
When will be alright?

Is it over? Is it over yet?
Why can't I let, just let myself forget?
Everything keeps pounding in my head
Can't free my soul 'til I

Learn to let go, oh-oh
I'm losing control, say it ain't so
Throw my hands up, learn to let go, oh-oh
Good at goodbyes but bad at hello
Throw my hands up, learn to let go
Learn to let
Learn to let go

I'm tired of being in my head
I'm tired of being left alone
Can you teach me how to breathe it in?
I can't free my, free my, free my, free my
Free my soul till I

Learn to let go, oh-oh
Good at goodbyes but bad at hello
Throw my hands up, learn to let go
(Is it over? Is it over? Is it over?)
Learn to let go
(Is it over? Is it over yet?)
Learn to let
Learn to let go

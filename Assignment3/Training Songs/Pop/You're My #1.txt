I've kissed the moon a million times
Danced with angels in the sky 
I've seen snowfall in the summertime
Felt the healing of the powers above

I've seen the world from the highest mountain
Tasted love from the purest fountain 
I've seen lips that spark desire
Felt the butterflies a hundred times

I've even seen miracles 
I've felt the pain disappear
But still haven't seen anything
That amazes me quite like you do

You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
You touch me deep you touch me right 
You do the things I've never done 
You make me wicked you make me wild 
'Cause baby, you're my number one

I've sailed in a perfect dream 
I've seen the sun make love to the sea 
I've kissed the moon a million times
Danced with angels in the sky

I've even seen miracles 
I've seen the tears disappear
But still haven't seen anything
That amazes me quite like you do

You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
You touch me deep you touch me right 
You do the things I've never done 
You make me wicked you make me wild 
'Cause baby, you're my number one, uh uh, uh uh

You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
You touch me deep you me right 
You do the things I've never done 
You make me wicked you make me wild 
You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
You touch me deep you touch me right 
You do the things I've never done 
You make me wicked you make me wild 
'Cause baby, you're my number one

La, la, la, la, la

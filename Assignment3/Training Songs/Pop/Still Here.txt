You take my money and burn it to the ground
It's no inferno but it follows me around, and I've got
Selective memory, forgotten your name
Now I'm turning myself inside out once again

And I'll take it one day at a time
And I'll take it one day at a time

If you do, if you don't, if you say that you won't
I'm still here
Watching you from afar
Would you stay? If you don't, that's OK
I'm still here
Watching you from afar

You tell my family, I am going blind
I can't see anything since I've been left behind, and I've got
No friends, no future, I've got no pension plan
At my funeral they'll bury just my head in the sand.

And I'll take it one day at a time
And I'll take it one day at a time

If you do, if you don't, if you say that you won't
I'm still here
Watching you from afar
Would you stay? If you don't, that's OK
I'm still here
Watching you from afar
Watching you from afar

Woo ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh

If you do, if you don't, if you say that you won't
I'm still here
Watching you from afar
Would you stay? If you don't, that's OK
I'm still here
Watching you from afar
Watching you from afar
Watching you from afar

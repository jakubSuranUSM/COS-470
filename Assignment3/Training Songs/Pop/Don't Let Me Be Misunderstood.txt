Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But, don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

Baby,sometimes I'm so carefree with a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do
Because I love you.

Oh,oh baby don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other one
Sometime I find myself regretting some foolish thing
Some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

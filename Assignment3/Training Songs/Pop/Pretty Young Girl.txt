I know life is different to you
First love can be frightening that's true
But take me as your brother and your friend
And take me as your lover and your man

[Chorus]
Pretty young girl of my mind
How I wish you to be mine
Girl you're no child anymore
Pretty young girl of my mind
Don't you know, know I can't hide
Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Don't know, is it wrong is it right?
Sweet girl, I want to love you tonight.
So take me as your brother and your friend
But first of all, I want to be your man

[Chorus: x2]

Got no reason for comin' to me
And the rain runnin' down
There's no reason
And the same voice comin' to me like it's all slowin' down
And believe me

I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after seventy-four, seventy-five

It's not easy
Nothin' to say 'cause it's already said
It's never easy
When I look on in your eyes then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on in your eyes then I'll do better

I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after seventy-four, seventy-five
Givin' me more and I'll define
'Cause you're really only after seventy-four, seventy-five

Got no reason for comin' to me
And the rain runnin' down
There's no reason
When I look on in your eyes then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on in your eyes then I'll do better

I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after seventy-four, seventy-five
Givin' me more and I'll define
'Cause you're really only after seventy-four, seventy-five

I was the one who let you know
I was your sorry ever after seventy-four, seventy-five
Givin' me more and I'll define
'Cause you're really only after seventy-four, seventy-five

Seventy-four, seventy-five

Seventy-four, seventy-five

Seventy-four, seventy-five

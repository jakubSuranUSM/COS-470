Living in this crazy world, soaked up in the confusion
Nothing is a making sense for me and you
Maybe we can find a way, there has got to be solution
How to make a brighter day. What do we do? 

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh oh oh oh oh, we can really make it better
Oh oh oh, only if we try

Got the worries on our minds, got the troubles on our shoulders
Sometimes it just seems so much what we go through
Maybe if we take the time, time to understand each other
We can learn to make it right. What do we do?

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh oh oh oh oh, we can really make it better
Oh oh oh, la la la, only if we try

Oh oh oh, la la la, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, la la la, only if we try

If everybody'd take somebody by the hand
Then maybe everyone could learn to love and understand that

Oh oh oh, we can really make it better
Oh oh oh, la la la, only if we try

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

(We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together)

Oh oh oh oh oh, we can really make it better
Oh oh oh, la la la, only if we try

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh oh oh oh oh, we can really make it better
Oh oh oh, la la la, only if we try

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh oh oh oh oh

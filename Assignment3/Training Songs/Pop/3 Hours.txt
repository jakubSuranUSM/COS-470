Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me,
Hit me where you want it, hit me where you want it,
Hit me where you want it, hit me where you want it,
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me,
Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way

3 minutes then I’m out of here
3 words if you say it I’m staying
3 hours I’ll sit here with no sleep
Contemplating all the things I should keep
So hold on just a second while my back is turned
In a second every lie was learned
3 years and those seconds we shared

Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me,
Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way
Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way

Only lonely when I stand by you
You kept on leaning while I stood for two
Two words make a pointless apology

I see the fire in your eyes
But weigh in closer now it burns, yeah
I hold a candle for you now
One puff and the smoke covers everything
One puff and the smoke covers everything
One puff and the smoke covers everything

Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way
Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way
Hit me where you want it
Hit me where you want it
Hit me where you want it

Hit me where you want it and I’ll take the blame
Hit me and I guarantee you’ll feel the same
Hit me if you think that it will help the pain
Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me any way

I’ve got smoke in my eyes, hit me one more time
I’ve got smoke in my eyes

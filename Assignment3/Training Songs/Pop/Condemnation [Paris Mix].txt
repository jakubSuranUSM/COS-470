Condemnation, tried.
Here on the stand,
With the book in my hand
And truth on my side.

Accusation, lies.
Hand me my sentence -
I'll show no repentance,
I'll suffer with pride.

If for honestly you want apologies -
I don't sympathize.
If for kindness you substitute blindness -
Please open your eyes.

Condemnation, why.
Because my beauty was always to beauty -
And that was my crime

Feel elation, high.
To know I can trust this,
Fix of injustice time after time.

If you see purity as immaturity -
Well, it's no surprise.
If for kindness you substitute blindness -
Please open your eyes.

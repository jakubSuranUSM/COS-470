When the routine bites hard 
And ambitions are low
And the resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect run so dry

Wet, there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep?
All my failings exposed
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold

Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
When love, love will tear us apart again

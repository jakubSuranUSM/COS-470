Uno, dos, tres, quattro
Yeah, oh baby
Oh girl, oh lady, come to, come to me
Oh I can't decide if I should read or think 
I'll keep an open mind, 'til the day sets in 
Hear you call me (hear you call me, call me) I'm so willing to call back (willing to call back)
Hear you thinking (hear you thinking, you thinking), hope you hear me thinking too (woah)

Why can't I wake up with you (why can't I wake up with you)
Somewhere there when I open my eyes (when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you (why can't I wake up with you)
You're my life, my love

Ooh
You're my life 
I feel alive, so I'll just begin (just begin)
Yeah, to read my mind, before you ring me (before you ring me)
Hear you thinking (hear you thinking, you thinking), hope you hear me thinking too 

Why can't I wake up with you (why can't I wake up with you)
Somewhere there there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you (why can't I wake up with you)
You're my life 
You're my life, mmh

Oh you're my love, you're my love
So good to be near you (so good to be near you)
So dark when you walk from my side (from my side)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life, you're my life (you're my life)

Hear you thinking (hear you thinking, you thinking), hope you hear me thinking too
Darling
Why can't I wake up with you 
Be there when I open my eyes 
Why can't I wake up with you 
My love
Why can't I wake up with you (why can't I wake up with you)
Be there when I open my eyes

I don't need respect from you
Don't think I deserve it too
I've got to much ships to load
To be riding three lane roads
Don't unlock your hidden thruth
Don't put your bags on this old mule
Don't you get my puzzle wrong
I don't let no reason rule
But I'll protect ya from my truth
Substitute your demons too
Please let me release the peace
I need your keys I'm hooked on you
I got this bitter cold turkey
Tempting me teasing me like 
I don't need ya

I got addicted to 
The kinky stuff you do
But you're affected too 
Cause you're a victim too
I got addicted to 
My dirty blood turns blue
I need the best of you 
Cause I'm addicted to you
I got addicted to 
Got to depend on you
I know you're tempted too 
So come to my rescue

I want your picture to 
Give me a déjà vu
Break down your last taboo cause 
I'm addicted to you
I need something to score
No more no man no user man
Dealing with your healing and 
You're my methadonna
Gotta clean up my act in fact 
I'ld sign any kind of saving pact

I got addicted to 
The kinky stuff you do
But you're affected too 
Cause you're a victim too
I got addicted to 
My dirty blood turns blue
I need the best of you 
Cause I'm addicted to you
I got addicted to 
Got to depend on you

When loving gets stronger my antidote is you
When loving gets strong I run away to you

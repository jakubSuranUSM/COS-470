Desire, the fire, it's all in you
The passion, and action, you take me through
I'm living it, I'm loving it
This is where the dreams come alive
A shooting star in the night

Para siempre
Viva los heroes

To all the heroes, the rush of emotions
In this high and low, ah-ay-ah let's go
To all the heroes, we celebrate our nations
Let the whole world know, ah-ay-ah let's go
To all the heroes.

Emotions, are rushing out of control
A Notion, touching my body and soul
Can't fight it, can't hide it
Everything I'm feeling inside
Reflects the gold in your eyes

To all the heroes...

Viva los heroes, the rush of emotions
In this high and low, ah-ay-ah let's go
Viva los heroes, we celebrate our nations
Let the whole world know, ah-ay-ah let's go
Viva los heroes

Para siempre
Viva los heroes

To all the heroes, the rush of emotions
In this high and low, ah-ay-ah let's go
To all the heroes, we celebrate our nations
Let the whole world know, ah-ay-ah let's go
To all the heroes

[Repeat]

Baby I got you on my answering machine on replay
This is getting difficult in my say
Stutter's on my mind when you approach me
With soft un-trusting words
Velvet linings on your language
Boy you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on

You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back
Twisting turning
You're such a wordshaker
I gotta shut you up
Your lips are burning
First you say yes then no
When you are ready baby let me know
You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back, back
Shaking me off my track

Leaving? I tell you that's impossible and you aren't speaking
This is so unfair and I'm so deep in
My head above the water still I'm sinking
So please make up your mind

Velvet linings on your language
Boy you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on

You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back
Twisting turning
You're such a wordshaker
I gotta shut you up
Your lips are burning
First you say yes then no
When you are ready baby let me know
You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back, back
Shaking me off my track

Velvet linings on your language
Boy you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on

You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back
Twisting turning
You're such a wordshaker
I gotta shut you up
Your lips are burning
First you say yes then no
When you are ready baby let me know
You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back, back 
(take it back, take it back, take it back)
Shaking me off my track

Talk and you take it back
Twisting turning
You're such a wordshaker
I gotta shut you up
Your lips are burning
First you say yes then no
When you are ready baby let me know
You're such a wordshaker

You're such a wordshaker

You emerge 
Your face drawn in black and white 
Your corset laced up just right 
A vampire in fishnets 
“So,” I laugh 
“What are you supposed to be?” 
You smile but won’t answer me 
Is this a trick or treat? 

Master of the cheap disguise 
Sometimes I can’t believe my eyes, I tell you 
(You/I/We) sure know how to make a scene 
It must be Halloween 

Half asleep 
We race home to beat the dawn 
I cut through a corner lawn 
And slice my head on a branch 
“Hang on, I just need to catch my breath” 
You say that I look like death 
And toss back your head to laugh in revenge.

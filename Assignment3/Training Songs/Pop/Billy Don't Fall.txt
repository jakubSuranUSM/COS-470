Billy was a young boy
Who's fate did decree
That he would like only other boys
So being with a boy came to him naturally
Billy was a green boy
His thoughts so naive
He wondered why he was so victimised
And his fear brought him close to me suddenly

But
Billy my friend
Don't fall in love with me
I'm not that kind of guy
But I'll stand by your side
If you need me to be

But
Billy my friend
Don't fall in love with me
Though it can't be wrong to be
To be what you are

Billy was a sick boy
His life fading to grey
He tried to grab for straws of family
But his loved ones turned young Billy away
Billy died a young man
His face to the wind
And of the things I regret the most
Was seeing how hate and fear killed a friend

But
Billy my friend
Don't fall in love with me
I'm not that kind of guy
But I'll stand by your side
If you need me to be

But
Billy my friend
Don't fall in love with me
Though it can't be wrong to be
To be what you are

When I look into your eyes,
Then I know that life's worth living,
Just without you,
More or less,
There's nothing left to tell.
All the years we shared our time,
All the things we had in common,
All the crisis,
More or less,
We've nothing left to tell.

All excuses, all your plights,
All your nice ideas,
Effusions of your mind,
But I'll tell you for a thousand times:

I want you going down,
Just for one time.
I want you going down,
Going down to the place
Where you belong to.

When I woke up in your arms
And I felt myself, I'm freezing
That's unusual,
More or less,
There's nothing left that's warm.
All the years we shared our dreams,
Now I know it was a nightmare,
Of your loving,
More or less,
There's nothing left to loose.

All excuses, all your plights,
All your nice ideas,
Effusions of your mind
But I'll tell you for a thousand times:

I want you going down,
Just for one time.
I want you going down
Going down to the place
Where you belong to.

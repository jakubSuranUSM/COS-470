I can see it in my street
I can see it in my home
I can see it in my self 
Making out like I'm okay

I can hear it on the radio
I can hear it on the TV
I can see it all gone wrong
Making out like it's okay

We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness

I can't watch the world no more
â€˜Cause my TV's looking sad
Cut up on the floor
Tied up in my bag

I'm going out tonight
To throw it in the river
But when it sinks away
It's the thing I want back most
But when it sinks away
It's the thing I want back most

We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured of sadness

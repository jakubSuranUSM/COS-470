Good morning, I had a goodnight sleep
And it's, my favorite day of the week
And I, I believe I'll start with prayer
Then get ready cause I gotta get there
Soon as I get through the door
My hands up, feet off the floor
Cause all the saints we go to work (ah)
That's how we do it down at my church (ah)

Ushers march (ooh)
Choir sing (ooh)
Kids playing (ooh)
The tambourine (ooh)
Preachers preaching, the mothers prayin'
My Sunday best on and we ain't playin'
I been workin' hard since Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Saturday came and gone (ah)
I can't wait, to get to Sunday morning

Good evenin', night service is about to start
And I gotta go do my part
Cause I sing with the choir
We try to take the people a little higher
And then I give my testimony
Tell everybody what God done for me
Just wanna encourage you (ah)
Cause at my church that's what we do

Ushers march (ooh)
Choir sing (ooh)
Kids playing (ooh)
The tambourine (ooh)
Preachers preaching, the mothers prayin'
My Sunday best on and we ain't playin'
I been workin' hard since Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Saturday came and gone (ah)
I can't wait, to get to Sunday morning

(Oop-oop, oop-oop, oop-oop...)
Maybe you go to the park
Maybe you stay in the bed
Maybe you go and wash your car
Or hang (hang) with your (hang)
Friends down at the mall
And all of those things are cool
And maybe that's fine with you
I been waitin' (waitin') 6 long days
To get to my church on Sunday (Sunday)

I been workin' (I been workin') hard
Since Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
(Thursday & Friday), Saturday came and gone
I can't wait to get (oh Lord) to
Sunday mornin' I can't wait, I can't wait

I been workin' hard since (oh Lord) Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday, (all week long)
Thursday and Friday,
Saturday came and gone (hey)
To wait to get to Sunday mornin'
Oooooh Sunday mornin'

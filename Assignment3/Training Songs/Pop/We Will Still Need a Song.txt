F*ck you, you're drunk and acting tough
I know you're sad you're not the only one
Who feels like that now

And maybe anger is your only choice
But maybe heart and fist and human voice
Might be the better way
Be the way

Chorus:
Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away
To carry it away
We will still need a song
To carry our hearts away
To carry them away

Don't let another tear be in your eyes
We can die in peace knowing we tried
To change our own ways

The poets let a generation down
And modern music could be the healing sound
It's the only way
Only way

Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away
To carry it away
We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day
To carry it away

And we will still need a song
(we will still need)
To carry a song (carry a song)
To carry a song 

And we, we will still need a song
To carry our hearts away
To carry them away
We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day, yeah
To carry it away, yeah

(Last chance for feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling down)
(Last chance for feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling down)

This will be your last chance
Cause I'll never again feel down

(Last chance for feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling down)

Cause we, we will still need a song
To carry our love away

(Last chance for feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling down)

We will still need a song
To dance on our wedding day
To carry it away
We all need a songâ€¦

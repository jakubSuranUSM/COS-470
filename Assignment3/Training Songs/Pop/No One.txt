Swimming in the deep end
With nowhere to go
My body's on the journey
And my mind can't let go
I'm falling into nothing
Tell me what's left to lose
'Fore I knew where I was going
And now I know I need you

They say you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone
They say you're no one
Till someone missess you when you're gone
And now I feel like I've let you down
It's me now who's reaching now
I can't do this on my own
Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

When I hit the ground running
Trying not to give in
Every step is a hurtle
Don't know where I begin
Hold my mind wide open
When lonely is the truth
Thought I knew where I was going
And now I know I need you

They say you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone
They say you're no one
Till someone misses you when you're gone
And now I feel like I've let you down
It's me now who's reaching now
I can't do this on my own
Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

If I came home all back down
If I have no one else around
Would you be there to pull me up
Will I be that somebody to you?
(Please tell, please tell me now)
Will I be that somebody to you?
(Please tell, please tell me now)
Could I be that somebody to you?
To you, to you, to you, to you
Could I be that somebody to you?

They say you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone
They say you're no one
Till someone misses you when you're gone
And I feel like I've let you down
It's me now who's reaching now
I can't do this on my own
Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

Just because you'll always be
Miles ahead of me
I don't see why
I shouldn't try
To catch up with you

'Cause in my mind a 1,000 times or more
I've been there before
There's nothing I can see
That will stop me, believe me

Our time will come
And I don't think I will let
Another chance
Pass me by

I don't want you to get bored
Like you have a 1,000 times before
Give me some time
Just to show that I am up to it

Our time will come
And I don't think I will let
Another chance
Pass me by

There's something that can be done
To bring us back together as one
There's something else I can do
That's why I'm sending this message to you
I will try another 1,000 times
To bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times
Till you decide to change your mind

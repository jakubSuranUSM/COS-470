Darlin' all you do is decieve. 
Always a heartache up your sleeve 
What good does it do to be hidin' the truth 
(Hidin' Hidin') 
The only one you really fool is you. 

[Chorus]
Baby I'm teaking the easy way out 
And I know that you know what I'm talking about 
All these games that you play I can live without 
I'm takin' the easy way out 

Your misbehavin' is tto much to bear 
You got me thinking that you just don't care 
All of your lyin's so hard to believe 
(Lyin' Lyin') 
Why do you do these things to me. 

[Chorus] 

Startin' Tonight it's gonna be much better 
It's gonna feel good to get you off my mind 

[Chorus]

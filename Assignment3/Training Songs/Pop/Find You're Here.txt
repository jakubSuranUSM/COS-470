When I wake up I find you're here
I should feel joy
But I am not even near
I don't know where you've been tonight
I guess you've been with someone else
But I don't care if I'm right
I do not feel no jealousy
If I would lose you now
I'd simply say it's destiny, destiny, destiny...

I find you're here
You're moving on
You're just doing what you want
And I can't find it wrong
I know for sure you would be gone
You wouldn't stay with me
If something better comes along
I do not feel anxiety
I wouldn't be alone for long
It's destiny, destiny, destiny, destiny...

When I wake up I find you're here
I should feel joy
But I am not even near
I don't know where you've been tonight
If I would lose you now
I'd simply say it's destiny

I can not blame you for a thing
If I would have the chance
I'd do the same to you
Destiny, destiny, destiny...

When I wake up I find you're here
I should feel joy
But I am not even near
I don't know where you've been tonight
I guess you've been with someone else
But I don't care if I'm right
I do not feel no jealousy
If I would lose you now
I'd simply say it's destiny, destiny, destiny...
I find you're here
You're moving on
You're just doing what you want
And I can't find it wrong
I do not feel anxiety
I would not be alone for long it's destiny...

Took your car and drove to Texas
Sorry, honey
But I suspected we were through
And I can't cry anymore

Well, since I left, been feeling better
'Cause what's what you get when you
You stay together too long
And I can't cry anymore

Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere?
Well, so long to this life
So much for pretending
Bad luck's never ending
And now I know that
Money comes in, but the fact is
There's not enough to pay my taxes
And I, I can't cry anymore

Well, I got a brother, he's got real problems
Heroin, now there's just no stoppin' him, tonight
And I won't cry anymore

Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere?
Well, so long to this life
So much for pretending
'Cause bad luck's never ending

It's never ending
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Well

Well, it could be worse
I could've missed my calling
Sometimes it hurts, but
When you read the writing on the wall
You can't cry anymore

And wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere?
Well, so long to this life
So much for pretending
'Cause bad luck's never ending
And too much time I've been spending
With my heart in my hands
Waiting for time to come and mend it

I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore

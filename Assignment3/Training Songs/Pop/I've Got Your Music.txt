When I'm alone
In my phones
I feel love
In digital stereo
We're hand in glove
I can't lose you
I move with the music
The music moves with me

I can't let go
I can't let
I can't let go
I can't let go, go, go

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

On and on and on (keep on playing)
Give me one more song (Please I'm praying)
You can do no wrong (And I'm staying)
Deep in the world

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

When I'm alone
In my phones
I feel love
In digital stereo
We're hand in glove
I can't lose you
I move with the music
The music moves with me

I can't let go
I can't let
I can't let go
I can't let go, go, go

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

Everywhere I go
Round and round it goes inside my head
I'm deep in the world
And on the surface still you're gone

On and on and on
Give me one more song
You can do no wrong

Deep in the world

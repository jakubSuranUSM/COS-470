Young man gemini lots of sensitivity
Seeks the girl of his dreams sure that eternally
Far too long to wait for the perfect day
Far too long to wait for the perfect day
Young girl, 17, who knows what she could have been
Needs a flat urgently for her child, eternity's
Far too long to wait for the perfect day
Far too long to wait for the perfect day
Something I know, something I know
Please don't tell me something I know
I open my mouth, I try to speak
You come for a day and you stay for a week

Gentle businessman searching for his peter pan
Nice house by the park, wrestles with an aching heart
Far too long lo wait for the perfect day
Far too long to wait for the perfect day

Something I know, something I know
Please don't tell me something I know
I open my mouth I try to speak
You come for a day and stay for a week
Young mum stuck at home waiting by the telephone
Desperate needs a rest, knows that forever is
Far too long to wait for the perfect day
Far too long to wait for the perfect day

Something I know, something I know
Please don't tell me something I know
I open my mouth I try lo speak
You come for a day and stay for a week

Leave it to the businessmen to die young
You took me to heaven I bought you a creme brule
You gave the impression you had so much more to say
The pessimist inside me was amazed at what you do
I'd need major surgery to change my attitude
I don't know what you want
I'm a singer not a clairvoyant
I don't know what you need it's a mystery to me
Leave it to the businessmen (To die young)
To worry where our future's gone
Leave it to the businessmen (To die young)
To worry where our future's gone
To die young
You were always smiling I was sure it couldn't last
But you were so determined to prevent me seeing past
The carefree individual you presented the world
So how can I identify you undercover girl
I don 't know what you want
I'm a singer not a clairvoyant
I don't know what you need
It's a mystery to me (To die young)
Leave it to the businessmen (To die young)
To worry where our future's gone
To die young

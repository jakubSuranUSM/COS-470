Maybe it's the way you used to love me
Maybe it's the way I feel you now
I'm feeling like the sky is fallin' on me
And my life is tumbelling down

Maybe I'm lost in the moment
I don't wanna be found
Feel like I must save the moment

Maybe I'm a fool for lovin' you
Maybe you're right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe 'cause I don't know what to do
Won't somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn't matter anyway
It's just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

Maybe one day I win the lottery
Maybe I'll be poor all my life
And there so many possibilities
All I got to do is try, try, try

But I'm still lost in this feeling
Now I wanna be found
Can anyone stop me from falling

Maybe I'm a fool for lovin' you
Maybe you're right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe 'cause I don't know what to do
Won't somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn't matter anyway
It's just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

I won't be waiting I can't be waisting no more time
Cause I got dray the line sometime
No second guessing it's only messing with my life
I don't want it anymore no

Maybe I'm a fool for lovin' you
Maybe you're right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe 'cause I don't know what to do
Won't somebody please help me
Maybe I got something else to say
It really doesn't matter anyway
It's just a little word an empty call
No maybe means nothing and all

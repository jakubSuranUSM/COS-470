If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive somehow
Baby when you're gone

Holding you close to me
Always made me feel so right
Love is fantasy
Sometimes it can change your life 

Tell me what are you feeling?
Tell me you still care
But I can't help believing
You will not be there 

If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survive somehow
Baby when you're gone 

If you leave me now
Holding on to the mystery
I can fight somehow
I will carry on 

You held me in ecstasy
Then you let me slip away
The things that you said to me
Made me think you'd always stay 

But you can't fight the feeling
Every night and day
When it's over, it's over
There's nothing I can stay 

If you leave me now
Holding on to the memories
I'll survivie somehow
Baby when you're gone 

If you leave me now
Holding on to the mystery
I can fight somehow
I will carry on 

Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on

Want to tell me
What are you feeling
Tell me you still care
But I can't help believing
You will not be there

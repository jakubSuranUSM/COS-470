Heaven is here
Each night when I should be asleep
I put on my coat
And I walk the streets
I spend these hours
Escaping from my dreams
Afraid of what I might see
Fear has no beginning no end
So I spend all my time
With you on my mind
I see visions of you
All my dreams coming true
And I fall to my knees at your beauty
My hand over my heart
A heart that's filled with love
A love that can lift the soul
Divine worship forever Amen
There are times spent in despair
That you won't believe me
So many times I've tried to tell you
But my courage deceives me
You have my whole world under your heel
No words on this earth
Can convey the way I feel
Heaven is here
Where I once feared to be
And I fall to my knees
At your beauty
My hand over my heart
A heart that's filled with love
A love that can lift the soul
Divine worship
Forever Amen
I fall to my knees
I fall to my knees
You lift up my heart
You lift up my heart
Nothing so fine
Nothing so sure
As I'm gazing in awe
At your beauty
My hand over my heart
A heart that's filled with love
A love that can lift the soul
Divine worship forever Amen
And late each night
As I walk the streets
I pray for the day
I lay my heart at your feet
You lift up my heart
You lift up my heart
You lift up my heart
With your love

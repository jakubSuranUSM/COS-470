Feel the blood rushin' through my veins
Baby it's not because I'm ready to blow
Standin' still doesn't work for me
Takin' my shot
I've got places to go

Once you get just a little taste
And you feel the heat coming on strong
There's no way you're turning back
Oh I've got to keep moving on

Do or die, any day or night
My eyes stay on the prize
With the road underneath my feet
I'm learning how to fly

I can't slow down
I'm on the run, chasing down the dream
I won't slow down
I need some room, to roam, to breathe
And no matter how the world may change
It's the fire inside, a burning flame, no
I won't slow down
I can't slow down

Take a chance, time to make a change
Hit while it's hot, I got nothing to lose

Taking one day at a time
Want to see it all come true

Do or die, any day or night
My eyes stay on the prize
Keep the world underneath my feet
I'm learning how to fly

I can't slow down
I'm on the run, chasing down the dream
I won't slow down
I need some room, to roam, to breathe
And no matter how the world may change
It's the fire inside, a burning flame, no
I won't slow down
I can't slow down

Woah

Yeah

I can't slow down
I'm on the run, chasing down the dream
I won't slow down
I need some room, to roam, to breathe
And no matter how the world may change
It's the fire inside, like a burning flame
I won't slow down
I can't slow down,
I can't slow down

I will survive, whatever they will do
I break the golden rules, I will survive

I'm alone on highway 9
The sun was hot, killing my time, oh no
Baby I'll never let you go, oh no no no

Hundred light years, you're away
Tell me your dreams, make my day, oh no
Baby I'll never let you go, oh no no no

I will survive
Whatever they will do
I break the golden rules for you
'cause I'll be never living without your love
I will survive
The wind will fly me home
I'll never baby be alone
'cause I'll be never living without your love

Oh, 90 miles, endless of fears
Loneliness and thousand tears, oh no
Baby I'll never let you go, oh no no no
I was the black sheep of my family
A dreamer lost his destiny, oh no
Oh baby, I'll never let you go, oh no no no

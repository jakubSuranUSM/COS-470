Ain't gonna lie
That's one thing
You and I could never see
So as we kiss goodbye
If I cry don't let these
Tears I shed today
Hold you back in any way
He's waiting for your smile so hurry
I'll be fine now don't you worry
Ain't gonna lie
If you say he's the guy
I won't stand in your way
Though it hurts me today
I'll get by
And I ain't gonna lie
Ain't gonna lie
Baby don't cry
Though my heart is breaking
I'm glad that you
Told the truth
Instead of some
Pack of lies
To us a lie's the only sin
At least we'll end the way we've been
By being truthful to each other
Girl I hope I find another
Ain't gonna lie
I'll be out by and by
Maybe I'll never meet
Anyone half as sweet
But I'll try
And I ain't gonna lie

To us a lie's the only sin
At least we'll end the way we've been
By being truthful to each other
Girl I hope I find another
Ain't gonna lie
I'll be out by and by
Maybe I'll never meet
Anyone half as sweet
But I'll try
And I ain't gonna lie
I ain't gonna lie
No I ain't gonna lie

Oh god its another night
And your head is feeling
Like a lump of lead
You should never have drunk
Those party-fours
You should of been home being good instead

Ever been in a deja vue 
and the end is the same again 
You ran out of your silver thins 
And you're trying to be so high class 
Though you need a bath and your hair's looking like string 
And though you're nearly broke you end up paying for all the drinks 
And you tell them 'Oh its nothing 
There's a million where those come from' 
And then you whisper to your longest-suffering friend 
'Please lend me a few quid'

Oh god it's another day
And your stomach's feeling
Like a blown-up balloon
You should never have eaten that greasy food
The doctor told you that chile was bad for your blood

And you're standing at the chemist in Boots 
Coughing up your guts like you're at deaths door 
All this for a packet of Do-Do's 
And the assistant gives you a wink and you turn bright red 
It's at time like this that you wish you were dead 
And you take the whole packet and you feel like you've drunk 
A bottle of bleach 
And you tell yourself 'Never, never again 
Well, not until next week anyway' 
And you were never one for holding drink 
And you stagger off to the toilet 
And you throw up like it was Christmas 
And you miss the bowl and you hit your shoes 
And there's no paper towels 
Now what else can go wrong for you 
It's a choice between a cab fare home 
And a packet of cigarettes 
So you choose and the money sticks 
In the machine and the manager says 
'Tough shit drink up and leave'

Oh god it's another disease
And you just got rid of the last
You were beginning to feel OK
And the friends you gave it to
Were speaking to you again.

And you find yourself having sex 
In the back of a car 
And the girl underneath 
Doesn't care who you are 
And you're nearly there 
And she still doesn't care 
And her chewing gum 
Is getting stuck in your hair 
And there's something wrong 
Something that you forgot 
Oh Shit, you've forgotten the rubber 
And you don't want a kid 
Well, deny it was you 
If your dad finds out 
Then he'll make you stay in 
And do your homework 
And cut your hair 
And wear your school uniform 
Out in the street 
Oh what a fate worse than death 
Oh well he can't hit you 
You can hit him back 
And play your records so loud 
All the ones that he especially hates 
Deep Purple in Rock, Led Zeppelin II 
Well even you hate those 
Well on second thoughts 
I think I'll leave home 
And go and live in America 
Because they earn more money there 
And they can get away with murder
Yeah!

Oh this is a Mugs game
I can't wait until I'm twenty one
And I can tell them all to sod off.

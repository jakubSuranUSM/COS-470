[Chorus]
I've been daisy petal pickin'
To see if she loves me
Well I've been daisy petal pickin'
To see what our future's gonna be

Her lips are I want to tell ya
Her eyes like a candle's glow
Although I think that she loves me
She never really ever let's me know
So

[Chorus]

One little petal from the daisy
Says that she loves me
The next one says she loves me not
So what am I gonna believe
Well

[Chorus]

We go riding every Sunday
Right by the daisy hill
I wonder if she loves me
Or if she loves me not
Maybe the daisies will tell
So

[Chorus]

I've been daisy petal pickin'
Yeah daisy petal pickin'
She loves me she loves me not
She loves me she loves me not
Still pickin' daisies

I've been looking all around the world
To see what I could find
Just a lot of broken promises
And people left behind
Oh and the - pain of being lonely
Is what everybody fears
Yeah, it took a lot of time for me to realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go
But now I know
It's here

You can spend your life competing
In a world that talks too loud
You can lose your own direction
Getting lost among the crowd
Confusion - is it any wonder
That the road ahead's not clear
Well you can try too hard to find it
Now I realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go

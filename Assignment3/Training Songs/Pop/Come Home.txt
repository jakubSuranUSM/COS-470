As I write my letter today
Tears start fallin' from my eyes
I remember things we used to say
And the ties that bind our love

Only one thing I want to do
Come home (whoa yeah)
Come home
Long as I know I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home

Please remember while I'm away
I think of you night and day
Of the things, of the fun
While we were one

Only one thing I want to do
Come home, come home
Long as I know I'm comin' home to you

I didn't think I'd ever be, whoa whoa
As bad as it's been, no-no-no
But now I'm comin' home
To give you a ring

As I write my letter today
Tears start fallin' from my eyes
I remember things we used to say
And the ties that bind our love

Only one thing I want to do
Come home (whoa whoa yeah)
Come home
Long as I know I'm comin' home to you

Only one thing I want to do
Come home (whoa whoa)
Come home
Long as I know I'm comin' home to you

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter

And you, it doesn't matter what you do
And hey, it doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are invisible to the world
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you, it doesn't matter what you do
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

Whatever happened to dreams of old
Where do you start
When there's nowhere to go
Caught in the middle without a choice
You're dying to speak but you have no voice

'Cause you are a creature without a name
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you are a player without a game
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

And you, it doesn't matter what you do
And hey, it doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are invisible to the world
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you, it doesn't matter what you do
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

Nobody's asking for your advice
You don't know the truth so how could you lie
How does it feel to be a background song
You're never right and you're never wrong

'Cause you are leader without a goal
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you are preacher without a soul
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

And you, it doesn't matter what you do
And hey, it doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are invisible to the world
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you, it doesn't matter what you do
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

Whatever happened to dreams of old
Where do you start
When there's nowhere to go
Caught in the middle without a choice
You're dying to speak but you have no voice

And you, it doesn't matter what you do
And hey, it doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are invisible to the world
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you, it doesn't matter what you do
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

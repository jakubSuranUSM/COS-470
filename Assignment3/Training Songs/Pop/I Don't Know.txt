In my soul , In my soul...
I am not a baby anymore
I am not a same sin as before
I see it in the mirror , in my room
And I can feel it stronger in my soul
But I don't know if its the right day, for this words
Now I say things I didn't say before 
I need an explanation, tell me more 
Why am I alone now? I don't know 

How can I live forever? I don't know 
Where can I find Heaven? I don't know
What is going to happen? I don't know 
Why am I alone now? I don't know

I don't know x2 
In my soul, in my soul...

I live it for my darling, and I will 
That am I leaving problems down our feet
I want to live my feelings day by day
I like to give emotions, in my way
But I don't know if its the right day, for this words
Now I say things I didn't say before
I need an explanation, tell me more 
Why am I alone now? I don't know 

How can I live forever? I don't know 
Where can I find Heaven? I don't know
What is going to happen? I don't know 
Why am I alone now? I don't know

In my soul, in my soul...

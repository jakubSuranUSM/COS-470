A sky isn't always blue
A sun doesn't always shine
It's alright to fall apart sometimes
I am not always you
And you are not always mine
It's alright to fall apart sometimes
After all is said and done
One and one still is one
When we cry, when we laugh
I am half, you are half
A heart isn't always true
And I am not always fine
We all have an angry heart sometimes
After all is said and done
One and one still is one
When we cry, when we laugh
I am half, you are half
Look how far we have come
One and one still is...
One moon, one star
I love the one we are
One thread, one line
Let's stand still in time
One moon, one star
I love the one we are
One thread, one line
That runs through our lives
After all is said and done
One and one still is one
When we cry, when we laugh
I am half, you are half
Look how far we have come
One and one still is one
Still is one, still is one

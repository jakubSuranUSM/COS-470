Don't loose my number
My heart is bleeding
Like storm and thunder
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

Don't cross the river
If there's a fire
Can you be sure girl
There's no desire

I'm not over you
I'm not over you

Was it a dream
Or was it real

Was it a joke
A fantasy

Don't think about me when you break my heart
Don't think about me if you break your part
Don't think about me if you hold his hand
Don't think about me
I'll understand

Don't think about me when you try to go
Don't think about me and the time will show
Don't think about me after all these years
Don't think about me and all my tears
Don't think about me

It's not the way girl

The story's ending
It's not the words girl
You were pretending
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

Don't send me rainbows

I need emotions
Looks like a heartake
And deep devotion
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

Was is a dream
Or was it real

Was it a joke
A fantasy

Don't think about me when you break my heart
Don't think about me if you break your part

Don't think about me if you hold his hand
Don't think about me
I'll understand

Don't think about me when you try to go
Don't think about me and the time will show
Don't think about me after all these years
Don't think about me and all my tears

Was it a dream
Or was it real

Was it a joke
A fantasy

Don't think about me when you break my heart
Don't think about me if you break your part
Don't think about me if you hold his hand

Don't think about me
I'll understand

Don't think about me when you try to go
Don't think about me and the time will show
Don't think about me after all these years
Don't think about me and all my tears
Don't think about me

Don't think about me

(Full Force)

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says, I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very, very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

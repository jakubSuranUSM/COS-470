When I was young I found
Imagine what I saw
Secret underground
Changed the way I see
Lost the child inside
He ran away from me

I’ve been reaching all out darling
And I can’t operate now
Someone for my love
To turn up and change

Oh let’s go running away
We can always be together
Oh let’s go running away
We can last forever
Oh let’s go meet up again
Just like the ice on the dune
Oh let’s go running away
Go run away

I know a hidden town
High above the clouds
A special place to be
Where there is humidity

I’ve been reaching all out for something
Make a home there forever
Someone for my love
To turn up and change

Oh let’s go running away
We can always be together
Oh let’s go running away
We can last forever
Oh let’s go meet up again
Just like the ice on the dune
Oh let’s go running away
Go run away

Run away run away run away
Oh we can run away
Run away run away run away
Oh we can run away

Run away run away run away
Oh we can run away
Run away run away run away
Oh we can run away

Oh let’s go running away
We can always be together
Oh let’s go running away
We can last forever
Oh let’s go meet up again
Just like the ice on the dune
Oh let’s go running away
Go run away

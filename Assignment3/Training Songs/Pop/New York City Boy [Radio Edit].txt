When you're a boy
some days are tough
lying on your bed
playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
you gotta escape
Wanna go and wander
in the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
into New York City

New York City boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing
the hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
at the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get that mix
it's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

New York City Boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York City boy
This is your reward day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

Then when the evening falls
you can return its calls

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
into New York City

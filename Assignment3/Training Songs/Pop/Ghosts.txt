When the room is quiet 
The daylight almost gone 
It seems there's something I should know 
Well I ought to leave but the rain it never stops 
And I've no particular place to go 

Just when I think I'm winning 
When I've broken every door 
The ghosts of my life blow wilder than before 
Just when I thought I could not be stopped 
When my chance came to be king 
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind 

Well I'm feeling nervous 
Now I find myself alone 
The simple life's no longer there 
Once I was so sure 
Now the doubt inside my mind 
Comes and goes but leads nowhere 

Just when I think I'm winning 
When I've broken every door 
The ghosts of my life blow wilder than before 
Just when I thought I could not be stopped 
When my chance came to be king 
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind

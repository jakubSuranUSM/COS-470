You're rattling my world like an earthquake
I am up in the clouds like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Somebody bring me down again 
I am trying to keep you real where it feels faith 
But I don't know how to do ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
I am losing solid ground again

[Chorus]
Don't pitch me, I am falling in love
And if I am dreaming this
Baby then don't wake me up
You got me hoping and wishing
That this could last for one more night
Baby you and me
We can take it to the middle of the dance floor 
And I got what you need
Tell the DJ keep it spinning on the dance floor
And let's go higher (let's go higher)
Let's go high
Let's go higher (let's go higher)
Let's go high

You could set it off if you want it
All you gotta do is ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Your body is calling me, yeah
And I don't want to have any regrets
When I am next to you it's like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Your touch is all I need, oh yeah

[Chorus]

Let the roller-coaster take me up and let me fall
Just as long as you're by my side I'll go through it all

Baby you and me
We can take it to the middle of the dance floor 
And I got what you need
Tell the DJ keep it spinning on the dance floor
And let's go higher (let's go higher)
Let's go high
Let's go higher (let's go higher)
Let's go high

[Repeat: x4]
Get higher for love

When we first met you said it's complicated take it slow
Deeper then water goes the more you wanna dip your toe
I couldn't get enough I wanted you right there and then
Ignoring all the signs I thought that you and I were cool
Said I was beautiful you put me on a pedestal
I would do anything to get back to those days again

Don't know what's wrong
Want to stay
In your arms

If two people can have it all
Live the dream and break the rules
Tell me, why not us?
If to people can fall in love
Destiny should be enough
So tell me, why not us?

If this ain't right what are we fighting for?
Like two worlds at war
What the heart beats for is love
Turns anything to dust, oh

We're out for dinner and I notice you don't look my way
Remember when you used to hang on every word I say
And compliment me on a dress I would choose to wear

Don't know what's wrong
Want to stay
In your arms

If two people can have it all
Live the dream and break the rules
Tell me, why not us?
If to people can fall in love
Destiny should be enough
So tell me, why not us?

If two people can have it all
Live the dream and break the rules
Tell me, why not us?
If to people can fall in love
Destiny should be enough
So tell me, why not us?

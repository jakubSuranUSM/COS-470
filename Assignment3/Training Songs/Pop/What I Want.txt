Yesterday we did it again
We did what weÂ´re supposed to
What is expected of
This constellation of two

Oh- itÂ´s what I want
ItÂ´s what I want
ItÂ´s what I like
ItÂ´s what I like

DonÂ´t let anybody tell you different
DonÂ´t let them know
Oh, itÂ´s what I want
ItÂ´s what I want

You say that filling me
Is whatÂ´s filling you
DonÂ´t tell them what
What fills you more

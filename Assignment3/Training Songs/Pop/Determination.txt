Girl the last time I saw you, you were crying my name
When I put you on the spot,
Will you still feel the same

Show me some determination
Show me the measure of your dedication
I need to see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me

I'm looking for someone,
Someone strong enough to believe in
Everybody's looking for someone
Strong enough to stand on his feet
And never break down

I'll put my life on the line and believe what you say
I'll go out on a limb if you meet me halfway

I'm looking for someone
To show me what they mean by devotion
Everybody's looking for someone
Prepared to put aside his emotion
And never break down

You're a new wave raver and you like to talk tough
But can you still cut the mustard
When the going gets rough
I need a demonstration of your determination
Give me an indication of your determination

Three days in the rain and I ain't had no sleep
But I won't break down now, I got a promise to keep
Showing my determination
'cause that's the way I am

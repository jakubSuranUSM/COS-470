She fired the spoon and she looked around her tiny bedroom
And knew that she was doomed
Daisy shot up her savings and traded on the glow
And waited for it to go crazy

Needle mythology is a death trap for you, girl
Why make your drug of choice
Your goodbye to the world?
The astro strings like silken wings

Take you away from everything
You loved about the way you were
The baby doll with daisy hair
And nothing in your way

You're just like Jesus, you die and rise again
Getting high and then scoring
A world betrayed by your hurry to the grave
You know you can't be saved and I'm so sorry

You spread your dreams underneath my feet
For I once bought you sweets
And all the junk that you once did for fun
Has now unhappily been done, now you can't run

I know one thing
That the truth in her eyes
Makes me love her
Sticks could break her little fine bones
But words could never harm her

She is crazy, she is crazy
You can't hurt her
You can't break her

I see the skies through her eyes
And the sun shines trough her smile
Sticks and stones could break her bones
But words could never harm her

She is crazy, she is crazy
You can't hurt her
You can't break her

She is crazy, she is crazy
You can't hurt her
You can't break her

The roses are crying
The roses are crying

I miss her more than words can express
Her lonely dances like the waterfalls

She is crazy, she is crazy
You can't hurt her
You can't break her

She is crazy, she is crazy
You can't hurt her
You can't break her
You can't break her

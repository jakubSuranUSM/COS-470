We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

Mean man, promised land
Nothing but a devil's hand
Trying to keep saying I feel okay
Telling myself this now for days

Mean man, machine man
I've been nothing but a puppets hand
But nothing ever comes
Without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
La la, love you

Been wondering, I take a chance
That chance is circumstance
'Cause nothing ever comes without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

Yeah, I've figured it out, I've seen the unknown
Like a shot in the dark, I'll carry you home
Ask a wise man, he'll say what's been done
All the roads in this world
Were made by the young, by the young

Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you (Welcome to your)

(Welcome to your)
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah
Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, oh yeah

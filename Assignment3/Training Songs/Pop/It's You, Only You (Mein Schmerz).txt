Let's say goodbye to our friends of the night (ni, ni, ni)
There's nothing for us here
Always been longing for a moment like this (oh, oh, oh)
Don't want to waste it here
Isn't it strange how sure you can be when you find the one you want
Isn't it strange how crazy you go when you finally won the one that you want
A moment like this (oh, oh, oh)
Maybe baby, we can make it

Chorus:
It's You, It's You, Only You
Well, I know what I want and I'm sure I can get it
But It's You, It's You, Only You
Well, I know what I want and I'm sure I can get it

I'm loosing my heart for you
And I'm prepared to lose my life
Ermmmm, Mein Schmertz
Maybe, we can make it
Maybe, maybe, we can make it

Chorus

It's You, It's You, Only You
It's You, It's You, Only You
But It's You, It's You, Only You
Well, I know what I want and I'm sure I can get it
It's You, It's You Mein Schmertz
fading...

Hey...
You always seem to catch me when I'm lying
About the stupidest of things
OK...
Stand there while I stab you in the back
With the words I never never ever should have taken this so far

[Chorus: x2]
Go ahead and buy yourself a drink
Cause you know you're deserving of it
Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep
And think how you hate me so bad

[x4]
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

I could write about a thousand songs to impress you
But I wouldn't want to do that
I could make you feel the queen of the world but I won't
Cause you're full of imperfections
This is coming from a third perspective
All I'm saying is you need to be selective
This is coming from a gentleman
With your needs in mind, I've got his on the side.
(Oh)

[Chorus: x2]

[x4]
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Go ahead and buy yourself a drink
Cause you know you're deserving of it
Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh, I'll never fall in love again
If this is how it feels
If there was something on your mind
You should have said

And did you think I'd lose control?
Was it a wish that you made?
A bitter potion, hard to swallow
You're acting strange

It fills my heart and soul with dread
There's nothing that I can do
I've got that feeling you have gone
And where's the symbol of love?

With your love running deep
Where is the love I can keep?
You blew a hole through my heart
Bruising me right from the start

They say still waters they run deep
Now I'm clinging to the shore
Is there some hope that I can keep?
Will I see you walk through my door?

I got that feeling you would go
Like summer, winter and fall
And there's a side to us that's great
But I find out too late

Will I ever fill the void
The havoc that you left behind?
And will time blur the lines
Heal all the wounds left inside?

Wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside

It tears my heart and soul in two
There's nothing left I can do
I've got that feeling you have gone
And where's the symbol of love?

You blew a hole through my heart
That's crushing me right from the start
With your love running deep
Where is the love I can keep?

Whisper some, better song
Know that you're doing me wrong
Know that you're doing me wrong
Know that you're doing me wrong

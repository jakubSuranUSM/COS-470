She's his yellow brick road
Leading him on
And letting him go as far
as she lets him go
Going down to nowhere

She puts on her make-up
The same way she did yesterday
Hoping everything's the same
But everything has changed

In my mind
Everything we did was right
Open your eyes, I'll still be by your side
How could I ever have been so blind?
You give me something to sleep to
at night

He wakes up to the sound
So scared that she's leaving
He wishes she were still
asleep next to him
Hoping she will change

In my mind
Everything we did was right
Open your eyes, I'll still be by your side
How could I ever have been so blind?
You give me something to sleep to
at night

You give me something to sleep to
And all I know is
You give me something to dream to when I'm all alone and blue
Don't leave me now [Repeats]

In my mind
Everything we did was right
Open your eyes, I'll still be by your side
How could I ever have been so blind?
You give me something to sleep to
Something to sleep to
Something to sleep to at night

It rains for days
So you stay inside and lock your door
Cryin' all the time
Crying for, you don't know what for

You say, you're undone by his kiss
But don't you think
That for once in your life
It should be like this

Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue

I'm keepin' you right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here

Climb aboard my pony
Now, you've been thrown
Get back in the saddle
And let it be known

That you're made of steel
But don't you think that
For once in your life
He should be made to feel

Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue

I'm keepin' you right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here

I know you're thirty two
But you look fifty five
You walk around
With your eyes wide open
But you're barely alive

You say, you've lost your touch
But don't you think
That for once in your life
He could walk without a crutch

Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue

I'm keepin' you right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here

Right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here

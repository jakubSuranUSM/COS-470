Who you think you're playing?
Why you look at me like I'm an alien?
Deep down you know that we could have been
Good together
In your eyes, you're hiding
I can tell by your smile that you're lying
Deep down you know
We could have been good together, good together

My God, you're smooth, the way you move
On a Hudson riverbed, on a Hudson cruise
Coco Chanel, you said, it's mademoiselle
It's like a fatal attraction, one last farewell

Can we have the soup and caviar?
Send it to the room, fill the minibar
Can we feel good one last time?
Can we make love one last time?
Lately, you have been pushing me away
I just made you come, can I make you stay?
Can you say it to my face this time?
I just wanna hear the truth this time

Who you think you're playing?
Why you look at me like I'm an alien?
Deep down you know that we could have been
Good together (good together)
In your eyes, you're hiding
I can tell by your smile that you're lying
Deep down you know that we might have been
Good together (good together)
I don't need to see that you care
I just felt like we were halfway there
Deep down you know
We could have been good together, good together

A question mark glowing in the dark
All that we built is breaking down, falling apart
Comme des gar√ßons, you feel the need to run
I'ma move, I'ma let it go, but before we're done

Can we have the soup and caviar?
Send it to the room, fill the minibar
Can we feel good one last time?
Can we make love one last time?
Lately, you have been pushing me away
I just made you come, can I make you stay?
Can you say it to my face this time?
I just wanna hear the truth this time

Who you think you're playing?
Why you look at me like I'm an alien?
Deep down you know that we could have been
Good together (good together)
In your eyes, you're hiding
I can tell by your smile that you're lying (you're lying)
Deep down you know that we might have been
Good together (good together)
I don't need to see that you care
I just felt like we were halfway there
Deep down you know
We could have been good together, good together

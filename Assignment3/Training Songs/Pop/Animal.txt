Make the most of opportunity, nothings free, nothings free
And don't believe everything that you see
It may not be quite what you believed

Oh I know everything that I do tonight
Means nothing if I don't succeed

My highlight desire while ecstasy
Filling me
Let intentions out so openly
It's not crazy, just chemistry

Oh I know everything that I do tonight
Means nothing if I don't succeed
I'm insufferable when I'm in heat
It's my animal, animal.
I'm insufferable when I'm in heat
It's my animal, animal

Animal Instinct

Make the most of opportunity, nothings free, nothings free
And don't believe everything that you see
It may not be quite what you believed

Oh I know everything that I do tonight
Means nothing if I don't succeed
I'm insufferable when I'm in heat
It's my animal, animal.
I'm insufferable when I'm in heat
It's my animal, animal

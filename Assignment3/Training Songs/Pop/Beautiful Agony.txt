I felt something snap
Looked up and you were gone
Clean through the gap somewhere
That I can’t get to, yeah
Love vandalizing me, yeah
With beautiful agony

Batten hatches
Full survival mode
A word that
Catches in my throat
Short pause
And then the full force
Knocks me sideways, yeah

Love vandalizing me, yeah
With beautiful agony, yeah
Love vandalizing me

Once upon a time
It wasn’t like this
Love was mine
So what the hell
Is after happening here
I’m stepping out
Into the roar
Trying to hear that voice

Saying hey
Don’t worry
It’s alright
Don’t worry
Ah now Dave
Don’t worry

Yeah love vandalizing me, yeah
With beautiful agony, yeah
Love vandalizing me, yeah
Love vandalizing me, yeah
With beautiful agony, yeah
Love vandalizing me, yeah
With beautiful agony, yeah

Read somewhere
In Neptune’s
Methane skies
It might be
Raining diamonds

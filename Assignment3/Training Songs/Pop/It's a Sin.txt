When I look back upon my life 
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
At school they taught me how be be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed.
For everything I long to do 
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Ever place I've ever been
Every where I'm going to
It's a sin
 
So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do 
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Ever place I've ever been
Every where I'm going to
It's a sin
 
Father forgive me 
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
What ever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father you fought me
'Cause I didn't care 
and I still don't understand
 
For everything I long to do 
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Ever place I've ever been
Every where I'm going to
It's a sin It's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a It's a sin

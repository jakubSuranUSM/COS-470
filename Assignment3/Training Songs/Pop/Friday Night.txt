Sleeping through the day 'cause I work all night
Get out the way things are coming alive
Look over there, another fight
I guess I should've seen the warning signs

We could be together
(I'm not looking for a fight)
Change the world forever
(Just wanna make it through the night)
Make it all together
(They're really giving me the...)
Eye-ey-eye-ey-eye-ey-eye

Think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
Think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it

I think I'm gonna loose it

The walls are growing ears
I'm paranoid
No need to fear what you can't avoid
Don't let 'em in, don't let 'em out
I'll give you something you can scream about

We could be together
(I'm not looking for a fight)
Change the world forever
(Just wanna make it through the night)
Make it all together
(They're really giving me the...)
Eye-ey-eye-ey-eye-ey-eye

Think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
Think I'm gonna loose it
Think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
Think I'm gonna loose it

No, no, no nothing's wrong with dreaming
Go, go, go you're dreaming all away
One love, one life, and that's enough to get you through the night
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hey, hey, hey!

I think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it
I think I'm gonna loose it, loose it, loose it

We could be together
Change the world forever
Make it all together
(They're really giving me the)
Eye

No, no, no nothing's wrong with dreaming
Go, go, go you're dreaming all away
One love, one life, and that's enough to get you through the night
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hey, hey, hey!

They come alive when I work the nights
I guess I should've seen the warning signs

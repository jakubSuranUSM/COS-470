Midnight’s crazy when you’re down
Plant your tears in the ground
Dream plantations slowly grow
Until they cover your sorrow

(Silver city knows) It’s hard to love
(Silver city tears) Living here
(Silver city knows) It’s hard to love
(Silver city tears) Living here

That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me

Walk for years, desert man
Footprints swallowed in the sand
Makes me dizzy this city of mine
Jagged teeth, made of glass, rising up and meet me in the sky

(Silver city knows) It’s hard to love
(Silver city tears) Living here
(Silver city knows) It’s hard to love
(Silver city tears) Living here

That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me
That don’t stop me

I don’t remember this place at all
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
I don’t remember this place at all
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else
Just that I’m dreaming of somewhere else

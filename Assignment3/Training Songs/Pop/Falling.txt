I  think about winter when I was with her
And the snow was fallin down
Warmed by the fire I love bein by her
When there's no one else around

And I'm fallin' woah, I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' in love with you

I think about summer my head was swimmin
You wrote my name in the sand
We walked together hopin forever
Please don't let go of my hand

Cause I'm fallin', woah, I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' in love with you

The fall and the springtime were like in between time
You're here and then you're gone away
Woah I just wanted to say
Won't you please, please stay
Cause I'm fallin', woah, I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' in love with you

In love with you
In love with you

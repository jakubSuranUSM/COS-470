How about a cup of coffee
Me and you, we can meet at the cafe
Parler while sippin cappuccinos
If that ain't you, we can go hit a movie
Here I am all jittery and nervous
Got me feelin that I'm really not good at this
In your mind I know your thinkin what I'm up to
All I want to do is try to get to know you

I can be the one
You know the one you don't know your lookin for
We can be the spark
To start a fire that the worlds been waitin for

The greatest love song started with a note
And the mona lisa started with a stroke
Maybe me and you could be one of those
The greatest idea started with a thought
If I think hard enough I can win your heart

what's up with you, can you tell me what you're thinkin

Take a breath, do you come here often
You say you do, and tomorrow is the weekend
Do you bowl or are you up for rollerblading
Take my number, hit me up on my cell phone
Maybe later we can finish converstatin
Yeah

I can be the one
You know the one you don't know your lookin for
We can be the spark
To start a fire that the worlds been waitin for

The greatest love affair started with hello
The greatest love song started with a note
And the mona lisa started with a stroke
Maybe me and you could be one of those
The greatest idea started with a thought
If I think hard enough I can win your heart
Cause the greatest love stor

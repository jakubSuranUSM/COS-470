Four o'clock, I've been walkin' all night
It's the time I always think of you
If you could only see through my eyes
Then you'd know just what I'm going through

Here am I, I'm taking a chance
In running around with stars in my eyes
Here am I, I'm looking for you
Wondering why do I feel so blue

I'm dreamin', dreamin' of me and you, oh
I'm dreamin', dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life

Yeah, dream you right into my life
(Dreamin', dreamin' will see me through)
Woman, you'd better believe that I'm
(Dreamin' you into my life)

Five o'clock, still walking around
I call you up but you just bring me down
I guess you'd say I'm getting nowhere
But in my dreams you always come around

Here am I, I'm taking a chance
I'm walking on air, flying so high
Here am I, I'm facing the truth
There's no other way I'll ever make you mine

I'm dreamin', dreamin' of me and you, oh
I'm dreamin', dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life

Yeah, dream you right into my life
(Dreamin', dreamin' will see me through)
Woman, you better believe that I'll be
(Dreamin' you into my life)

Woman, you've got to believe me, woman
Oh woman, you've got to believe me woman I'll be
(Dreamin' you into my life)

You've got to believe me, woman
Woman, oh woman, you've got to believe me, I'll be forever
(Dreamin' you into my life)

Hey, I wanna live in a leaderless world
I wonder what that is
Who makes the rules in a leaderless world?
I wonder what happens
Without cool kids and presidents
And dark aids, first elephants, ooh
I wanna work in a classless world
I wonder what that's like
And would I work in a classless world?
Or would I just get high?
Without rich kids, and immigrants
And big dreams of better things, ooh

Let's raise a glass
And have a toast to all our differences (ay)
You carry me on your shoulders
When I don't know what my limit is
(Ya, ya, ya, ya) I wonder where my limit lies, my limit lies

Huh, woke up and I'ma feels like
What it means to be loved in real life
Well go inspire high to achieve heights
Toast to those that chose the road we drive
And if you in the dark here's a street light
How the moon shine bright if you realize
How my mood get right when the weed light
How you soon cannot fight rights off a beat might
I love it if a beat hate
But overeat, I'm reciting every detail
Package it, push it
Send it out to retail
But this one of a kind style, can't resell
Daughter on the way, soon hear your cries
It's gonna be a wonder when I see your eyes
And I wonder where my limit lies
My limit flies, oh, I'm living life

Let's raise a glass
And have a toast to all our differences (ay)
You carry me on your shoulders
When I don't know what my limit is
(Ya, ya, ya, ya) I wonder where my limit lies, my limit lies

It's nice to be here
Darling, geezers and se√±oritas
Now please catch a breather
You see back in the day I used to do eaters
'Round Gingersmith Avenue, hanging out with hyenas
Oh and then it connected you with bereavement
I know now I'm still have to fight off the demons
I strum the guitar to stop the daydreaming
I strum the guitar and toast to achievement
I speak to my mate Taylor now about business
And now my mind's clear because I ain't got no mistress
As if I went around the big fat skunks
If that blows out my brain up and turns my lung inconsistent
I hope I can give hope to the lads that live that life
And have to spend time in their reason
We gonna do what we like in an instant
My name's Hak Baker, thank you for listening
Yeah, yeah

Let's raise a glass
And have a toast to all our differences (ay)
You carry me on your shoulders
When I don't know what my limit is (ay)
(Ya, ya, ya, ya) I wonder where my limit lies, my limit lies
(Ya, ya, ya, ya) these mayday boys are living lies
They're living lies (hey, hey, hey)

The wind was howling outside my door
The rain was pouring, can't take no more
Came out of nowhere, out of the night
So cold and nasty, it was so right

It had to be so easy
Been down that road before, yeah
Down and dirty, baby, she's down and dirty
Listen

My heart was pounding, head in a spin
Spellbound and wicked for in a sin
I had no warning about her kind
It did not matter, babe, she did not mind

How could it be so easy
I did not see her lies
Down and dirty, baby, she's down and dirty

She'll take your money, down and dirty
She'll steal your heart away
She'll show no mercy, down and dirty
Too bad I had to stay
Oh no no, no

How could it be so easy
I did not see her lies
Down and dirty, baby, she's down and dirty, yeah

She'll take your money, down and dirty
She'll steal your heart, oh yeah
She'll show no mercy, baby (Down and dirty)
Too bad I had to stay

She'll take your money, down and dirty
She'll steal your heart away, yeah
She'll show no mercy, baby (Down and dirty)
Too bad I had to stay
Yeah

Down and dirty, yeah
Got to be so blind
Ooh, hey yeah

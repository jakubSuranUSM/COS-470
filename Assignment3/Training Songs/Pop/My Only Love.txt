Do i ever wonder?
More than words can say
Heaven knows it´s hard enough to pray
Let me tell you something
There's a change in me
Even now you're gone you'll always be
My only love
Does it seem so funny
For a fool to cry?
Do you know the meaning of goodbye?
There´s a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you need to know remember me
My only love
Let me tell you something
More than words can say
But they're all i have, no other way
There´s a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you find you're there remember me
My only love

Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yeah
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Ooh, be careful of 'em in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Can't you hear me now
Can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight
Ooh, on a downtown train
Every night it's just the same
You leave me lonely, now

I know your window; I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
And they all catch heart attacks
They stay at the carnival, Baby
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight
Baby, on a downtown train
Every night, every night, is just the same
You leave me lonely, now
Will I see you tonight
Ooh, on a downtown train
All my dreams just fall like rain
All upon a downtown train

Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yeah
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
Can't you hear me now
Can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight
Baby, on a downtown train
Every night, every night, it's just the same
You leave me lonely, now

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All my dreams just fall like rain
All upon a downtown train
Oh wo-ooh

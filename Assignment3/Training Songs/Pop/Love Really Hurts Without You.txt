You're running around town. 
Like a fool and you think it is groovy. 
You're giving in to some other guy. 
Who gives you the eye. 
You don't give nothing to me. 

You painted a smile and you dress for awhile to excite me. 
But don't you know that you're turning me on. 
I know that it's wrong. 
But I can't stop the pain inside me.

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you!
And it's breaking my heart but what can I do. 
Baby, Love really hurts without you.

Love really hurts through and through. 
And it's breaking my heart. 
But what can I do without you?

You walk like a dream. 
And you make like a queen on the action. 
You're using every trick in the book. 
The way that you look. 

You're really something to see. 
You're cheating your life to impress any guy that you fancy.
But don't you know I'm out of my mind. 
So give me a sign. That helps to ease the pain inside me.

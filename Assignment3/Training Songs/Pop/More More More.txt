Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
More, more, more, more, more

Here am I with my desire
Feel it burning just for you
My, oh my, this love divine
Is talking me to somewhere new

Just slide
Get your body down, down, down
And glide
I gotta feel you all around

Boy, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
Keep it saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more

Here am I and deep desire
I got a little spot for you
Make me sigh with sheer delight
As baby, you caress and soothe

Just slide
I want to feel you down, down, down
And glide
You know, I need you all around

Oh, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
Keep it saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
Till I can't take no more

Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more

Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more

Just slide
Get your body down, down, down
And glide
I gotta feel you all around

Boy, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Come on, now, burn me up, burn me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
More, more, more, more

Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more

Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more

Come and give me more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more

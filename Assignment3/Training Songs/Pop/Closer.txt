I’m ready for love for the first time
Ready for love and I know I’m coming home
To the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel

I know that
There’s something inside
I’m falling into the skies
It’s taking me over now
I’m getting closer now

Oh I'm feeling closer now
Feels like gliding away
Don't like the sun, ?

I’m ready for love for the first time
Ready for love and I know I’m coming home
To the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel

I know that
There’s something inside
I’m falling into the skies
It’s taking me over now
I’m getting closer now

Oh I can feel it again
Ooh
It’s taking me over now

I’m ready for love
I’m ready for love for the first time
Take me away, take me away to the sun

I’m ready for love for the first time
Ready for love and I know I’m coming home
To the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel it

I know that
There’s something inside
I’m falling into the skies
It’s taking me over now
I’m getting closer now

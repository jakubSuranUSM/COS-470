No more games is about positivity
And positivity is not about being soft
It's about being smart
You sucker

Ain't It Funky

Yeah we're gonna send this one out
To all those non-believers out there
Who been tryin to put us down and keep us down
For the past five years
I'm gon tell you what
We ain't goin out like that
You think this is a love song
Wrong
The NKOTB is too strong

Games, games, games, games, games!

Somebody said somebody wouldn't last too long, somebody's still going strong.
Somebody said somebody was all a front, somebody's still talking junk.
Think of what you say, think of what you do,
Think of what you try to put us through.
We're just singing our song.
When you put us down, it ain't gonna get you nowhere.
We're positive and no matter what you think we really care.
Games! Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh, 
Games, games, games, games, games.

Somebody said somebody worked too hard, somebody gotta charm some hearts.
Somebody said everybody's gonna wait and see, what's gonna be is gonna be.
Think of what you say, think of what you do,
Think of what you try to put us through.
We're just singing our song
When you put us down, it ain't gonna get you nowhere.
We're positive and no matter what you think we really care.
Games, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Games, games, games, games, games.
Games, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Games, games, games, games, games
Games!
Think of what you say
Think of what you do
Think of what you're trying to put us through
We're just singing a song

When you put us down
It ain't gonna get you nowhere
We're positive
And no matter what you think we really care

Games
Ain't it funky
Games games games games games
Games
Games games games games games
Games

No more games boy
So what ya saying
Beat the beatness
Cos Donnie ain't playin'
Witness the quickness
As I kick this
I'm on a mission
So listen as I dismiss
All this negativity by takin' a stand
Cos we're five bad brothers from the bean town land
No sell out
So get the hell out
We do it our way
Who gives a damn about what critics say
Said we wouldn't last
Said our time will pass
In just a flash
But we're still kicking ass
The DONNIE
The WAHL to the BERG
That's funky
And now the games must cease
And to the non-believers I say peace
Stop playin' those games
Boy
Huh-huh
Ah Yeah
Uh huh, uh huh

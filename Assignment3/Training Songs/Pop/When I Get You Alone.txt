Oh

Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long no
Mm
You makin' dogs want to beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now

(Oh)
See all these illusions just take us too long
(Oh) And I want it bad
Because you walk pretty,
Because you talk pretty,
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'

(Ah)
Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin',
Asking for a raise
(Oh) Well does she want me to carry her home now?
(Oh) So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

(Ah)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)

(Ah oh)
Come on
Oh yeah-yeah

Baby girl you da shit
That makes you my equivalent
Well you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight,
All right
All my dogs talkin' fast
Ain't you got some photographs?
'Cause you shook that room like a star, now
Yes you did, oh

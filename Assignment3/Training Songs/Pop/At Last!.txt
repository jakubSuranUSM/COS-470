At last, I found what I was dreaming of
So bad, I want to tell the whole world
But I won't say no more
Won't make it harder on you girls

At last, the love that I was dreaming of is mine
Been walking on air for the last 92 hours
But I won't make it harder on you girls

Been groping my way along the darkest of dungeons
Until I found out there were switches all around

At last
At last, I found what I was dreaming of
Someone who truly understands me
A man I can trust, trust with my dust, oho

At last, it's more than I could ever expect
I can't believe it's real
Now my life has a goal, a good happy home

Made up my mind, now it's time, settle down
But don't hold this against me, I gotta run now, at last

Oh girls, I found what you're still craving for
If you accept a piece of my advice
It's nothing but luck and I happened to be struck, oho

Oh girls, oh please don't be so childish
Don't want my joy to make you sick
Thought I could share the fun
But I guess I was wrong

Gave up my heart and my soul and my pride
And my job and my creeds and the ones that I love
Gave up my all to a man I just met
But there's no time to waste 'cause it's almost too late

At last, at last, at last, at last

Let's dance tonight
Let's party tonight
Let's dance dance dance

I can feel the blood rushing right up into my head, oh-oh-oh
Just like the mercury rising right up into the red
So if you can't stand the heat get away from the fire
Cause the beat's getting ready to pump
Yeah we're gonna roll the hot rock
Keep on burning it up

Let's dance tonight
Let's dance tonight
Let's dance dance dance

We're gonna get crazy tonight
We're gonna pump it up tonight
Let's dance dance dance

I can feel a shock runnin' underneath the ground, oh-oh-oh
Cause we'll be crankin' it up until we're tumbling down, oh-oh
So if you can't stand the heat get away from the fire
Cause the beat's getting ready to pump
Yeah we're gonna roll the hot rock
Keep on burnin' it up

Let's dance tonight
Let's party tonight
Let's dance dance dance

We're gonna get crazy tonight
We're gonna pump it up tonight
Let's dance dance dance

Let's dance tonight
Let's party tonight
Let's dance dance dance

We're gonna get crazy tonight
We're gonna pump it up tonight
Let's dance dance dance

Let's dance tonight
Let's party tonight
Let's dance dance dance

We're gonna get crazy tonight
We're gonna pump it up tonight
Let's dance dance dance

Let's dance tonight
Let's party tonight
Let's dance dance dance

We're gonna get crazy tonight
We're gonna pump it up tonight
Let's dance dance dance

It was hot in Mexico
Delirio, tremendo

My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco
My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco

I drive two hours to work
Fill my tank with gasoline
Buy my lunch and large coffee
There it goes, I work for free

But I just let it flow
My job is all I know
Until I met Pedro
Amor cambió todo

My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco
My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco

You and I alone
Drink and sparkle on our throne
Tequila and ron
Run this country on our own

But I just let it flow
My job is all I know
Until I met Pedro
Amor cambió todo

My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco
My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco

Tequila and ron
Drinking at the bar alone
Waiting for a boy to come and take me home
Tequila and ron
Drinking at the bar alone
Waiting for a boy to come and take me home

My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco
My boss is loco, he pays me poco
Loco, poco, loco, poco

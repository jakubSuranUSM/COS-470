Fire 
Fire 

You know there's a fire 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart 
My desire caught fire baby 
From just one tiny spark 

Now it's outta control 
Spreadin' through my soul 
It's been deliberately set 
Gonna get even hotter yet 

Burnin' me up 
You started a fire 
A burnin' in my heart 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart and soul 

Baby with your love 
I burst into flames 
When I called out your name 
And suddenly I was engulfed 

Now my whole life's on fire 
Flames keep gettin' higher and higher 
In the feat of the night 
I get the fever 
But it feels all right 

Burnin me up 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart 

Fire 
Fire 
You know there's a fire 

You starteda fire baby 
Burnin' in my heart 
Burnin' in my soul 
Burnin' red hot coal 

Now I'm really hot 
I just can't be stopped 
Now it's your turn to burn 
Got to learn to walk on fire 
Burnin' me up 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart

Lately you've been acting crazy,
Call my number then you hang up baby
Girl what do you think's going on?

No one else i want to please me
I don't know why you won't believe me
I would never do you that wrong

What we've got
Is hanging by a thread
How did you
Get this inside your head
Because of you
I'm having second thoughts
All the fear, all your doubt
Can't you see

You're pushin' me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin' me 

What's this you been saying 'bout me?
About how you can't breathe without me
What book are you reading today?
Confused, don't know what I'm doing
Dreaming of a bed with me and you in
I should be walking away (yeah)

Me and you
We could've had it all
Now our backs 
Are up against the wall
It may be
A little late for us
All the time you scream and shout
Don't you know

You're pushin' me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin' me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin' me out

You're pushin' me out

You're pushin' me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin' me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin me out
You're pushin' me in
The position is clear
From where I'm standin'
You're always talking 'bout love
You're too demanding
You've got your head in the clouds
Well happy landing
You know you're pushin' me out

Climb in my time machine
I've been mean
Now I'm sorry
So do you mind if we just skip
To when we're friends again
What do I have to say?
To get you to see it my way
'Cause all I want is you
And all I want to do
Future you calls to make plans to see bands with me
But now you is mad at me all the way till yesterday
It's been a long year since we've had a chat
It's gonna be a few more before you smile back
And in the meantime we could be fine
Just buckle up and close that hatch
'Cause all I want is you
And all I wanna do

Twenty-twenty-one, I've said and I've done
What any good friend would have
Twenty-twenty-two I've had it, I'm through
I'm quittin' on you, I'm turning my back
Twenty-twenty-three, you're looking at me
But you really can't see I'm there
Twenty-twenty-four, I don't care about the score
I can't take it any more, and I don't care

'Cause all I want is you
And all I wanna do
All I want is you
And all I wanna do

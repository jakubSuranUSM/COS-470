What do you do when you're down
Nobody else is around who's gonna love you forever
Who's going down for me
And you Don't know what to do feeling like a fool playing by the rules
But every day the world gets stranger to you now but something's never change

You can always reach for me
Wherever you are oh baby
You can reach for me
No matter how far
It's crazy but some say that love fades away
But you know where I'll be
Reach for me

So many lies you could say
Something would give you away
Nothing lasts forever except for maybe me and you
Telling like it is pain and happiness
I'll be there to share it like no one ever did
The world seems stranger to you now
But something's never change

You can always reach for me
Wherever you are oh baby
You can reach for me
No matter how far
It's crazy but some say that love fades away
But you know where I'll be
Reach for me

Oh I'll be there,
When you need someone to talk to need someone to love you yeah, oh yeah
I will be there when it's closing in around you
I'll be the one who'll never doubt you,
You don't have to worry 'bout a thing

You can always Reach for me
Wherever you are
Reach for me no matter how far
But some say that love fades away
But you know where I'll be

You can always reach for me
Wherever you are oh baby
You can reach for me
No matter how far
It's crazy but some say that love fades away
But you know where I'll be
Reach for me

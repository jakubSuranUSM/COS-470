Gotta go, gotta go
Go your own way

What's it all about, what're they saying now that I'm not good for you
But they don't know I'd be there for you
How I care for you, truly doubt for you
But it's clear that

I know if I push, I push you away
So I give you time
I hope you decide what we feel is right
Can't make up your mind

Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you're feeling doubt baby, work it out
Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you feel the same then baby, stay

Now it's up to you what you wanna do
No one can decide if you're wrong or right
Everybody who's got their point of view
Don't know what's on the line though it's hard sometimes

I know if I push, I push you away
So I give you time
I hope you decide what we feel is right
Can't make up your mind

Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you're feeling doubt baby, work it out
Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you feel the same then baby, stay

If you wanna be with me
You gotta show me what I'm trying to see
You gotta give me some kind of sign
Cause Baby I can't read your mind

I know you wanna get in a zone
But nobody wanna live alone
It doesn't matter what I say
I can't make you stay

Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you're feeling doubt baby, work it out
Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you feel the same then baby, stay

Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you're feeling doubt baby, work it out
Gotta go your own way, go your own way
If you feel the same then baby, stay

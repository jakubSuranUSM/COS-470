Of all the modern technology when will they make what I really need
Are they gonna fabricate the part to fix the hole in my lonely heart?
If I laugh its cause my tears ran dry, my sense of humor is my alibi
If you could hear what's going on inside, you'd hear my heart beat double time
She goes boom boom ,boom boom, boom boom ,boom boom, boom boom,
When I look at you

So I guess I'm gonna hit the streets, find someone who can rescue me
Locked up behind my rib cage, my heart wants to come out and play

My heart pumps red blood, big buckets of red love
That's exactly what she does, when its you I'm thinking of
If I were a machine my pistons would be pumping
You could hear my heart valves thumping like boom, boom, boom
If I were a machine my pulse pace would be jumping
You could hear my system bumping like boom, boom, boom

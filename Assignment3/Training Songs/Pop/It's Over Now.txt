I guess it's over now
I think we've seen the end
When our common dream
Falters in the betweens

Though I've tried so hard
To make it real
It's doesn't matter now
I guess it never did

And it's alright with me
And it's alright if that's how you want it to be
I learned through weaknesses
And through the web of your lies

That everyday I live
Another piece of me dies
And in the black and white
I found a need to move on

To find a road of gold
A throne to live upon
If there's a reason for the pain then let me know
If I'm the reason for your pain then let me go

I'm not out to convince you
But draw upon your mind
I'm not out to lose you
You know I'm not that kind

All I wanna do is be with you
All I wanna do is be with you

I'm not here to forgive you
I'm neither clever nor confused
I'm not looking to steal you
Don't want you feeling used

All I wanna do is be with you
All I wanna do is be with you

I've given dust, I feel the most
I twist and turn, turn
I'm lost and found

Can you give out?
Can you see them?
Remember

I'm not out to train you
Lead, you follow far behind
I'm not here to claim you
You know I'm not that kind

All I wanna do is be with you
All I wanna do is be with you
Be with you, be with you, be with you

All I wanna do is be with you
With you, be with you

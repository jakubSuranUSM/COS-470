Psychodelicate girl
Come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
She can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (oh, no, no, no, no, no)

Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you?
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know, people I love
They seem so unhappy
Dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (oh, no, no, no)

Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you?
And it'll makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

A million dreams
A million scars
A million
A million dreams
A million dreams
A million
A million
A million
A million

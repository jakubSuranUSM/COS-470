From across the room, I went to ask her why
She looked so sad, she began to cry
I said dry your eyes, dry your eyes and talk to me
Can't be so bad, it will get better can't you see me
I wanna talk to you, can't you see me, I want to talk to you

I'm not trying to take advantage of you
I see your down, is there anything, anything that I could do?
Wipe you eyes and talk to me
Can't be so sad, things will get better can't you see me
I wanna talk to you, can't you see me, I wanna talk to you

There's no reason for you to be alone
Come with me and I will gladly take you to my home
Wipe your eyes and talk talk talk talk to me
Can't be so bad, things will get better can't you see me
I wanna talk to you
Can't you see me, I wanna talk to you

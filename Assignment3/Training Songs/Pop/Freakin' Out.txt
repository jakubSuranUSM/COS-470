Nothing to see, nothing to hear
Nothing to be, nothing to fear
Nothing to prove, nothing to say
Nothing to loose, nothing to gain 

Nothing to feel, nothing to hate
Nothing is real, it's all too late
What do you do, when nothing's wrong?
Ain't got a clue, ain't got no song 

You're foaming at the mouth
You're mad without a doubt
Cause I'm really freakin' out
I'm going out of my mind
TV's got me going blind
And I'm really freakin' out 

Hey man you think you got it made
Cool beard you stick on your phantom face
Got on your aviator's shades
Yeah man, your looking really ace 

So what the hell you doing here?
Filling the space between my ears
Why don't you all just disappear
Plus all your friends just way to dear 

You're foaming at the mouth
You're mad without a doubt
Cause I'm really freakin' out
I'm going out of my mind
TV's got me going blind
And I'm really freakin' out 

Nothing to see, nothing to hear
Nothing to be, nothing to fear
Nothing to prove, nothing to say
La la la la, la la la lie 

You're foaming at the mouth
You're mad without a doubt
Cause I'm really freakin' out
I'm going out of my mind
TV's got me going blind
And I'm really freakin' out

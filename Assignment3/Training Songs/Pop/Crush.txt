In a crowd you came to me
Fell in love, now you're free
And I believed in you
Many things I didn't know
At 24 a heart grows cold
And I believed in you and me
You came like a riddle to me
Then broke in my hour of need
Oh my love
You-you brought with you
That gentle touch
Now as it seems this love was
Just a crush
Love fades in the shade of your grace
Kills me and drives me away
Oh my love
You brought with you
That humble touch
Now could it be this love was
Just a crush
You brought with you
That gentle touch
Now as it seems this love was
Just a crush
Could it be? this love was
Just a crush

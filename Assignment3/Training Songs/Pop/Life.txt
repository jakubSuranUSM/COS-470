There's a train at the station that's ready to leave
And a perfect future just made for me
I let this stranger walk into my life
Stepped out of the darkness back into the light

I know I'm crazy but just a little sane
I get to take this ride again

You give me hope when I wake up
To lift my head high
And take what's mine
We look for laughter in the madness
You give me hope
And you give me life

Will you let me breathe now while I find my truth
If I love myself don't mean I don't love you
All of my chances are in my hands
Stepped out of the darkness, found out who I am

I know I'm crazy but just a little sane
I get to take this ride again

You give me hope when I wake up
To lift my head high
And take what's mine
We look for laughter in the madness
You give me hope
And you give me life

(You give me life)

(You give me life)

Well I don't know who I am
When I'm lost in you
When I'm under the water (Under the water)
When I'm under the water
I look to you
You know I do
I look to you
And the water is gone

You give me hope when I wake up
To lift my head high
And take what's mine
We look for laughter in the madness
You give me hope
And you give me life

Oh, you give me life

You give me life

Oh, you give me life

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Everybody here is sleeping tight
Ain't nobody gonna find us here
We'll disappear

There's a dancer in the arms of love
And he's dancing on the sky above
And the truth is that we'll never know
Where love will flow

Aim high, shoot low
We gotta aim high, shoot low baby

[Chorus]
Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Ain't nobody here to make it right
'Cause we couldn't seem to find a way
For love to stay
If you had another night to give
I would have another night to live
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

(Last goodbye)

Is it cloudy where you are tonight
All there neon lights shining bright
Are you looking for a place to stay
To get away (don't get away)

And the days are horses down the hill
Running fast with no time to kill
And the truth is that we'll never know
Where love will flow

Aim high, shoot low
We gotta aim high, shoot low baby

[Chorus]

If I could do it over
I'd do it all again (over again)
And if I got one more chance
I wouldn't change a thing

Aim high, shoot low
Aim high, shoot low

[Chorus: x2]

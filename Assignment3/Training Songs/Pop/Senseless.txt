All ya friend just a try
Watch mi style
Any man me a take

How you make my thing come great
Five minus four
Seven days of the week, weak
Them couldn't never be pretty from me head, shoulder and me knee
Any picture me a post

And get sent to the cemetary
Muny pun mi mind
Pussy pink like hawk
Any man mi a f*ck
Hafi beg mi na stop
Ring pon mi finger
Balmain pon mi lock
When DON touch road
Every gyal face drop
Number one, inna da good look book

A ten thing
Nothing pon mi body ever broke
Five minus four tell a gyal me nah shook

If a gyal make fren den me haffi free dat
And if 'em war
Nuff shot and lik head top
Mi no play less him go say him gyal it no dat

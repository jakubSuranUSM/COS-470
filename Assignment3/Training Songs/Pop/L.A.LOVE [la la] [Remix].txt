Finger on the pump, make the sixth straight jump from SoCal

Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where you at?

To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg

Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down

From the plaques to the (uh uh) everything fat
Got Mustard on a track, my girls all stack
When I roll down the window, let me know where you’re
Atlanta, north south cack a lack
Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back
To London, Jamaica, then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell ‘em

Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town

Brought her and fucked in our back yard, the milli' it ain’t hard
My mama be like “YG you so brazy”
Have you ever seen a gangsta gangsta make a billion dollars
Dre did it, he from L.A so pop yo' collar
The LAPD be all over me
Tryin’ to ban me from my own bity
But for no reason the cops just killed that
Home of the Rodney King riots this shit been wild
I hit the club and party like I scored a touchdown
I pop a bottle and all the models wanna f*ck now
We jammin’ on Piquot, bustin’ hoes over on Sunset
I could take you to Venice Beach and watch the sun set
Or I could take you to the Blippers game
Court seat, floor side, eatin’ on Roscoe’s chicken wings

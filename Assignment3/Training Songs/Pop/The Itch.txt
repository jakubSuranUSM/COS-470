Ha ha ha (ah)

Don't want to hurt you (hurt you baby)
You think you love me, but you don't know me
Don't want to hurt you (hurt you baby)
want to go ride, not a backseat drive
Ah oh, I, I, I, I need
Ah oh, something inside that you can't provide me

I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch

I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch 
I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch

Don't want to hurt you (hurt you baby)
You can hurt me, but you can't really hold me
? I do, it's crazy
Don't want to be cold, but I'm out of control
Ah oh, ay ay ay, it's true ?
Ah oh, wish I could, but I can't be good

I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I'm starting to twitch again
I need to get tricked again
I feel the itch
I'm feeling the itch again

'Cause I want to go down
Before I feel my heart pound
Now don't you know that I get restless
You can't reach where I be scratching
So feel the itch again

Itch
Itch

Ah oh, I, I, I, I need
Ah oh, something inside that you can't provide me

Repeat 1

Yeah yeah..I feel the itch again
i-i-itch

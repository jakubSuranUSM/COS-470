Careless
Why must I be so careless?
I only want the best for you
Yes, I'm truly careless

Careful,
Why hurt the one
I'll hold tonight?
Just when the feeling felt so right
Oh I should be careful

How many times should I apologize?
How many times should I cry?
I was lonely
Away from home
feeling so alone
Just like now

Sleepless
How can I sleep knowing I hurt you so?
Maybe I'm crazy
I don't know
But if you'd go I'd be helpless

CHORUS

Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love
Love, once you've tasted love

Don't be sold a dream
Remember how the past has been 
Don't be led to believe this one's for you 
Calculate your needs
I see there's room to plant your seeds 
Don't decide |til you see how the others have grown 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Once you've tasted love 

Still too early to know
Give them time and they will grow 
Don't believe that the first's the one for you 
Most will grow to be tall
Others will break and fall 
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all 

Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning 
Your head is spinning 
Once you've tasted love 

Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love
Once you've tasted love it is just the beginning of a new world 
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in, oh no
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning, oh yeah
(Once you've tasted love) once you've tasted love is just the beginning 
Once you've tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should 

Came into my world and the badness disappears
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears 
It feels so nice to be with you
Us two, we fit like a glove 
When I see your eyes I realize you too have tasted love 

You've tasted love, you know it's good 
Come taste my love 
You know you should

(Check check, OK cool, rolling)

(Hey)
(Yeah)

Carjack used to fix flat tires (Get your ass out of the car now!)
Cadillac used to be a Benz (hey, get out of the street)
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost you in the end

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today

He's gay used to mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed (alright)
You're played used to mean top forty 
(You're listening to WNPG and we will ? chaos)
Now 40 days of being played ain't proud

I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Lookin' through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world today
(Yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Safe sex used to mean no babies
When intercourse used to mean fun
If I had fifteen ladies
I would only f*ck with one

I get hit by a mortar, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder [rulin'/ruinin'] my world today

(Good guys, look the way, coming down here)
(F*ck we belong)
(Senora)
(I'm not gonna tell her, a lot of work to do)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)

(Oh whoa no no no)
(Hey)

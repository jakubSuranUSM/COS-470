Eurasian eyes are watching me
Like a river, oh you flow through me
Eurasian eyes are running still
Whispered moments, oh cut the chill
When Eurasian eyes are watching me

Do you feel the passion in me?
'Cause I'm the one that said I'd never care
For someone like you
Now I'm the one that lacks the eloquence
To say, oh to say

That when the world is cold with no one to hold
I can only see Eurasian eyes
Love won't lie 'cause the truth would cry
That I can only see Eurasian eyes

Eurasian eyes inspire me
Look for the magic until I see
Eurasian eyes, so honestly

Do you feel the passion in me?
'Cause I'm the one that said I'd never care
For someone like you
Now you're inside me
And I won't defend what I want to do for you
But oh, now I said
Now I'm the one that lacks the eloquence
To say, oh to say

When the world is cold with no one to hold
I can only see Eurasian eyes
You know love won't lie 'cause the truth would cry
I can only see Eurasian eyes
And if my heart is blind then why do I find
I can only see Eurasian eyes
Oh no, no

When the world is cold with no one to hold
I can only see Eurasian eyes
You know love won't lie 'cause the truth would cry
That I can only see Eurasian eyes
And if my heart is blind then why do I find
I can only see Eurasian eyes
And when the world is cold with no one to hold
I can only see Eurasian eyes
Eurasian eyes

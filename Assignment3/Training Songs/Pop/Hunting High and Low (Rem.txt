Here I am and within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep and she's sweeter now
Than the wildest dream could have seen her
And I watch her sleeping away
Though I know I'll be hunting high and low

High, there's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low
High, there's no end to lengths I'll go

To find her again, upon this my dreams are depending
Through the dark I sense the poundin' of her heart next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I guess I'll be hunting high and low

High, there's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High, do you know what it means to love you?

I'm hunting high and low
And now she's tellin' me she's got to go away

I'll always be hunting high and low
Hungry for you
(And now she's tellin' me)
Watch me tearing myself to pieces
Hunting high and low

High, there's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Oh, for you I'll be hunting high and low

Traveled far to get ourselves here
Left our indifference behind
With your courage I escaped my fear
You learned to say what's on your mind
Now we make our loving memories
Living heart to heart
Glowing like an open fire
We came out from the dark

Yeah, only you is all I need
Only you know where to go to get to me
Only you can break me free
Stop me living behind the lines of enemies
Waiting for someone to rescue me

We traveled rough to get ourselves here
Now laughter dries the tears we cried
Through the good times and the bad, my dear
We suffered for each other's crime
I placed the love you gave me closer to my heart
You took the songs I sang to you, alone in the dark

Only you is all I need
Only you know where to go to get to me
Only you can break me free
Stop me living, stop me living behind the lines of enemies

Oh, when I'm with you baby it's a beautiful life
Together this world feels like home
Walk beside me now until the end of time
Without you I feel so alone

Only you is all I need
Only you know where to go to get to me
Only you can break me free
Stop me living, yes, stop me living, now
Stop me living, behind the lines of enemies

In walked a stranger, unaware of the dangers of the city,
A new arrival of the train from the plane, lookin' pretty!
Knows nothing bout rock n roll and even less bout racial wars,
Be prepared to lose your soul, if your gonna walk out of that door

Don’t go walkin' in the dark, don’t go walking in the dark

He’s heard the glory in some second hand stories, dreaming Broadway
He did a turn about and had to come and learn about it his way
He’s learning fast about being scared and even more bout being alone
Not gonna last , it’s a different life
Nothing that he’s ever known.

Don’t go walkin' in the dark, don’t go walking in the dark

Hey mister, your lookin' for danger if you walk outside
Hey mister, you ain't the lone ranger 
And you better decide, your life or your pride!
Now don’t go walkin'!

A crosstown romance that never had a chance, her name was Rudy.
Part-time waitress and centerfold queen, a Latin cutie
Now all her teasing and her downtown sleezing filled his heart with pain
She gave him hope and then she let him down, standing alone in the rain!

Don’t go walkin' in the dark, don’t go walking in the dark

Oh I'm so tired of the blogging
Yeah, I'm so tired of them bothering
This think come all the generation
Is born of life of constant longing
Yeah, I'm so tired of opinions
And all the shadow aquitation
I call the local weather station
It's raining bullshit through the nation

So go, get far, it comes a message from an empty heart.
Go, get far, twitter, twitter, little star.
Plastic faces, plastic words,
We're all living in our plastic world,
And we are caught in mud.
Plastic faces, plastic food,
God would sure misunderstood
A home in this plastic world.

This is a world with people starving,
Young people dying, bombs are falling.
We do our party conversations
About make-up and foundation
And all this talk about the fashion
Is such a western life obsession
Who's in, who's out, who bloody cares?
I close my eyes and disappear.

So go, get far, it comes a message from an empty heart.
Go, get far, twitter, twitter, little star.
Plastic faces, plastic words,
We're all living in our plastic world,
And we are caught in mud.
Plastic faces, plastic food,
God would sure misunderstood
A home in this plastic world,
In this plastic world.

In this plastic world
In this plastic world

(In this plastic world)

Plastic faces, plastic words,
We're all living in our plastic world, oh hmm
Plastic faces, plastic food,
God would sure misunderstood
In this plastic world,

In this plastic world

Searching for an endless moment
You don't have to say I'm wrong
As I float on through this windless orchard
Shadows favor all the dark in sight
I feel the light it cuts my face
I'm staring at the wall
It wont be long till we embrace
I'm knocking on your wall
Lady, take me to the magic wall
And maybe we'll drift on through the world

I miss you every day that I'm breathing
I couldn't even say goodbye
I'm dreaming that your face is smiling
It wont be to long till I meet you there
Where have you run to I need to know
Where will I find you I have to go
If I die please don't cry
Ill be there by your side
If I die please don't cry
Ill be there inside your arms.

I know everything about you
What you like to do
Where we're gonna be when we're old
You don't know me but I know you
And I can't say when we'll meet
But I feel we getting close

Fall angel fall
Hold me a fallen angel and set me free
Fall angel fall
Fall for me

Could be anywhere
Maybe far from here
Might tap me on the shoulder right now
I don't know how but I know you're there
And I will always believe
And know we're getting close

Fall angel fall
Hold me a fallen angel and set me free
Fall angel fall
Fall for me

Fall angel fall
Hold me a fallen angel and set me free
Fall angel fall
Fall for me

Fall angel fall
All my life I've lived with this misery
Fall angel fall
Fall for me

Fall angel fall
Hold me a fallen angel and set me free
Fall angel fall
Fall for me

Fall angel fall
All my life I've lived with this misery

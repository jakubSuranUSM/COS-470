Too many doubts
Too much fear
Too much danger
When society constructs our human nature
Live by the rules
Live by the laws
Live by commandments
Notions preconceived can lead to utter madness

Let it go
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
We are made, we are not born
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
We are made, we are not born

Learn to convert
Learn to assert
Learn to abandon
Ideologies and disciplines at random
Lay down my laws
Lay down the rules
Lay down commandments
Lift the sanctions
That restrict this woman's madness

Let it go
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
We are made, we are not born
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
We are made, we are not born

Uniformity
Conventionality
Is the bane of our existence
Keep it safely at a distance
Nonconformity
Unconventionality
Is too good to be
Let your hair down
Can't you see

Let it go
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
We are made, we are not born
Let it go
Let it free your body
Let it move your soul
Let it go, oh no
A woman is made, she is not born

Let it go
Let it free your head
Uncivilize your soul
Oh, oh
Let it go
Let it free your head
Uncivilize your soul
Let it go
Oh, let it go
Let it free your head
Uncivilize your soul

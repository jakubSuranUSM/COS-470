Do you remember I searched you out?
How I climbed your city's walls
Do you remember me as devout?
How I prayed for your calls
I stood still, it's what I did
Love like ours is never fixed

I stuck around
I did behave,
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool
I was a fool

Then you blamed me and blocked me out
How long did you think I'd last?
Then you disappeared for weeks to pout
How many times could I pack?
But stand still is all I did
Love like ours is never fixed

Still I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)

If youâ€™re worried
That I might've changed
Left behind all of my foolish ways
You best be looking for somebody else
Without a foolish heart
A foolish heart

But stand still is all we did (That's all we did)
Love like ours is never fixed

I stuck around
I did behave,
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool for love
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)

I am the Candyman,
Coming from Bountyland.
I am the Candyman,
Coming from Bountyland.

I wish that you were my Lollipop.
Sweet things, I will never get enough.
If you show me to the sugar tree,
Will you give me a soda pop for free.

Come with me Honey, (Oh)
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman.
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland. (Oh)
Bite me, I'm yours, if you're hungry please understand.
This is the end, of the sweet sugar Candyman.

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, your word is my command.
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland.

(Oh) you are my Lollipop,
(Oh) sugar sugar top
(Oh) you are my Lollipop,
(Oh) sugar sugar top

I wish that I were a Bubble Yum,
Chewing on me baby all day long.
I will be begging for sweet delight,
Until you say I'm yours tonight.

Come with me Honey,
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman.
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland.
Bite me, I'm yours, if you're hungry please understand.
This is the end, of the sweet sugar Candyman.

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, your word is my command.
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland.

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, your word is my command.
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland.

I am the Candyman
Coming from Bountyland
I am the Candyman
Coming from Bountyland

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, your word is my command.
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman,
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland.

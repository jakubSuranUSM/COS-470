You came. You changed the way I feel.
You turn me upside down.
And now the past has disappeared.
Since I know you're around.

So never never never break my heart.
Never leave me stranded.
So never never let us fall apart.
Don't take me for granted.

I give to you the best of me.
Reach out and take it all.
My love and sensuality.
My body and my soul.

So never never never break my heart.
Never leave me stranded.
So never never let us fall apart.
Don't take me for granted.
I need you. Baby more and more each day.
Don't you know'
I can't survive if you should walk away.

Sit back. How good could a Bad Boy be'
Said I'd be jealous, 'cause I get another term to meet.
You're the one for me.
It should be plain to see. Your love is not a game to me.
Love is just for those who don't have a heart.
I remember the times you were there when the days were dark.
Taking long talks and walks in the park.

So never never never break my heart.
Never leave me stranded.
So never never let us fall apart.
Don't take me for granted.
I need you. Baby more and more each day.
Don't you know'
I can't survive if you should walk away.

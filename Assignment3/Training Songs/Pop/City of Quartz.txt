Roam the lions Roam the courts 
This fiery eyed won’t wait for love 
But hang walls in a hostile mission 
The new stars all look constellations 
How can you wait on course You dick out of source 
Wanna slow play with some hesitation 
And get lost in a conversation 
But you can’t laugh, you can’t always 
Alliances all recorded

How can you wait on course 
You dick out of source 
Wanna slow play with some hesitation 
And get lost in a conversation 
But you can’t laugh, you can’t always 
Alliances all recorded

We tip and turn 
Our hands all night I’ll take it all 
Take it easy 
Our times, hard forgiving 
We’ll pay our for pipe lines strong

Tear our eyes beyond the tours 
Sniff the lions we know the course 
The guy mores above me location 
The heavy words no inspiration 
Hiding pools, miring stars compound days tear you apart 
The lost of hot desolation 
And get lost in a conversation 
But you can’t laugh, you can’t always 
Alliances all recorded We tip and turn 
Our hands all night

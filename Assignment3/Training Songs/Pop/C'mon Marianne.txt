Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne

Whoa-ho-ho here I am on my knees again
I'll do anything just to make it right
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can
See'mon Marianne

No matter what people say, it didn't happen that way
She was a passing fling and not a permanent thing
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can

See'mon Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)
Say you can understand
My Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne

Well now your big brown eyes are all full of tears
From the bitterness of my cheatin' years
So I hang my head, wish that I was dead
See'mon Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)
Say you can understand
My Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)
See'mon Marianne (baby)

Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne

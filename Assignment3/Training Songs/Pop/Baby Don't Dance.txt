It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom
It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom

Baby I'm in love
Don't hold me back
Don't stop me now
Baby I'm in love
Can't hold me back
Don't stop me now
Baby I'm in love
Can't hold me back
No way no how
Baby I'm in love
Don't stop me now
Can't hold me back

And when I'm with you baby
I'm never gonna give it up
Just me and you baby
Our love is enough is enough

[Chorus]
Baby don't dance
Baby don't sing
Baby don't have to do anything
cause my baby got something that does it for me
This is love that we got and I like it I like it
Baby don't groove
Baby don't swing
Baby don't have to prove anything
cause my baby so real it's the way I feel
This is love and I like it

It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom
It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom

Baby I'm in love
And I'm feeling high
And it feels so right
Baby I'm in love can't hold me back
Don't stop me now

And when I'm with you baby
I'm never gonna give it up
Just me and you baby
Our love is enough is enough

[Chorus]

It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom
It makes my heart go boom bang boom boom

And when I'm with you baby
I'm never gonna give it up
Just me and you baby
Our love is enough is enough

[Chorus]

Baby

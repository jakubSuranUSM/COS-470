I just called, just to say
That I'm coming round and I don't care if it's out my way
I know you, told me not to call
I'll clear out my clothes pack up my bags be on my way
I know that you still secretly care
But if I'm wrong then I'll just get out of your hair
And if you let me stay don't let me go
Let me know I just wanna know

In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way

Sometimes I, never let you know
That I still sing the songs wrote down on my bedroom wall
And somehow I, always fail to show
The appreciation you crave cuz I'm a fool for you
So let me in I'll let you call me names
Insult the words and cuss at me that it's all the same
And if you want me out then only say
Only say, and I'll be on my way

In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way

And if you want me out then only say
Only say, and I'll be on my way

In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way
In then I'm out, out then I'm in, and I'm on my way

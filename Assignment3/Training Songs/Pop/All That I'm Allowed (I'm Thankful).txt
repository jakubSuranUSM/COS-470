Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road sun rising at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
We're walking higher everyday
The barriers get in the way but I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, I'm thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful
I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
Its out of reach somewhere beyond this room

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
We're walking higher everyday
The barriers get in the way but I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful
I've got all that I'm allowed

I've always tried to make things clear
Then I watched as progress stalled
I only hope I'm standing here when Heaven finally comes to call

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
We're walking higher everyday
The barriers get in the way but I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful
I've got all that I'm allowed

Thankful, I'm thankful
So thankful
Thankful
I've got all that I'm allowed

All that I'm allowed

I'm thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed
So thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed

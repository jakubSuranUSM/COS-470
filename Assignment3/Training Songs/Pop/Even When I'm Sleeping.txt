Don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony,
My mind is clear
I may be low or miles high off in the distance,
I want you near
I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes,you're everywhere.
And if they take me flying on the magic carpet,
See me wave
If our communication fails I'll reconnect it, 
I want to rave 
I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes, you're everywhere
No matter where the road is leading us remember, don't be afraid
We have a continent that sometimes comes between us, that's ok
I love you, even when I'm sleeping 
When I close my eyes, you're everywhere

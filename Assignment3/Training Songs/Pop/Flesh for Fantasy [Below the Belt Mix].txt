Flesh, flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
You cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

Face to face
And back to back
You see and feel
My sex attack, sing it
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

Flesh
Flesh
Flesh

It's after midnight
Are you feelin' alright, oh yeah
Turn on the light, babe
Are you someone else tonight?

Neighbor to neighbor, door to door
Don't ask questions
There's time for it all, oh yeah

Face to face
And back to back
You see and feel
My sex attack, sing it
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

We cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

You cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

Flesh
Flesh
Flesh

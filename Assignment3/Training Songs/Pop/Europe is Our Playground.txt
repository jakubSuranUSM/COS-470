Run with me baby  let your hair down 
Through every station  through every town 
Run with me baby  let's take a chance 
From Heathrow to Hounslow  from the Eastern Block to France 

Europe is our playground  London is our town 
So run with me baby now 

Run with me baby  let your hair down 
Through every station  through every town 
Run with me baby  let's make a stand 
From peepshows to disco  from Spain to Camber Sands 

Europe is our playground, London is our town 
So run with me baby now...

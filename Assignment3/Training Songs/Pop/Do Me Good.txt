You move me
You sooth me
You know I like it
When you're there to do me good
And if you would hurt me
I take it back
But try to forgive you give you

Give me love so I can too
Give me hope when I am through
You're fine, you're mine
You're all I need to find
You're fine, you're mine
Wo wow wo wo wo
Do me good you know you should
I love you so, don't ever go away

Give me love so I can too
Give me hope when I am through
You're fine, you're mine
You're all I need to find
You're fine, you're mine
Wo wow wo wo wo
Do me good you know you should
I love you so, don't ever go away

She needs me,
She sees me
She knows I like it
When she's there to do me good
And if she would hurt me
I take it back
But try to forgive all give all

Give me love so I can too
Give me hope when I am through
You're fine, you're mine
You're all I need to find
You're fine, you're mine
Wo wow wo wo wo
Do me good you know you should
I love you so, don't ever go away

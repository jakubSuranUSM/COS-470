Little girl, big dreams
Read it in a magazine did that girl
Life's more like a beauty trip
She set off with all the tricks did that girl.

In this world
Nobody you can blame
You've got to stake your claim
Make it your aim.

Don't blame it on that girl
It's the only way she knows
Don't blame it on that girl
She wants a better world
(Don't blame it on that girl).

Her beauty was her saving grace
She goes far on pretty face will that girl
Use it for her every need
Beauty of the first degree was that girl.

In this world
Nobody you can blame
You've got to stake your claim
Make it your aim.

Don't blame it on that girl
It's the only way she knows
Don't blame it on that girl
She wants a better world
(Don't blame it on that girl).

Hit it!

OK!

In this world
Nobody you can blame
You've got to stake your claim
Make it your aim.

Don't blame it
Don't blame it on that girl
It's the only way she knows
Don't blame it on that girl
She wants a better world
(Don't blame it on that girl).

(Don't blame it on that girl)
She's level in ????
(Don't blame it on that girl)
(Don't blame it on that girl)
She's doing what comes naturally
(Don't blame it on that girl).

(Don't blame it on that girl)
She's not the girl she wants to be
(Don't blame it on that girl)
(Don't blame it on that girl)
She's yeah
(Don't blame it on that girl)...

We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties

My mother cried
When president Kennedy died
She said it was the communists
But I knew better

Would they drop the bomb on us
While we made love on the beach
We were the class they couldn't teach
'Cause we knew better

We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties

They screamed
When the Beatles sang
And they laughed when the King fell down the steps
Oh they should've known better

Oh we hated our Aunt
Then we messed in our pants
Then we lost our faith and prayed to the TV
Oh we should've known better

We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties

We freeze like statues on the pages of history
Living was never like this when we took all those G.C.E.'s
Oh you opened the door for us
And then you turned to dust

You don't understand us
So don't reprimand us
We're taking the future
We don't need no teacher

Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties

Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties

When the weight is on your shoulders 
Come on your knees 
When the weight is on your shoulders 
Come on your knees 

Wake me when it's over 
Wake me please 
Wake me when it's over 

All the things you knew for sure 
Were not what they seemed 
All the things you knew for sure 
Were not what they seemed 

Wake me when it's over 
Wake me please 
Wake me when it's over 

When all the noise is gone 
Anything you want 
I will give away just to watch you go

A la la la
La la la la la la la oh, oh, yeah, oh
You walk up to me and say,
I feel like I know you baby
And then take a sip of your cherry coke,
Now, now who drinks a cherry coke
Maybe you notice
I see that bead of sweat dancing on your cheek
Your words are like a cheap champagne,
I get the point, but it's much too sweet

I'm so tired of the dance,
This carousel of superficial conversation
Gets me nowhere

So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.
It's the human condition that keeps up apart,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

Yea everybody's got a story that could break your heart.
La la la la la la na na na na na na na

Now who can read the mind of the red-headed girl next door,
Or the taxi driver who just dropped you off,
Or the, or the classmate that you ignore.

Don't assume everything on the surface is what you see,
'Cause that classmate just lost her mother,
And that taxi driver's got a Ph-d.

I'm so tired of the fear
That weighs us down with wrong assumptions
A broken heart's a natural function

So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.
It's the human condition that keeps us apart,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

La la la la
La la la la la la la la la

So dig deep, (dig deep)
Deeper than the image that you see, (dig deep)
Lift up, feel, and let your true self breathe, (dig deep)
Show the world the beauty of belief (belief)

See my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.
It's the human condition that keeps up apart,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

See my bra, underneath my shirt,
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt,
But that ain't the picture it's just a part,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

See my eyes, don't see what I see.
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me.
(Touch my tongue and don't know what tastes good to me)
The human condition that keeps up apart,
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart.

That could break your heart, baby
Everybody's got a story, oh yeah

La la la la la la

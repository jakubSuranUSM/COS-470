English rose
This is how the story goes
Been asleep
Pricked my finger
Fell too deep
Woke to find
A dead prince charming by my side
So hey, there's no need to say goodbye

Will I find
Any baddies or goodies
Will I lie with any princes or hoodies
Alibi
You better pucker up or die
Be mine
Say I was with you last night

No more pretending
There's happy endings
You gotta make one, make one

Where did you go?
What did you see?
Cinderella's eyes
What did you do?
Where did you sleep?
Underneath the sky
Did you belong?
Are you complete?
Kick my heels three times
My oh my, what'll I do out there?

Cinderella are you happy
With your fella and your home
Had to wake up from my nightmare

Ginger bread
Man he tried to seduce me
Off his head
I'm allergic to dairy
Better yet
He didn't know I needed more
A smart cookie who really knows the score

Little girl
You got to do it for yourself
In a world
Where cards are so randomly dealt
No you can't
Change the done it's in the past
So you, buckle your boots and don't look back

No more pretending
There's happy endings
You gotta make one, make one

Where did you go?
What did you see?
Cinderella's eyes
What did you do?
Where did you sleep?
Underneath the sky
Did you belong?
Are you complete?
Kick my heels three times
My oh my, what'll I do out there?

Cinderella are you happy
With your fella and your home
Had to wake up from my nightmare

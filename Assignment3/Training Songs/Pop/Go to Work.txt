Go to work, work, work, work, work, work

Sunlight wakes me up
Say good morning
Then I'm rolling
I’m still holding on to you
Seven forty five
The day is dawning

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do 
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do 

Why don’t you go to work, do your nine to five
Gotta treat me right, you need to earn your stripes
Why don’t you do your thing
Bring the money home just like mama done
Why don’t you go to work
Why don’t you go to work
Do your nine to five
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don’t you do your thing
Bring the money home just like mama done
Why don’t you go to work

Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
What I gotta do
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
What I gotta do

Now you’re acting up
I think it's stalling
Appreciation boy
That’s all I need from you
Don’t apologise
Just give me something

Tell me what I gotta do 
To get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do to
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Get you up in the morning
Tell me what I gotta do 

Why don’t you go to work, do your nine to five
Gotta treat me right, you need to earn your stripes
Why don’t you do your thing
Bring the money home just like mama done
Why don’t you go to work
Why don’t you go to work
Do your nine to five
Gotta treat me right
You need to earn your stripes
Why don’t you do your thing
Bring the money home just like mama done
Why don’t you go to work

Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
What I gotta do
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
Why don't you go work
What I gotta do

When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home (what I gotta do)
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home (what I gotta do)
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home (what I gotta do)
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home
When I come home, when I come home
Just a little bit of love when I come home
What I gotta do

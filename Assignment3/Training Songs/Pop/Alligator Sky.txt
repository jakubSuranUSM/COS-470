Where was I when the rockets came to life,
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead,
I’m never letting go, I’m never letting go

Uh uh, that’s not a plane, that’s me,
I’m sittin’ where I’m supposed to,
Floatin’ on the cloud, can’t nobody come close to,
The concrete and the sky switch places,
So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces,
Firecracker to the moon, keep your eyes shut,
Blastin’ off like a rocket from the ground up,
I used to catch a cab on the Monday,
Now the taxi’s sellin’ lights on the runway,
Fly, condo on the Milky Way,
A house on the cloud and God’s my landlord,
And for my rent all I pay is my drive,
I got that
So if you need me you can find me in the alligator sky.

Where was I when the rockets came to life,
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
(Into the alligator sky)
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead,
I’m never letting go, I’m never letting go!

Roller coaster through the atmosphere,
I’m drowning in this starry serenade,
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier,
My imagination’s taking me away.

Reverie, whisper in my ear,
I’m scared to death that I’ll never be afraid,
Roller coaster through the atmosphere,
My imagination’s taking me away.

Uh, now I’ma dance like I never dance,
Sing like I never sing, dream like I never dream,
Or try to, ’cause we’ve been lied to,
That the sun is somethin’ that we can’t fly to,
Well, I sit on my star and see street lights,
Look up, ha, you’ll miss me if you blink twice,
Imagination is hot and if you got it you can meet me,
When you see me in the alligator sky.

Where was I when the rockets came to life,
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
(Into the alligator sky)
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead,
I’m never letting go, I’m never letting go!

Where was I when the rockets came to life,
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead,
I’m never letting go, I’m never letting go!

In the alligator sky?
In the alligator sky?
In the alligator sky?
In the alligator sky?

Up every morning just to keep a job
I have to work my way through the hustlin mob
The sounds of the city poundin in my brain
While another day goes down the drain

But when you try so hard just to be someone
To be someone you want to be
All my hangups putdowns caveats
There's something else to beleive

Yeah Yeah
It's a 5 o'clock world when the whistle blows
And I'm telling to you
And it's the 5 o'clock shadow when the missile blows
I thank god for you

Working so hard for the pay I get
Livin on money that I ain't made yet
Five bucks a copy just to be myself
When I'd rather be somebody else

Yeah, Yeah
Well it's a 5 o'clock world when the whistle blows
And I'm telling to you
And it's the 5 o'clock shadow when the missile blows
I thank god for you

I know a place
Where we can hide from the human race outside
The count downs started
And your bags are packed
We leave this planet tonight my dear
Let's ride
Yeah yeah yeah

In the shelter of her arms everything's OK
She smiles and the world goes whistling away
She gives me reason to carry on
When every other reason is gone

Yeah Yeah
But it's a 5 o'clock world when the whistle blows
And I'm telling to you
And it's a mighty small planet when the missile blows
I thank god for you

It's a 5 o'clock world when the whistle blows
And I'm telling to you
And it's a mighty small planet when the missile blows
I thank god for you
Thank god for you

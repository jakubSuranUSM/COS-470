I'm going through good and bad times
Working hard to live my dreams and I
Know now that I chose the right way
I'll never forget the last three years, but

Sometimes, I wonder
If I had, made it without

The way you love me and support me
Makes me know we'll never part
The way you touch me deep in my soul
That's the reason you're in my heart

The way you need me like I need you
I'm sure we'll never part
The way you feel me and make me smile
That's the reason you're in my heart

In moments of fear and darkness
You covered me with light and hope
But we need a break it won't be forever, 'cause
We owe you the time of our lives

Always in all times
We will be, yours, 'cause we know

The way you love me and support me
Makes me know we'll never part
The way you touch me deep in my soul
That's the reason you're in my heart
The way you need me like I need you
I'm sure we'll never part
The way you feel me and make me smile
That's the reason you're in my heart

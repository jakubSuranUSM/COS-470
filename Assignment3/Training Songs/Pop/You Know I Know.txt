Mr Lover Lover
Shaggy, Olly Murs, our time

You know I heard about you
You got a flirty mind
And I confess that you've been blessed
The way you dress is borderline
The more I think about it
I wanna make you mine
We pretend that we're just friends
But I think it's time we redefine

I've waited up all night to see you
So, baby, meet me at the bar
You don't have to dress up for me, yeah
Because you're perfect as you are

All of these things that I wanna do
All of these things make me think of you
All of these moves that I wanna use
You know I know that you want me
All of these tricks that I wanna try
All of these licks, wanna do it right
You don't have to tease, you ain't gotta lie
You know I know that you want me

You know I know
You know I know
You know I know that you want me
You know I know
You know I know
You know I know that you want me

Gyal ah try play it cute, she want my bag
From the way she look, I know she like my swag
Every time I spot her looking at the ceiling
Gotta feeling catching all kinda feelings
You on the IG, checking out my snaps
Trying hard now not to double tap
Well, baby girl, you should notice I'm the real thing
You are the queen, know you broke up with your dream ting

I've waited up all night to see you
So, baby, meet me at the bar
You don't have to dress up for me, yeah

With her high heel against the wall
Kind of dancing, though not at all
She had stockings running up to her thigh
Snaps her finger to keep the time.
From the back of the room I saw her there
I said she wants to be alone and I shouldn't dare
But then she noticed me glance at her
I had no choice but to dance with her.

The lights they move sideways and up and down
The beat takes you over and spins you 'round
Our hearts steady beating, our sweat turns to cold
We're slaves to the DJ and out of control

I watched her feet move
Her hips they sway
Does a hair flip
And starts to say
'oh my god it's my favourite song'
I pull her close and she sings along
We can't slow down even if we try
If the record keeps spinning then so will I
She likes disco and tastes like a tear
Tells me don't stop dancing and she's pulling me near

The lights they move sideways and up and down
The beat takes you over and spins you round
Our hearts steady beating, our sweat turns to cold
We're slaves to the DJ and out of control

we've got no where to go
We've got nothing to prove
Instead dancing alone I should be dancing with you
This song turning me on
The beat is doing me in
Or maybe its only you
But either way let's begin 

we've got no where to go
We've got nothing to prove
Instead dancing alone I should be dancing with you
This song turning me on
The beat is doing me in
Or maybe its only you
But either way let's begin

we've got no where to go

The beat takes you over and spins you round
Our hearts steady beating, our sweat turns to cold

The beat takes you over and spins you round
Our hearts steady beating, our sweat turns to cold

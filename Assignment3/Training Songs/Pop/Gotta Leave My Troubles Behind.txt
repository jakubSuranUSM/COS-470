My baby gives me the love I've looked for all my life
He's the only guy that I would take for my man
Our relationship is good yeah it's one of it's kind
But I've gotta leave my troubles behind

I'm acting supersticious when he's been away
A jealous little woman with nothing to blame
Screaming and threating that I would leave him
Well it's my troubles I should leave behind

My baby loves me when I'm down and out
My baby loves me when I'm up and shining
Don't want to scare him away from me
Oh, how I love him

I've got to have faith in you and let you feel free
That life would be as good as you are to me
Honey I don't want to mess this up one more time
Promise I will leave my troubles behind

My baby loves me when I'm down and out
My baby loves me when I'm up and shining
Don't want to scare him away from me
Oh, how I love him

My baby loves me when I'm down and out
My baby loves me when I'm up and shining
Don't want to scare him away from me
Don't want to scare him away from me
Oh, how I love him
Oh how I love him
How I loove
How I love him
How I love him

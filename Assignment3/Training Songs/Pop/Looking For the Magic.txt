All my life I'm looking for the magic
I've been looking for the magic
Fantasize on a silly little tragic
I've been looking for the magic
In my eyes

Oh, oh, oh, I'm
Looking for the magic in my eyes
In my eyes
Baby in my eyes

Only child is a silly little ragged
She's been looking for the magic
Stay awhile til the city is a desert
She's been looking for the treasure
In my eyes

Because a photograph is
Like an hourglass out of time
And then I never laughed
Because I never had no time

Oh, oh, oh, I'm
Looking for the magic in my eyes
In your eyes
Baby in your eyes

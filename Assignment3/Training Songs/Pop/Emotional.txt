Yeah

I can't promise you pearls and diamonds, I got no Rolls Royce
And you know it's a good thing if I give you any choice
But you've heard all this before hand, now baby won't you dry your eyes
And take some disappointment from our lives

And it's a delicate situation, I'll be a gentle as I can
Seven long years of rock and roll should show you where I am
But you heard all this before hand, about the things that I don't do
We're gonna make it by this time, it's up to you

And you know you're so emotional
You're so emotional
You never use your head, give your heart a rest
You're so emotional

Yes, you know you're so emotional, emotional
So god damn down right emotional
Now use your head, give your heart a rest
So emotional

You're so emotional, yeah, you're so emotional
You never use your head, give your heart a rest
You're so emotional

You're so emotional, emotional
I guess that's why I love you so
You never use your head, give your heart a rest
You're so emotional

And you know you're so emotional, emotional
So god damn down right emotional
You don't use your head, give your heart a rest
You're so emotional
You know you're so emotional
You're so emotional

We got no place left to go
Sit on by and

I never need a drink
I ain't got no time to think
Well, I never need a drink
And I ain't got no time to think, baby

In the dark I need to smoke
And it ain't no joke
And I ain't got no time for me to think, 'bout you baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my baby

You're so emotional, emotional
You're god damn down right emotional
Use your head, give your heart a rest

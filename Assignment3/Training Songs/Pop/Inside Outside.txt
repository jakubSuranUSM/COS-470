Inside outside, under my skin
Never ending love I don't know where it begins?
I don't know where it ends, I don't know how high
I don't know how deep, I don't know how wide
Outside inside around the world
Never ending love envelops me like a cloud
I feel you in front, I feel you behind 
I feel you up above, And I feel you at the side

And you, you're all over me, you're all over me
Your banner is over me, I give it all â€˜cos 

You still captivate me, fascinate me
You still captivate me, saturate me

Inside outside, pulling me in
No matter where I run I know you'll never give in
I see you in the storm, I see you in a kiss
I've been around the world and never found a love like this

You're all over me, you're all over me
You're everything I want to be
I'm all over you, you're everything I want to see
You're all over me

You, still captivate me, fascinate me
You still captivate me, saturate me
You still captivate me, liberate me
You still captivate me

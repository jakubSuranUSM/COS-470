Though I've tried before to tell him
Of the feelings I have for him
In my heart

Every time that I come near him
I just loose my nerve like I've done
From the start

Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story?
Of the thousand rainy days
Since we first met

Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me 
Who ends up getting wet

Cause every lil thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

I resolve to call him up
A thousand times a day
And ask him if hell marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reached the phone
Long before my tongues tripped me
Must I always be alone

Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Cause every little thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Goes on goes on

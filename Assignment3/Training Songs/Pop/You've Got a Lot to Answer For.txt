You've got a lot to answer for, 
But baby I love you.
But baby I love you.
If it turns to blue, what are we gonna do
If it stays on white, will it be alright.
If it all turns sour, it's too late
The CSA are bound to find you soon.
If you want to talk, then talk about it
You could talk all night if you wanted
You could talk all night and day, but
I'd think by now you know exactly
How to end up here
Are you looking for the sun?
Are you looking out for me? 

You've got a lot to answer for, 
But baby I love you. 
But baby I love you.
You said I got the looks
Well I got the means
Let's get together, mix each other's genes
Let's get together, mix each other's genes
Can't buy myself a future,
My DNA will be past it's sell by date
Are you looking for a son? 
See are you holding out for me?

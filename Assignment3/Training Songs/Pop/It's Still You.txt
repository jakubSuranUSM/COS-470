You talked about forever,
And it scared me half to death
You used words like "commitment"
And I couldn't catch my breath
So I turned my back on love
Must have been out of my mind
'cause everything I want from life, I left behind

Chorus:
It's still you
If it's not too late
Forever sounds just wonderful
I needed time to clear this crazy head of mine
It's still you
Still you

The world is just a desert
Every day you're not with me
In no time I discovered
There's pain in being free
If I have the chance again
To be part of you once more
I promise
I won't be the fool I was before

Chorus

Night after night I cried and cried
I walked out on love
But love hadn't died

Chorus

And these days
Forever sounds just fine

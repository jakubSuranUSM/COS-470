Party's in my head
Party's in my head
Hey

I don't care if the whole club is dead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
If you won't let me in
Dancing on the street instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
I don't care about the VIP
'Cause every single DJ is inside me
If you dunno where to go
Stay close to me instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head

Me against the world
The world against me
Those who can't feel or see what I see
The ones who stay close
Hear what I hear
I'll be your host the music is here

I'm on a train again
Jamming on my own again
They think I'm insane
There's no music playing
Why wait on Friday lights
Since I'm out on every night
If no one's around I'm my own crowd

I don't care if the whole club is dead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
If you won't let me in
Dancing on the street instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
I don't care about the VIP
'Cause every single DJ is inside me
If you dunno where to go
Stay close to me instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head

Imagine with me
Just like I said
Millions of us
The sound in your head
Feel it vibrate
From state to state
Moving those plates
Be an earthquake

I'm on a train again
Jamming on my own again
They think I'm insane
There's no music playing
Why wait on Friday lights
Since I'm out on every night
If no one's around I'm my own crowd

I don't care if the whole club is dead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
If you won't let me in
Dancing on the street instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head

I don't care about the VIP
'Cause every single DJ is inside me
If you dunno where to go
Stay close to me instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
I've got the whole world on my guest list
No one that precious
No one that precious, yeah
Close your eyes and turn up to this
Yeah, turn up to this
Yeah, turn up to this yeah

I'm in my world
And my own world we getting
With every boy
And every single girl, yeah
And every one
And every one's in me
No matter where I'm gonna be

I don't care if the whole club is dead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
If you won't let me in
Dancing on the street instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head

I don't care about the VIP
'Cause every single DJ is inside me
If you dunno where to go
Stay close to me instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head

I don't care if the whole club is dead
The party's in my head
If you won't let me in
Dancing on the street instead
The party's in my head

I don't care about the VIP
â€˜Cause every single DJ is inside me
If you dunno where to go
Stay close to me instead
'Cause the party's in my head
The party's in my head
Party's in my head

Lady arrogance you've really got it made
You can pick and choose
Your debts are always neatly paid
Yes you've got us all at your beck and call
Does it please you?

Lady confidence your path is paved with gold
Played your tricks so well
He gladly bought the lies you told
Though I don't admire your style
Can't help falling for your smile
Let you use me
You seduce me
And confuse me

Come to your senses for I've had enough
He's got the money but I offer love
Well you made it clear that beggars can't be choosers
But you must admit that winners need their losers

Lady arrogance it took some time to see
You were never more
Than just a rich man's luxury
Life was built on charity
Driven by fatality
For he left you
He just kept you
He'll forget you

Now that you lost him you're begging for love
I no longer want you cause I've seen enough
Does it hurt to find out winners can be losers
It might help to know that beggars can be choosers

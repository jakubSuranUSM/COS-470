The more I learn the less I know
Could you make mine straight absolute?
The more I fail the less I try
Ask not of me the reason why
 
Oh, my Sentimental Fool
Have I got a tale for you
Oh, my Sentimental Fool
 
The woman I love is not content
The life I made - it ain't what I meant
The space I'm in is filled with love
The state I'm in is pitiful
 
Oh, my Sentimental Fool
Have I got a tale for you
Oh, my Sentimental Fool
Have I got a tale for you...
 
But, when she calls my name
We're almost happy - she's almost like you
Yes, when she calls my name
We're almost there, man - she's almost like you
 
The longer I live the less I believe
And all I lost is all I need
The life I made is filled with regret
And I can't tell the half of it
The woman I love has lost her faith
And I just watch as she fades away
The space I'm in is filled with love
The shape I'm in ain't beautiful
 
Oh, my Sentimental Fool
Have I got a tale for you...
I`m draining the glass for you
 
Do you see my girl?
She's almost like you...

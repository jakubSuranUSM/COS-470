Where did you go when I arrived
What was that look, saw in your eyes
Nothing is what it appears
I'm a bit more refined in my recent years

She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't 

It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out

do you believe in things that you hear
Maybe you're wrong
It isn't clear
Another excuse for me to ignore
It's not quite as simple as it was before

She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't 

It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out

I'm giving in
It's coming out
You gave it away
I'm thinking about
Not taking it
You're faking it
You're such a sad girl
Sad girl
Were did you leave
Why did you go
What were you thinking
I'd like to know
If walking away is all it's about
Then why did it take so long to figure out

She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't 

It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time
It's only

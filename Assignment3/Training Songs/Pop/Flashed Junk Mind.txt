When we were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

When we were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the citylife
Flashlights when we’re falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

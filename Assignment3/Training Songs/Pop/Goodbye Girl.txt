Footsteps echo on familiar streets
Crossing bridges never burned
I am tired of playing hide and seek
Is this all that I have learned?

Looking for a diamond in the dark
I was sure you were the one
You held me spellbound while you made your mark
Now the damage has been done

Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye
I'm afraid when I turn out the light

Words you say while you're asleep
Where you were and what you did last night
Those are secrets you can keep, yeah

Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye
Tied to you blood on the wire

Don't you know you've pushed me much too far
Just who do you think you are
I can't escape 
Must all roads lead to Rome?

Every time I say goodbye, you hypnotize
Footsteps echo on familiar streets
Crossing bridges never burned
I am tired of playing hide and seek
Is this all that I have learned?

Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize my eyes
Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize

I can't say goodbye
Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize my eyes
Goodbye girl, it's a game we play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

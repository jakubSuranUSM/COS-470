You're so terrific
Ooooh you never done it like that
You never been this way before
To be specific
Ooooh you never done it like that
Who went and opened up the door?
My lips are burnin'
Yeah, you never done it like that
I thought the flame was dead and gone
But you been learnin'
Yeah you never done it like that
How long has this been goin' on?

Ooooh, ooooh, who's been teachin' you?
Show me the man and let me shake his hand
Hey look at me, I feel just like Columbus
I did discover you're some kind of lover

My mind is blowin'
Ooooh you never done it like that
You got me climbin' up the wall
My love is growin'
Yeah, you never done it like that
You know you made me ten feet tall

Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it, You never done it
You never done it like that

Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it, You never done it
You never done it like that

Oh what a feelin'
Ooooh you never done it like that
Not since I can remember when
I'm on the ceiling
Hey you never done it like that
Looks like we got it on again

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it, You never done it
You never done it like that

Ooh what you're doin'
Do it again
Ooh what you're doin'
Do it again
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it, You never done it
You never done it like that

Ooh what you're doin'
Do it again
Ooh what you're doin'
Ooh what you're doin'
You never done it, You never done it
You never done it like that

(j.astrop/k.moline)

When I met you, your heart was broken
You were sure that love was passing you by
Well I can help you now that you've spoken
I'll tell you something I can no longer hide

I'm all you need
So I'm saying, I know I can help you
You'd be crazy if you don't let me try
I'm all you need

All you need is a little attention
All you need is a real-life fantasy
All you need is hot-blooded affection
All you need is a little love from me
All you need is the right kind of love
All you need is to realize you are free
All you need is some time to discover (that)
All you need is a little kiss from me

It's so silly to lock away your feelings
If you hurt so bad you don't have to lie
So I'm saying, I know I can help you
I can help you if you stay here right by my side

I'm all you need
So I'm saying, I know I can fix it
You'd be crazy if you don't let me try
I'm all you need

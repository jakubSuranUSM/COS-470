Well, I lost my faith in fellow man
I've been living alone for so long
That I don't know who I am
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?

I've been waiting a lifetime
For someone like you to set me free
Why did it take so long?
For you to come and rescue me
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?

'Cause you're beautiful and everyone knows it
And you're everything I want you to be
I got sunshine on my face, my smile shows it
Well it can't be wrong, 'cause you're so right for me

You're so right for me
Yeah, yeah
You're so right for me

Well, it just don't matter if it's wrong or right
I didn't know something could feel so good
I've been wasting all my time
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?

'Cause you're beautiful and everyone knows it
And you're everything I want you to be
I got sunshine on my face, my smile shows it
Well, it can't be wrong, 'cause you're so right for me

'Cause you're beautiful and everyone knows it
And you're everything I want you to be
I got sunshine on my face, my smile shows it
Well, it can't be wrong, 'cause you're so right for me

You're just so right for me
You're just so right for me
You're just so right for me

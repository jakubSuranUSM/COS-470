Babe, I'm gonna leave you,
Tell you when I'm gonna leave you,
Leave you when ol' summer-time, summer comes a-rolling,
Leave you when ol' summer comes along.

Babe, I'd like to stay here,
You know I'd really like to stay here,
My feet start goin' down, goin' down that highway,
My feet start goin' down, goin' down alone.

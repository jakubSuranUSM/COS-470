Could you be the one who wants to turn me into something new?
Could you be the one, the one who has to make life fun of you

So far gone
So far gone
I'd love to turn you on

Could you be the one, you always complicate my thoughts of you
Could you be the one, you always stop for me to drive right through

So far gone
So far gone
I'd love to turn you on

Understand my way,
I hope you will someday
I understand my way

Did you be the one that wants to turn me into something new
Did you be the one, you always complicate my thoughts of you

So far gone
So far gone
I'd love to turn you on

Understand my way,
I hope you will someday
I understand my way

So far gone
So far gone
I'd love to turn you on

Catch the bus by half past three 
Otherwise you'll find you're walking home 
The forecast is for rain 
Two weeks in an awkwars squeeze 
He just ignores the phone and turns 
The t.v. up when he gets in 

My favourite thing has gone away 
And I know it won't be easy now-but I'll manage somehow 
I stole his shoes and ran away 
Trying jolly hard to see if we can catch him round the bend 
Oh no!

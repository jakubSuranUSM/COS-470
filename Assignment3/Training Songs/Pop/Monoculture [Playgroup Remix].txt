Why don't I just give up
And do myself a favor?
My life is slowly turning gray
And losing all its flavor

Everything the same
Again and again and again
Everything the same
Again and again and again

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)

No change
The world's gone insane
(Monoculture)
Everything that's old
Is new again
(Monoculture)

Monoculture
Monoculture

Why don't I just give up
And submit to the great God of Bland
All my exotic gestures
No longer in demand

Everything the same
Again and again and again
Everything the same
Again and again and again

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)

Monoculture
It's the same

Monoculture
(Monoculture)
Mediocre
(Mediocre)
Monoculture
(Monoculture)
Mediocre

Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)
Over and over and over
Again and again and again
(Monoculture)

No change
The world has gone insane
(Monoculture)
Everything that's old
Is new again
(Monoculture)

Monoculture
Mediocre

The same, ordinary
Boring, mediocre
The same, ordinary
Boring, monoculture

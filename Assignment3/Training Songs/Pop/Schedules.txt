Thought I saw you in the crowd tonight
But I know you're somewhere else, you're just on my mind
I don't need you, but it feels so good
To just say it as it is and be understood

Oh, woah
I don't care 'bout perfect timing, this is it

I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that my schedule is fucked up
But, baby, you know you're the same (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that I'm begging for trouble
But for once, I'ma misbehave (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
I think we're a hit (oh oh)

I guess now's the time to have fun
We can keep this going even if we're on the run
We got something special right now
Feel free to call me up, I'm always down

Oh, woah
I don't care 'bout perfect timing, this is it

I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that my schedule is fucked up
But, baby, you know you're the same (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that I'm begging for trouble
But for once, I'ma misbehave (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
I think we're a hit (oh oh)

Ay yi yeah (oh)
Ay yi yeah (oh, oh)
I think we're a hit, wooh (oh, oh)
Ay yi yeah (oh)
Ay yi yeah (oh, oh)

I think that we are, think that we are, I think that we are
I think that we are, think that we are, I think that we are
I think that we are, think that we are, I think that we are
I think that we are, think that we are

I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that my schedule is fucked up
But, baby, you know you're the same (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
I think we're a hit, wooh (oh)
I know that I'm begging for trouble
But for once, I'ma misbehave (oh)
And that's why (oh oh)
That's why I think we're a hit (oh oh)

(I think that we are, think that we are, think that we are)
Ay yi yeah
(I think that we are, think that we are, think that we are)
I think we're a hit (oh oh)
(I think that we are, think that we are, think that we are)
Ay yi yeah
(I think that we are, think that we are)
That's why I think we're a hit, wooh

(Watch out)
I creep around slowly
And receive from the tv
Signals about my life

I've no dedication
To my medication
I'm otherwise occupied
An ambitious plan

To bring attention to myself
A cerebral hitman
Permeates my mental health

But, but I don't want to be left out
So will you take me too
When the supper is handed out
There will be room for two
Now I'm flying away
Stupefy and sedate

At my own invitation
A new celebration
Of how I became a man
This whole evolution

And manic confusion
To unlock and understand
In a past life
I'm sure I was a princess then

A princess wife
My hypnotist he took me there

But, but I don't want to be left out
So will you take me too
When the supper is handed out
There will be room for two

Now I'm flying away
Stupefy and sedate

And now you show up bright and clear eyed
Now you show up bright and clear eyed

But, but I don't want to be left out
So will you take me too
When the supper is handed out
There will be room for two

Now I'm flying away
Stupefy and sedate

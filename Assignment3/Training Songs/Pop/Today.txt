Today get your cinnamon and pray 
Today get your cinnamon and pray 
For the beauty of our land and 
For the secrets, for the moments 
That we use to share 

Leather, covers, broken glasses, 
Playing music and the rain, 
Airplanes, morbid phrases turning into dust 

Spinning around, swimming, jumping 
In a world of sound, you are always 
In my favourite dreams, 
Lovely, tender and proud 
You may be 
Running around, searching, looking for something 
To find while I'm still here waiting for you, 
Do you see me at all my sweet sweet sweet love? 

Today there is nothing left to say 
Today there is nothing left to say 
We all know that 
Just a word can break as into pieces 
So that we cannot forget 

Leather, covers, broken glasses, 
Playing music and the rain, 
Airplanes, morbid phrases turning into dust 

Spinning around, swimming, jumping 
In a world of sounds 
You are always in my favourite dreams, 
Lovely tender and proud 
You may be 
Running around searching, looking for something 
To find while I'm still here waiting for you, 
Do you see me at all my sweet love? 

Black and white photographs, 
Dirty clothes, two guitars 
Dirty clothes, two guitarsâ€¦ 

Spinning around, swimming, jumping 
In a world of sounds you are always in my favourite 
Dreams, lovely tender and proud 
You may be 
Running around searching, looking for something to find 
While I'm still here waiting for you 
Do you see me at all my sweet sweet sweet love?

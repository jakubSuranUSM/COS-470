Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy girl, my, my, my, my baby

Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
And the boys from the casino dance
With their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all those silly New York virgins by the score

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever
Oh, I mean it Sandy girl, oh my baby
Hey, Sandy girl, my, my, my, my baby

Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night
She said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie
For tellin' fortunes better than they do?
For me, this boardwalk life is through
You ought to quit this scene, too

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy girl, my, my, my, my baby

Hey, Sandy girl, oh my baby
Hey, Sandy girl, my, my, my, my baby
Hey, Sandy girl, oh my baby
Hey, Sandy girl, my, my, my, my baby

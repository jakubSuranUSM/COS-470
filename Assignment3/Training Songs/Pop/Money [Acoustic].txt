Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Imagine if money just grew on trees
I would spend the whole day planting seeds
I wish that I could give you everything
And treat you to the world's most beautiful things

I know you don't ask for nothing
You don't want material
But I want to show you heaven
And you know someday I will

I'd give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like kings and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

I know that being rich can't buy your love
Even if we're broke we won't give a f*ck
'Cause you and me will always be enough
But you know I ain't giving up

I know you don't ask for nothing
You don't want material
But I want to show you heaven
And you know someday I will

I'll give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like kings and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money

Ah, ah, ah
If I've got you (ah)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I've got you (ah)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose

I'd give you every diamond ring
Get that beach house by the sea
We'd be living like king and queens
If I had money, money, money
Get you every pair of shoes
Saint Tropez on a yacht we'll cruise
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I had money, money, money

Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money
Where's the money (where's the money, where's the money)
If I've got you (where's the money)
We'd have nothing in the world to lose
If I've got you
If I've got you
We'd have nothing in the world to lose

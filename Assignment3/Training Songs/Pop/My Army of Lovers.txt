Be be ay be be ay
Around the world around the world
Around the world
Be be ay be be ay

A time to go a time to live
A place to be a love to give
When traveling around the world
My army of lovers

Disney World to Yellowknife
America my way of life
Riding on a wave of love
My army of lovers

A cherry moon a night of fun
We dance into the rising sun
I lost my soul in Tokyo
My army of lovers

Around the world around the world
Around the world 
Be be ay be be ay

St. Tropez to la defense
A perfume Latin lovers' scent
A pleasure sweet my body heat
My army of lovers

My gentlemen polite and proud
From London town I wave goodbye
The Scorpio is rising high
My army of lovers

Around the world around the world
Around the world 
Be be ay be be ay

Pour l'univers on quitte la terre
Hereux joyeux
L'amour de dieux n'a pas de frontiÃ¾res
Pour l'armÃ¾e qui voyage sous la lumiÃ¾re

In crystal snow my palace guard
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
Come shoot me with your laser beam
My army of lovers

Taj Mahal I've come to rest
A royal bed a lovers' nest
Classic art we here explore
My army of lovers

Around the world around the world
Around the world 
Be be ay be be ay

Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world 
Be be ay be be ay

Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world 
Be be ay be be ay

Once upon a time
I had a dream I had a vision
Of that someone that was missing
In my life
Here I am, looking back
On the road I used to travel
Through the darkness
Through the times of sacrifice
I can't believe how things can change so fast
I can see it in your eyes
We're gonna last

With every bit of me with all my heart
With every single breath I'm gonna love you
Fall into my arms tonight
And make it allright
If you ever come to doubt these words
Let me be the one to break it to you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
With every bit of me

Love will come and go
But as long as you are with me
I am happy to be someone
In this world
You're the day
That changed it all
You're the nights I will remember
For as long as I am walking on this earth

With every bit of me with all my heart
With every single breath I'm here for you now
I'm gonna love you endlessly
With every bit of me

If you can dream it
If you believe me
Like I believe it
Standing here with you
You brought me something
Right out of nothing
You are the one thing
That makes it all come true

I can see it in your eyes
We're gonna last

With every bit of me with all my heart
With every single breath I'm gonna love you
Fall into my arms tonight
And make it allright
If you ever come to doubt these words
Let me be the one to break it to you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
With every bit of me

Oh, baby
Fall into my arms tonight
And make it allright
If you ever come to doubt these words
Let me be the one to break it to you
I'm gonna love you endlessly
With every bit of me

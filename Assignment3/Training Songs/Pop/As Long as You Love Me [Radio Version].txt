[Repeat: x2]
Shoo-do-do-opp
Shoo-do-do-do-di-do
Shoo-do-do-opp
Shoo-do-do-dop-di-do

Can I ever talk with you
And me walk you home from school
I got something that's on my mind and I don't know just what to do
See girl I've been watchin you and I think I'm a little sprung
Can't seem to get my mind off it
I'm thinkin' about you
I think that your the one
So won't you just listen to me
There's so much I wanna say
Girl I got this love for you
You can have it your way everyday
I will treat you right
I will never lie
Girl I promise to you that I won't make you cry
Girl be straight for me
Tell me your feeling the way that I do

[Chorus: x2]
Girl give you your love
I'll give you my heart
Lets put them together see what we can start
I wanna be with you
You wanna be with me
I wanna be with you

All those people they talk about
Its only a puppy love
They say our feelings could not be real
We know the deal yeah
I just don't know what to do cause girl I'm so crazy 'bout you
And I know its not wrong because I wanna be everything that you need
Shoo-do-do-opp
Girl wanna walk you home from school
Wanna help you do your homework, homework
And when you a kiss I'll shooo! I'll be the one
I wanna be the one
Girl if you say yes to me
I promise that I'll not
No I'll never leave I'll be right by your side
With my love for you I can fly high

[Chorus]

Girl, I wanna be everything that you need
'Cause I aim to please
And that's the way it is

My hearts on the line
Don't take your time
Your still free

[Chorus: x2]

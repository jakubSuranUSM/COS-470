There's dancing
Behind movie scenes
Behind the movie scenes
Sadi Rani

She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning
Past the evening
To the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the 45
Well it's a brimful of Asha on the 45
And dancing
Behind movie scenes

Behind those movie scenes
Asha Bhosle
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning

Past the evening
To the end of the light
Brimful of Asha on the 45
Well it's a brimful of Asha on the 45

And singing
Illuminate thee main streets
And the cinema aisles
We don't care bout no

Gov't warnings,
'bout their promotion of a simple life
And the dams they're building
Brimful of Asha on the 45

Well it's a brimful of Asha on the 45
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Mine's on the 45

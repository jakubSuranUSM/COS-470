Is this the night I finally will see you?
Is this the time I've waited for so long?
Night after night I play this show without you
Can't help but think about you in every song

Back in the wings somebody says "Five minutes"
And soon the lights will dim out in the hall
I check the mirror at the side of the stage, I'm waiting
Ready to meet the one I want most of all

I see your face in the crowd and I am crazy for you
You see me crying out loud
Millions of faces, a sea before me, I can see
Only you are the face in the crowd

With every song I really get to know you
A crowd of one though there's twenty thousand more
We are alone in the midst of all this madness
Will you be there when I walk out the backstage door?

I see your face in the crowd and I am crazy for you
You see me crying out loud
Millions of faces, a sea before me, I can see
Only you are the face in the crowd

Before I know it the show's at its conclusion
I close my eyes on this visual love affair
And as I leave the theater, crowds are waiting
I turn to sign the last book and you are there

I see your face in the crowd and I am crazy for you
You see me crying out loud
Millions of faces, a sea before me, I can see
Only you were the face in the crowd

I see your face in the crowd and I am crazy for you
You see me crying out loud
Millions of faces, a sea before me, I can see
Only you are the face in the crowd

I see your face in the crowd and I am crazy for you
You see me crying out loud
Millions of faces, a sea before me, I can see
Only you are the face in the crowd

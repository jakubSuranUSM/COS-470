They don’t know what they believe 
So we stare and nod as they think out loud 
Trying our best to fit in 
As we fight for breath in this stifling crowd 
And the time races by when you’re having some fun 
But it’s plodding along now at quarter to one 
As the night tries our patience we’re hitting a wall 
I slip off to the side like I’m taking a call to observe 

Extroverts at play 
Egos run amuck 
I’d like them well enough 
If they would just shut up 
But we will persevere 
By sheer force of will 
We’ll stoically endure 
This social overkill 

Tomorrow we’ll take the whole day 
To recuperate in a private place 
Sleeping or reading a book 
Our resilience now is our saving grace 
So just try to imagine, it’s not such a stretch 
I’m the life of the party and it is the death of me 
Here in my eyes you’re the belle of the ball 
With the hint of a smile you enchant more than all of the

Maybe someday this will 
Come to us more naturally but 
Until then we’ll have to pretend 

We’ll hone our acting skills 
Fake it ’til we make it baby 
Until then we’ll have to pretend.

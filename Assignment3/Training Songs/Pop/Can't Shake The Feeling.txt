The minute I met you I couldn't forget you
I knew I was falling in love
Ever since then to see you again
Was all I've been thinking of

I have found emotions stronger than anything

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I wanted to know you but how could I show you
Life has new meaning for me
The second I saw you I knew I adored you
That's what true love should be

I have found devotion and you are my everything

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I have found emotions stronger than anything

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last, I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
And I just can't shake the feeling, no, no, no

I can't shake the feeling (feeling)

Uhh
Uhh

My baby went to Africa
With the dirty lens photographer
My baby land in jungle land
With a US body and a real light tan
(US body and a real light tan)

My baby went to Africa
My baby went to Africa

Sing
(Uhh)
Sing
(Uhh)

My baby went to Africa
With a make-up man and a love-sick lover
She get a couple o' grand and a two-piece suit
Let the folks back home see the native beauty
(Folks back home see the native beauty)

My baby went to Africa
My baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa
I packed my bags and gotta get to her
Before the lions and tigers try to jump on her bones

And the boys sing
(Uhh)
Africa, Africa
(Uhh)
And the girls sing
(Uhh, uhh)

My baby went to Africa
I packed my bags and I'll get to her
Before the lions and tigers try to jump on her bones

Sing
Baby went to Africa
(Africa, Africa)
Baby went to Africa
(Africa, Africa)
Baby went to Africa
(Lions and tigers try to jump on her bones)

Baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa
(Let the folks back home see the native beauty)
Baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa
(I'm on my way)
Baby went to Africa, baby went to Africa

I know cause I've seen it
It was grey and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more

[Bridge]
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as they come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
That this is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
I know we are in the knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

[Bridge]

[Chorus: x2]

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ectascy
I know what's best for me
I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple Yellow Red and Blue

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah)

When I grow up I wanna be
A movie star or on TV
'Cause workin' just don't work for me
But I can't focus feeling hopeless
So I'll just sit back, try to relieve

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ectascy
I know what's best for me
I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple Yellow Red and Blue

When I grow up I wanna be
A rich-kid born celebrity
It's not greed, but necessity
Now I don't focus on the hopeless
When I look out it's only for me

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ectascy
I know what's best for me
I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple Yellow Red and Blue

I just
Wanna be evil
I just
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
I just wanna be evil

I just
Wanna be evil
I just
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Purple Yellow Red and Blue

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah)

All that I needed
Is something to believe in
Because everything just falls in place like that

I remember like it's yesterday
The song we used to sing
What was it's name
Danced together till the break of day
And I knew I'd never be the same
Now so many winters turned to spring
But where is the love that I thought they would bring
Sit and think about that girl from Spain
And how we used to sing

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa

London, Amsterdam and gay Paris
Don't mean that much to me, they're all the same
People falling but no one for me
They can never match that girl from Spain
Now so many years have passed me by
And still I long for that sweet Spanish sky
SÃ¨norita do you think of me and of this melody

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa

A box of letters and a photograph
Are all that's left to keep our memory
Sometimes I swear that I can hear you laugh
Like a ghost of what could never be
At night I will look across the sea
And wonder if you could be looking at me
The ocean haunts me like a symphony that plays our melody

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, Europa

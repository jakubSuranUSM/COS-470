To the whole room, her eyes are numb
As she reads from a true love story
From the pages of a book, her lover comes
Her heart bleeds; it's a true love story

Misty shape in the window by her bed
Dreaming on what she's read
Hero takes her hand and leads her through
Who knows what this night will do?

[Chorus] 
Only in the blue night, he comes to her
Only in the blue night
That's when the whole night belongs to her
Only in the blue night

I see a dark face by the moon's glow
As she reads from a true love story
Beckoning hand scratching at the window
Her heart bleeds; it's a true love story

Misty path and the night is endless.
She could be a queen or a desert princess.
Hero takes her hand and leads her through.
Who knows what this night will do?

[Chorus]

Only in the blue night
Only in the blue night
That's when the whole night belongs to her
Only in the blue night

She wants to break free
From the cold light of reality
And as she drifts away
I hear her voice say, "come away."

Dark skin glistening by the silver light
This is the hero come tonight
And taking her hand, he leads her through
Who knows what this night will do?

[Chorus x 2] 
 
Blue, blue night
Only in the blue night
Blue, blue night
Only in the blue night

Blue, blue night
Only in the blue night
Blue, blue night

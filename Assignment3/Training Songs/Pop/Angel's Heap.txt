News travels fast, there's an old wreck in the underpass
Wine in a glass and a well traveled bed, down the length
And breadth of the motorway, down the information highway

I took a ride in an angels heap
Yeah, I took a ride and she took me away
To where the hills are steep, yeah I took a ride

In the still mind of a child, there's a live bird on her shoulder
She could swallow a lie like she's drinking a flagon of beer
I'll never be the same again, let the black wheels fly over

I took a ride in an angels heap and she took me away
To where the air was sweet and she made me come alive
In a red vinyl seat, yeah I took a ride, let the black wheels fly over

(We're prescribing you a medication, f*ck)

Doctor says that I'm so lonely
A mistake on the painting of my family
But that big smudge is what i love
Give me a Grenade and I'll tape to my face

Gettin' drunk at quarter to one
'Cause my dad is a geezer and he keys up my mum
You put it in my mouth, I’m gonna bite down
If that ain't normal then the pope is a right clown

Lost in the White light, white heat
Fire shots in our arms on your street
Lost in the White light, white heat
I'm blank why you shouting at me

I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation
I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
'Cause I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation

Woo
Doctor says, "Don't fight that feeling"
But my head is stuck to the ceiling
I can't get it off
You superglued it on
It's like I'm a bad scene stuck in a wet dream

My heart is a bomb, it just ticks along
With a bang, bang, bang on a beat up tin drum
I'm an experiment of young irrelevance
I'm insecure so I got tattoo of an elephant

Lost in the White light, white heat
Fire shots in our arms on your street
Lost in the White light, white heat
I'm blank why you shouting at me

I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation
I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
'Cause I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation

You cannot pretend there’s no dirt on your shirt
'Cause that’s not how it works, no, that’s not how it works
You try to perceive that you're so squeaky clean
But that’s not how it works, that's not that’s not how it works
You cannot pretend there’s no dirt on your shirt
'Cause that’s not how it works, no, that’s not how it works
You try to perceive that you're so squeaky clean
But that’s not how it works, that's not that’s not how it works

I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation
I just wanna take my
I just wanna take my
My medication
'Cause I just wanna find my
I just wanna find my
My motivation

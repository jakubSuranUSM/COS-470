Unspoken words 
You know just what to do 
The rhythm moves like 
Second nature to you 
So primitive  it fits you like a glove 
Instinctive as to make love 
Let's go 

Before the groove hits 
The move you want it to 
And Uncle Funk wants 
It over tonight 
So  just dance along to 
Wherever they take you tonight 
You just bang it all up and out 
Bang it all on time 

Let the beat  let the beat be your lover 
Free your mind, let the beat take you over 
Throw all inhibitions up into the wind 

Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I wanna 

Well, if you move to the groove 
The way I do 
There's nothing else in the world 
That compares 
And if you dance to release the part of you 
That keeps telling you to be free 
Let it take you there 

Let the beat, let the beat be your lover 
Free your mind, let the beat take you over 
A groove premonition your feet can't ignore 

Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I wanna 

Oh in the air tonight 
There's breathing in the wind 
Oh in the air tonight 
The beat is; it's going on 
It's going on, it goes: 
Let the beat, let the beat be your lover 
Free your mind, let the beat take you over 
A groove premonition your feet can't ignore 

Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I want to go bang 
Let's go bang 
I wanna

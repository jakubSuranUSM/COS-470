Sometimes it never rains
It can't rain all the time
And if I seem to make no sense
I make no sense sometimes
Sometimes it never shines
It can't shine all the time
And I can't speak through one more scene
I can't talk all the time
There's a promise in your mouth
Is that what this was all about?
We've got to suck it in and shout 
It's been a long long time
Sometimes I never talk
I can't talk all the time
And I can't see to find my feet
I can't sleep all the time
You've got to stop before you talk
Because it's all been said before
You can't stop knocking down my door
It's been a long long long long time
Sunday's child will fall from grace
And heaven holds the hands that pray
There's nothing here for me to say
With my name upon your face
There's no one counting down these days
There's no one here to hear you say
It's been a long long long long time
Sometimes it never rains
It can't rain all the time
And if I seem to make no sense
I make no sense sometimes
Sometimes it never shines
It can't shine all the time
And I can't speak through one more scene
I can't talk all the time
There's a promise in your mouth
Is that what this was all about?
We've got to suck it in and shout 
It's been a long long time
You've got to stop before you talk
Because it's all been said before
You can't stop knocking down my door
It's been a long long long long time
Sometimes it never rains
It can't rain all the time

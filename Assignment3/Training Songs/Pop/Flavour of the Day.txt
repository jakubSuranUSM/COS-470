Wish it was always summer
Summer all year
We're outside
Under skies that seem near
My thoughts are clear
When you are with me
No regrets and no fear

we're dancing in the street
Making our lives complete

wish it was always summer
Summer all year
We're walking barefoot
All the clouds disappear
And you will be my lover
Whisper in my ear
Sing all the lovesongs
Downtown at the pier

we're getting on our feet
Trying to get on the beat
You know it's easy when you got
Somebody right next to you

will you be my flavour of the day - come my way
I really need you here in my arms
And if you never meant to stay - that's okay
I'll be your flavour of the day

wish it was always summer
Summer all year
Nightswimming in the ocean
Starlight so clear
And it is never raining
Never raining, dear
But only when you're with me
Just when you're near

we're dancing in the street
Making our lifes complete
You know it's easy when got
Somebody right next to you

will you be my flavour of the day - come my way
I really need you here by my side
And if you never meant to stay - that's okay
I really need you, please hold me tight
Will you be my flavour of the day
Will you be my flavour of the day
Oh girl if you want me
Come my way

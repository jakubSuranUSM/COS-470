I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose

I remember days when we were all alone
If you would ever leave me
I would call your phone
We would talk for days
And never leave my home
I think about it

Always found a reason to be strong apart
Always wondered if and when you'd break my heart
You would try and argue with me from the start
I can live without it

Come on and baby take my hand now
Remember when we used to say now
It's where it all began
It's where we always hide it

You're tired of being disregarded
You wonder why you're broken hearted
We've been here times before
We've been here since it started

Yeah

I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose

Funny how we can leave things just the way they are
Having fun with you wasn't so bizarre
But we can never be more than an open scar

I think about it

Never took the time to ever wonder why
Could have been if we were caught that we'd be laughing or crying
But we would never learn because we both denied it
I can live without it

Come on and baby take my hand now
Remember when we used to say now
It's where it all began
It's where we always hide it

You're tired of being disregarded
You wonder why you're broken hearted
We've been here times before
We've been here since it started

Yeah

I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose
It's only for us two

I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose
It's only for us two

I win
I win
I win
I win
I win
I win
I win

I never counted on this
'cause that's the way that it goes, yeah
You used to be someone I knew,
Somebody I could understand but,
Now I don't know what to do
And I don't know who you are now
All the things I hear you say
You talk that way
You're a stranger
And I

I don't know where to be begin
Don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
This is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

And I remember your voice
Before this happened to us
But I could see
And I was sure
And everything was young and new but

We lost it too many times
And that's the way that it is
Lovers come and lovers go
When you think that you know,
It just isn't true, oh

I don't know where to be begin
Don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
This is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

I don't know where to be begin
Don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
This is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

Don't believe anymore

Don't believe anymore

I don't know where to be begin
Don't want to hear it again
I don't believe anymore
This is all I know
I know I've heard it before
I don't believe anymore

Oh, oh, oh

Don't believe anymore

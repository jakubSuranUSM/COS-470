The days are really getting longer now
The rain is gone
The sun is stronger now
So cast aside your inhibitions
And your raincoats too
The pretty gals are lying on the sand
They’re trying their best to get their bodies tanned
I don’t know why but when it’s summer all I think is you
So… come outside baby
Now the time is right
With your brand new shades
And your jeans so tight
Well the sun is burning and I’m getting hot for you
And never mind what other people say
They’re only praying for the rainy day
Make up your mind to have some fun and we’ll go out tonight (?)
That’s right
And when we’re dancing nothing can go wrong
The DJs playing all our favourite songs
And all my worries drift away when you hold me tight (So tight)
So, come outside baby
the time is right
with your brand new shades
and your jeans so tight
Well the sun is burning and I’m getting hot for you

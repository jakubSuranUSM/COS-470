Golden blunders come in pairs, they're very unaware
What they know is what they've seen
Education wasn't fun, but now that school is done
Higher learning's just begun
(Chorus)
You're gonna watch what you say for a long time
You're gonna suffer the guilt forever
You're gonna get in the way at the wrong time
You're gonna mess up things you thought you would never
Disappointment breeds contempt, it make you feel inept
Never thought you'd feel alone (at home)
His and hers forever more, throw your freedom out of the door
Before you find out what it's for
(Chorus)
Four weeks seemed like a long time then - but nine months is longer now
But even if you never speak again - you've already made the wedding vow
(Chorus)
Honeymoons will never start, bonds will blow apart
Just as fast as they were made
Men and women please beware : don't pretend you care
Nothing lasts when nothing's there
(Repeat Chorus)

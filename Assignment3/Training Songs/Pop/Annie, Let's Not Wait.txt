Found something crying it was my soul
I fed it milk, so wouldn't grow old
We crossed the borderline at dawn
And woke up in a field of corn

A farmer told me I was late
I better start oiling the gate
Said that, "Those who rush'll fall"
But I don't wanna wait for waves
I don't wanna wait at all

Annie, let's not wait, let's cross the river now
We could sit for years staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things they're so cute
But our dreams are all we really need to grow

I found something dying, it was my light
I had resigned itself, tonight
So I threw it out a fishing line and said
"Catch your will and then catch mine"

Oh, Annie, let's not wait, let's cross the river now
We could sit for years staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things, they're so cute
But in the end they're just a suit

Oh, Annie let's not wait, time's not on our side
Well, it never was, you know that deep inside
Oh, just look at you with your ruffled hair
Oh, I love you and that's all you need to know

Annie, Annie
Annie, Annie
Annie, Annie

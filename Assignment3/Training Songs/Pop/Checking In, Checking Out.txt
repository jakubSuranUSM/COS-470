If funny looks don't get you down
You could get on in this town
The drivers crawl along the curb
The thought of walking's quite absurd
The dumbest thing I've ever heard

Checking in and checking out
Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

The living church must move along
The Carmelites could use a song
A blessing father if you please
Help the hopeless in their need
They don't need this kind of sleaze

Checking in and checking out
Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

Here's a man who's run the marathon
Sad and lonely, now it's been and gone
Let me check upon my family
I wonder, do they still remember me
I'm on the run, on the fun run

Gifted artists need respect
True collectors must collect
There behind those rusty gates
Dodgy sculptured license plates
The gifted sit around and wait

Checking in and checking out
Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

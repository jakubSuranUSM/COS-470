I knew her since high school, we were seventeen
I was old enough to know she was old enough to dream
I try to remember, bring back memories
And you know that she is always on my mind

She knew what I needed, never let me down
She was always the last to leave, and the first to come around
I try to remember, bring back memories
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know that she is always on my mind

Every night in my dreams I still see her face
But she gave it up for me, she only gave me a taste
Every time I see her it comes back to me
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know, yes you know, yes you know

Oh yeah, always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know that she is always on my mind

Always on my mind
She's driving me crazy
Always on my mind
And you know, yes you know, yes you know
Always on my mind
Always on my mind

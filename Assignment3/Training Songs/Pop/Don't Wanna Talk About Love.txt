Don't want to talk about love, baby, oh 

Boy I know 
What you got on That mind 
That's all right 
Don't you know, it's on mine too 

Don't worry lover 
I'm more than aware 
You're in no hurry 
My hands are already, there 

Don't want to talk about love 
Just give it to me baby 
Don't want to talk about love 
Don't want to talk about love 
We'll just slip into it baby 
'Cause I know what you're thinking 
I know, what you want 
Don't want to talk about love 

Boy I see 
You got something good for me 
I'll be true 
Won't talk to snakes by trees 

Don't worry lover 
I'm more than aware 
You're in no hurry 
my hands are already there 

Don't want to talk about love 
Just give it to me baby 
Don't want to talk about love 
Don't want to talk about love 
Just slip into me baby 
Don't want to talk about love 
'Cause I know what you're Thinking 
I know what you want 
Don't want to talk about love 

I don't want to break you 
I'll never make you cry 
I'm physically incapable 
of ever bringing you harm 

Have you ever had an emotion 
So strong you just can't deal ? 
Lovers can't you see this is real

Is at an end
Only change will bring

You outta of the darkness
In this moment everything
(Moment)

Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day into your life

Reach up for the sunrise
(Sunrise)

Feel the new day into your life

Now the fire fall burns
(Fall burns)
We go out together
As the planet returns
(Returns)
Into the light
Something more than dreams to
(More than dreams)
Watch out for each other
'cause' we know what it means

To be alive?

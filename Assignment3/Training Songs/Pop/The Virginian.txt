When I was young
I knew a girl
Who wouldn't love God as a test
Or gamble with her happiness
And so led astray

So she did turn
Her father would say
You're only a guest of the Master
But passion was her Sunday best
And she fell away

She fell away
She fell away
She fell away from the side of the Lord
Then she was free to do what she wanted
With clouds of her own
Na na na na

When she grew up
She fell in love
She thought it was all that she wanted
She knew how it felt to be haunted
And he ran away

Picked herself up
And said through her tears
Don't waste anymore of your time
You'll spend it all standing in line
And they'll turn you away

She fell away
She fell away
She fell away from the side of the Lord
Then she was free to do what she wanted
With clouds of her own
Na na na na

Hope and superstition
And your heart's permission
'Cause you're good enough
Good enough
Good enough 
To make it alone 

Then when she died
She didn't ask God
To take her back into His graces
She'd taken on too many shapes
And too many were strange

And as they laid her into the ground
Her spirits they all flew all away
The sun shone so bright on that day
You'd've thought it was spring

She fell away
She fell away
She fell away from the side of the Lord
Then she was free to do what she wanted
With clouds of her own
Na na na na

When they came to this land
We gave our friendship, gave them our hands
But it was never to be
Oh, you must bow down, they said,
"Fall to your knees."
Oh, Diamond Sun has to burn
Oh, are we never to learn.

Love gives life and life is love
But what have we done?

We have walked on this earth
Since the first star was shining and the moon had its birth
But as with the shadows
Of lonely trees
We are in bondage
But our hearts are still free
Oh Diamond Sun has to burn
Oh, are we never to learn?

Love gives life and life is love...

Still Diamond Sun has to burn
Oh, are we never to learn
Still Diamond Sun has to burn
In my heart I believe
Someday the sun will shine
And you shall be free
And bless our children as they're put to the test
You'll hear the heartbeat
Of a nation's unrest
Oh Diamond Sun has to burn
Oh are we never to learn.

Love gives life and life is love...

Love gives life and life is love...

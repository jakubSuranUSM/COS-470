[Chorus]
Robyn is here 
Robyn is here 
Robyn is here gotta let you know 
Lend me your ears can you hear my flow 

Wake up people thereÂ´s something new in the air 
Can you hear it  smell it  feel it  Robyn is here 
ProvinÂ´ IÂ´m alive when IÂ´m cominÂ´ with the spring 
MakinÂ´ my debut summer Â´95  startin' to sing 

Better wake up Â´cause I will make you feel alright 
Will get you in that freaky mood  will make you 
make love tonight 

I am here to sing, joy is what I bring 
CominÂ´ with a positive feelinÂ´ 
'Cause this a Robynthing 

[Chorus]

GoinÂ´ downtown sittinÂ´ in the frontseat 
My head is spinninÂ´ around and around because of the heat 
The sun is shininÂ´ it makes everybody horney 
IÂ´m just about to face it that everybody I know is goinÂ´ crazy 

My girls are dressed up from their heads to their feet 
But there ainÂ´t much them clothes will hide 
Guys are mackinÂ´ makinÂ´ the scene complete 
IÂ´m tellinÂ´ itÂ´s contagious itÂ´s the summervibe and IÂ´m here 

[Chorus] 

A dedication to this special time of the year 
And a celebration 'cause finally I am here 
SpreadinÂ´ love to all of my family and my friends 
To that special one IÂ´m thinkinÂ´ of and to my audience 

IÂ´m lettinÂ´ everything else go, have only one thing on my mind 
Tonight I am gonnaÂ´ let you know my flow 
IÂ´m gonnaÂ´ make you feel alright

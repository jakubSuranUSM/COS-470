As a little girl I came down to the water
With a little stone in my hand
And it would shimmer and sing
And I knew everything

In a little while I got steeped in authority
Heaven only knows what when wrong
When there is nothing so cruel
Than to bury that jewel when it was mine all along
And I'm gonna find it

You're shining, I can see you
You're smiling, that's enough well
I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough
Like a diamond in the rough

Ever now and then I can see that I am getting somewhere
Where I have to go is so deep
I was angry back then, and you know I still am
I have lost too much sleep and I'm gonna find it

You're shining, I can see you
You're smiling, that's enough well
I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough
Like a diamond in the rough

Snake's in the grass better step on the gas
In my dreams I go down by the water
With a little girl in my arms and we shimmer and sing
And we know everything
As a little girl I came down

You're shining, I can see you
You're smiling, that's enough well
I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough
Like a diamond in the rough

You're tired of fighting
You want some love
You tell me maybe parting
Is all that's left for us
What do you want from me?
Ask anything
I'll give it all to you
Just don't let it end

Stay another night
Help me get it right
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
Take another shot
And keep the fire hot
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby, no
Don't give it up

I need you more than ever
Don't turn away
I swear I can make it better
I'll never hurt you, no, never again
It was wrong to be so cruel
But I'm gonna change
You'll feel love through and through
Every single day

Stay another night
Help me get it right
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
Take another shot
Keep the fire hot
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby, no
Don't give it up

I just want to throw it back together
Comin' home to your smile every night
Can't you see I'm gonna need you forever
Show me the way to make it alright

Stay another night
Help me get it right
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
Take another shot
And keep the fire hot
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby

I just want to throw it back together
Comin' home to your smile every night
Can't you see I'm gonna need you forever
Show me the way to make it alright

Baby, I'll be true to you
Do what you want me to
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
I don't want you gone
I want to carry on
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
Don't give it up, baby
Don't give it up, baby
Don't give it up, come back...

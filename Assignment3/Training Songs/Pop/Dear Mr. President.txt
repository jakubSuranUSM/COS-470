I'm looking outside of my window
The view that I see is a child and mama
And the child is begging for money
Tell me why, tell me why
The woman is blind
Is she so broke the kid's dealing crime

It's such a beautiful city
But the world is burning it down
It's such a beautiful city
But the world is burning it down

I go to my room to turn on the TV
I sit myself down and I start laughing hard
'Cause this man he's asking for money
He says if you send me lots of cash
I'll send you stuff to make you rich fast

It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
And it's burning down
And it's called the US of A

One day I'm going to have lots of money
But I'll have to give up for this rich society
Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future
'Cause you'll just get it back
From the little blind woman with the kid on the corner
And the people all over, doin' crack

It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
Sing it
And it's burning down
And it's called the US of A

I'm walking outside on a sunny day
With no one around and I wonder what's wrong
The I hear this loud piercing siren
Oh my God the bomb has just dropped
And everybody climbed right on top

Screaming, what a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down, he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down, he's burning it down
And it's burning down
And it's called the US of A

Cinderella cinderella, pretty pretty pretty cinderella
It's late now
While your lips were kissin' mine
I forgot to watch the time

And I'm sorry
Cinderella cinderella, pretty pretty pretty cinderella
I promise
Promised we'd be home on time

I bet cha done think
It was just a line
Cinderella
Twelve o'clock, twelve o'clock

Was what we bargained for
What are we gonna tell your mom and dad
When we're at your front door

Cinderella cinderella, pretty pretty pretty cinderella
Have faith now
I am sure the one above
Will preserve our lasting love

Cinderella
It's late now
I promise
Twelve o'clock, twelve o'clock

Was what we bargained for
Now what do I tell
Your mother and dad
When were at your front door

Oh cinderella cindrella, pretty pretty cinderella
Have faith now
I am sure the one above
Will preserve our lasting love

Cinderella
Whoa such a oretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty cinderella

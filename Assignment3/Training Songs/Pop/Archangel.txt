Angel, just tell me that you'll never leave, understand
Though I know it can't always be the way we planned
I don't think about tomorrow, I just thank God
You're my angel

And you saved my life and I was suddenly free
I don't know how you came like an archangel
But now it's just you and me
I was running scared for much too long
'Til you put me back on straight

Archangel, God knows what I'd do without you
My angel, never leave me, always love me
Like an angel, Archangel

Tears drop like diamonds from your golden eyes
Weep for me archangel and wash away the lies
I've run with demons much too long
Now I thank God you're mine

Archangel, God knows what I'd do without you
My angel, never leave me, always love me
Like an angel, Archangel
Archangel, archangel, archangel, archangel, ooh-ooh

My mama followed her lover to India
The mongoose and the Roti Walla 
On your front porch
Tear me from a growling tiger's mouth
From then on I'm in love

Don't ask me how I am today
Don't want to talk about it
Don't ask what the matter is
Today's the big day
Daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away
My daddy's getting married
I don't know what to say
My daddy's getting married
Today's the big day
My daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away

Nice mommy and daddy 
Tell me to drink my milk
Don't draw moustaches 
On my sister's barbies
Sit on the potty till 
You go little girl
I learned to smoke cigarettes 
In Kentucky, y'all

Don't ask me how I am today
Don't want to talk about it
Don't ask what the matter is
Today's the big day

Daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away
My daddy's getting married
I don't know what to say
My daddy's getting married
Today's the big day
My daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away

Never really felt weird or anything
Things like this happen even to me
Wedding cake rotting in the graveyard
Drowning dream like puppies in the sea

Today is the big day
My daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away
My daddy's getting married
Today is the big day
My daddy's getting married
Mama wipe yer tears away

Now a country boy named Shorty
And a city boy named Dan,
Had to prove who could run the fastest
To win Miss Lucy's hand.
Now Dan had all the money,
And he also had the looks.
But Shorty must have had something boys that can't be found in books.

Chorus
“Cut across Shorty, Shorty cut across.”
That's what Miss Lucy said.
“Cut across Shorty, Shorty cut across.
It's you I wanna win.”

Now Dan had been in training,
A week before the race.
He'd made up his mind old Shorty,
Would end in second place.
Now Dan with his long legs flying,
Left Shorty far behind.
And Shorty heard him holler out,
“Miss Lucy you'll soon be mine.”

Chorus

Break

But Shorty wasn't worried.
He had a smile upon hsi face.
He knew that he was gonna win,
'Cos Lucy had fixed the race.
And just like that old story 'bout the turtle and the hare,
When Dan crossed over the finishing line,
He found Shorty waiting there.

Repeat Chorus to end

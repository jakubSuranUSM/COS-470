Well day by day
And night by night
want to learn how to love you babe 
Till I get it right
Yeah day by day and night by night

Come on and join the dance
I t goes round and round
Until the things you've lost
Become the things you've found 
Day by day and night by night

Now piece by piece
And bit by bit
I can see the target 
I've got to try to hit
Piece by piece and bit by bit.

I tell you sweet singing sister
Gonna love you till I'm blistered and blue 
'cause you're making what I'm shaking 
Harder than the big bamboo
But although I'm digging singing babe 
I really have to sing it with you

Sing it day by day 
And night by night?

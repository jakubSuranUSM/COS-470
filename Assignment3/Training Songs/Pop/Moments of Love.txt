Fate, was once, the friend
That brought you to my life
So long ago
Now, he comes, again
With arms to take you back
But I can't let go

When, I look back, over time
All the million days in my life
I'll remember the moments of love
Here with you
By my side
There's no other love to compare
I'll remember the moments of love

Time, may not, be ours
The times I had with you
Will never fade
Every word, you said
Will linger in my mind
For always... always

When, I look back, over time
All the million days of my life
I remember the moments of love
Here with you

By my side
There's no other love to compare
I'll remember the moments of love
All the million days in my life
I'll remember the moments of love.

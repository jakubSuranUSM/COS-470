In another world 
Under another sky 
I see another story waiting 
To be told 

And another you, wakes up 
With another me 
For that's the way we've come to be 
In another world 

In a different place 
Way 'cross time and space 
The door is open wide 
Drawn to a different light 
Maybe we'll step inside 

In another world 
We can show we care 
You can be sure I'm waiting there 
In another world 

When the dice were cast 
They laid a crazy path we follow to our graves 
But I know in different world 
We journey a different way 

So we live but life 
Isn't what it seems 
We're only living in our dreams 
In another world 

You can believe I'll meet you here 
In another world

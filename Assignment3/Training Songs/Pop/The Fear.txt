This is our "Music from A Bachelor's Den"
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant waterbed
And it sounds just like this.
This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're okay when they're not
You're gonna like it
But not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh, baby
Here comes the fear again, oh-oh
The end is near again, oh-oh
A monkey's built a house on your back
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack, oh
Here we go again

So now you know the words to our song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad, when you're lonely
And it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear

And when you're no longer searching
For beauty or love
Just some kind of life
With the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you're frightened of
This song will be here

Oh, baby
Here comes the fear gain, oh-oh
The end is near again, oh-oh
If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
But you know you're only having a laugh, oh
And here we go again
Until the end

Until the end

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

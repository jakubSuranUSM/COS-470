The feeling of coming to no one there
You rip off my clothes as you rip off my life
Destroyed my world in a matter of words
You left me waiting, you left me undeciding
You left me waiting, you left me waiting

I hear the knock at the door 
And I don't care who's not there anymore
This sound is driving me insane
And damn it nothing's going my way

We're at the point of talking about the morning
Trying to decide who's going to go
I think you forgot whose bed you slept in
And who is going home

I'm running through the forest by myself
I'm walking over oceans to you
Hey ma, I'm walking on water
Hey God, I think I'm your son

We're at the point of talking about the morning
Trying to decide who's going to go
I think you forgot whose bed you slept in
And who is going home

Don't stand there looking at me
Don't stand there looking through me
Just take your clothes and I'll open the door
Looking around, you don't live here anymore

I don't know what I can do for you
I'm not sure what I can be for you
Over some table in someone else's kitchen
Someone's talking but no one wants to listen

We're at the point of talking about the morning
Trying to decide who's going to go
I think you forgot whose bed you slept in
And who is going home

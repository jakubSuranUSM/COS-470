My dress is torn, you have a black eye
You got from a giving kind
But your coat is big and I am warm
I'll ask if I can walk you home

Grey like the gravel under our shoes
The sky doesn't clarify
Simple is something of a mystery
No longer making sense to me

Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true

I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous

I got my best dress on
And you've a smile and a bruise
So come and rescue me,
And me you

I am the heat in an empty room
The cold coming through the walls
Your sofas' old, but I am new
And there is better on the brew

My breath is soft, your hands are unlocked
Un-manned and un-vertical
I feel strings without the black n blues
A weekend in a weekdays shoes

Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true

I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous

I got my best dress on
And you've a smile and a bruise
So come and rescue me
And me you

Now I'm lost, I lost the way to go
I walked for miles I talked for lies, loser
Now I'm lost, I waste my time, my days,
I feel sometimes I drink some wine, winner

I'm walker, walker, walker, walker,
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker

Now I'm lost, I lost my words and soul my cards and keys, but not my name, walker

Now I'm lost, I waste my life away,
Like a blank that's my left wonder

I'm walker, walker, walker, walker,
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker

I'm walker, walker, walker, walker,
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker
I'm walker, walker, walker, walker

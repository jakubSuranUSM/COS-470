Sometimes it seems to me
A long and tender love
Is just not meant to be
It's just not of this world

The more we live with this love
The more we learn to ignore
We keep our feelings inside
Until we open the door

Chorus:
It's in my heart, it's in your eyes
It's waving us on
Till everything stops, everything dies
(we can't stop now, we've come this far)
Don't let me down

'cause in it's darkest hour
A love that's still worthwhile
Will always stand it's ground
If we just realize

The more we give to this love
The more we know that it's right
But if the time ever comes
That we should look for that light

Chorus:

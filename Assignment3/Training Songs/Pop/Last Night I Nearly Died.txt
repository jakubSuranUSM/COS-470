Can't put this off forever
I've got to tell you some time
But when I try and say it
My mouth just gives up and dies

I lose my meaning
When I get this feeling

Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time
Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time

I'm not who you think I am
I slipped a stranger inside
It helps the nights go quicker
But I diminish each time

And in the morning
I shake the warning

Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time
Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time

I lose my meaning
And I get this feeling

Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time
Last night I nearly died
But I woke up just in time

Last night I nearly died

What are you going to do now, where are you going to go
You always had the answers, on your phone-in show
It's never going to happen, or so you did say
For no one really wants it, but here we are today
With a fallout, it's a fallout

You'd better run for shelter, and put yourself in a
Fallout suit
You'd better get yourself used to, just living in a
Fallout suit
A satellite clockwork information, is going to give you
The duration
Of the fallout 

So what are we going to do now, now that it's here
But listen to you talking, about the after care
Living in boxes, covered in lead
In three feet of concrete, to keep us from the dead
It's a fallout, it's a fallout

You'd better run for shelter, and put yourself in a
Fallout suit
You'd better get yourself used to, just living in a
Fallout suit
A satellite clockwork information, is going to give you
The duration
Of the fallout

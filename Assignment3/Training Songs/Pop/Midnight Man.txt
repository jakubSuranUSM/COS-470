Midnight man
Twelve o'clock, 
You climb your stairs
You turn the key
And no one's there
No one's there
It's cold in bed

And there's the fire
It's on your wall
And there's a note
No one's called
No one's called
Ain't that small

But I can help you
I can understand
I can help you
To your promised land
I'm your helping hand
Your midnight man

You try to sleep
But sleep won't come
You lie awake
And toss and turn
Toss and turn
And burn burn burn burn

You read a book
And try some food
You have a smoke
It ain't no good
It ain't no good
You remember

But I can help you
I can understand
I can help you
To your promised land
I'm your helping hand
Your midnight man

No need to be there
Out on your own
You've got my number
You've got the phone
Any time any day
And I'll be on my way

I'm at your window
I'm at your door
I'm on the ceiling
I'm on the floor
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm coming
Here I come

'Cause I can help you
I can understand
I can help you
To your promised land
I'm your helping hand
Your midnight man

I can help you
I can understand
I can help you
To your promised land
I'm your helping hand
Your midnight man

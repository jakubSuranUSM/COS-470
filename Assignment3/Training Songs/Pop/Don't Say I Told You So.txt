i've been living through some hard times 
i've been seeing through some dark times 
now i know the sun will shine 

you don't understand my point of view 
how i must get away from you 
now i know i must be free 

i always knew that it would be this way 
everybody used to say 
everybody seems to know 
don't say i told you so told you so 
don't say i told you so i told you so
told you so, told you so...... 

everywhere i go you follow me 
everything i do you bother me 
you follow me everywhere you go 
every day and every night 
every morning we fight 
one day it's gonna be alright

did you ever dream about this place
where there are lots of girls with a pretty face
where the beer is cheap, you don't have to sleep
hang out all night, new friends to meet
the music makes them all turn wild
nobody tells you wrong or right, so come on
everybody knows your name
moviestars and gamble games
and they never stop cause the band plays rock
spot that girl, she's looking hot
hey Mr. Deejay play another song
there's always something going on
and the neon lights say welcome home
you're off tonight, you're looking good
gonna dance all night on your blue suede shoes
the guitars so loud, you're gonna shout
what tomorrow brings you don't care about
so come on
everybody knows your name
movie stars and gamble games
and you'll never stop cause the band plays hot
let's make out at the parking lot
hey pretty baby, won't you come along
step outta the car and walk around / I feel so fine
just breathe the air and hear the sound / gonna dance all night
the light's so bright, the love so deep / gonna make you mine
rockcity take me to your dream

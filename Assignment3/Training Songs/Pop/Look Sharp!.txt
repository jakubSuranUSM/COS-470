Big shot, tell you what, tell me what goes on around here
Go on and get me in the corner, smoke my cigarettes and drink my beer
Tell me that this world is no place for the weak
Then you can look me in the eye and tell me if you see a trace of fear
You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder
Okay, what you say, tell me what they're wearing this year
Go on and laugh at me, 'cause you don't see that I got something going right here
Say I'm just a dreamer, say I'm just a kid
Well, ace, shut your face, maybe you will see or hear
You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder
Big shot, thanks a lot, gotta go, it's getting late
I got a date with my tailor now, thanks for putting me so straight
Tell me how they rob me blind on every street
But check your watch and wallet now before I go and you're too late
You gotta look sharp
You gotta look sharp
And you gotta have no illusions
Just keep going your way looking over your shoulder
Yeah...

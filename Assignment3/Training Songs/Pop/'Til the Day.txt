And the churches won't stretch out through tarmac of flyovers,
The city don't smell like they said in the brochures,
And it's no longer surprising when lovers and lawyers, they lie, 
But I'd gladly put up with this shit 창??til the day that I die.

Well we've had our problems but hey hasn't everyone?
As soon as they're gone we just drag in another one,
'Cause I see that your upset but you say there's a lash in your eye,
And I'll gladly put up with your shit 창??til the day that I die.

Yeah well, I get the feeling I'm just not cut out for this,
All strategy's, hidden agendas and politics,
But if we can stand before legions of enemies, just you and I, 
And I'll gladly put up with this shit 창??til the day that I die, 
창??til the day that I die [Repeat: x1]
Oh the day that I die.

And I, well they will not hurt me at all [Repeat: x2]
Well they will not hurt me at all,
And I, well they will not hurt me at all.

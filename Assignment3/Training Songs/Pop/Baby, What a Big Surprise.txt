Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only fakin' it
And like before my heart was takin' it

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh

Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind

Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay, oh
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way, hey yeah

Now and then just like before
I think about the love I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh
Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Oh, oh, oh, woah, oh
Baby what a big surprise

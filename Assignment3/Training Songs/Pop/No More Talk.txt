Talking is useless when your cards have all been shown
I'll make you feel bitter and I'll never use the phone
'Cause I'm not the kind of person soft enough to cry
I'm not the kind of person to hide when I can fight
So breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today
'Cause I'm not the kind of person to hang around
I'm not the kind of person to sympathise with self indulgence
Breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today
Talking is stupid now my interest has flown
I'll make you feel useless if you call me on the phone
Breakout now let the feelings out and take the blame away
And leave the past for another day
Please no more talk today

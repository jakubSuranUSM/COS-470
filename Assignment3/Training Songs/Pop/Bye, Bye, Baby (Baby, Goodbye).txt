If you hate me after what I say, ooh
Can't put it off any longer
I just gotta tell you anyway
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
Bye bye baby don't make me cry

You're the one girl in town I'd marry
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free
I wish it could be
I could love you but why begin it
'Cause there ain't any future in it
She's got me and I'm not free
So bye bye baby baby goodbye
Bye bye baby don't make me cry

Guess I never will know you better
Wish I knew you before I met her
Gee how good you would be for me
Should have told you that I can't linger
There's a weddin' ring on my finger
She's got me and I'm not free
So bye bye baby baby goodbye
Bye bye baby don't make me cry

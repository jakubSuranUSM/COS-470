You come in cold 
You're covered in blood 
They're all so happy you've arrived 
The doctor cuts your cord, 
Hands you to your mom 
She sets you free into this life 
And where do you go 
With no destination 
No map to guide you 
Wouldn't you know 
That it doesn't matter we all end up the same 

[Chorus]
These are the chronicles of life and death and everything between 
These were the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem. 
You come in this world, and you go out just the same. 
Today could be the best day of your life. 

And money talks in this world, 
That's what idiots will say 
But you'll find out that this world, 
Is just an idiots parade 
Before you go, you've got some questions. 
And you want answers 
But now you're old, cold, covered in blood, 
Right back to where you started from 

[Chorus]

But these are the chronicles of life and death and everything between. 
These are the stories of our lives, as fictional as they may seem. 
You come in this world, and you go out just the same. 
Today could be the best day of, 
Today could be the worst day of, 
Today could be the last day of your life. 
It's your life, your life.

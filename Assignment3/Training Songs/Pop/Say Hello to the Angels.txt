I want your silent parts
the parts that the birds love
I know there's such a place
I had my back turned,
you didn't realize I'm lonely
You lack the things 
o which I relate
But I see no harm.
Come away, come away, come away
It's over.
And 1, 2, 3 

When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you
Move into my airspace
Move into my airspace
Something's coming over me
I see you in the doorway
I cannot control the part of me that swells up when you
Move into my airspace
Move into my airspace

But each night,
I bury my love around you
Oh each night,
I bury my love around you
You're linked to my innocence

This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This isn't you yet 
What you thought was such a conquest
Your hair is so pretty and red
Baby, baby, you're really the best

Can I get to this way, I think so
Can I get to this way, I think so
Can I get to this way? Can I get to this way?
Can I get to this way? Can I get to this way?

We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town and I've seen my faces change
We should take a trip to see new places
I'm sick of this town, I've seen my faces change
(each night I bury my love around you)

Say hello, say hello to the angels
Say hello, say hello to the angels

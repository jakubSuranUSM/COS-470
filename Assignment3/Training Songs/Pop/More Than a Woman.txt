Do-do-do-do 
More than a woman 
Do-do-do-do 

Oh girl I've know you very well 
I've seen you growing every day 
I never really looked before 
But now you take my breath away 
Suddenly you're in my life 
Part of everything I do 
You've got me working day and night 
Just trying to keep a hold on you 

Here in your arms I've found my paradise 
My only chance for happiness 
And if I lose you now I think I would die 
Oh say you'll always be my baby 
We can make it shine 
We can take forever 
Just a minute at a time, oh-oh 

[Chorus] 
More than a woman 
More than a woman to me, baby 
More than a woman (more than a woman) 
More than a woman to me 

Do-do-do-do 
More than a woman 
Do-do-do-do Oh girl 

There are stories old and true 
Of peo

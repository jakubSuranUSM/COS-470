I may seem wise I may seem old
Feels like I just came into this world
I beg and lie and then regret,
I run and grab and soon forget

I can feel I see two skies above
One to be with, one - to love
I envy them. They never lose,
'Cause they have a choice not to choose
I can feel I see two skies above

Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by
Watch the clouds, while they cross the sky
If I should choose among them all
I'd be confused, I'd feel small
Clouds and clouds and clouds are passing by

I may seem wise I may seem old
Feels like I just came into this world
I beg and lie and then regret,
I run and grab and soon forget

I may seem wise I may seem old
Feels like I just came into this world
I beg and lie and then regret,
I run and grab and soon forget...

Two broken hearts
Neither one knows what to say
Both falling for love
But not quite all the way

Look at us now
Reaching back to yesterday
Longing to know 
If they are the ones to stay
 
After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without anymore
Out there lost is the dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for
Don't you want me anymore, darling
 
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
 
Oh
Where shall we start
Tender words that we can share
Different believes
In time we will get there
 
Look at us now
Wanting more than words can say
Both falling for love
But distant all the way
 
Out there lost are the words I still love you
But they worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling

[Chorus:]

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I want to stay with you
 
Would you love me in the morning
We used to be there in the morning
Would you leave without a warning
Say you love me too

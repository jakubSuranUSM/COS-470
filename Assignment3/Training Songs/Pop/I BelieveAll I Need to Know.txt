The taxman's in the pocketbook
The pressmen are by the bar
And all the world is at your door.
It's strange that you should lock it up
And preach an open heart
But you know what they're waiting for.

You can turn your face away
And don't think twice
I'm just the ordinary guy you used to know
I'm not after your money
Or even your advice
I believe you'll follow me
It's all I need to know
(To walk away).

I was tempted by the devil
In his deep blue swimming pool
Until the devil's makeup ran (ran ran).
And my future's in the strangle hold 
Of ever changing rules
I don't intend to understand.

You can stop pretending now
That I had you fooled
I'm still the ordinary guy you used to know
I'm not after your money
To paralyze my soul
I believe you'll follow me
It's all I need to know
Promise me you'll try to understand before I go
(And walk away).

You can turn your face away
And don't think twice
I'm just the ordinary guy you used to know.
I'm not after your money
Or even your advice
I believe you'll follow me
It's all I need to know
Promise me you'll try to understand before I go

All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know

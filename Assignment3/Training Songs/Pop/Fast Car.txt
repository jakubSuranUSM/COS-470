I’m in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I can’t weak
It’s like I’m running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin’ all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car

It isn’t like me to get caught up
But when you running you’re never quite free
I wasn’t really meant to find love
But now you found me and got me all weak
It’s like I’m running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin’ all the brake lights
Hold up, hold up oh

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I’ll drive you like a fast car

I’m in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I can’t weak
I can’t weak I can’t weak

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car

Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there’s no turning back us
We’ve gone too far
I’ll drive you like a fast car
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I’ll drive you like a fast car

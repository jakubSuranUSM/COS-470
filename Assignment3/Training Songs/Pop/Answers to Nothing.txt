High upon a hillside 
A preacher tells a story to a crowd
He tells the same old story 
A thousand times he's read that story loud
He wants to get the answers 
But his words are only 
Answers to nothing

Lying in my bedroom 
A man comes on my TV. with a grin
He tells me to believe him
He said that I should put my faith in him 
Says he has the answers 
But his words are only
Answers to nothing

Believed for the last time
Deceived for the last time

They're the chosen leaders
Who say we can't stay sitting on the fence 
They leave us stuff 
They're buying guns and bombs
For our defense 
The think this is the answer 
But their thoughts are only 
Answers to nothing 

Where is all the friend ship?
How can all the comradeship be done?
What of all the teachings?
What of things we learned when we where young?
It doesn't bear the asking â€˜cause the answer's given where
Answers to nothing

Lied for the last time
Died for the last time
Cried for the last time
The last time
Believed for the last time
Deceived for the last time
Believed for the last time
This time

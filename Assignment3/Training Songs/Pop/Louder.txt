Turn it up boy boy turn it up boy
Turn it up boy boy turn it up boy

This could be like Romeo Juliet
A tender love we won't regret
I feel the way you're feeling to
But baby I need more volume

I need to hear your heart go boom
If we're going to rock it rock the room
Do it as bad as injected
Baby don't whisper what you're saying

Just imagine us now but with a little more power
We'd be thundering
We could make it so hot
And we'd be living it up so tell me one thing

Turn it up
Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up louder louder louder
Hold that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm you won't be beat
Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up boy boy turn it up boy

I gotta get a rush so I need to say your love is dangerous
But now you're pushing zero on the meter
So go connect your body to a speaker ooh

I need emotion
You don't need to worry about caution
I wanna push your level to distraction
I wouldn't really care much unless cause I can handle handle this

Just imagine us now but with a little more power
We'd be thundering
We could make it so hot
And we'd be living it up so tell me one thing

Turn it up
Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up louder louder louder
Hold that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm you won't be beat
Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up boy boy turn it up boy

Are you getting to my heart
Are you really getting to ma to ma heart yeah
Eh yeah are you getting to my heart
Dude your really getting to ma to ma heart

You got to try always try keeping me
Boy if your finding it easy to leave
I won't be missing you like you missing me
And when I'm gone you'll be walking the stream

Yeah

Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up louder louder louder
Hold that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm you won't be beat
Turn it up louder louder louder
Turn it up boy boy turn it up boy
Turn it Turn It Turn it Up

A straw headed woman, and a barrel chested man
A pocket full of posies with a hat brim full of sand
(Ooh ooh) waiting for the train that never comes

A dog chasing the tumbleweeds, across the sandy floor
That drift along the platform, through the ticket office door
(Ooh ooh) waiting for the train that never comes
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) waiting for the train that never comes

But don't tell me there's nothing coming, you don't fool me
I hear the ghost train rumbling along the tracks - set them free
And I hear them
It's black and white, don't try to hide [x2]

The station master's writing with a piece of orange chalk
A hundred cancellations, still no one wants to walk
Keep the hungry children from the skeleton in the back
Paid to keep an eye out for the Gypsy caravan
(Ooh ooh) waiting for the train that never comes
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh) waiting for the train that never comes

I hear the ghost train rumbling along the tracks - set them free
And I hear them
It's black and white, don't try to hide [x4]
It's black and white (don't try) [x2]
It's black and white, don't try to hide [x2]
And I hear them
It's black and white, don't try to hide [x2]

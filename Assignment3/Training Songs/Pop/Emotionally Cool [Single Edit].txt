You know how to twirl your hair with ease 
Any more subtle would be considered a tease 
You know how to make good eye contact 
Too bad your flaws aren’t as easy as that 

Intimacy isn’t what you go through 
Every time the ceiling is staring back at you 
The danger comes when you ignore the truth 
And that’s all I’ve been trying to tell you

Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 
Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool

You know how to flirt with whomever you please 
And get them worked up then you wanna leave 
You know how to take everything you said back 
Too bad I don’t have the same spirit you lack 

Intimacy isn’t what you go through 
Every time the ceiling is staring back at you 
The danger comes when you ignore the truth 
And that’s all I’ve been trying to tell you

Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 
Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 

Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 
Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 

You don’t play hard to get 
And that gives me such a fit 
You’re supposed to be a challenge 
But it’s not there 
I guess you’ve never met someone that really cares

And intimacy isn’t what you go through 
Every time the ceiling is staring back at you 
The danger comes when you ignore the truth 
And that’s all I’ve been trying to tell you. 
Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool 
Anybody else would be considered a fool 
But when you do it you’re emotionally cool

But when you do

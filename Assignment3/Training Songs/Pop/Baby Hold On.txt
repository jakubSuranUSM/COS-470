You're such a natural woman
But you're so far away baby
Your love is driving me crazy, coming home
I know you can't live without love
I know you're feeling so lonely
Save all your sweet loving for me
I'm coming home

Save all your sweet loving for me
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
You gotta hold on babe, I'm coming home
So baby hold on don't throw your love away
Cause I'm coming home, so baby hold on baby hold on
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
You're such natural woman
You know my feelings about you
You know I can't live without you
I'm coming home
I'm sorry I ever left you
I thought this free life was better
I know you can't wait forever
But baby hold on
I know you can't wait forever, so baby hold on
Cause I'm coming home
You gotta hold on baby, 'm coming home
So baby hold on, don't throw your love away
Cause I'm coming home so baby hold on, baby hold on

We are we are romanced in fascination
Sinfully sated in every incarnation
Typically farcical in every situation
But look what you can do with a little imagination

Feeling like we've never felt 
Smelling like we've never smelt
If only the booze tasted as good as it felt
We'd be holding on to buckled belts
For hot love now

We are we are reeling in our feelings
In love we'll trust til we'll go bust it's heavenly appealing
There's no sense in dressing up cos it's time to get revealing
And look what you can do when you're swinging from the ceiling

Every painted puckered lip
Every pouting nipple tip
Every time I trip you trip we trip...

Feeling like we've never felt
Smelling like we've never smelt
Here we come we don't need no help
We're holding on to buckled belts 
Here they come now heaven knows
Trying on their sisters clothes 
For hot love now

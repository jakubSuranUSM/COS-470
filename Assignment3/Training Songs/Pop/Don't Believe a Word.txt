How can you say
After all we've done together
 It's gonna take forever
 To mend what's come apart
 And how can you say
That you never meant to hurt me
You didn't dare alert me
To your poisoned heart
Before too long
Something is wrong
Tell me you're too sick to mention
Show me about your good intention
Give me all of your attention
 But I don't believe a word
don't believe a word
 I hate to say but
 You know you're growing older
 And your eyes are getting colder
 And your hair is falling out
 There'll be a day
 When your confidence is shaken
And you know you were mistaken
You'll have your doubts
Before too long
Something is wrong
Tell me you're too sick to mention
Show me about your good intention
Give me all of your attention
 But I don't believe a word
don't believe a word

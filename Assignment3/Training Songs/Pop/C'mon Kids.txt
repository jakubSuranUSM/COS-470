See'mon kids don't do yourself down
Throw out your arms for a new sound
Pretty face it don't mean a thing
If you look so same as your crowd

Work all day it don't mean a thing
With the sun always outside your window
F*ck the ones who tell you that life
Is merely a time before dying

Look for the box and find what's inside
You'll never find it till you have done
And f*ck the ones who tell you that life
Is merely a time before dying

I know it's hard to do
But have we ever let you down
See'mon kids

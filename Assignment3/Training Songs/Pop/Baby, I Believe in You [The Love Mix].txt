Baby, I believe in you
And every little thing you do
Every time we kiss
It always feels like this
I believe in you
Baby, I believe in us
And every little inch of our trust
Whether I'm around you never let me down
I believe in you

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But you're just so amazing
And I'm so in love, girl, with you
I believe in you

Oh girl
There is something about you

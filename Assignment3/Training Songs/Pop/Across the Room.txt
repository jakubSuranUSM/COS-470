Long hair across the room, baby she got that glow
I know you see me over here, so dance on me real slow
We've been goin' for about two hours and I don't even know your name
So baby please reveal, reveal

Your friends are callin’ you baby stay with me instead
I know you sayin' that you're tired there's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, good time we had

The scent of your perfume has got me lost in a haze
And oh this moment depends on the records that the DJ plays
Baby move a lil bit closer 'cause I wanna feel you babe
I wanna feel you babe 

Your friends are callin’ you baby stay with me instead
I know you sayin' that you're tired there's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, good time we had

I needed a reason
To climb out of my shell.
I needed a reason
To care at all 'bout myself.
Then you walked into my sight
And you opened up my life.

And you made the best of me
So easily
And I couldn't love you better
Baby

You made the best of me
Darlin'
The best that I could be

You made the best of me.
I waited a lifetime
To try livin' it out.
I needed a lifeline
To know what life was about.
And you made me realize

And you touched me with your eyes.
And you made the best of me

You made the best of me
Oh baby
You made the best of me
Best of me.

And you made the best of me

You made the best of me

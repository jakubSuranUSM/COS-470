Beautiful World, you taught me to remember 
All the feelings, I lost along the way 
I was afraid, alone in my confusion 
Running and hiding `stead of living from day to day 
When we were walking, we touched the summer flowers 
And I saw the wonder, oh in a young child`s eye 
Well I looked around and saw how truly grateful 
That I should be for all the love I`ve found 

Beautiful World well you shook me to my senses 
And opened my eyes to the love inside of me 
It`s up to me, if I can always believe 
In the way I see it now, what a Beautiful World 
It would always be

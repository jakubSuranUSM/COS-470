Hear the happy feet dancing to the beat of the Freddie (Freddie)
Put a guy in front make a line in back then you're ready (ready)

[Chorus:]
Kick your feet up swing your arms up too
Move your head both ways like you see me do
Then jump three feet to the swinging beat
Do the Freddie (Freddie), Do the Freddie (Freddie)

It's an easy dance give yourself a chance
Dance the Freddie (Freddie)
It's the thing to do kids will envy you
So do the Freddie (Freddie)

[Chorus]

Wow!

[Chorus]

Dance the Freddie, Dance the Freddie

Well I pass him by on the street each day 
Brother, don't you walk away 
He's about my size and about my age 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Down a different road, might've been my friend 
Brother, don't you walk away 
But you never know how the road will bend... 

Brother, don't you walk, Brother, don't you walk away 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Tell me why it so hard to say 
Brother, don't you walk away 

When you sleep all night on a pillow of stone 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Do you dream of finding your way back home 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Well some might say these are better days 
Brother, don't you walk away 
But a cardboard box is your home these days... 

Brother, don't you walk, Brother, don't you walk away 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Tell me why it so hard to say 
Brother, don't you walk away 

Now the wind blows hard through the holes in your cap 
Brother, don't you walk away 
While I'm safe inside here in luxury's lap 
Brother, don't you walk away 
So you walk this land in your worn out shoes 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Well if this land's mine, is it your land too... 

Brother, don't you walk, Brother, don't you walk away 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Tell me why it so hard to say 
Brother, don't you walk away 

So you look at me with a look so real 
Brother, don't you walk away 
As I turn away from the things I feel 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Even here and now as I lie awake 
Brother, don't you walk away 
Tell me how much difference can one man make 

Brother, don't you walk, Brother, don't

When I came back home from the USA
I had nothin' in my pockets and not a lot to say
Though I knew somehow we would meet real soon
But the way you've been avoidin' me
It's like I'm livin' on the moon
Here I am on this side of the stars
Livin' in California
And sometimes I get out of reach in the bars
Dreamin' about my life
And maybe one day I'll take a wife
Though I spent some time on the evil road
I've done things that I'm ashamed of
Oh man it's such a heavy load
Though I knew somehow we would meet real soon
But the way you've been avoidin' me
It's like I'm livin' on the moon
Here I am on this side of the stars
Livin' in California
And sometimes I get out of reach in the bars
Dreamin' about my life
And maybe one day I'll take a wife
Oh
I miss you girl
Your dreams are more than I can take
You are the love of my life
But I could be my biggest mistake
Ah babe my heart's turnin' like a wheel
I feel emotion for you but I just can't tell if it's real
When I came back home from the USA
I had nothin' in my pockets and not a lot to say
Though I knew somehow we would meet real soon
But the way you've been avoidin' me
It's like I'm livin' on the moon
Here I am on this side of the stars
Livin' in California
And sometimes I get out of reach in the bars
Dreamin' about my life
And maybe one day I'll take a wife
Oh ooooh baby oh I miss you girl

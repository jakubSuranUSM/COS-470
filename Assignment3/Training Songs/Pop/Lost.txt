I see her face in my dreams – like a star shining all across the sea
I remember this moment – years ago there was only you and me
When I wake up in sadness – I realize my deep wounds never heal 
Living only in memories – all is lost, coldness I can feel

Sky turned darker and darker – soulless voices whispering her name 
End came closer and closer – endless sleep was sweeping in her veins

She faded away – like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words – please don´t cry for me

Lost in endless night – take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light – when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me – all across the raging sea 
Together we will be – when will I ever be free

One night I was dreaming – seemed to me like reality, so clear
A fallen angel inside me – speaks to me, tells me what has to be done
There´s a fire in my heart – burning bright like the glory of a king
For too long I was waiting – now my soul is flowing in the wind

She faded away – like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words – please don´t cry for me

Lost in endless night – take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light – when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me – all across the raging sea
Together we will be – when will I ever be free

Lost in endless night – take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light – when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me – all across the raging sea
Together we will be – when will I ever be free

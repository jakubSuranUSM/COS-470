It's my nature
To want you
Baby what can I do?
I'm falling for you
Must be my nature
To want you 

Could've searched forever girl
And never realized
That I could feel this way
When I look in your eyes
Now I got you all alone
I think the moment's right
I'll do what it takes
To make you mine tonight
'Cause a man needs a woman
And a woman needs a man
And that's the way it's always been
Since time began
We all need lovin'
Like the flowers need the rain
Come a little closer girl
I just can't wait 

[Chorus:]
'Cause it's my nature
To want you
Baby what can I do?
I'm falling for you
Must be my nature
To want you
Tell me what can I say
Don't turn this heart away
It's just my nature 

Every time I'm next to you
I feel so weak inside
Never been this way before
Oooh girl you're driving me wild
You're the only one I found
Could make me lose control
Gonna fill you up
You know I want you so
Now a man needs a woman
And a woman needs a man
Come a little closer girl
You've got to understand 

[Chorus:] 
I can't help the way I feel about you
Oooh I can't help but love you
I know I need your love to see me through

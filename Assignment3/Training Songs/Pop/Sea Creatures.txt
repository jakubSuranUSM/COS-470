The stars and moon
Remind me of you
I don't know what to say
It might make you worse

I don't understand
What her problem is
I think she's just a fish!

I know you get it bad
You don't deserve this
And I won't put up
With their ignorance

And they tell you
They love you
Well the don't mean it

I don't think they know what they mean!
I don't think they know what love is
Throw it around like it's worthless
Don't think they know what love is

I don't get this town
Neither do you
We should run away
Just me and you

'Cause I don't get the people here
They're curious
They don't really care

Sea creatures
Interfere
Wish they would disappear

They don't know what love is
Throw it around like it's worthless
They don't know what love is!

I pray for you
And you know I don't like Jesus!

Want you to get better
Please, please get better
For you
For me

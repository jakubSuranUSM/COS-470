There's no other way,
In the ?
Population,
Neighborhood.
I look for you,
So you look for me.
It's the only way you're gonna get ?

Going settle down,
And watch the dust.
Going read the book,
All the rules that must.
Sets the time,
To set the pace.
You take me closer,
One step closer to that place.

You take me one step closer,
Now I know we're here.
It's better now than ever,
Now I know you'll stay.

And another way,
It's a different world.
There's a shining light,
And a darkened word.
And it waited,
Takes a path,
To a different place,
Different time,
Different vibe.

You take me one step closer,
Now I know we're here.
It's better now than ever,
Now I know you're here.

You take me one step closer,
Now I know we're there.
Much better now than ever,
Now I know you'll stay.

Found another way,
Another attitude.
There's a population,
In the neighborhood.
I'm looking for you,
You look for me.
It's the only way to get,
To where we want to be.

You take me one step closer,
And now I know we're here.
Much better now than ever,
And now I know you'll stay.

You're taking me one step closer,
And now I know we're there.
It's better now than ever,
And now I know you'll stay with me.

You're taking me one step closer,
And now I know you're there with me.
Much better now than ever,
Now I know you're here

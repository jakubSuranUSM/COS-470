Here I go out the door of my 
Apartment before I miss my train
And there's no way that is happening
Coz my girl you see
Has been doing things without me 
So I'm going to see
What's been going on without me
Is my ex a film critic?
And now living as a nanny in manhattan

Hear this from me
Some folks are telling jokes about the
Secrets she writes about all
Words for each and every one of those
Songs about people that you know

From the train to the car 
And as we drove I kept calling 
Leaving cute one liners there on your machine
I'm looking in your window 
And there's some guy looking back at me

Please tell me what the hell is happening
Well your ex, the film critic
Is now living as a nanny in Manhattan
Hear this from me
Some folks are telling jokes about the things that she wrote
Words for each and every one of those 
Songs about people that you know

This is what I mean
So it should sound mean
It's just because you ain't actin' like a friend
Like our last phone call

Forget to chill
You need to know
And don't ever talk to me that way again

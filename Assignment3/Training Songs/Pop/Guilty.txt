Lyin' is such a waste of time
If being dirty is a crime
I am filthy, I am guilty
Of everything I've ever said or done
And all that I've become
Is so filthy, I am guilty

I'm caught up in the zeros and ones
Heroes are none, egos and guns
What the hell are we doing it for
Wars and rumors of war, ignore the poor
Saw a billboard with 1-800-DIVORCE
Of course I just let it happen let someone else die for freedom
The devil's playing a game and only God can beat him
And the only time that I seem to pray is when I need him
And I'm feeling like a sorry sack of snake semen
Feeling edgy and fidgety in this digital gadgetdy
Sick, tragedy stricken kick in the dick, called "Earth"
But did you care that the Frigidaire's bare
That you couldn't get a beer there
Life is a carnival but it ain't fair
Where where tell me where where
Can I learn to smile again
All I can do is stare at all the stupid people frolicking
Around downtown 'round 'bout now
I'm looking for someone to give me the truth
But lies are all I found

Lyin' is such a waste of time
If being dirty is a crime
I am filthy, I am guilty
Of everything I've ever said or done
And all that I've become
Is so filthy, I am guilty

A raindrop falls from a cloud into exhaust
And we've yet to witness the cost of our greed
Just a child with a smile and a wide open mouth
And his tongue hanging out, thirsty for heaven
That raindrop's coming down somewhere right now
And a beautiful future has been diluted, polluted
My father saw the flag, he she'd a tear and saluted
When I was young he said the world was in trouble, I knew it
I find the news to confusing killing the gin
I'm into the wind, three sheets and I feel under the gun
With a lung full ganja they want you to wonder
Aimlessly, nameless, brainless
Insane as it sounds is insane as I feel
What is real Got a zillion ideas Is I'm ill
This is weird all the fashion trends, thieves are cashing in
We've been deceived knee deep in dung and disease

Lyin' is such a waste of time
If being dirty is a crime
I am filthy, I am guilty
Of everything I've ever said or done
And all that I've become
Is so filthy, I am guilty

Lyin' is such a waste of time
If being dirty is a crime
I am filthy, I am guilty
Of everything I've ever said or done
And all that I've become
Is so filthy, I am guilty

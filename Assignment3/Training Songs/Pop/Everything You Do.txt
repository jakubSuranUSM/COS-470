I love the way you smile when I look in your eyes.
I love the way you laugh when I try to be funny.
And how the tears roll down your face when I say no one could ever take your
Place.

[Chorus]
Cause baby when you sleep, I watch you breathing. 
And baby when you dream, I dream with you.
Cause everywhere you are is where I wanna be, It's true.
Everything you do makes me know how much I love you.

The way you touch my lips right after every kiss,
And softly whisper that I'm your everything.
The way you pray our love wont die
Every night just before you close your eyes.

[Chorus]

I believe that things were meant to be.
As sure as there is love, yours is meant for me.

[Chorus]

Deep in my heart, there's no room for crying,
But I'm trying to see your point of view
Deep in my heart, I'm afraid of dying,
I'd be lying if I said I'm not

Welcome in, welcome in,
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in,
It will come
It's a sin, it's a sin,
Where birds of a feather, are welcome to, land on you

[CHORUS]
Ya Ya Ya *2
You've got my eyes
We can see, what you'll be, you can't disguise
And either way, I will pray, you will be wise
Pretty soon you will see the tears in my eyes..

As each day goes by, it makes way for another,
We discover that we're not alone
And each day we try, the best we can to recover,
All the feelings that we left below

Welcome in, welcome in,
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in,
You will come
It's a sin, it's a sin,
Where birds of a feather, are welcome to, land on you

[CHORUS]
Ya Ya Ya *2
You've got my eyes
We can see, what you'll be, you can't disguise
And either way, I will pray, you will be wise
Pretty soon you will see the tears in my eyes..

Welcome in, welcome in,
Shame about the weather
Welcome in, welcome in,
You will come
It's a sin, it's a sin,
Where birds of a feather, are welcome to, land on you...

[CHORUS]
Ya Ya Ya *2
You've got my eyes
We can see, what you'll be, you can't disguise
And either way, I will pray, you will be wise
Pretty soon you will see the tears in my eyes.. *3

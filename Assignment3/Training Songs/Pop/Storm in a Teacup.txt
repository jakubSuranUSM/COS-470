Pitter-patter pitter-patter .... 
Pitter-patter pitter-patter .... 

One drop of rain on your window pane 
Doesn't mean to say there's a thunderstorm comin' 
Rain may pour for an hour or more 
But it doesn't matter, you know it doesn't matter 

One gentle breeze blowin' softly through the trees 
Doesn't mean to say there's a hurricane hummin' 
Don't go running ev'ry time you hear it coming 
It doesn't matter, you know it doesn't matter 

One little word that you may have overheard 
Doesn't mean to say that my love for you is dyin' 
Don't go cryin' over second hand lyin' 
'Cause it doesn't matter, you know it doesn't matter 

It's a storm in a teacup 
Brewing up double all those tiny little troubles 
A storm in a teacup 
It really doesn't matter 
If it pitter-pitter-patters all the day 

Pidder-padder pidder-padder .... 
It doesn't matter, no no it doesn't matter 

One little word that you may have overheard 
Doesn't mean to say that my love for you is dyin' 
So don't start cryin' over second hand lyin' 
'Cause it doesn't matter, you know it doesn't matter 

It's a storm in a teacup 
Brewing up double all those tiny little troubles 
Storm in a teacup 
It really doesn't matter 
If it pitter-pitter-patters all the day 

Pitter-patter pitter-patter .... 
It's a storm in a teacup 
Brewing up double all those tiny little troubles 
Storm in a teacup 
It really doesn't matter 
If it pitter-pitter-patters all the day

Are you aching for the blade?
That's OK, we're insured
Are you aching for the grave?
That's OK, we're insured
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
Daniel's saving Grace
She's out in deep water
Hope he's a good swimmer
Daniel plays his ace
Deep inside his temple
He knows how to serve her
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
Daniel drinks his weight
Drinks like Richard Burton
Dance like John Travolta
Now
Daniel's saving Grace
He was all but drowning
Now they live like dolphins
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
We're getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
Oh, getting away with it all messed up
Getting away with it all messed up
That's the living
Getting away with it
We're getting away with it
That's the living
That's the living

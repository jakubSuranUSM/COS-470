Dream crazy
We change too fast
Take cover
'Cause it can`t last
(It`s a) cold crime
A deadly sting
There`s no time
To talk of deadly things

Well there`s no lifetime guarantees
But I see you and you see me
Let`s spend the night on love`s deep sea
And let emotion set us free

I love the way you start to glow
I love the way your body flows

Stand easy
It`s a party crash
So sleazy
Let`s make a smash
Cool colors 
Set the scene
Dive into
The neon love machine

You know my love`s a guarantee
So dance a dance of love with me
Your body`s moving like the sea
Now we`re as close as we can be

[Chorus]
I love the way you start to glow
I love the way your body flows
That`s the way the party goes
And it`s a way everyone knows

Well there`s no lifetime guarantees
But when you you`re making love to me
We`ll ride the waves of ecstasy
And let emotion set us free

[Chorus]

Dream crazy
Dream crazy

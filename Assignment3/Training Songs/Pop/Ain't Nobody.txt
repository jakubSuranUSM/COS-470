Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do

Meet me in the red sky and dance with me
Let the valley change you and the night set you free
It's dusk in the dessert, it's heaven at the gates
You were my desire, you were my escape

Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do

Open up this moment and bury me inside
I can see us changing, like a season over time
It's silver on the river, reflections of your love
Drown me in the silence, we'll never come undone

Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do

Shadows are falling, tomorrow's closing in
Stay with me till morning, open up your wings
I can hear your whispers, they're calling out my name
Will you promise me that we'll steal the night again 'cause

Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do
Ain't nobody can love me like you do

Meet me in the red sky and dance with me
Let the valley change you and the night set you free
It's dusk in the dessert, it's heaven at the gates
You were my desire, you were my escape

I love you when you touch me,
I love your kisses on my skin,
I love you when you ask me:
"Put out the light and please come in"
For you I'd fight the fiercest dragon,
For you I freeze in winter nights,
For you I'd catch your fall in sunbeam,
For you I give up all my rights
When I feel your lips come near up
I see the magic in your eyes
I love you when you touch me,
I love your kisses on my skin,
I love you when you ask me:
"Put out the light and please come in"
I love you when you call me
Yeah if my princess seems to tell
To love you makes me happy
The world explodes but I don't care
I don't care
For you

I've got my finger on the phone
I never thought itd take me so long
Girl, don't ever let them put you down
don't ever let them push you around
Crush, and all the thing I've left behind

And when I started think of to be another time
I'll never mind

And I am
I'm Electric
I just want to dance
I'm Electric
I just want to dance

I want to be loved by you
I'm Electric
I just want to dance
I'm Electric
I just want to dance

I want to be loved by you
And when the night is closing in
Can you hear me calling within
Crush, and all the things I've left behind
And when we take the stage tonight you'll be on my mind
Yes, you'll be the one

And I am
Electric
I just want to dance
Electric
I just want to dance

I want to be loved by you
I'm Electric
I just want to dance
I'm Electric
I just want to dance

I want to be loved by you
And when we take the stage tonight you'll be on my mind
Yes, you'll be the one

And I am
And I am
I want to be loved by you
I'm Electric
I just want to dance
I'm Electric
I just want to dance

I want to be loved by youuu

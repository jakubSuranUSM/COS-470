You're moving in a circle,
I'm coming on in a little dizzy spells,
And the room is all forlorn,
We could be stuck in substance hell,
Some more of this is what we need,
So hand in hand and off we sway.

I'm not that close, I'm not that close to you,
I'm not that close, I'm not that close to you.

Your face is taking pictures of itself,
I close my eyes and sighs explode,
We sellotape the telephone,
And all the little voices grow,
Some more of this is what we need,
So hand in hand and off we sway.

I'm not that close, 
I'm not that close to you, oh oh oh,
I'm not that close, I'm not that close to you,
It's only the state I'm in and I'm about to come down,
It's only the mess within in about to come out.
La la la la la la 

It's only the state I'm in, I'm about to come down,
It's only the mess within is about to come out,
I'm not that close, I'm not that close to you,
I'm not that close, I'm not that close to you.
No

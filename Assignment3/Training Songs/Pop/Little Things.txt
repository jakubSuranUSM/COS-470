It's the little things I need
Like a sunrise or a biscuit with tea
And it feels so pointless now
When nothing seems to be working for me
All I can do is try
I will get by

There's the little things I need
'Cause I don't want it to end
Open up my door
When nothing seems to be working for me
All I can do is try
I will get by

Everything that I've had in mind
Faced with time
Everything that will get me high

Everything that will get me high
I will try
Just to get by

It's the little things I need
Like a sunset together with you
Open up your door
When nothing seems to be working for me
All I can do is try
I will get by

Everything that I've got in mind
Faced with time
Everything that will get me high
I will try

Just to get by

Take me back to paradise

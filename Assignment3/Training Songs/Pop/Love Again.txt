These days I'm afraid of me
There's fire where my heart should be
My confident core is weak
My mouth doesn't dare to speak
'Cause I've been looking too hard for something,
Looking too hard for something
Giving it all for nothing,
Trying too hard to love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again

In light of reality,
The truth it's too good to be
Looking too hard for something,
Looking too hard for something
Giving it all for nothing,
Trying too hard to love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again

Maybe if I stop lookin'
Take back all that I've put in
Elevate and build you will
Maybe if I, maybe if I stop

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Looking for, looking for love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again

Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again
Ooh ooh, eh eh (I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for love again

I want the light without the darkness
I want the sun without the rain
I'm beginning to believe it's possible
To have someone like you without the pain

When I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I promise I'll never ever ask for more
But when it comes to sweetness, baby, I'm insatiable
I'm like a kid in a candy store

You know what they say, you know what they say
You know what they say, can't have it all your way
When it's too good, too good, too good to be true
You know what they say, you know what they say
You know what they say, can't have it all your way
It's usually too good, too good, too good to be true

But not tonight
I want the light without the darkness (not tonight)
I want the sun without the rain (not tonight)
I'm beginning to believe it's possible
To have someone like you without the pain

Baby, I just want you to be reckless
So come on, flick the switch on common sense
'Cause I wanna feel the fire, baby, make it burn
I promise there won't be no consequence

You know what they say, you know what they say
You know what they say, can't have it all your way
When it's too good, too good, too good to be true
You know what they say, you know what they say
You know what they say, can't have it all your way
It's usually too good, too good, too good to be true

But not tonight
I want the light without the darkness (not tonight)
I want the sun without the rain (not tonight)
I'm beginning to believe it's possible
To have someone like you without the pain

Baby, I just want you to be reckless, ooh
Baby, I just want you to be reckless, ooh
You know what they say, you know what they say
You know what they say, can't have it all your way
When it's too good, too good, too good to be true

But not tonight
I want the light without the darkness (not tonight)
I want the sun without the rain (not tonight)
I'm beginning to believe it's possible
To have someone like you without the pain

But not tonight
I want the light without the darkness
(I want the sun without the rain)
I want the sun without the rain
(I'm beginning to believe it's possible)
I'm beginning to believe it's possible
To have someone like you without the pain

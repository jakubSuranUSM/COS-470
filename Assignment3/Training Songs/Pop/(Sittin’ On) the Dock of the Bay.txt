Sittin' in the morning sun,
I'll be sittin' when the even comes
I watchin' as the ships come in
And watch 'em roll away again

Sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Watchin' the tide roll away,
Sittin' on the dock of the bay,wasting time
Left my home in Georgia,

Headed for the 'Frisco bay,
I have nothing to live for,
like nothings gonna pass my way
I'm a just a sittin' at the dock of the bay,

Watchin' the tide roll away,
Sittin' on the dock of the bay,wasting time
A Mistake,nothings ever gonna change,
every day,everything'll make up my mind.

I can do what ten people tell me to do
I'll get down on my knees and pray
A Mistake,nothings ever gonna change,
every day, everything'll make up my mind.

I can do what ten people tell me to do
I'll get down on my knees and pray
I'm sittin' and restin' my bones,
loneliness won't leave me alone,

Two thousand miles from home,
Just to make this deck my home
Sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Watchin' the tide roll away,

Sittin' on the dock of the bay,wasting time
Sittin' on the dock of the bay,
Watchin' the tide roll away,
Sittin' on the dock of the bay,wasting time

Sittin' on the dock of the bay

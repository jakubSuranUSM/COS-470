Here I come in my fifty seven,
She's a real low rider paint perfection
With a custom engine painted black with flames
Ain't nobody gonna call that hot rod tame
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

V eight engine with the fuel injection
Two eight three, that's my ounce of perfection
Get that rod out when it's very late
Haven't got a round to getting license plates
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Well I'm cruising low and I'm cruising mean,
Well I'm cruising slow in my dream machine
You're my hot rod mama
And you're really built for speed

When I reach that final destination
I will drive your car and leave you compensation
With a little reeling and a lot of rockin'
You're my hot rod mama in your fishnet stockings
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

You're built for speed, you're built for speed,

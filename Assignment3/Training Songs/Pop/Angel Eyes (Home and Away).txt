I pay the price for cheap advice

Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away
So now I'm gonna take that all that I can get
With those angel eyes
You make saints do sins all the time

Say I'm gonna stay, home and away, well well,
When I said I'd catch you when you're falling
I'd have my heart open wide
And you who's not naive I thought
Say I thought I'd mend my heart

People say I'm so automatic
People say I'm not so systematic
When I'm down I'm in manual, lord
And time on time again I walk on by
With the look of love

[Chorus:]
And with those angel eyes, whoa whoa
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes, whoa whoa
C'mon now baby

The saddest thing I've ever seen on my tv screen
Was a dying man who died for his dream
Toughest thing I've ever heard
Was that new-born scream in this naked world

People say I'm so automatic
People say I'm not so systematic
When I'm down I'm in manual, lord
And time on time again I walk on by
With the look of love

[Chorus]

Say I'm gonna stay home and away
Show a little loving that'll make you shine girl
Say I'm gonna stay home and away

People say that I'm so automatic
People say I'm not so systematic
When I'm down I'm in manual, lord
Been all around those edges
But ain't never been in love
Ain't never been in love before babe
Never been in love
Never been in love

Set me on fire, baby

And with those angel eyes, whoa whoa
Set me on fire, fire

And with those angel eyes, whoa whoa
Set me on fire, fire

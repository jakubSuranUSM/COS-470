All across the universe
Every boy and every girl
Is looking for this thing called love
So why do all the other guys
Got pretty women by their side
Some guys really can't complain

Every night I lay awake and cry
I'm missing someone to stand by my side

REFRAIN:
I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes me feel so blue
I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes my dreams come true
I feel lonely

It's not easy to fall in love
So I pray to god above
Lord I need a helping hand
Hey Mr. DJ play this song
I felt lonely for so long
This is my SOS for love

All the time I got it on my mind
Someone to hold me tight is hard to find

REFRAIN

Ooh, ooh
Na, na, na, na, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

All I want, all I want is forever
I don't want much from you
Just your love my whole life through
That's all I want, yes, that's all I want

And all I need is to be with you always
I don't need much, you see
Just need eternity
And to be with you, yes, to be with you

Forever
All I want is forever
Am I asking too much
Asking for all your love forever

Oh, all I know is when we're together, baby
Time passes much too fast
And I want to make it last
Last forever more, girl, forever more

And all my life I've been waiting to find, to find you, baby
Now that you're finally here
Ooh, I want you always near
And to share my life, yes, to share my life

Forever
All I want is forever (that's all I want is forever, baby)
Am I asking too much
Asking for all your love

Forever
Won't you give me forever, baby (this time make it last, baby)
I'm not asking for much
Asking for all your love forever

Oh, oh, just say that you will stay for always
And always you'll be mine
At least till the end of time

Forever {oh, forever, my baby, yeah, yeah}
All I want is forever (oh, is that what you want, that's what I
want}
Am I asking too much
Asking for all your love

Forever (forever)
Won't you give me forever, baby {all I want is forever, baby, yeah}
(Ooh, ooh)
I'm not asking too much
Asking for all your love

Forever {hey, yeah}
All I want is forever (forever and ever and ever, now baby, oh,
baby}
Am I asking too much
Asking for all your love {I just want forever}

Forever {I just need forever}
All I want is forever (and you know I love you, baby)
Am I asking too much
Asking for all your love forever

Are you having a good time
'Cause I'm having a good time
And I might be a bit tipsy
But that's okay cause you're with me
Are you having a good time
'Cause I'm having a good time
And I might be a bit tipsy
But that's okay cause you're with me

I came here just to party
All this don't you hate on me, yeah
Got my sexy girls with me
Oh, I love it

Wo-oh, let's party
Yeah, let's party, and have a good time
Wo-oh, let's party
Yeah, let's party, and have a good time

There go the paparazzi
I don't really give a f*ck, move out of my way
'Cause I came to party rock
Good times are here, and you know they're here to stay
If you're not here to party, move and get out of the way

Wo-oh, let's party
Yeah, let's party, and have a good time
Wo-oh, let's party
Yeah, let's party, and have a good time

Are you having a good time
'Cause I'm having a good time
And I might be a bit tipsy
But that's okay cause you're with me

I'm fucked up, I can't tell you what's what
All she know is suck f*ck
I walked up to a big butt, and ask her ass 'butt what'
Tunechi never slacks without a button up, I rolled the dice and lucked up
I'm all in, I'm all in
More money more problems
More money will solve them
It's YMCMB bitch
Paris, do you speak french? I get special treatment
Girl turn over, good defense! We turned down for what
Tomorrow isn't promised
Tonight is all we got
And times like these are timeless
She fucked me like she love me
Love is such a science, do you think it's love? Thanks for not replying
It's Paris Hilton bitch!

Lick it, lock it, it's the last day to party
Don't just, don't stop moving
'Cause we're having a good time, having a good time

Are you having a good time
'Cause I'm having a good time
And I might be a bit tipsy
But that's okay cause you're with me

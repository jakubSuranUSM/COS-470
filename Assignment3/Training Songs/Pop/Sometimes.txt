There's a storm outside
And the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder
Is closing in
Is closing in

The rain floods gutters
And makes a great sound on concrete

On a flat roof, there's a boy
Leaning against a wall of rain
Aerial held high
Calling "Come on thunder,
Come on thunder!"

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul

It's a monsoon!
And the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys
Stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy's hit!
Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Then he crumples
Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on
Delivers him on

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul

There's four new colours in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he catches
Is endless rain
Endless rain
Endless rain
Endless rain

He says, "Listen!"
Takes my head
Puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea

Sometimes (sometimes), I look in your eyes, I can see your soul
(I can reach your soul)
Sometimes (sometimes), I look in your eyes, I can see your soul
(I can touch your soul)
Sometimes, I look in your eyes, I can see your soul
(I can hear your soul)
Sometimes (sometimes), I look in your eyes, I can see your soul
Sometimes, I look in your eyes, I can see your soul (*4 to fade)

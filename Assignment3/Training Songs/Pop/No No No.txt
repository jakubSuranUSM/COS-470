You don't know
You don't hear me
Waste my time, mmh

I don't know
What to do now
Face your life
But isn't it time
To say

No, no, no, no
For what you're doing
Don't say there is no other way
No, no, no, no
For what you're sayin'
I'm gonna be so honest today, yeah

Don't you stay
In denial
Clever words, ah, ah
But I know
That you're lying
I feeling fine
Isn't it time for us
To say, yeah

No no no no
For what you're doing
Don't say there is no other way
No, no, no, no
For what you're sayin'
I'm gonna be so honest today, yeah, yeah

No no no no
For what you're doing
Don't say there is no other way
No, no, no, no
For what you're sayin'

No, no, no, no
For what you're doing
Don't say there is no other way
No, no, no, no
For what you're sayin' 
I'm gonna be so honest today, yeah

For what you're doing
Don't say there is no other way
No no no no
For what you're sayin'
I'm gonna be so honest today, yeah, yeah

If I do what I wanted
Just don't have the time
I want to ride my motorcycle
Into the sunshine

My TV's laughin'
We could only feel small
Now come silent into this cell
All I can see is these walls
And I never want to see another shopping mall

Oh Free
To be what I will
Oh Free
I'll keep it up till
I'm Free
But I won't have nothing at all

This is my life
Believe it I will pay
But why should I care about all that today
I need a head start
And I don't want to stall
Gonna take a bulldozer to break down the walls
And I never want to see another shopping mall

Oh Free
To be what I will
Oh Free
I'll keep it up till
I'm Free
But I won't have nothing at all

Oh Free
To be what I will
Oh Free
I'll keep it up till
I'm Free
But I won't have nothing at all

Oh Free
To be what I will
Oh Free
I'll keep it up till
I'm Free
But I won't have nothing at all

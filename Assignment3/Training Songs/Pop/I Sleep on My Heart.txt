The time has come for dreaming 
Don`t be tired, but I feel a need to sleep
'Cause my life takes on you meaning
When I close my eyes and you reveal yourself to me
That`s our time, time for changes 
A time for reason 
Something only you can see 
All my life I have waited
For a chance to give a love 
Only you demand of me

Fame and success are poor relations 
The more I get the less I need it
Happiness is an unknown sensation 
My heart has a hunger and only you can feed it

[Chorus:]
Come on in my dreams tonight 
Show me where to start 
Come on I need to shed some light
I want to sleep on my heart 

In the past for protection 
When someone got too close 
Yet another bridge would burn 
But I can find no connection 
Between the love that you propose and the lessons I have learned

I want to hear your explanations 
You`ll never know how much I need it 
I want my tears to pay your reflection 
'Cause my heart has a hunger and only you can feed it 

[Chorus:]

I`m sitting here surrounded my possessions 
Objects that confront me night and day 
The fruits of my material obsession
But it seems the more I earn the more I have to pay 
You've made it clear that blind ambition 
Leads nowhere and I don`t need it 
I've lost all my fear 
All my inhibitions my heart has hunger but I know you can feed it...

What've we become, everything we had is gone
For a while I thought, we were best of friends
What's on my mind, I used to see you all the time
That's all gone, the fun is gone
You don't like me, I don't like you
What the hell are we supposed to do
Who's to blame this time
I don't like you, you don't like me
Whatever reason you've got, I disagree
Who's to blame this time
What's there to say, don't know the rules, 
Don't like the game
You're a fake I guess, so that's all the same
What's with my head, I'm tired, 
Can't get out of bed
Something's wrong, the fun is gone
You don't like me, I don't like you
What the hell are we supposed to do
Who's to blame this time
I don't like you, you don't like me
Whatever reason you've got, I disagree
Who's to blame this time, 
Who's to blame this time

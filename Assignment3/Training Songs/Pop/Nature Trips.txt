No one else 
Needs to know 
About this 
I can't help 
If you don't 
Let me in 
And if we don't get lost 
We might never find the 
Truth within us 
I've been waiting so long 

Come back to me 
And just be by my side 
I know I'm wrong 
And I'm sorry if I made you cry 
I'm not giving up 
Yeah I've been doing drugs 
Cuz I don't give a f*ck 
I just wanna forget 
Everything that's making me feel bad 
It's making me feel so bad 
Yeah it's making me feel so bad 
It's so bad 
The demons are filling me up 
And I need you back

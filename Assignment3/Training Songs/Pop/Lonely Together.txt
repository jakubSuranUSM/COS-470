Treating you well, but I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of the knife and it hurts just a little
Yeah, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I, I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow but I’m on my way tonight
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (oh)
Before the rush to my blood hurts too much and we flatline (oh)
Yeah and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (oh)

I might free myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I, I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let’s be lonely together (yeah)
A little less lonely together (yeah)

My hands are tied but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I, I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow but I’m on my way tonight
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let’s be lonely together 
Let’s be lonely lonely together
Let’s be lonely lonely together (little less lonely now)
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now

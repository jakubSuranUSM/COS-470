You're on the inside
I'm on the outside
Baby, there's no right side to this game

You had me floatin'
How could I be knowin'
That our love was only a one act play

Flyin'
you should be flyin' home
Flyin'
now you'll be flyin'home

Now that you're leavin'
I just can't believe it
I should have seen it a long time ago

The time I was losing
love can be so confusing
Now I'll put you back on that morning plane

Flyin'
now you're flyin' home
Flyin'
you'll be flyin' home

Get on your way...
Get on your way up to the sky
A brand new day...
it's a brand new day and I'm flyin'!

Flyin'
you'll be flyin' home
Flyin'
it's time you're flyin' home
Flyin'
you'll be flyin' home
Flyin'
I'll see you flyin' home

Flyin' home...

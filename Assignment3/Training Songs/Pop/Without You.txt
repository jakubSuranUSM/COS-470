I am climbing up a tree
Staring at your window
And the light is shining down on me

I'm feeling pretty ill
My mother says I will get better soon
I hope I do

'cause I feel better, so much much better, without you
I feel better, oh so much better, without you
Without you
Without you

hey, it's happening again
Your voice is in the hall
And all the faces look like you

come down here on the street
We'll kiss this sweet concrete
And we'll run on and on tonight until the road is over

I feel better if I left
And smashed that picture on your shelf
Pretending like you killed yourself

I'm at your window
I can't see through

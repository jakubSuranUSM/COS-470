Got a sweet snap
And juggle a pack
It's very nice when it's going down
But if you got time
We don't need a dime
We'll save our money for a house in town

[Chorus: x2]
I'm talking about love (love), love (love)
All you'll ever get from me,
I'm talking about love (love), love (love)
All you'll ever got from me

Cadillac car
And blueberry jar
It doesn't matter what your fancy is
Cause when you're alone
And nobody's home
There's only one thing that you really miss

[Chorus: x2]

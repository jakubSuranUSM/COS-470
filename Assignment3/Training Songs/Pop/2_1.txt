Keeping a brave face
In circumstances
Is impossible
Cannot describe
So many decisions
It's impossible
To know which is
The proper order
The best position
To be in
Take advantage
Or so it seems
The way it goes.

It's tragic, Sandman comes
Laid down on your side, two to one
Too easy, in the dark
You know that, you know, dark reflections
You're soaking wet, in my head
You talk too much, in my bed
It's not necessary, again

Before the ice melts, sandman goes
I just want to say, two in tow
This racket's yours, wet and dumb
Don't ask for more, three's the number
'Cause somewhere along the line, coming down
Coming round again
I've forgotten already

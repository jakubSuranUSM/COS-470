Diamonds in the sunset, now your time has come
Pretty yellow bird fly away into the sun
Don't look down
Do not look down

Spread your broken wings and learn how to fly
Take the diamonds from the sun, 
Wipe the tear from your eye
Don't look down

Do not look down
When the candles burn down worlds turn to stone
That's when you've got to fly, fly away home
Don't look down

Do not look down
Get out of town
Follow the sound

Oh yeah
Baby I, I got something to say t-t-tonight
What you got to say?
Every time I try to find the words
Don't come out right

And I can't stop thinking about you
No I can't stop thinking about you
Do you want me?
Do you need me?
'Cause I think I'm falling in love

Don't go baby, bye-bye-bye
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night
Oh no, don't be sh-sh-shy-shy
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night

Baby, dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me

Beating heart
Racing in my chest
It's beating hard, yeah
Pretty girl
Let's take it all the way
Across the world

'Cause I can't stop thinking about you
No I can't stop thinking about you (Can't stop thinking)
Do you want me? (Do you want me?)
Do you need me? (Do you need me?)
'Cause I think I'm falling in love (I think I'm falling in love)

Don't go baby, bye-bye-bye
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night
Oh no, don't be sh-sh-shy-shy
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night

Baby, dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me

Be my only one, and only for me
I'll be your amor, be my mon chéri
Be my only one, and only for me
I'll be your amor, be my mon chéri

Don't go baby, bye-bye-bye
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night
Oh no, don't be sh-sh-shy-shy
Tell me that you want me to-ni-ni-night

Baby, dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Clap your hands with me
Go to France with me

Baby, baby we can go there

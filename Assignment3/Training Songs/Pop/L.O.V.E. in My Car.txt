Well I'm burning, burning up the street. 
Watching people on their feet in my new car. 
No time, no time to mess around. 
Got my foot flat on the ground in my new car. 

I change the gears, I hear the wheel. 
We're riding smooth and inside the groove, Uh Huh. 
It's ten till eight, and it won't be late. 
So please be there don't hesitate, Uh Huh. 

I'll ride. Tonight, I'll hold you tight and make you mine. 
It's now or never girl. 
Outside. Start light. 
You'll be flying high by my side.

L.O.V.E. 
Do you want to ride in my car? 
I'm saying L.O.V.E. 
Do you want to get down in my car? 

So if you want it, you got it, don't let it go. 
I'm saying L.O.V.E., L.O.V.E.

So I step, I step down on the gas, we're moving super fast. 
Wild and free. 
Let me know is everything's alright? 
We'll rock it through the night, you and me. 

Don't make me mad. Don't make me sad. 
Gonna put me down. Gonna wear a frown. Uh Huh. 
Let's groove all night, till the morning light, 
I'll play your music, you can't refuse it. Uh Huh. 

I'll ride. Tonight. I'll hold you tight and make you mine. 
It's now or never girl. 
Outside. Start light, you'll be flying high by my side. 

(Accelerate, don't step on the brakes.)

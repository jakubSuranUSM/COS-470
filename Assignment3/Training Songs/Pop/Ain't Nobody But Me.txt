Let me tell you a story that'll make a change,
Let me tell you when I'm way out of range
It's about a man who's crueler than me,
So promise not to cause a scene,
Heaven help the one's you love,
There's no big need for stars above

Well, you can run, you, know he'll find you,
It don't matter now, just look behind you,
You had your warn, and you knew the score,
You got it wrong, and that means war
So, why'd you have to treat me rough,
Your explanation's not enough

Ain't nobody but me,
Gonna lie for you, gonna die for you
Ain't no fish in the sea,
Gonna sigh for you, gonna try for you,
Gonna lie for you, gonna die for you, Wooh

You see, I got a mental disposition,
Sometimes, I'm mean, sometimes I'm vicious
I'm Dr. Jekyll, I'm Mr. Hyde,
So if you want to stay alive,
Just give me all you've got to give,
And, then perhaps I'll let you live

Ain't nobody but me,
Gonna lie for you, gonna die for you,
Ain't no fish in the sea,

Goin' sigh for you, gonna try for you,
Goin' lie for you, gonna die for you
Goin' sigh for you, gonna try for you,
Goin' lie for you, gonna die for you

(Hush) now baby, stop your crying,
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lying,
(Hush) now baby, stop your crying
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lying

(Hush) now baby, stop your crying
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lying
(Hush) now baby, stop your crying
(Oh yes) I know that I've been lying
(Hush) now baby, stop your crying

You're pretty cute, you're pretty tough
I'm stuck on you, yeah, I know I'm stuck
Don't wanna chit chat on the telephone
I wanna stay after I walk you home

Stuck on you, all right
Stuck on you, all right

You're the glue that I want to huff
A sticky habit I don't want to stop
On you like shampoo
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere

A gummy bear in your underwear
I'm stuck to you, yeah, I'm stuck right there
You're sweet like gum, you're the brand I chew
I'll chew it and stick it right on you

Stuck on you, all right
Stuck on you, all right

Pomade in your teased hair
I'm stuck on you, you're not going anywhere
Stuck to me you're without a doubt
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere

Stuck on you
Stuck on you
Stuck on you
Stuck on you

And when I'm stuck on you
I say nothing ever beats it (nothing ever beats it)
And when I'm stuck on you
It's everything I needed (everything I needed)
I get so stuck on you
And you've never been a bore (never been a bore)
I get so stuck on you
And I wanna stick to you some more
Some more, some more

Stuck on you [8x]
Yeah, Yeah you [4x]
I'm stuck
I'm stuck

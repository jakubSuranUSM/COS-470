Mission control
Take his feet
He's tired of where they lead him
Twinkle in Mars and his eyes
He's racing up to meet them
Mission control, ohhh
Mission control

So I erase you now
All of the people
I know and love
Say I erase you now
All of the people
I know and love

Baby I know she is alone
But how much is beneath her
She sees me away
And she smiles
She knows I comprehend her

So I erase you now
All of the people
I know and love
Say I erase you now
All of the people
I know and love
Are gone, gone now
Ah now
Mission control
Invite me take me
Bring me back down to my knees
Mission control

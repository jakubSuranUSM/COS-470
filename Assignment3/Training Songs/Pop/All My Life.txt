Billy Joel - All My Life

All my life,
I've searched this whole world through.
Try as I might,
to find someone like you.
The years drifted by,
but it was always on my mind.
I didn't know just how long I'd go,
until I ran out of time.

All my life,
I've hurt the ones who cared.
One by one,
no loving heart was spared.
I've been a wild and restless man,
but, still a man who needs a wife.
That was dream, and now it seems,
you've taken all my life.

For as long as I could,
my intentions were good.
I assumed my affairs would be fine.

But I know very well,
There's a long road to Hell.
That's been paved with intentions like mine.

All my life,
I've paid for my mistakes.
After a while,
the strongest spirit breaks.
I've had heartache and pain,
it cut me deeper than a knife.
But those days are done,
‘cause you're the one I've wanted all my life.

And, I know very well,
There's a long road to Hell.
That's been paved with intentions like mine.

All my life,
my stars were surely crossed.
Now and then,
I missed the love I lost.
But, all that changed,
The day you said you'd be my wife.

Who could have known,
that finding you would only take me
all my life?

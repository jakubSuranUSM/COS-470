Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah

I thought I found love
With somebody else's girl, yeah
Ooh

Walkin 'round feeling so broken-hearted
Lost in a different world
Then you came in my life
Bought me back to reality someday
Now I don't need a fantasy
You're the only one I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Ooh yeah

I thought you'd soon be my girl
But my imagination was running wild
Ooh
I wouldn't listen to a single soul
Deep in a sense of denial
But then you rescued me baby
Opened my eyes and made me see you babe
What real love can be

You're the angel that I need

I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
Ooh

I will never, no I'll never
I will never lose my way again
Oh sweet baby
Ooh

Oh, I see heaven in your eyes with me
Yeah, yeah
Oh baby
Now I will give my lovin' faithfully

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah sweet baby
Be my angel

Heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Sweet sweet baby
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love
I found heaven, sweet heaven baby
On the wings of love

Heaven sweet sweet baby
On the wings of love
You gave me heaven
Sweet heaven baby, sweet baby

I watched the burning sun climb in the morning sky
And from all sides I hear excited voices cry
Today Don Juan will fight the proudest bull of all
And in the blood-red sand which one will fall
Hey! Don Juan!

I am the matador who's won a thousand fights
And just as many girls to while away my nights
But there is one who's love thrills me like heady wine
I'll fear no fear of death while she is mine
Hey! Don Juan!

Don Juan, braver than brave
Show us today what you are
Don Juan, man amon men
Your name will shine like a star

The time draws very near to meet my greatest test
But with her eyes on me I'll fight my best
Hey! Don Juan!

Lord, my whole life has been like a raging torrent
Sweeping many things in its course that other men only dream of
I've valued it so cheaply, until now

But now her love leads me to find peace of mind
Let me live, let me give, my love to her

Don Juan, braver than brave
Show us today what you are
Don Juan, man amon men
Your name will shine like a star
Hey! Don Juan!

The end must be in sight this bull will die for me
And I think of the one who'll share my victory
As my eyes search the crowd my body turns to stone
I see my lover there, but not alone
Hey! Don Juan!

If I can't live for her, then there's no life for me
So in this blood-red ring, die Don Juan!

Don Juan!
Don Juan!
Don Juan!

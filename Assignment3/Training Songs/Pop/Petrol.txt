The cars come up the drive, so many people inside,
Under the stars they smile, 
They want to invade my home
I pace the darkened hall, try to consider it all
In the dull lamps glow 
And the truth is I don't know

The cars stop outside, they all stay inside
The house is drenched in light, 
But what have I done wrong?
I quietly climb the stairs, 
I remember all the years,
I check everything is right I need to hurry-now!

I've been preparing for days, 
I know exactly what to say
'No one will be around, no one will take me down'
They'll all get in back in the cars, 
And maybe they'll go home
But the things they'll never know, 
Like where it is I go

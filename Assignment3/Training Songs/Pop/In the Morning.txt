Oh oh
Oh oh

He can't bear to leave me, in the morning
I'm too blind to see him, in the morning
Buried all my feelings
I'm withholding, it's not fair to let him fall

I tried to leave him signs
Give him warning
Are they hard to recognize?
You're still falling 
Away 'cause I can't tell him
I don't love him anymore

I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go

He's falling even deeper, didn't see it coming
His heart belongs to me, but I'm still running
Away 'cause I can't tell him
I don't love him anymore

I can't be who he wants me to be, in the morning
I can't see whom he wants me to see, in the morning
But I can't wait to tell him
I don't love him anymore

I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go
I've got to let him go, no
I've got to let him

I need him in the evening
I need him more and more
But when I wake to see him
He's not even on my mind oh no no no

I've got to let him go, no no no
I've got to let him go, no no no no
I've got to let him go, no no no
I've got to let him go, go

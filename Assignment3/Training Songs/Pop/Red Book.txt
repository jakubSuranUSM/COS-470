Days they surround you through the day
Words imprison you they say
Maybe there is something you can do
Look around there's no resisting truth
Just breathe it out 
And find out what you're looking for
Yeh breathe it out
And find out what you're looking for
Just leave it now
And let your mind roam free
Help me get you through the night
Hush and listen to the quiet
Tell me if there's something I can do
Trust in me don't be misunderstood
Just breathe it out 
And find out what you're looking for
Yeh breathe it out
And find out what you're looking for
Just leave it now
And let your mind roam free
Just breathe it out 
And find out what you're looking for
Yeh breathe it out
And find out what you're looking for
Just leave it now
And let your mind roam free
Just breathe it out 
And find out what you're looking for
Yeh breathe it out
And find out what you're looking for
Just leave it now
And let your mind roam free

You let me try so hard, babe
I'm giving all my best
Pretending there's no passion
You seem to be impressed
Won't you tell me what to do
I'm so in love with you

Don't ever make me give you
A promise I might break
I never wanna have to
Pretend and lie and fake
Baby tell me what to do
I'm so in love with you

Every time you need me I'll be here
Every time you leave me I'll be near
Every time you hold me like you do
I'm so in love with you

Every time you need me I'll be here
Every time you leave me I'll be near
Every time you hold me like you do
I'm so in love with you

Don't make me tell you stories
There's so much I could say
But words destroy the moment
And carry it away
Please tell me what to do
'Cause I'm in love with you

Your love is like an ocean
I'm drowning in your soul
I'm blinded by emotion
I'm gonna lose control
Baby tell me what to do
I'm so in love with you

Every time you need me I'll be here
Every time you leave me I'll be near
Every time you hold me like you do
I'm so in love with you

Every time

I'll be your king
I'll be your queen
And all that happens in between
I'll be your fix
Your lucky dice
And here in Wonderland in paradise
Your serenator
Your hall fo fame
Your force of nature
And back again
Your last confession
Your holy grail
Your first impression
From London to the USA

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Everybody's feeling wonderland

I'll take my place
My majesty
So put on your crown and dance with me
My fate awaits a celebration
A part of your society
Don't leave me waiting
Don't leave me here
The life and times of this time of year
My reelection
My final stand
My words of wisdom
From heaven to the promised land

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Everybody's feeling wonderland

And the music of my body
And the music gives me joy
And the music keeps me company
When I need somewhere to cry
Yeah, the feeling is sensational
And you gotta understand
How the music makes me feel wonderland

All your dreams are made
All your dreams are made
In Wonderland
In Wonderland

(You wanna see what you came here for?)

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Everybody's feeling wonderland

Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Get on my feet, get on my knees for it
Music makes me feel good
Music makes me feel good
Everybody's feeling wonderland

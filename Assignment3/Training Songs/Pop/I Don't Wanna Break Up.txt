Hey, I said it's alright 
I'm gonna make my change 
When I bust my time, oh baby 
I'll tell you the truth 

You're kind of beautiful, yeah 
I heard a funny thing 
I hear it'll make a change 
When I hit my feet and then go baby 

I'll tell you the truth 
You're kind of beautiful, yeah 
Yeah 
I don't want to break up 

I don't want to take it on the mouth 
I don't want to sit tight 
I don't want to bust it out 
Bust it out baby, don't get down 

I don't want to justify my love 
I don't want to get tight 
I don't want to bust my brain, 
Bust my brain, come on 

Team, don't want to let me down 
Let me record my change 
When it takes no sound to go, oh baby 
I'll tell you the truth 

You're kind of beautiful, yeah 
Yeah 
And I don't want to break up 
I don't want to spread myself too thin 

I don't want to shoot straight 
I don't want to bust again 
Bust it in baby, don't get down 
I don't want to search for the truth 

I don't want to get back 
I don't want to find the point we're bound to lose 
Come on 
Yeah, I said it's alright 

I'm gonna make my change 
Everyone is a silver shifter, babe 
Now tell me the truth 
I'm kind of beautiful, yeah 

And I don't want to break up 
I don't want to take it on the mouth 
I don't want to sit tight 
I don't want to bust it out 

Bust it out baby, don't get down 
I don't want to justify my love 
I don't want to get tight 
Hey, I don't want to, I don't want to 

I don't want to, come on! 
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! 
Yeah baby come on, 
I did it for you! Come on!

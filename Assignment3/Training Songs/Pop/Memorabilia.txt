Everywhere I go
I take a little piece of you

I collect, I reject
Photographs I took of you
Towns that I passed through
I´ve got to have a memory

Or I have never been there
I have never had you, had you, had you
I can´t remember
Give me a reminder

I collect, I reject
Memorabilia
Memorabilia

I like little bits of glassware
Ashtrays with inscriptions
Plastic things on pencils
Bits of mass production

Postcards, pretty pictures
Little bits of plastic
Covering up the bedroom
To show you I´ve been there
To show you I´ve been there

Keychains and snowstorms
Keychains and snowstorms
Give me a reminder
Give me a reminder

Memorabilia, memorabilia
Keychains and snowstorms
Memorabilia, memorabilia
I can´t remember
Give me a reminder

I collect, I reject
Photographs I took of you
Towns that I passed through
I´ve got to have a memory

Or I have never been there
I have never had you, had you, had you
I can´t remember
Give me a reminder
I collect, I reject

Castanets, mantillas
Torremolinos
Castanets and plastic men

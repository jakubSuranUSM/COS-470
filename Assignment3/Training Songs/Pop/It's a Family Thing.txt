It's 4 o'clock in the morning
I've seen the man in the moon
I've seen things, I couldn't have dreamed of
I wished that you would come soon
And I know, when rainbow clouds open
I'll be the one on the moon
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

[Chorus]
Should I stand back and watch
As you continue to argue all night
Maybe this is my role in life
But don't you worry yourself cause it's alright
If I knew what to say
Just like today when we were discussing the weather
I could want her amour
More of those days when we could be laughing together

It's time for quiet contemplation
Just like those men on the moon
No sense in thinking it over
Cause one and one should make
It's a kind of curious assumption
To think I understand you

[Chorus]

If I kissed you like this
I know god exists
And what I was hoping to find here
Hold that thought in your head
If something I said
Could give you the wrong impression
All about me
All I want to be
How I suffer from a lack of direction
It's a family thing
When I'm just unable to find where we're going.

They lit the fires under our feet
Chased us into the hills, oh
They let the wolves off of the leash
Shoulda finished the kill

We've got ashes on our shoes
And an outcast attitude
We're all immune 'cause we know the truth is viral

We might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now

No bones, no drama
We live how we wanna
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
Be the outsiders, the outsiders

We set our tents up on the fringe
With our backs to their cool now
And in our heads we fit right in
'Cause they gave us the fuel

We've got ashes on our shoes
And an outcast attitude
We're all immune cos you know the truth is viral

We might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now

No bones, no drama
We live how we wanna
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
Be the outsiders, the outsiders

We don't need good reputations
We don't need no thought control
We don't need good reputations (Our smiles are real we don’t fake 'em)
We don't need no thought control

We might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
But the in-crowd is so out right now

No bones, no drama
We live how we wanna
Yeah, we might be the outsiders
Be the outsiders, the outsiders

We don't need good reputations
We don't need no thought control
We don't need good reputations (Our smiles are real we don’t fake 'em)
We don't need no thought control

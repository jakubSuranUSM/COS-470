You have never been there
Till you've heard the fat girl sing
And nothing else matters
Everything just pales within

Hanging 'round the corners
Shouting at the top of your voice
Sing you little fuckers
Sing like you've got no choice

I believe it's true
We are everywhere
And I feel the wind
And it feels so high

There really is no purpose
Definitely is no need
Stop running 'round the houses
Like a race horse on speed

I believe again
We are everything
And I feel the wind
And I've got so high

C'mon, baby, let's go
Ooh c'mon, baby, let's go
And you said where to?
I said I don't know

I just need to run
And you need it too
And I catch your ride
And I feel the wind
And it feels so high

We're plotting out the acorns
Wondering to where they'll lead
We're plotting out the acorns
Wondering to where they'll seed

C'mon, baby, let's go
Yeah c'mon, baby, let's go
And you said where to?
I said I don't know

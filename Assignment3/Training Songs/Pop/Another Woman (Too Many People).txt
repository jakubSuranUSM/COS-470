(r.r. maue)
I met a friend of mine just the other day
She was really sorry, I said: "I'm okay!"
But then she told me 'bout a boy who looked like you
On your harley-d, you were talking to:

Another woman
Another woman

I'm not the kind of girl who would take advice
I'm a self-made lady of my own device
I let the people say what the people want
But I'm asking you, are they right or wrong

Another woman
Another woman

Too many people walk out in the rain
You saved her from drowning
There's no-one to blame
And if I cry me a river

My life stays the same
Got nothing to live for
I'm losing the game
She has got the best of me, my man

Now I believe that water turns to red, red wine
I'd buy every story from you every time
You could even tell me that the world is flat
But I never thought that you would ever have

Another woman
Another woman

So I call you up because I'm missing you
I dial your number, baby
And I get right through
But then the poison arrow hits as cold as ice
Drrrrt.......drrrrt.......hello!

Another woman
Another woman

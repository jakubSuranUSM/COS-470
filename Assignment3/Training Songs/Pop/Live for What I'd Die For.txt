I wanna love the one I never dared to
Speak the words I hid away
Wanna say each word how I would say your name
I wanna say the things that I was scared to
Shout them high see where they fall
Let it make no sense but never care at all
My heart is beating to a rhythm
That nobody else can hear
But I can hear it, I can hear it clear

If you can see me now,
Am I who you’d want me to be?

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away

I wanna step on to the high wire
100 miles above the ground
To walk the line, but never to look down
So that’s where they can find me
Between the clouds and the sky
That is where I’m gonna watch the world go by

If you can see me now
Am I who you’d want me to be?

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away

It's been a while I thought I heard you say
We go a long way back
And now it's gone so
So you left, flown away
For the brothers day and I'll say
Fearless
Way down to the bone
Carrying yourself together
Cause you're way back home
Weightless, heavenly we seem
You don't have to bother
You don't have to stay

For what you are
What a price to pay
Some say your here so pride
I hope you find some way from you, a way from you
I don't know cause all I love you
Just a morning away our plans stay and I'll say
Just a morning away with the brothers day and I'll say you

Fearless
Way down to the bone
Drive yourself together
Cause you're way back home
Weightless, heavenly we seem
You don't have to bother
You don't have to stay

Fearless
Way down to the bone
Drive yourself together
Drive your way back home
Weightless, heavenly we seem
You don't have to bother
You don't have to

Fearless
Drive your way back home
Weightless
Fearless
You don't have to

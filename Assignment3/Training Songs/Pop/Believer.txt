If I could be someone
Within an hour or a day
If I could turn the wheel of fortune
Could you guess what I would say?
If I could be a believer
If I could be whatever
You'd want me to be
A believer, a believer, a believer.

Someone, someone
To make your every day
Yeah, someone just trying
To wipe them tears away
Yeah, someone burning fires
On the edge of every town
Yeah, someone just rollin'
In your love as it comes down.

And if I could see things different
If I could turn the clock of time
If I could rearrange the play, love
I would never leave you behind
If I could be a believer If I could be
Whoever you'd want me to be.
A believer, a believer, a believer.

Someone, someone
To make your every day
Yeah, someone just trying
To wipe them tears away
Yeah, someone burning fires
On the edge of every town
Yeah, someone just rollin'
In your love as it comes down.

Someone, someone
To make your every day
Yeah, someone, bitter morning
Come on play your solid blues.
A believer, a believer, believer, believer, a believer
Then I might stop, then I might stop playing pretend
And if I could show you
My heaven I'd wear my thorny crown
I walk the stairs of seven
I walk them down

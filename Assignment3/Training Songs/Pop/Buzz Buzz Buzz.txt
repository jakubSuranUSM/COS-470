You see, Buzz buzz buzz goes the honey bee
And tweedily tweedily twee goes the bird
But the sound of your little voice darling
That's the sweetest sound I've ever heard

I say, Buzz buzz buzz goes the honey bee
While tweedily tweedily twee goes the bird
Buzz buzz buzz goes the honey bee
While tweedily tweedily twee goes the bird

Let's go out to the clover now
Up in Maine and the grass is growin'

And, Buzz buzz buzz goes the honey bee
And tweedily tweedily twee goes the bird
But the sound of your little voice is sweeter
It's the sweetest sound I've ever heard

Well I love to be out here, in the springtime
With the birds and the bees
The bees sing good
The birds sing good
But they're not like you for me

Buzz buzz buzz goes the honey bee
And tweedily tweedily twee goes the bird
But the sound of your little voice darling
That's the sweetest sound I've ever heard

Tell them the modern lovers
(Buzz buzz buzz)
(That's what the honey bee does)
Tweedily tweedily twee
(You know the bird does that)
Buzz buzz buzz (goes the honey bee)
(And) tweedily tweedily twee (goes the bird)

Buzz buzz buzz
(Goes the honey bee)
Tweedily tweedily twee
(Goes the bird)
Buzz buzz buzz (goes nature's honey bee)
While tweedily tweedily twee goes the

I don't want to holiday in the sun
I want to go to the new Belsen
I want to see some history
Cause now t got a reasonable economy

Oh now I got a reason
And I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
To be waiting
The Berlin wall

In Sensurround sound in a two inch wall
Well I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine
And I got world war three
I'm looking over the wall
And they're looking at me

Oh now l got a reason
And I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
To be waiting
The Berlin wall

They're staring all night
And they're staring all day.
L had no reason to be here at all.
But now I got a reason if's no real reason
And I'm waiting at Berlin wall
I gotta go over the Berlin wall.
I don't understand it

Claustrophobia there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets
I went in before
And now I got a reason
It's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall

I gotta go over the wall,
I don't understand this bit at all

Please don't be waiting for me.

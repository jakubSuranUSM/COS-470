I'm lingering on when they kiss
Leaning towards this abyss
And of lately the only people I can stare
Are the unraveled ones with their hands laying bare
But their hands are numb and empty
Their dull silence soothes me
Loud whispers in my back as if I couldn't hear
Thought I left ghosts behind but they're just coming near

It doesn't matter, does it
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

Rage as a fabric, through and through
Like that gaze they used to do
'Cause the suicidal thoughts that are still in my head
Gives her that awful side-smile when I lay in bed

It doesn't matter, does it
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

She's barely feeding, but she'll deny
Ribbon-legged, she passes by
Until she surrenders in the midst of the street
And the guys simply stare but continue to eat

It doesn't matter, does it
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

It doesn't matter, does it
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

And if I am cast out 'cause I wanted some more
And if this guy dances way too close to the shore
And if I could just push this door chalked on the wall
And if after the void there's somewhere else to fall

Forget I said it
I soliloquize
A stinging nettle
Their hands on their thighs

Run if you stole a shard of sunlight, yeah, yeah
Don't ever tell them, I've got your back, yeah, yeah
Choking to tears with shards of sunlight, yeah, yeah
Run if you stole a shard of sunlight, yeah, yeah

Run if you stole a shard of sunlight (oh, run)
Don't ever tell them, I've got your back (save all you can)
Choking to tears with shards of sunlight (oh, you won't be found)
Run if you stole a shard of sunlight (oh, and never come back)

It doesn't matter, does it 
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

It doesn't matter, does it 
If I know any exit
If I believe in god and if god does exist
If I believe in god and if god does exist

God, god, god, god
God, god, god, god
God, god, god, god
God, god, god

Oh, didn't matter where we lie
Back in spring of '79
There were no rules to feel sublime
Let's trek down the path

We slept to the radio
Gentle as my heart beats now
Turn up the fuse all over again, my friend

Just to take me away

Rewind, be my DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind, there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

There is a thread that runs along
The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
Weave all into one
The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures, rays and larks
Relax

Just to take me away

Rewind, be my DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind, there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same
Take me away
So far away
No-one will find us
On our own island
Just out of choice
The dreamer fought the battleship away
It's over the horizon

Voices inside of us to guide us on
Guiding us on (can't you hear us calling you)
Can't you hear us calling you
Can't you hear us calling you

Rewind, we were DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind, there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

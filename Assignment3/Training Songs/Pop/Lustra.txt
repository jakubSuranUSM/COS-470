Lustra
There's something hiding behind your immaculate smile
You have always known, so let it out
Lustra
I fell your anger swell the radical in your style, girl
Take the cross you bear and throw it out
She's coming up, coming up
Breathe it in and let it out
Let it go, be yourself, take a shot
It's what you've always known now
You've always known now
What you waiting for
Lustra
It's gonna take as long, as long as it will take
To strike a match to your silence
Take the pain you bear and burn it out
She's coming up, coming up
Breathe it in and let it out
Let it go, be yourself, take a shot and give it out
Coming up, coming up
Breathe it in and let it out
Let it go, be yourself, take a shot
It's what you've always known now
You've always known now
What you waiting for
Lustra
Don't you know where's no tomorrow
In a sense, there's no way out
Innocence is all you're born with
Inner sense dictates the way you wheel
The way you deal with knowing who you are
Lustra
You know where hell is when you
Fight the maze of denial
Do it
You've gotta take a shot
Give all you've got for your dreams girl
She's coming up, coming up
Breathe it in and let it out
Let it go, be yourself, take a shot and give it out
Coming up, coming up
Breathe it in and let it out
Let it go, be yourself, take a shot
It's what you've always known now
You've always known now

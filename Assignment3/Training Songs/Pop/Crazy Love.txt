I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heaven opens every time she smiles
And when I come to her, that's where I belong
I guess I'm running to her like a river's song

She gives me love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, crazy love
She's got a fine sense of humour, when iÂ´m feeling down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down

She takes away my trouble, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache in the night like a thief
She gives me love, love, love crazy love
She gives me love, crazy love

I guess I need her in the daytime
I guess I need her in the night
Someone strong to put my arms around her
I kiss her, kiss her tight

She gives me love, crazy love
She gives me love, crazy, crazy love
A crazy love

When you’re older maybe you will have no problem
Marry and be happy till you’re old and gray
There will be no clouds
Maybe if you’re lucky you will rock one day

Up, down, round and round
Life is a carousel
With every turn
Try for the brass ring

When you grow up you will have a lifetime of money
You won’t ever have to worry about the rent
There will be no clouds
Maybe you’ll grow up to be the president

Up, down, round and round
Life is a carousel
With every turn
Try for the brass ring

Up, down, round and round
Life is a carousel
With every turn
Try for the brass ring

There is always something that is ‘bout to happen
Praying all the time and things will be okay
If there is a cloud
And you feel it’s that, just have to sing this way

Been a lot of days
Been a lot of nights
Been a lot of times in my life
Been a lot of tears that I've cried
Been a lot of times that I just had to keep them all locked inside
Been a lot of friends
Friends I have lost
For reasons now I forgot
Been a lot of people that I've know
But maybe looking back I realize, w
We weren't all that close

And the love you made
Held by paper chains
Broken by the weight of our two hearts
And these paper chains 
Is now all that remains
Just hanging by a thread
Torn apart

If I was wrong
If I was right
It's easy said with hindsight
Something I've never done in my life
I never judged a man unless I've seen the world through his eyes
Some things I've done
Some things I've said
Some mistakes, some regrets
You can't live your life in the past
So try your best to carry on because there's no turning back

And the love you made
Held by paper chains
Broken by the weight of our two hearts
And these paper chains 
Is now all that remains
Just hanging by a thread
Torn apart

And the love you made
Held by paper chains
Broken by the weight of our two hearts

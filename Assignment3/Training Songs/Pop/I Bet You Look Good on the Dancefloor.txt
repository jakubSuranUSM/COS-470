Cooler than the red dress 
'cause I'm cooler 
'cause I'm cooler 
'cause I'm cooler than the red dress 
'cause I'm cooler 
'cause I'm cooler 

Using subtle diploma 
To get what she wants 
Can't say that it's wrong 
No baby 
A man's not a boy can't you see 
We're pulling the strings 
We're taking the lead 

And when you're sure 
You'll never let him play you again 
She'll put on your favorite smile 
And plug the cord 
And get you in your dirty dance 
Her hips will send you into a trance 

'cause I'm cooler than the red dress 
I'd rather catch a guy on my own 
(Give me credit) 
'cause what you see the man gets 
(Don't forget it) 
And if he don't I'm better off here alone 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Don't need candlelight to make you stay over 
I'm giving it up now, baby 
If that's what I gotta do just to own you 
I'm giving it up now maybe 
(To you) 

I've played the desperate lady 
Jumped through all of the hoops boy 
Instead of constant craving 
I leave the chasing to you 
And if you don't respect it 
Ill pick up my Jimmy Choos 
'cause boy if you don't love me 
Then I've got nothing to lose 

'cause I've been down this roads before 
I should have known that I was to blame 
Won't put on your 
Favorite smile 
Won't plug the cord to get you to your dirty dance 
That's not the way I get my demands 

'cause I'm cooler than the red dress 
I'd rather catch a guy on my own 
'cause what you see the man gets 
And if he don't I'm better off here alone 

(Save your kisses) 
'cause I'm cooler than the red dress 
(Do you get it) 
I'd rather catch a guy on my own 
(Give me credit) 
'cause what you see the man gets 
(Don't forget it) 
And if he don't I'm better off here alone 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Don't need candlelight to make you stay over 
I'm giving it up now baby 
If that's what I gotta do just to own you 
I'm giving it up now baby 
Don't need candlelight to make you stay over 
(Right now) 
I'm giving it up now baby 
If that's what I gotta do just to own you 
(Own you, own you baby) 
I'm giving it up now maybe 

Said don't call me baby 
(Cooler than the red dress) 
Said don't call me baby 
(Cooler than the red dress)

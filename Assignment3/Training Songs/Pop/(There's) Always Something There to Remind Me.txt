walk along those city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be
Oh how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?

Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 
You'll always be a part of me 

Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh 
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share 
Just go back to the places where we used to go 
And I'll be there 

How can I forget you 
When there is always something there to remind me? 
Always something there to remind me 
I was born to love you 

And I will never be free 
You'll always be a part of me 
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh 
Whoa-oh-ooo-ohhh 

f you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share 
Just come back to the places where we used to go 
And I'll be there 
How can I forget you 

When there is always something there to remind me? 
Always something there to remind me 
I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 

When there is 
When there is 
When, there, is 

Always something there to remind me 
Always something there to remind me 
Always something there to remind me

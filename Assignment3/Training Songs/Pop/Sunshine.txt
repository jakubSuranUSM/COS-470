Sometimes it's hard
When rain's pouring on
I used to worry
What tomorrow would bring
Then you came along
Changed my world around
Gave me something to believe in
When I'm upside down

And let me say I owe it all to you
And I want to thank you
For making the sun come
Shining through

Now that we're together
Everything can only get better (get better and better)
Now that you're around me
Swear I'm gonna love you forever (forever and ever)
Now that we're together
Everything can only get better
You bring the sunshine to my life

If you should find
You need someone too
Just turn head in my direction
And I'll do the same to you

And let me say from the bottom of my heart
I want to thank you (I want to thank you)
For making the sun come shining through

Now that we're together
Everything can only get better (get better and better)
Now that you're around me
Swear I'm gonna love you forever (forever and ever)
Now that we're together
Everything can only get better (do do do do do do)
Now that you're around me
Swear I'm gonna love you forever (hey)
You bring the sunshine to my life

Keep bringing (keep on)
Keep bringing (keep on)
Keep bringing
The sunshine to me

Keep bringing (keep on)
Keep bringing (keep on)
Keep bringing
The sunshine to me

And let me ask you
Girl, where would I be
Without you right here
Making the sun shine down on me

Now that we're together
Everything can only get better (get better and better)
Now that you're around me
Swear I'm gonna love you forever (bring the sunshine, bring the loving)
Now that we're together
Everything can only get better
Now that you're around me
Swear I'm gonna love you forever
You bring the sunshine to my life

Bring it on (keep bringing)
Bring it on (keep bringing)
Bring it on (keep bringing)
The sunshine to me

Bring it on (keep bringing)
Bring it on (keep bringing)
Bring it on (keep bringing)
The sunshine to me

[Repeat until fade]

In this life
Everyone needs some kind of guiding light
In your eyes
I'm seeing a true picture of paradise
And my love for you grows stronger every day
All my wishes came true
When you walked my way
Chorus
You're my shining star
When things go wrong and I can't go on
My shining star
Your light it giudes me
You're my shining star
When things go wrong and I can't go on
My shining star
Inspires me
When I'm down
And looking for someone to talk to
You come around
Your spirit it helps me to make it through
All the lonely experienecs life has to bring
When you're by me side
I can face anything
Come on, come on, come on, shine
Come on, come on, come on, shine on me
Oh I can feel your light, and it feels so right
I thank God above for giving me your love

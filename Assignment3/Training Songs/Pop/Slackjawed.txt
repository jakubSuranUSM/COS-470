Words and Music: Mike Connell
Someone tells me somethin' --
Well I'm prepared to listen.
Nothin's goin' on, nothin's goin' on.
Standing next to no one,
Well that was my intention.
Nothin's goin' on, nothin's goin' on.
But then you're back and I'm guessing it's not so bad at all.
And I've been standing slackjawed since you were here.
Yeah, I've been standing slackjawed.
Something says this may be the strangest light I'll mention --
Someone left you on, someone left you on.
Saying next to nothing -- the words were my invention.
Someone left you on, someone left you on.
And now you're here and I'm thinking it's not so bad at all.
And I've been standing slackjawed since you were here.
Yeah, I've been standing slackjawed.

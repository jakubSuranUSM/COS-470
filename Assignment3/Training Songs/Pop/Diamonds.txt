You woke up to hate your life again 
Feeling it's all been said and seen today 
You woke up to fake your smile again 
You're not the one, you're not the one 

You feel bittersweet when others win 
You'd rather see them fall than gain a thing 
You know you're too afraid to fail 
You're not the one, you're not the one 

Slowly, slowly, more away 'cause 

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone 
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want 
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading 
Slowly, slowly, slowly more away 

I can't believe a thing you say 
Can you the words don't come out easily 
I can't believe it's all right to cry for what you never lost now 
You're not the one 

Slowly, slowly, more away 'cause 

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone 
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want 
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading 
Slowly, slowly more away from you
From you

Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly more away

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone 
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want 
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading 
Slowly, slowly, slowly more away

Maybe the diamonds are not for everyone (more away)
Maybe the lie you live is really all they want 
You stay silent watching all dreams around you fading 
Slowly, slowly more away from you

I'm crying again
Can't remember last time when
A day went by without tears falling
I try my hardest
But I always get sent to bed
I don't know why, that's why I'm crying

Mummy you're not watching me
Oh please

I could run away
But I would rather try again
I don't know why but I'm still crying
If only you'd see
I'm not the fool you think I am
If you could see, if you could see

Mummy you're not watching me
Oh please

I'm crying again
Can't remember last time when
A day went by without tears falling
I could run away
But I would rather try again
Until I know you're watching me

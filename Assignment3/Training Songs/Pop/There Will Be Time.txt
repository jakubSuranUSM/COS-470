In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have

So open up my eyes to a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night
But I lift up my eyes to a new high
And indeed there would be time

But in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have
And in the cold light I live, I only live for you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

A time to love
A time to sing, a time to shine
A time to leave, a time to stay
There is a time, a time to cry
A time to love, a time to live
There is a time, a time to sing
A time to love

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

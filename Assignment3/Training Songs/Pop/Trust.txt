Trust

I can't believe it's a just dessert
I can't believe just how much it hurts
It's like a pain that I could never know
Come on, come up, come on, come on

I got no trust
And all the wreckage was sealed
(Trust)
Like rising crows in a field
(Trust)

I got my raging sea, but got no agency
I got no love to devote
(Trust)
I will never be whole

I learned a thing that I shouldn't learn
Kicked out of heaven how I fell and burn
Born too young I never learned to fly
You can't heal a wound that you're keeping alive
It's a low as this, as old as this
So long ago, a buried kiss
I pull and tear to make the stitches fray
Corrosively remake my DNA
No point in showing, so now I'm going
The ravens in the field begin the final crowing
I got no trust

I got no trust
And all the wreckage was sealed
(Trust)
Like rising crows in a field
(Trust)

I got my raging sea, but got no agency
I got no love to devote
(Trust)
I will never be whole

The dog assumes an open field, where it's safe
The house is like a vortex, so black with hate
Heredity of hurt, cos nothing's ever clear
The demons in the shadows now, there's everything to fear
And this is
Trust

I got no trust
And all the wreckage was sealed
(Trust)
Like rising crows in a field
(Trust)

I got my raging sea, but got no agency
I got no love to devote
(Trust)
I will never be whole

I will never be whole
(Trust)
I will never be whole
(Trust)
I will never be whole
(Trust)
I will never be whole

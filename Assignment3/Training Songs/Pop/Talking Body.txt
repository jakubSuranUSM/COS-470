Bed, stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke smoke me broke
I don't care, I'm down for what you want
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer loving and fights
How it is for us, and it's all because

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on
Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on

Love can be love
Anything you want I'll give it up
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste your fingertips
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer loving and fights
How it is for us, and it's all because

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on
Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on

Oh oh

Bodies
Oh baby make 'em bodies, we just use them for fun
Bodies
Let's use 'em up 'till every little piece is gone
Let's go! On and on and on
Let's go! On and on (let's go)

Oh now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on
Ooh now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on

We're talking body
Put it on me
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We f*ck for life, on and on and on

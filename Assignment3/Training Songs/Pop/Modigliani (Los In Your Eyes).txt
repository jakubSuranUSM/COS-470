Darkest night, candlelight
Your hands were soft
Your skin too pale
White on white
I had to turn away
From your light

I could see you
Laugh at me
You knew what
I was thinking inside
With one look
Of your all seeing eyes

(Your eyes)
Wear the disguise
(Your eyes)
(Your eyes)
I'm lost in your eyes

Your glance felt
Like a knife
So clear, so blue
I was swimming inside
I was swimming inside

You'll always be real to me
I took one look
I could fly away
Stare, stare
In your all seeing eyes
Till starlight

(Your eyes)
You wear the disguise
(Your eyes)
(Your eyes)
I'm lost in your eyes

(Your eyes)
You wear the disguise
(Your eyes)
(Your eyes)
I'm lost in your eyes

Amedio
Gli occhi tuoi
Mi anno fatto innamorare

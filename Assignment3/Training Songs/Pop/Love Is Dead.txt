Nothing ever goes right
Nothing really flows in my life
No one really cares if no one ever shares my bed
People push by with fear in their eyes in my life

Love is dead, love is dead

The telephone rings, but no one ever thinks to speak to me
The traffic speeds by, but no one's ever stopped here yet
Intelligent friends don't care in the end, believe me

Love is dead, love is dead

And plastic people wear imaginary smiles
Exchanging secrets at the back of their minds
Plastic people
Plastic people

Nothing ever goes right
Nothing really flows in my life
No one really cares if there's horrors inside my head
People push by with fear in their eyes in my life

Love is dead, love is dead
Love is dead, love is dead
Love is dead, love is dead

And all the lies that you've given us
And all the things things that you said

And all the lies that you've given us
Blow like wind in my head

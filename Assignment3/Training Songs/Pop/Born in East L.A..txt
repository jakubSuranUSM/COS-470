Took a walk to the corner store
Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores
Up pulled a guy in a yellow van
Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand

He said, alright all you mohuddles down here
I want you all to hit the floor
I got one thing to ask you and nothing more
So answer in English, if you can
Where were ya born, man

Huh? where was I born?

That's right, I said
Where were ya born?

Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man
Hey, I'm a cancer with a bad moon rising

Look here Alfago, watch my lips
Where were ya born?

I was born in East L.A
Man, I was born in East L.A

Oh yeah, you were born in East L.A
Let's see your green card

Huh?  green card?
I'm from East L.A

Alright, then who's president of the United States

Oh, that's easy, man
That guy that used to be on death valley days, John Wayne

Alright, let's go, come on

Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land
People talkin' so fast, I couldn't understand
There was nobody there to lend a helping hand
I was cold, it was dark where is a burger stand

I want to go back to east L.A
I wish I was back in East L.A
I don't belong here in downtown t.j.
Cause I was born in East L.A, ole

I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream
Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine
Walked all day in the burning sun
Now I know what it's like to be born to run

Up ahead was the promised land
Shining like a star just beyond my hand
All I could see was a golden door
I looked up, a sign said five billion sold

And I was back in East L.A
Yes, I was back in East L.A
You know I'm never gonna stray
Cause I was born in East L.A, oh L.A

East L.A

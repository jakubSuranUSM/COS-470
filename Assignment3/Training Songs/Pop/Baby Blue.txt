She wrote me today
That she won't come back to stay
That she'd only comes to pick up her clothes
She wrote I must not cry
That her love for me has died
But she'd found somebody else, I suppose
Baby Blue, Baby Blue
Do you know that I'm still in love with you
Now I know that you won't be here no more
How I need you, how I want you Baby Blue
I know I must forget
All the good times we had
But I'll know that I can't forget you
You're still on my mind
And I know I can find
Such a girl as my sweet Baby Blue
Baby Blue, Baby Blue
Do you know that I'm still in love with you
Now I know that you won't be here no more
How I need you, how I want you Baby Blue

Baby Blue, Baby Blue
Do you know that I'm still in love with you
Now I know that you won't be here no more
How I need you, how I want you Baby Blue

I've got a television, it's filling me with home
I've got a television, it's filling me with home
Wherever I end up, wherever I roam
Hey I've got a television it's filling me with home
I've got a phone that beeps, makes me know I'm not alone
I've got a phone that beeps, makes me know I'm not alone
Wherever I end up I sleep like a stone
I've got a phone that beeps, makes me know I'm not alone

My head my shoulders knees and toes
My head my shoulders knees and toes
My head my shoulders knees and toes
They're running everywhere where to go
My head my shoulders knees and toes
My head my shoulders knees and toes
My head my shoulders knees and toes
They take me to where I want to go

Cry

Got hurt
Don't you wanna get some
Esso

And all around the party we stand in circles now
Yeah all around the party we stand in circles now
Walking I find you who knows where I come from
All around the party we stand in circles now
I had a dog before now I don't know where it's gone
I had a dog before now I don't know where it's gone
Oh how did I get here did it say when I was young
I had a dog before now don't know where it's gone

I've got a television, it's filling me with home
I've got a television, it's filling me with home
Wherever I end up wherever I roam
Hey I've got a television it's filling me with home

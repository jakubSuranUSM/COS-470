Movement surrounds me - mysteries
Movement surrounds me
Face
Face to face
With a stranger in myself
And his grip on my soul
Face
Face to face
With the force he occupies

All my thoughts and my whole life
He wants me to fail

He attracts me and he charms me
He excites me and he calms me
Makes me freezing and he warms me
But someone is trying to warn me
Face
Face to face - I'll show myself and I will fight

I'll drive him out of my life
Face
Face to face - with the power of my thoughts
I'll defeat his magic force
Movement surrounds me - mysteries
Face
Face to face - I've destroyed his work on me

I feel strong again and free

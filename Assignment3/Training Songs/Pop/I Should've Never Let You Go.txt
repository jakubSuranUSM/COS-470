Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I, Oh, Oh, Oh, I.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I, Oh, Oh, Oh, I.
Seems we played a game, but lost along the way,
Somewhere we went wrong, I didn't have a clue.
Should've never let you go, baby don't you know,
It was all in my mind, was I such a fool.
To let you get away and now everyday,
There's nothing to defend.
My head was in the clouds and when I look around,
I won't give up - till you come back again..

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, I never would've thought,
That I could lose you boy but now I know, I should've never let you go.
If I could have one wish, I'll be the first to tell you,
This is never what I wanted, no, I should've never let you go.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I, Oh, Oh, Oh, I.
I was confident, thought you were content,
How did we go wrong and now what can I do?
Should've never let you go, baby don't you know,
My tears are on the inside, how can it be true.
I let you get away, and now everyday,
There's nothing to defend.
My head was in the clouds and when I look around,
I won't give up - till you come back again.

[Chorus]

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,, Oh, Oh, Oh, I no, no, no.
I should've never let you go.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,, Oh, Oh, Oh,
I should've never, should've never let you go,
I should've never let you go.
Should've never, should've never let you go, let you go.
Oh baby, oh baby, don't you know, don't you know,
I won't give up, no, no, no - till you come back again.

[Chorus: x2]

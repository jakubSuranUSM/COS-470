We lived in a dogfish egg case  You could barely call it home  Sorry little lot no roof on top  But the fish left us alone  Try a little more said the girl next door  It's time to roam    Mad Lizzy Crumbs blind cobblers thumbs  Were a sight to behold  She was a rum old slapper and we always   tried to get her pants off when she phoned  Left her cap by the sink it's not what you think  Oh take me home    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside    Strap-on Sally chased us down the alley  We feared for our behinds  Oasis was a shop with shoes so hot  They were sure to blow your mind  Running so fast I can taste the past  Oh take me home    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside    These waters run deep it's clear my little one  Blue velvet star sky not a sound  The light in your eyes, the smile on your ruby lips  Tells me my lost soul is found    Now we know where we're going baby  We can lay back and enjoy the ride  Take in the sights and drown in our senses  Love is the law so take me deep inside

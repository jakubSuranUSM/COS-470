You came to me
With your arms opened wide
You don't know
What you mean to me
Girl, I owe you my life

It feels good
With you next to me
That's enough, that's enough
This is not such a mystery
I'm in love
With your love

There is pain in this world
I can see it in your eyes
It's so hard to stay alive
At the edge of the night

Well, it feels good
With you're close to me
That's enough, that's enough
We will fade into history
I'm in love
With your love

Well, it feels good
With you're close to me
That's enough, that's enough
And I like your trajectory
I'm in love
With your love

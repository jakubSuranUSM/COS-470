Well, who'd have believed this seasoned connoisseur lady-killer
like me
Would get hurt by a girl like you?
And they got names for dirty little girls like you, honey
It ain't nice, but they call you "everybody's girl"

And they say: "Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes"
And they say: " here she comes, here she comes, here she comes
There goes everybody's girl
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl, everybody's girl"

You might say I was blind for a while
I fell asleep at the driving wheel
You sure woke me up in a hurry, honey
And I can't blame anyone but me I know
It's my fault for falling for everybody's girl

And they say: "He's the one, he's the one, he's the one"
And they say: "He's the one, he's the one, he's the one

He got screwed by everybody's girl
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl, everybody's girl

You got no apparent sensitivity
You're cut deep with self-destructivity
Your mind's made up, you're heading for the day
When you'll shake and your heart breaks
It's gonna come

Everybody's girl, everybody's girl
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl
Everybody's girl - you know the time's gonna come
Everybody's girl - you can't do this forever
Everybody's girl - you're not gonna get another chance
Everybody's girl - you're gonna get it!

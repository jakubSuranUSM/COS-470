Locked in a sorry dream
You know we're drowning in designer ice cream
I scream, this is the present but it's no surprise
Then I realize

(To see you, to see you, to see you)
What I see I spies
(Nice to see you, to see you, to see you)
The past was eagle-eyed
(To see you, nice to see you, to see you, to see you)
The future's pixelised
(To see you, nice to see you, to see you, to see you, to see you)

I had my Frisbee sharpened and honed
I had it galvanized and chromed
Decapitate and bury your toys
My Frisbee brings the noise

(To see you, to see you, to see you)
What I see I spies
(Nice to see you, to see you, to see you)
The past was eagle-eyed
(To see you, nice to see you, to see you, to see you)
The future's pixelised
(To see you, nice to see you, to see you, to see you, to see you)

To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Wipe your windscreen with a chocolate cake)
To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Count your pizzas before they bake)
To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Wipe your windscreen with a chocolate cake)
To see you, to see you, to see you
(Count your pizzas before they bake)
To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Wipe your windscreen with a chocolate cake)
To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Count your pizzas before they bake)
To see you, to see you, to see you
(Wipe your windscreen with a chocolate cake)
To see you, to see you, to see you, nice to see you
(Wipe your windscreen with a chocolate cake)

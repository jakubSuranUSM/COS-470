He lives on his own
The TV's on loan
He watches old movies
He lives in a flat
The lino's all cracked
But he's got plans bingo
He sings like Sinatra with more feel
Plays with his pocket roulette wheel all day
And no one stopped him
He got away
Waited all this time with
All this scratching around
In one place, made it just in time
All this talk about luck
He's just so loaded
He's just so loaded down
He gets on a plane
He changes his name
He flies off to Las Vegas
He saved up for years
Cashed in his fears
He always had plans bingo
He packs up his white lounge lizard suit
Plenty of hairspray and a big cigar
And no one stopped him
He got away
Took him forty years
To plan his route of escape
From this place, made it just in time with
All this talk about luck
He's just so loaded
He's just so loaded down
The first time he flew
Watched the Vegas skyline
Gently melt into view
All this booze, swore he just saw Elvis
Playing poker at Dunes
He's just so loaded
He's just so loaded
He's just so loaded now

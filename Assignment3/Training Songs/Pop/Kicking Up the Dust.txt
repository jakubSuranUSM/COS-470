As the doctor ?? what's wrong with me
He says "Son the well don't give a shit
You better lead and live your life carefully
????

So ??? my team used to pay the rent
And borrow from my folks and my friends
Amends to pay them back but ??? I spent
The ??? are in my hand

Take a breath outside
Tears will fill your eyes
Sail a little longer the endless sea of time

Take a look outside
Show me what you find
Kicking up the endless dust in time

???the first the man well said???
Why don't you give him one more try
So ???? let him ??? the present??
Still waiting???

So I wrote my message out for long to see
And let he sit for tall??
And now I feel defeat belong to me
'Cause the life is the only wall
Say the life is the only wall

Take a breath outside
Tears will fill your eyes
Sail a little longer the endless sea of time

Take a look outside
Show me what you find
Kicking up the endless dust in time

Today is still another day????
Could be the last day of my life
??? the sun is grown across the shore

The endless sea of time
Nothing's forever
Kicking up the endless dust in time
Never knowing if forever

Knowing the endless sea of time
If we'll be together
Growing up the endless dust in time
I'll love you forever

Today is still another day????
Could be the last day of my life
??? the sun is grown across the shore

Today is still another day????
Could be the last day of my life
??? the sun is grown across the shore

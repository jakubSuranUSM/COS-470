I'm kinda reeling
A deja-vu feeling
We've been together
In another life

Got me extending
That network's ending
The future echoes
With your memory

Now darling, I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing to sing 'til I drop
Now baby, I don't know how it happened to be
But when we met it was like future shock

Tell me what to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those hands of time right up
So that I don't leave here all alone. Woo hoo!

The death of the romance
Thought there was no chance
Then you appeared right in front of me
I got to thinking
Loneliness sinking
I felt the cloudiness come over me

Now darling, I don't know what the future will hold
But I'm not willing to do as I'm told
Now baby, I don't care how it happened to be
But I know that my future's right in front of me

Tell me what to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time right up
So that I don't leave here all alone. Woo hoo!

Did you ever get the feeling that the universe is leaning?
It's accelerating, it will never stop
Did you ever wonder if the number one divide by zero
Is infinity and if that's the case then what?
If imaginary numbers are abstractions of the real thing
Then could someone make the clock of time stop?
If we were always meant to be together like forever
Than it must have been a future shock

I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing to sing 'til I drop...

What to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time
Right up so that I don't leave here all alone

I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing to sing 'til I drop (Gonna speed those sands of time right up)
Oh darling, I don't know how it happened to be
But when we met it was like future shock

What to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time
Right up so that I don't leave here all alone

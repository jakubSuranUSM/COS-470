Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
I don't care about your "modern time preachers"
Welcome boys, too much noise, I will teach ya
(Pam pam pa hoo, turram pam pa hoo)
Hey, I think you forgot how to play
My teddy bear's running away
The Barbie got something to say, hey, hey, hey
Hey! My "Simon says" leave me alone
I'm taking my Pikachu home
You're stupid just like your smartphone

Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a bucka-mhm-buckbuckbuck-mhm boy
Bucka-mhm-buckbuckbuck
I'm not your bucka-mhm-buck-mhm-buck-mhm

I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down now, make you watch
We're dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
Not your toy (Cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)

A-a-a-Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play with me boy!
A-a-a-Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play, shake!
(Cululoo, cululoo) Wedding bells ringing
(Cululoo, cululoo) Money men bling-bling
I donâ€™t care about your stefa, baby
(Pam pam pa hoo, turram pam pa hoo)

Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a bucka-mhm-buckbuckbuck-mhm boy
Bucka-mhm-buckbuckbuck
I'm not your bucka-mhm-buck-mhm-buck-mhm

I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy (Stupid boy)
I'll take you down now, make you watch
We're dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat

I'm not your toy (Not your toy)
You stupid boy (Stupid boy)
I'll t-t-t-take you now
W-w-w-with me now, boy

(I'm not your toy)
You stupid boy
I'll take you down now, make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
(I'm not your toy) Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
(You stupid boy) I don't care about your "modern time preacher"
(I'm not your toy) Not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy

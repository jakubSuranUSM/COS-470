I`ve been looking for a boy like you
All of my life
I`ve been looking for a love that`s true
All of my life

Been searching for a hand to hold
When things aren`t right
To keep me warm when I get cold at night
All of my life (all of my life)
All of my life (all of my life)

I`ve been hoping for some happiness
All of my life
I`ve been waiting for a special kiss

All of my life

Been looking for a love like you
I can`t wait till we say I do
Then I`ll have all of you all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life

I`ve been looking for a love like you
I can`t wait till we say I do
Then I`ll have all of you all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life (repeat to fade)

Gonna do what we do together
We're gonna find out
What we do to ourselves
How we want it to be
And we shoot to the center
Of our own shores
For a motionless core
On the western front

I look round at what I see
This ain't where I want to be
Looking for some kind of plan
Oh yes I am

I'm not going down

Easing through this phase together
We're gonna do all
To return to the flow
And the rest will fall
And the rest will fall

I look round at what I see
This ain't where I want to be
Looking for the word in hand
Oh yes I am

I'm not going down

Say yes

Look back at old ways
Gonna give it all away
Look back at old ways
Gonna give it all away

I'm not going down

It is the western way
It is the western way

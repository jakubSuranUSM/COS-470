Girl, who is that institution over there?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Come, go back to the islands, irie, man
Brr, hey, Puerto Rico, le grand Bahamas
The French island of St. Martinique
Parlez-vous Français?
Oui, je parle Français
Monsieur, tu me plais, qui moi?
Ooh, baby (ooh, baby)

I've seen you hangin' out
Lookin' like you know what life's about, uh-huh
Laughin', jivin' with your friends
Baby, that ain't where the world ends, oh yeah

I'm layin' my love on you
You'll be feelin' somethin' brand new, oh yes, you will
Gonna hold you tight with all my might
Squeeze you right, whatcha wanna do tonight?
Yeah-ah-ah

I'm gonna hold you in the afternoon
Tease you from the sun
Dancin' 'neath the island moon
We'll go on and on

Yeah, ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, oh, baby, now
Oh, ain't nobody ever loved you, boy
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, uh-huh

Hey, drag a comb across your hair
Change your shirt, we're going somewhere, ain't we, baby?
Huh, I'll throw a little lipstick on
Check the mirror twice and we're gone, yeah-ah

I believe in rain
We can bring the heat up again, oh, yes, we can
I'm gonna take my time and treat you fine
Baby, baby, baby, I'm makin' you mine, oh tonight, boy

Hear the people laugh and sing, hey-hey
Right outside your door
Somethin' great is happenin'
And you can be sure

Oh, ain't nobody else could love you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

Wait, ah, oh
Look out now, yeah

Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey
Ain't nobody love you, no (oh, the Islands, I love them, man)
Like I'm gonna love you, hey hey (the tread wings they blowing the wind and it feels so good like a carress that falls)

Hear the people laugh and sing, hey hey
Right outside your door, hey man
Somethin' great is happenin'
And you can be sure, oh

Nobody else can love you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, baby
Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

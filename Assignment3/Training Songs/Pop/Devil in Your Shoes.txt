have you heard about my screams 
cause i like a drink 
and i haven't touched one in weeks 
can the blind see through the eyes 
of a dog or is it just attention i seek 
have you ever known it to be 
because i know you're warming to me 
and i know you're waiting you're always ready 
you keep your mouth in your backside baby 
and you're using it daily in my defense 
you wear the devil in your shoes lately 
and you're walking all over the times when i've known you 
and smiled 
have you burned down to the seams 
i'm on my feet 
and haven't touched down in weeks 
can the blind see through these eyes 
see through the fog or is it just attention i seek 
have you ever known it to be 
because i know your warming to me 
and i know you're waiting you're always ready 

have you every known it to be 
because i know you're warming to me 
and i know you're waiting you're always ready 
and i know you can't keep reeling 
from just your own free wheeling 
and i know you're waiting you're always ready you see 
you wear the devil in your shoes lately 
and you're walking all over the times when i've known you 
and smiled

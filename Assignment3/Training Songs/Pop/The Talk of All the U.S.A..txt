Julie puts her make up
On her face ev'ry day
She's a woman
Yes I know
She's a woman
Even so
She's the talk of all the USA
Oh
Yeah
The talk of all the USA.
I went out with Julie
To a party one night.
She's a woman...
I was mad I completely
Turned blind
She wouldn't let me love her
And it blew my mind
Julie said man
I must be very sure
.
She told me that she'd
Never been loved before.
Then I put my coat on
We decided to go.
She's a woman...
On the way back home
I tried with Julie again

She's a woman...
In the car with remote
Controlled hands
I knew that little Julie
She would understand
When I got there before my very eyes
I'll tell you man
I got myself a big surprise.
Julie had that something
Other girls didn't have.
She's a woman...

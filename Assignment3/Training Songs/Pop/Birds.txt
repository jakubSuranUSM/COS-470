Take your time
Make peace with the day
Lie on the ground and think of me
Nevermind what people will say
Talking is thoughtless and cheap

I only said it to be kind
I won't pretend to be naive
And thoughts arrive...
Like leaves on the page
Trying and hoping to be
You and I like birds in a cage
Dreaming how once we were free
The evening closes on the
I saw you hiding in the eaves

Don't leave me hanging on the wire
A shadow underneathe the trees

I only want you to be mine
I only want you to be free
If either one of us is right
It must be seen to be believed

I only want you to be mine
I only want you to be free

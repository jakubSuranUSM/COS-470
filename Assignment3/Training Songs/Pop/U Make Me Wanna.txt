To start it off, I know you know me
To come to think of it, it was only last week
That I had a dream about us
That's why I'm here, I'm writing this song
To tell the truth, you know I've been hurting all along
Some way let me know you want me, girl

Every time you see me, what do you see?
I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen
Oh baby, you're the only thing that I really need
Baby, that's why

You make me want to call you in the middle of the night
You make me want to hold you till the morning light
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight
You're the first and last thing on my mind
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul

Well I know that these feelings won't end
And they'll just get stronger if I see you again
Baby, I'm tired of being friends
I want to know if you feel the same
And, could you tell me, do you feel my pain?
Don't leave me in doubt

Every time you see me, what do you see?
I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen
Oh baby, you're the only thing that I really need
Baby, that's why

You make me want to call you in the middle of the night
You make me want to hold you till the morning light
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight
You're the first and last thing on my mind
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul

I'll take you home real quick, and sit you down on the couch
Pour some Don Perignon and hit the lights out
Baby, we can make sweet love
Then we'll take it nice and slow
I'm gonna touch you like you've never known before
We're gonna make love all night

You make me want to call you in the middle of the night
You make me want to hold you till the morning light
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight
You're the first and last thing on my mind
You make me want to love, you make me want to fall
You make me want to surrender my soul

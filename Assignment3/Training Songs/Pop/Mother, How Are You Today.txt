Mother, how are you today?
Here is a note from your daughter
With me everything is OK
Mother, how are you today?

Mother, don't worry, I'm fine
Promise to see you this summer
This time there will be no delay
Mother, how are you today?

I found the man of my dreams
Next time you will get to know him
Many things happened while I was away
Mother, how are you today?

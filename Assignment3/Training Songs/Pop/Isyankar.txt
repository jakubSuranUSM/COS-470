Sandal and Gentleman tell them say love it ah the only way
Never ever you will go astray
Why you send a lion, boom
Make them know
We go like this

Istersen dağlar dağlar
Yerinden oynar oynar
Sabırsız kalbim bir tek
Aśkina isyankar

Sandal make them know
Love it ah it's oh so fly
Go down, we have to survive
We tired ah them war and strife
Now we have to live upright
Moving towards the light
Time never ever so right
Be concerned about your spiritual earnings
The light of your life it is burning yeah yeah
Everyday you got to look where you're turning
Get ready for a higher learning

Korkma yaklaş, hislerinle
Sanki bir adım attığını bilmez mi gönül?
Gecer mi ömür?
Stersen dağlar dağlar
Yerinden oynar oynar
Sabırsız kalbim bir tek
Aśkına isyankar

We have toi live some life now
Before we grow old
Got to be a license full ah never been told
Love it ah the ultimate thing we uphold
Never ever you will go astray
Never ever you go cold
Much to win and there is nothing to lose
Even know you're might feel confused yeah yeah
At the crossroads again you can lose
Love it ah the only way you can't even choose

Korkma yaklaş, hislerinle
Sanki bir adım attığını bilmez mi gönül?
Gecer (häckchen unter dem c) mi ömür?
Stersen dağlar dağlar
Yerinden oynar oynar
Sabırsız kalbim bir tek
Aśkına isyankar

Everyday I see your face from a picture on the wall.
I just sit by the phone and hope that someday maybe you'll call.
I remember the days, we slept so close it always felt so right.
Night after night how we held each other tight.
But morning comes and I'm all alone.
Cuz you're gone and you won't be back again.
Chorus:
Don't take your love
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love
Don't take don't take it away
Don't take your love
Nooo nooo
I couldn't keep up the pace
Seems I lost the race
and it's really got me down
cuz you're trying to run to every fancy place in town
pretty soon you're going to realize 
when you do you're going to want me back again
Chorus:
Don't take your love
Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love
Don't take don't take it away"

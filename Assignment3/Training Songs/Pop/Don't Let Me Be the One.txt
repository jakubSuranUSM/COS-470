I Want You To Understand 
I Only Want to Be Your Friend
Maybe We've Been Getting In Too Deep?
I Want To Let You Know, You've Got To Let Me Go

(Reprise)
Don't Let Me Be The One, (Don't Let Me Be The One), Don't Let Me Be The One...To Plauge Your Heart.

There's Nothing Left That You Could Say
To Make Me want to Stay
Maybe We've Been Getting In Too Deep?
I Want To Let You To Know, You've Got To Let Me Go

(Reprise 2 Times)
Don't Let Me Be The One, (Don't Let Me Be The ONe), Don't Let Me Be The One...To Plauge Your Heart. Don't Let me Be The One, (Don't Let Me Be The One), Don't Let Me Be The One...TO Plauge Your Heart

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

(Reprise, Repeats 3 Times)

My feet move without me 
All roads lead me back to you 
Lights flash red to yellow 
I can’t control these things I do 
Yeah I know I should leave 
Yeah I know this is wrong 
But I don’t care 
I don’t wanna be that strong 

Like poison that I just have to taste
Like an ocean that sweeps me away 
Something’s this good has to be 
Has to be 
Hazardous 
Oh oh oh 
Hazardous 
Has to be
Hazardous
Oh oh oh
Hazardous

My heart it knows better 
You pushed the dagger way to deep into me 
This weak strange addiction 
It’s what I want not what I need 
What I need 
So what do you do? 
When your falling face first 
And you know your gunna like the way that it hurts

Like poison that I just have to taste 
Like an ocean that sweeps me away 
Something’s this good has to be 
Has to be 
Hazardous 
Oh oh oh 
Hazardous 
Has to be
Hazardous 
Oh oh oh
Hazardous

When your next to me
I can’t hardly breathe
Or touch the ground
Oh my life would be much easier without you, without you
But I wouldn’t change one single thing about you. 

Like poison that I just have to taste 
Like an ocean that sweeps me away 
Something’s this good has to be 
Has to be 
Hazardous 
Oh oh oh 
Hazardous 
Has to be
Hazardous 
Oh oh oh
Hazardous

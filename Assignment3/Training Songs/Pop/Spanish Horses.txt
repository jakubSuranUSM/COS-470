Ran a red light, running lonely through Gaudi's soft confusion
Hey, hey, my Barcelonian
Such a gentle Jones running through my bones
Placa reial calls, it calls, it calls
It calls the night home

And then her eyes like Spanish horses
Danced as language died
They danced like Spanish horses

As saddened skies descended on the night
We saw two ships set sail
And the lights danced on the water
They danced, they danced like Spanish horses

Trying to exercise, thought that daytime dies, race
Run and stumble, fall into dark
Feel the fire, see the spark
Then you fall, then you fall
So free and humble, you tumble

Into her eyes like Spanish horses
Danced as language died
They danced like Spanish horses

As saddened skies descended on the night
We saw two ships set sail
And the lights danced on the water
They danced, they danced like Spanish horses

You're born from bloody revolution
You're lost to simplicity and small solutions
So you burn when you're born
Then you burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

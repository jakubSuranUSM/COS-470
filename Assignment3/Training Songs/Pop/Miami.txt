Well, I hear in Miami they have a lot of girls
Who toast their flesh in the sun
Living on allowances they receive from the old man at home
To keep up appearances, to have fun

[Chorus]
Hey, baby
Living in Miami
I know you're hip to those hotel alibies
I know you're nowhere near twenty
But I ain't the kind to kiss and tell, or tell lies

Well they are easy to look at; they are hard to hold
They have high opinions of themselves
But at night you can find them drinking in the bar
Wishing that they could find somebody else

[Chorus]

Well, they pull and tug on their high fashion clothes
As they strip off their armour in their apartment bedrooms
They wish that somewhere they can find a spark
Well, their sights, and visions, and dreams are set high
They think the world can be won with a smile
I hear 'em giggle out loud, lost in the crowd
Give me a cuddle when we get outside

[Chorus x 2]

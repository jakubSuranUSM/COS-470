When we go out dancing on a Friday night
I get this funny feeling something's not quite right
My sense of rhythm is incontrovertibly shite
I can't fake it

I can see the pity in your big brown eyes
The perpetrator lies between my back and my thighs
It doesn't want to wiggle though I try try try
I can't make it

I get the feeling that I look absurd
I get the feeling that I look absurd, and it hurts

I just can't shake it

Couldn't walk the line inside the country scene
And disco was a flop I'm sure no dancing queen
Couldn't really qualify for breakdancing
I just break it

Tried moving my body to the latest hit
Someone called the nurse thought I was having a fit
I execute the moonwalk like I stepped in shit
I can't take it

I get the feeling that I look absurd
I get the feeling that I look absurd - and it hurts

I just can't shake it

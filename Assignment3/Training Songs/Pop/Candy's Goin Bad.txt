Candy took the pearls, got ahead of the girls
Got on top and found the secret entrance
Are you satisfied?
Through neon doors, 'cross killing floors
She got sucked into a champagne desert
Are you satisfied?

Daddy said: I'll break your bones
If you come home dressed in Peacock clothes
Mother said: quit the show
She didn't want the neighbors to know
Candy had to quit the show

Well, Candy didn't care, when she started her affair
With the studs and the mares of the night
Are you satisfied?
Teddy knows the rule, of the underground school
He's got Candy wrapped 'round his finger
Are you satisfied?

Daddy said: I'll break your bones
If you don't get your tricks off the phone
Mother said: quit the show
She didn't want the neighbors to know

Candy's going bad, got a room to let
Candy's going bad, got a pimp named Ted
Candy's going bad, Long Green's where it's at
Candy's going bad, she got stars in her head

Candy took the pearls, got ahead of the girls
Got on top and found the secret entrance
Are you satisfied?

Daddy said: I'll break your bones
If you come home dressed in Peacock clothes
Mother said: quit the show
I don't want the neighbors to know

Candy's going bad, got a room to let
Candy's going bad, got a pimp named Ted
Candy's going bad, Long Green's where it's at
Candy's going bad, she got stars in her head

Candy's going bad, got a room to let
Candy's going bad, she got stars in her head

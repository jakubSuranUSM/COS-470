You know Christina's got the body
She really likes to spin and twirl
But when she's flirting with the camera
You know she's just a little girl
Now Pink is cute but still a baby
And she talks with attitude
She has some spunks for a young lady
But what I'd really like to do
I'd love to do it with Madonna
She's what a woman's supposed to be
Oh Madonna can you do it with me?

When Britney sings it sounds amazing
I like her belly and her butt
But how would you like to be with her?
She's always hanging with her mum.
I'd rather do it with Madonna
She's what a woman's supposed to be
The only girl I'll ever need
Madonna do it with me
I'd rather do it with Madonna
She's really got me on my knees
The only girl I'll ever need
Madonna, do it with me
Oh Madonna ooo, ooo, ooo, Madonna,
I'd really like to be with Kylie
I think she's really really hot
I wonder if I could get Kylie
To want to do it with Madonna
I'd rather do it with Madonna
She's really got me on my knees
Oh Madonna won't you do it with me?
I'd rather do it with Madonna
She's what a woman's supposed to be
Oh Madonna come and do it with me
I'd rather do it with Madonna
She's really got me
Have you seen her where she's wearing the cowboy hat and she's kicking the dirt
I want to do it with
O Madonna [till fade]

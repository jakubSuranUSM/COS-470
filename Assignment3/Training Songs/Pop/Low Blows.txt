You coming round too late
I've taken off my face
And you won't like it
I haven't seen anyone in days
But it's best this way
You see I don't like it
Don't wanna be anyone again
See I don't like it

Baby, I have nothing left and
You took my money and you took my friends back
To where I never

Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it
Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it

Working on my own
Until the work gets cold
That's when I don't like it
But I can't leave anything alone
And I won't say no
Even when I wanna
I never see the end of anything
'Cause I don't like it

Baby, I have nothing left and
You took my money and you took my friends back, oh
To where I never

Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it
Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it

But I don't like it
And I never liked it like that

Oh ohoh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Whoah ooh

Baby, I have nothing left and
You took my money and you took my friends back
To where I never
To where I never
To where I never

Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it
Low blows, man up
It's all good, man up
'Cause I don't say much when I don't like it

But I don't like it
No I don't like it
And I never liked it
And I never liked it like that

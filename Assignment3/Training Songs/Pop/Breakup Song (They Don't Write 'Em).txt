We had broken up for good
Just an hour before
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies
As they're dancing 'cross the floor
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
And then the band slowed the tempo
And the music gets you down
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
It was the same old song
With a melancholy sound
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
We'd been living together for a million years
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
But now it feels so strange out of the atmospheres
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies
As they're dancing so slow
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore

Mm, now I wind up staring at an empty glass
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
'Cause it's so easy to say
That she'll forget your past
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
No, they just don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't, no, they don't, no no, uh-uh
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't

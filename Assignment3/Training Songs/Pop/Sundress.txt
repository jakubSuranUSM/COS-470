Everybody's trying to be the best
What about the girl with loneliness
I like your sundress
I like your sundress
What about the girl with loneliness
From the inside out, you're so beautiful
I want to hold you in my hand

I do everything you want me to
I do everything you want me to do

I want to start going on a morning walk
What about the days when we used to talk?
I don't need a smile from a mannequin
I just want to hold you in my hands

I do everything you want me to
I do everything you want me to
I do everything you want me to do

From the inside out, you've changed, girl
You know you have
Don't make a good thing bad
Just let me hold you in my hands

I do everything you want me to
I do everything you want me to do
I do everything, everything, everything
I do everything you want me to
I do everything you want me to do (wow)
Do (wow), do (wow), for you

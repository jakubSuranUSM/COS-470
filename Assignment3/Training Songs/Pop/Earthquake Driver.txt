I was born again a little north of Disneyland
Somewhere under Wonderland
In Hollywood
But then I had to go
Skipping and diving and bouncing 
back to New York City
Straight through the heart of America
Where all the wild things grow

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I live alone but I am hungry for affection
I just struggle with connection
Til the water calls me home
Down under the ocean
Among millions of other lonely people
Drowning among the only people
We are ever going to know

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I wanna be like the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away
Is I’m tied into the lightning line
I wanna see if the sun is shining
Long night’s just a waste of time
I don’t wanna see people like me
Just sleeping and waking and hoping and hating and…

You look at me like I’m a carnival attraction
You say “Love is an abstraction
Just some ghost that you chase”
Well, I am a cypher
I am a blank space
Filled up with words you remember
From whenever you see my face

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

I wanna be like all the people I see
They want a rover just like me
I wanna stay but what keeps me away
Is I’m plugged into the lightning line
I wanna be where the sun is shining all night 
Chasing time
I don’t wanna be with people like me
Just creeping and waking and 
hoping and hating and…

What is the price for all this fame and self-absorption?
We turn ourselves into orphans
And then spend our nights alone
Living in fear of some imaginary consequence
Terror incognito
O-bla-di		
Li-bi-do

I wanna be an earthquake driver
I don’t wanna be an aquarium diver
I just don’t wanna go home

Hey, what's the big idea?

Yo Mika.

I said, 
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
I said, 
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down.

Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.

I went walking in with my mama one day,
When she warn me what people say,
Live your life until love is found,
'cause love's gonna get you down.

Take a look at the girl next door,
She's a player and a down right whore,
Jesus loves her, she wants more,
Oh bad girls get you down.

Singing,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.

Mama told me what I should know,
Too much candy gonna rot your soul,
If she loves you, let her go,
'cause love only gets you down.
Take a look at the boy like me,
Never stood on my own two feet,
Now I'm blue, as I can be,
Oh love couldn't get me down.

Singing,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love, say love,
Or love's gonna get you down.

I went walking with my mama one day,
When she warn me what people say,
Live your life until love is found,
Or love's gonna get you down.

Singing,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love (say love), say love (say love),
Or love's gonna get you down.
Say love (say love), say love (say love),
Or love's gonna get you down.

Mama told me what I should know,
Too much candy gonna rot your soul,
If she loves you, let her go,
'cause love only gets you down.

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop.
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop.

Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down,
Say, 
Sucking too hard on your lollipop, 
Or love's gonna get you down

We all got wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted 

This is for the drunks, the winos, 
The belligerent 
After hour all night psychos 
For the party people 
Party crashers 
Lovers with no sequel 
Cause the first hardly mattered 
Lushes lookin' luscious 
Torn and tattered 
Hair of the dogs off the chains 
And comin' at em 
They're dead to the world 
And they're plastered and pissed 
Each trying to get the girl 
Then just past out stiff 

We got wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We all got wasted 

This is for the porcelain god 
Holy rollers 
Prayin' they were only sober 
Surfin' on a lonely sofa 
You only live once and then it's over 
And if we drink long enough 
Then we won't get hungover 
Now our heads just pound 
We got to make a toast to the drinks 
That we downed 
Everybody crowd around 
Lift up your cup 
Give it up to the one's fucked up 

We got wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We all got wasted

We all got wasted 
On 99 bottles of booze 
I only danced with your friend 
Cause I thought she was you 
We got wasted 
Cause there was nothing to do 
I must've had five drinks 
But I thought it was two 
We got wasted 
Everybody's buyin' a round 
We got wasted 
Off the wall and pass it around 
Hit the pavement 
Everybody's ass on the ground 
We got wasted 

We got wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted 
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We got fucked up and wasted wasted
We all got wasted

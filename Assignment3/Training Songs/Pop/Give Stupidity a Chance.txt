Intelligent people
Have had their say
It’s time for the foolish
To show the way

Let’s lead this world a merry dance
Let’s give stupidity a chance

We’ve heard quite enough
Of experts and their dealings
Why face the facts
When you can just feel the feelings?

Let’s lead this world a merry dance
Let’s give stupidity a chance

Forget political correctness
I mean, W-T-F!
I don’t wanna think about the world
I wanna talk about myself!

Instead of governing
With thoughtful sensitivity
Let’s shock and awe the world
With idiotic bigotry

Let’s lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance

You say corruption
I say justified reward
Keeps the cronies loyal
Chairmen of the board

Let’s lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance

Forget political correctness
Let’s talk man to man
Chicks are always up for it
You gotta grab whatever you can

We need a leader who knows
That money means class
With an eye for a peach-perfect
Piece of ass
Not a total dumb-cluck
Just one of the guys
Let’s give stupidity a prize

Let’s lead this world a merry dance
And give stupidity a chance
Let’s give stupidity a chance

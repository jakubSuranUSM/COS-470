I will love you forever
I will love you from now, 'til the end of time
And I promise forever
I will give up my will for you
I will fulfill all your dreams for you
I would give up my life for you
I will stay by your side
To protect you and hide you from all of the pain
That a man and a woman must hide
I will stand by your side
I would give up my life for you
Just to do right to you
You will know who I am
Only you would understand
I would give up my life for you

(Stand by me) I will be there when you need me
(Swear by me) I swear by the part of God that's in me
I will care and be there
For as long as you need
I will stay by your side

I will love you forever
I will love you from now 'til the end of time
I will stay by your side

I will love you forever
I will love you from now 'til the end of time
And I promise forever
I will love you forever
'Til the end of time

I was one with you, breathing
And was close to you, in your sleep
And I don't deny, waiting
For the little light from you

And I wish that I had tried
Mm baby I now wished that 'us' away
Oh no, if I wish that hard enough would love come home, home again
And I wish that I had tried
Mm baby I now wished that 'us' away
Oh no, if I wish that hard enough
Would love come home, home again
And I go oh no
He could be the one who hits the light inside my soul
Oh baby, This could be the last of my control

I was watching you, leaving
Didn't know that love cut so deep
How was I to know baby,
All the tears I cry for you

And I wish that I had tried
Mm baby I now wished that 'us' away
Oh no, if I wish that hard enough would love come home, home again
And I wish that I had tried
Mm baby I now wished that 'us' away
Oh no, if I wish that hard enough
Would love come home, home again
And I go oh no
He could be the one who hits the light inside my soul
Oh baby, This could be the last of my control
And I go oh no
He could be the one who hits the light inside my soul
Oh baby, This could be the last of my control

Feels like starry eyed
I'm alone, alone on a slowly, lonely ride
Each time I decide to get off, I drop in rolling, holding tight
Feels like starry eyed
I'm alone, alone on a slowly, lonely ride
Each time I decide to get off, I drop in rolling, holdingÃ¢?Â¦ Holding

And I wish that I had tried
Mm baby I now wished that 'us' away
Oh no, if I wish that hard enough would love come home, home again
And I go oh no
He could be the one who hits the light inside my soul
Oh baby, This could be the last of my control
And I go oh no
He could be the one who hits the light inside my soul
Oh baby, This could be the last of my control

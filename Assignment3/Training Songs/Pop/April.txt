(Don McGlashan)
Joey said that you'd been calling
I guess that means we're through our falling out, April
But don't begrudge my being wary
Of the hatchet you'd like to bury
I've still got the scars, April
April you tied yourself to the railroad track
April you fell into the fire and I pulled you back
I don't know why I'm trying to reach you
If I caught you it just might teach you
Not to do it again
You made me feel as if I counted
Then you had me stuffed and mounted
I won't do that again, April
Oh April
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back in April
All the month of May
I'd ask myself, are you OK? and I would lie
June I put my life together
But I've no way of knowing whether I
Can face July
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back
Oh I'd love to be back in April

Mmmm mmmm mmmm 
Come on, buzz me up to heaven baby 
Mmmm mmmm mmmm 
Come on, buzz me up to heaven 

I've been missing you I should be kissing you 
Honey to the bee that's you for me 
I wouldn't tell a lie got a love I can't deny 
Honey to the bee that's you for me 
Honey to the bee that's you for me 
Honey to the bee 

I close my eyes and I see you clear 
It feels like you're lying here 
All the things I want to say come and go 
Easy as the breeze those words just flow 
I float on air light as a feather 
Your love so sweet like an open flower 
I'm dizzy from the time we spent together 
I need that honey drip every hour 

I'm thinking about your sugar lips 
Got a feeling for you now that's so strong 
I'm dreaming of the candy in your finger tips 
Baby don't stay away from me for too long 

I've been missing you I should be kissing you 
Honey to the bee that's you for me 
I wouldn't tell a lie got a love I can't deny

Honey to the bee 

Mmmm mmmm mmmm 
Come on, buzz me up to heaven baby 
Mmmm mmmm mmmm 
Come on, buzz me up to heaven baby 

You make me smile though you're far away 
I hear your voice like it was yesterday 
All the things you do make me feel so fine 
I want to tell the world about a love that's mine 
These wings to fly are gonna last forever 
'cause one by one my dreams come true 
And I touch the sky whenever we're together 
I can't believe the joy I get with you 

I'm thinking about your sugar lips 
Got a feeling for you now that's so strong 
I'm dreaming of the candy in your finger tips 
Baby don't stay away from me for too long

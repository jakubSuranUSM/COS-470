How can I know which way to turn
Between my feelings and my dreams
I'm drowning in tennement oceans
There is more than this

I know that in my heart
I feel like going home again
But, I know that in my heart
I'm scared of what I'll find

It's raining on the kelvin
The rhythms never change
It's like a whisper
A whisper out of range
People can't convince me

I'll say again
I'm not ashamed
So how can I know which way to turn
When I walk on different grounds
No one can tell me
There is more than this

I know that in my heart
I feel like going home again
But, I know that in my heart
I'm scared of what I'll find

I know that in my heart
I want to see another side
But, I know that in my heart
I'm scared of what I'll find

Lord find me, don't turn me away
Lord find me, don't turn me away

I know that in my heart
I want to see another side
But, I know that in my heart
I'm scared of what I'll find

I know that in my heart
I feel like going home again
But, I know that in my heart
I'm scared of what I'll find

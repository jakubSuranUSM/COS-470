seven hundred times 
thought of you 
a voice of innocence 
i hear it calling
i know it´s you

now i realize 
that it´s just hurting 
for the first time 
i feel it aching 
i know it´s you

seven hundred lies 
seven hundred ways 
to hide the fact 
that i am longing 
longing for you

but now i see it .. i feel it .. 
it seems so right 
a trace of light 
that i will follow 
till i reach you

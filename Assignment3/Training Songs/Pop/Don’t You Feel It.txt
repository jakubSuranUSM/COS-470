In the dark and I'm dreaming
I'm awake, can I roll with you?
On the streets someone's screaming
Words to songs that we once knew
Now the moonlight is beaming
Yeah, I like how it shines on you
And I can't stop the feeling
I need to be close to you

Hold me as it gets alright
I'll stay with you tonight
Love me and I'll be fine
You're bringing me to life
Hold me as it gets alright
I'll stay with you tonight
Love me and I'll be fine
You're bringing me to life

Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you feel it?

Now the night has a meaning
I describe what I feel for you
With the love that I'm feeling
Darker skies return to blue
Never leave mama bleeding
Tell me what you want 'cause you
Have the power of healing
I need to be close to you

Hold me as it gets alright
I'll stay with you tonight
Love me and I'll be fine
You're bringing me to life
Hold me as it gets alright
I'll stay with you tonight
Love me and I'll be fine
You're bringing me to life

Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you feel it?

Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it too?
Don't you feel it?

You're bringing me to life
You're bringing me to life

Hold me as it gets alright (it gets alright)
Love me and I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
Hold me as it gets alright
You're bringing me to life
You're bringing me to life

Live on the outside
I'll help you through your pain
If you help me through mine
Never have I met
Someone as insensitive as you

I want to escape what you've done to my life
I love the way that you're always on my mind
It's ok, you're not a bad one you're sane
I can't help this pain that I feel

Relapse and soda
My head is not all that you want it to lay
Existence is purpose
Explain what my touch means to you if it does

I want to escape what you've done to my life
I love the way that you're always on my mind
It's ok, you're not a bad one you're sane
I can't help this pain that I'm feeling
I can't help this pain that I'm feeling
I can't help this pain that I'm feeling

Oh yeah, hey
Hey, Yeah

When I saw you, I want to escape what you've done to my life
I love the way that you're always on my mind
It's ok, you're not a bad one you're sane
So how you love, it feels how you feel

Yeah, yeah

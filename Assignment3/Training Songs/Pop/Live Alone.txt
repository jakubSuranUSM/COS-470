I want to live alone
Because the greatest love
Is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
So I want to live alone
I could be happy on my own

Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

So I'm going to live alone
I'm not saying that out love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Want to stay in love with you
So I'm going to live alone
Yeah I'll be happy on my own

Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

In NYC when
I get in a taxi
I say "man" to the driver so
He'll think
"Man!
I can imagine
Having a drink with that guy"
"He's alright"

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

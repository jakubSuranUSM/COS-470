There’s a ring, it's getting late
The train’s pulling out, there’s no time to waste
Now you better move fast, yeah, you better move fast

Staple your ticket after on your shoes
Pack up your suitcase, there’s no time to lose
Now you better move fast, yeah, you better move fast

It’s getting late, now it’s time to go
It’s over the top now, it’s out of control
Just a matter of time ‘til the zero hour

Last time trying to get out of the bed
The phones still ringing, but it’s gone to your head
Now you better move fast, yeah, you better move fast

It’s time to look at the things you’ve done
It’s time to finish, girl, what you’ve become
Now you better move fast, yeah, you better move fast

It’s getting late, now it’s time to go
It’s over the top now, it’s out of control
Just a matter of time ‘til the zero hour

It’s getting late and it’s time to go
It’s over the top now, it’s out of control
Just a matter of time ‘til the zero hour

Until the zero hour
Until the zero hour
Until the zero

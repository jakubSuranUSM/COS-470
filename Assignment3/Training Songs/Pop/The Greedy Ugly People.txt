I had her on the carpet twisting and squirming about,
Trying to guess what she needs,
Trying to guess what the fuss was about.

She had a conscience that surely did need pricking,
I was there for the picking as she would soon find out.

The Greedy Ugly People are not like us,
They don't feel the love that she and I would die without.

I had her on a chair in the middle of the living room,
And then we went to the bedroom, where we were making spoons.

When we went out she started clicking her heels,
She was sticking her chest out, cause she was starting to feel.

Love don't stop no wars, don't stop no cancer,
It stops my heart.

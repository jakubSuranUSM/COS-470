If that's your problem don't let it show
You will find itself decieving love can be unsure.
Keep a level head maintain'your pride
Then you can face the situation straight in the eye.
And especially when she comes on strong
When she smiles that smile that leads you on
Ny to see it through playing out your part
Making certain when you give your heart - it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love.
Love was never planned ever before.
Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure
But as suddenly as that love will arrive
And you'll recognize the feeling
Your on fire.
And especially when she moves in close
When she moves that move there's no suppose
You'll find your hurting when you're apart
But when you give your heart - it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love.
When you give your heart it should be
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love.
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love. . . .

(Kim Carnes/Dave Ellingson)

Just before you go could we talk a while
Maybe my ol' face could make you smile
I know you haven't said all that's on your mind
We always used to keep an open line

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

Try to hold the sun when it's sinking low
Try to keep away the lonely night
Try to make you stay when you wanna go
And nothin' that I say can make things right

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

Just before you go could we talk a while
Maybe my ol' face could make you smile
Guess every dream is just like sand in the hand
Hold it too hard and it's gone

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

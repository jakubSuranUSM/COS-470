Yeah
I don't need diamonds
I don't need a car
I don't need you to listen
Yea come in

See it's like that
Sick of brothers flashing the cash
And the ladies that be pimping their ass
But that kind of 'ish
It goes on and on 
It don't stop

'Cause you
Gotta treat me like a real lady
If you wanna get with me
I'm not that kind of one night lover

I got my own diamond rings
Don't need a man to buy me things
So save it for somebody else
'Cause no means no

No, I don't want a man with the dough
No, I ain't getting with your flow
No, cash money ain't my style

Ladies won't you hear me now
Everybody shout it out

No, I don't wanna drink at the bar
No, I don't wanna ride in your car
No, I don't give a damn who you are
No means no

I, I, I don't get down
With boys that play around
And you nasty girls
Whose talking all that shit about me

Baby 
If I choose to wear these clothes
Don't mean that I'm a hoe
Can't you see
I'm shaking what my mama gave me

I got my own diamond rings
Don't need a man to buy me things
So save it for somebody else
'Cause no means no

So tell me what's a girl to do
I'm sick and tired of telling you
So save it for somebody else
'Cause no means no

No, I don't want a man with the dough
No, I ain't getting with your flow
No, cash money ain't my style

Ladies won't you hear me now
Everybody shout it out

No, I don't want a man with the dough
No, I ain't getting with your flow
No, cash money ain't my style

Ladies won't you hear me no
Everybody shout it out

No, I don't wanna drink at the bar
No, I don't wanna ride in your car
No, I don't give a damn who you are
No means no

No, I don't want a man with the dough
No, I ain't getting with your flow
No, cash money ain't my style

Ladies won't you hear me no
Everybody shout it out

No, I don't wanna drink at the bar
No, I don't wanna ride in your car
No, I don't give a damn who you are
No means no

No, no, no

Maybe I'm a fool, one day we'll know 
Maybe I'm a fool, only time can show 
But now these lonely nights are killin' me 
I'm so far away from reality 
The pain grows stronger 
I can't hold on much longer 
It hurts when I think of how I had your sweet love 
And still I set you free 

Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, guess it's not like we planned 
Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go 

I wish that you could see the tears on my face 
Painful memories of a love I can't replace 
I'm sailin' in the past, and I sinkin' fast 
You can hear my S.O.S. cryin' out for tenderness 
Though yesterday's dead and gone 
Your magic still lingers on 
It hurts when I think of how I had your sweet love 
And how I set you free 

Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, I guess it's not like we planned, oh no no 
Oh Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go 

Oh Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, I guess it's not like we planned 
Oh Lucky, you know I really really love you so 
But Lucky, I still have to go 

Lucky, I said I hope you try and understand 
Lucky, I guess it's not like ... [fade out]

If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
A hundred miles, a hundred miles

You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
And the land that I once loved is not my own

Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two,
Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

A hundred tanks along the square
One man stands and stops them there
Someday soon the tide'll turn and I'll be free
I'll be free, I'll be free
I'll come home to my country
Someday soon the tide'll turn and I'll be free

If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two,
Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home...
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home...

I'll be free, I'll be free
I'll come home to my country
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home

You can hear the whistle blow five hundred miles

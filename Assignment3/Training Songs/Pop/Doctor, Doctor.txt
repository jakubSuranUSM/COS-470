I saw you there, just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming yeah
I kissed you then, then once again
You said you would come and dance with me
Dance with me across the sea
And we could feel the motion of a thousand dreams 
(chorus)

Oh, Doctor, doctor, can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh, Doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling? 
Ships at night give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please don't go no please don't go
Cause I don't want to stay here on my own 

Oh, Doctor, doctor, can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh, Doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling? 
Ships at night give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please don't go no please don't go
Cause I don't want to stay here on my own 

Fever breathe your love on me (breathe your love)
Take away my name (take away)
Fever lay your hands on me (breathe your love)
Never be the same 

Oh, Doctor, doctor, can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh, Doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling? 
Ships at night give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please don't go no please don't go
Cause I don't want to stay here on my own 

Oh, Doctor, doctor, can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh, Doctor, doctor, is this love I'm feeling? 
Ships at night give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please don't go no please don't go
Cause I don't want to stay here on my own 

Come with me and make believe
We can travel to eternity

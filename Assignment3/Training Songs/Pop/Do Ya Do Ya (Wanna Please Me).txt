Are you strong enough
Give me what I want
Can you please me, right now

Are you strong enough
Give me what I want
Can you please me, right now
(Right now, right now) Com'on!
(Now, now, now, now, now...whoa oh)

So you know my name
Now you know my number
Don't the others want you any more

If you're gonna call
You'll see-I'm stronger
Stronger than the girls you had before

Well do you know how to please...
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please...
Please me now, oh, oh, oh

Tell me how it feels
Now the table's turning
I could get you underneath my thumb
Have you got a heart
Is your heart burning
Tell me is it pounding like a drum

Well do you know how to please...
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please
Please me now, oh, oh, oh

Please... Please...

Give me what I want, give me what I need
Give me what I want, give me what I need
Give me what I want, give me what I need
Give me what I want, give me what I need

Oh do you know how to please...
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please me
Do ya, do ya wanna please
Please me now, oh, oh, oh

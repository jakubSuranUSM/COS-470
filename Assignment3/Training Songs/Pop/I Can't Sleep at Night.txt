I'm not good at being lonely

I'm sorry if you saw too much
But baby I got too near
I'm open to the slightest touch
When I don't have you here

What can I do?
What can I say?
How could I make the same mistake?

Can't give it up
Can't let it go
Ooh, I gotta make you see its you for me

'cause I,
I Can't Sleep At Night
It just don't feel right
'cause baby I'm lonely, and I want you here to hold me

'cause I,
I Can't Sleep At Night
It just don't feel right
'cause baby I'm lonely, I'm not good at being lonely
I know you'll give me one more chance
I know I crossed the line

I'm guessing it's too much to ask
That you give me some time

The more I give
The more I want
With every sip, I'm going under

But it feels right
I know it's wrong

Ooh, I gotta make you see it's you for me

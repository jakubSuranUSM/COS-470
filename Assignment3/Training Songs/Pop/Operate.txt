Yeah yeah yeah, uhh 
It seems to me so strange 
Check wallet for his name 
His face is in the muck 
I think his zippers stuck 

He is perfect for me 
To practice surgery 
One look coagulates 
Its time to operate 

Just keep it going 
Just keep it going 
Just keep it going 

[Chorus]
He's not dead 
He's gonna live 
He's not dead 
He's gonna live 
I see his eyes rollin back in his head [Repeat: x4]

Come on lets take him home 
I think i heard him groan 
Hold on or he will sink 
Just keep it going 

You say your not but i know you can fake it 
I can take it! 

Just keep it going 
Just keep it going 
Just keep it going 

[Chorus]

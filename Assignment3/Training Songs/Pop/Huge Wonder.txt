I don't want to sit here just hanging around
What am I doing hanging with this crowd
Too many things to do and see
I can't sympathize with your apathy

Now my town's a ghost town
And that's OK
Meet me at The Farmer's Market
Make it today
The hunchbacks of Fairfax are out of sight
A hunk of burnin' Myrna's gonna catch my eye

It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small
Just a hop off the bus
Forget about the fuss
Too many things to do and see
Huge wonder

Hollywood Boulevard, now that's a scene
Punk rock jail bait and G.I. teens
The children of the night and the critics know
The only God on earth is Axl Rose

It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small
Just a hop off the bus
Forget about the fuss
Too many things to do and see
Huge wonder

It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small wonder
It's no wonder, no small
Just a hop off the bus
Forget about the fuss
Too many things to do and see
Huge wonder

It's no wonder, no small wonder
Huge wonder
It's no wonder, no small wonder
Huge wonder
It's no wonder, no small wonder
Huge wonder

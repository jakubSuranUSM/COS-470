I saw the lamplight from your window
I didnt think you were home
Sitting there all alone
So I came up to your room to ask you why
Why did you hurt me so?
Why did you have to go away?
I never wanted anything in my life
Not until I met you
I thought you'd see me through
All the bad days that I had
Before I met you
Something in the past
Never thought it couldn't last
Forever
There's one thing I can say
Every day how I miss you
Every day that I'm without you
Hurts just a little bit more than
I've ever been hurt before
Every day that I'm without you
Hurts just a little bit more
And now I look down from your window
See a young man across the street
He looks something like me
And he's walking with his head down to the ground
Did you want to hurt me so?
Why did you have to go away?
There's one thing I can say
Every day how I miss you
Every day that I'm without you
Hurts just a little bit more than
I've ever been hurt before
Every day that I'm without you
Hurts just a little bit more

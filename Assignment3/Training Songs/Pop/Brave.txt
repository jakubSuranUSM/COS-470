Ooh ooh oo hoo och ooh hoo
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I could hear the calling, a million miles away
As my heart beats fills the silence, with words that I can't say
my mother used to tell me, girl time for you will come
And so I sit back and I hold tight, my time has now begun
Chorus
And I won't ever walk away
I'll just be brave and stay
Hold me till the end
And in your arms I'll rise up high
Ooh hoo I wait for tomorrow, remember yesterday
Ooh when I was scared of the darkness
And saying things I shouldn't say
But now my life has changed ooh
Just look what I've become
And so I sit back and I hold tight
My life has just begun
Repeat Chorus
Ooh hoo life has been fine as a child up till now
But I found I'm searching for something more
Yeah
Saxaphone Solo
Ooh hoo love it has no reason, don't need none to survive
It's just a little flame in my heart, Ooh hoo keep me burning bright
Repeat Chorus
Don't walk away (don't walk away)
Just be brave and stay (Don't walk away)
Hold me till the and (don't walk away)
And in your arms I'll rise up high
Haa haa haa haa haa rise up high
haa haa haa haa haa rise up high
Note
Ad lib and then ends on rise up high or
haa haa haa haa haa haa haa haa

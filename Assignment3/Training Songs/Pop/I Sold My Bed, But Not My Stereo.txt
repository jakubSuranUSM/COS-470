Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
Blank tapes and posters on the door
Listen to my Pink Floyd cover
Take a seat like a backbeat lover
Mixed tapes and cushions on the floor

I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo

Paper bags and escalators
Pushing up those broken faders
Only way to find out who you are
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero
Little things will always get you far

I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo

Black is my favorite color
Makes me feel like we know each other
In a town of ones and zeros
You are one magnetic hero

I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo
I sold my bed, but not my stereo

Cryin' (oh ah-ah ah-ah) in the streets 
Cryin' (oh ah-ah ah-ah) in the streets 

Here comes a girl 
She really wants to make the scene 
She's proud of her tight fittin' clothes 
She'll show the world she really swings, 
& all her heartbreak, no one knows 
& all her heartbreak, no one knows 
See it in her eyes (see it in her eyes) 
Ah (see it in her ey yi yi yies) 

There goes a boy 
He's makin' like he's big and bad 
Leather boots & bleach streaks in his hair 
He's wearin' shades & Levis too 
He's actin' smart and nonchalant 
He's actin' smart and nonchalant 
See it in his eyes (see it in his eyes) 
Ah (see it in his ey yi yi yies) 

(Watch 'em in the streets) oh oh they're masqueradin' 
(Watch em' inthe streets) oh oh they're just paradin' 
(Make-up won't cover up) no no no no 
(Make-up won't cover up) no no no no 
See it in their eyes (see it in their eyes) 
Ah (see it in their ey yi yi yies)

Don't talk to me about heroes
Most of these men sing like surfs
Jesus was a black man
No Jesus was Batman
No, no, no, no, not at all
That was Bruce Wayne

Who got the biggest
Who got the biggest
Who got the biggest brain
For a year I did bang her
And Dennis sleeps fucked off
He'll surface again

Don't talk to me about heroes
Most of these men sing like Surfs
Don't talk to me about your big big heroes
Most of these men sing like surfs

He never a sad man
Or so call mean bad man
Or that's just down to the strain
Well he hand out fish man
With his centred parted sun tan
Then cut all the lame

Who got the biggest
Who got the biggest
Who got the richest brain
Jesus was a black man
No Jesus was Batman
No, no, no, no, f*ck
That was Bruce Wayne

Don't talk to me about heroes
Most of these men sing like Surfs
Don't talk to me about your big big heroes
Most of these men sing like surfs

We lead double lives
We deal in sex and beautiful women
Contemplating

Don't talk to me about heroes
Most of these men sing like Surfs
Don't talk to me about your big big heroes
Most of these men sing like surfs

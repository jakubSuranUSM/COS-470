Dirty Creature come my way
from the bottom of a big black lake
Shuffles up to my window
making sure I'm awake
S'probably gonna pick my brain
Got me in a vice-like grip
He said one slip, your dead. Ha.

Dirty Creature of habit
Little horror here to stay
Anyone in his right mind
would tell it to go away
but the river of dread runs deep
full of unspeakable things
The creature don't mess around
I don't want to mess with him

I don't want to sail, I don't want to sail
I don't want to, I don't want to sail tonight
Dirty Creature's got me at a disadvantage from the inside.

Tentacles on the brain keep me from falling asleep
I'm rooted to the spot
The beast don't know when to stop
Sneaking up from behind
Binds and gags my wits
Dirty Creature got my head exactly where he wants it

I don't want to sail, I don't want to sail,
I don't want to, I don't want to sail tonight,
Taniwha is waiting for me just below the surface so bright (Yeah)
Even as we speak the Dirty Creature springs a nasty surprise.

Dirty Creature knows my type
Found it in a magazine
He's seen the look of fear before
splattered all over the screen
The animal magnet thug
draws me out of myself
I need a dragon-slayer
who can save me from myself

I don't want to sail, I don't want to sail,
I don't want to set sail for the middle of nowhere tonight
Dirty Creature's got me at a disadvantage from the inside (Yeah)
I don't want to sail upon the waters of invention tonight

[a Taniwha is a New Zealand dragon/sea monster type "dirty creature"]

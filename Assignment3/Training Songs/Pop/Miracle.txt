Every time I get up
My heart is in the basement
I can't get over it.
I never wanted to work for pieces of paper
But I guess that's all I get
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
I wanna win in this world but its pushing me out,
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
I was born in this house and I'm burning it down

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again

Everybody get out
We can't stand underwater
Can't seem to touch the ground
Your modern tongue
Keeps talking it over
But it doesn't make a sound
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
What you gonna say to me now? I'm calling you out,
Oh oh oh, oh oh-oo
'cause I was born in this house and I'm burning it down

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again

Ah! it's a miracle
Even if it's in my head
Ah! like a miracle
I'm in love again

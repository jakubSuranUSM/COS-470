That how you want to play it
Break my heart and go home
Why'd you want to go do that, but we're not even in the way

That how you want to sing it
I've been having loads of fun
I think I've heard that song before it ends up as a book

That how you want to see it
If you just have a 'tongue?'
Tunnel vision, never listen, no we're never going home

You're a good time killer
Why did you end up on your own
Overlook at Acapulco playing paper, scissors , stone

You told the fortune teller
The crystal ball is going to show
Uri Geller's going to tell or bend the truth so I don't know

Sea has something stirring
On the currents down below
There's a beach out of reach, pack it up so we can go

Crystal leaks start all over
Switch it up and overhaul
Step in line, get in time, speed it up until we fall

Paint a picture of a sunset
Scratch the writing on the wall
Roll the credits on your edit play it back and watch it all

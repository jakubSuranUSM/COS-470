Come stand beside me
Come gather 'round me
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart

When I was just a boy
The voice of an angel came to me
It said your future is there
Inside your cold, cold heart
But I was just a boy
And a boy sees what he wants to see
And I saw nothing to share
Inside this cold, cold heart
Somebody should have told me
That when you're born to this world
Your life starts slipping away

Come stand beside me (cold heart)
Come gather 'round me (cold heart)
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart
With love inside me (cold heart)
With arms around me (cold heart)
With love inside me, with arms around me
We'll heat this cold, cold heart

When I became a man
The voice of a devil said to me
It said forever you'll live
Inside your cold, cold heart
But I'm a better man
A wiser man who wants to be free
To have someone to care
About this cold, cold heart
Somebody should have loved me
They should have taken me on
Instead of taking away

Come stand beside me (cold heart)
Come gather 'round me (cold heart)
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart
With love inside me (cold heart)
With arms around me (cold heart)
With love inside me, with arms around me
We'll heat this cold, cold heart

Ohhh...
Come stand beside me
Come gather 'round me
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart
With love inside me (cold heart)
With arms around me (cold heart)
With love inside me, with arms around me
We'll heat this cold, cold heart

Come stand beside me (ohhh...)
Come gather 'round me (ohhh...)
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart
With love inside me (cold heart)
With arms around me (cold heart)
With love inside me, with arms around me
We'll heat this cold, cold heart

Come stand beside me (cold heart)
Come gather 'round me (cold heart)
Come stand beside me, come gather 'round me
And heat this cold, cold heart
With love inside me (cold heart)
With arms around me (cold heart)
With love inside me, with arms around me

Shame, ain't that a shame

You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?

My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
Yeah, yeah

Girl, you broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?

My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
Yeah, oh c'mon, c'mon

Oh well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?

My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Shame, shame
C'mon now

Oh well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?

My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Shame, ain't that a shame?
Shame, ain't that a shame?
Shame, ain't that a shame?
Shame [Incomprehensible]
Shame, ain't that a shame?

Recorded in 1976 as a be-side to 'lost in france'. lyrics taken from careful listening.

Sometimes, late in the night
I wonder how it is
Two people so much in love
Should end up like this

May hear you somewhere
So many world's apart
When you think how close we were
It's enough to break your heart

Baby baby baby
Remember the love you gave me
Baby baby I remember you
Baby baby baby
Remember the love you gave me
'cause baby baby, I sure remember you

Sometimes, late in the night
Holding someone new
Sometimes I have closed my eyes
And thought that it was you

Dreams, dreams of what might have been
Is living in the past
I'm just glad that I knew you once
Although it couldn't last

Baby baby baby
Remember the love you gave me
'cause, baby baby I sure remember you...(x4)

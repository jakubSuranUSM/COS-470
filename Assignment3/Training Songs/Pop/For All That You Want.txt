I can't sit and wait,
for you to say,
If there's room inside your heart,
I'm not used to playing,
Love's silly games,
Turn me down or let me start,

You have to believe 
I'll make things right,
Open your arms 
Give up the fight,

For all that you want,
For all that you're feeling,
There's a place where you can go,
For all that you need,
I will be waiting,
To be your life your hero,

Now if you decide,
To run and hide,
It's only you you're cheating,
(The key's in your hand)
The key's in your hand
(You must understand)
You must understand,
I won't be defeated no,

I really believe 
This goes inside,
Open your arms 
Let me see your light,

For all that you want,
For all that you're feeling,
There's a place where you can go,
For all that you need,
I will be waiting,
To be your life your hero, oh,

I'm sure that you've heard 
This before so many times,
(So many times)
Yeah,
But girl, look inside my heart 
And you will find,
I'll be your life your hero,

I'll be the one to hold you,
I'll never let you go,
I'll always understand you baby,
To be your life your hero,

(For all that you want)
For all that you want,
(For all you're feeling)
For all that you're feeling,
(There is a place)
There's a place where you can go,
(For all that you need)
For all that you need,
(I will be waiting)
I will be waiting,
To be your life your hero, 
Whoa, ho,
(For all that you want)
Whoa ho yeah,
(For all you're feeling)
(There is a place)
There's a place where you can go,
(For all that you need)
Oh yeah,
(I will be waiting)
I will be waiting,
To be your life,
Your hero....

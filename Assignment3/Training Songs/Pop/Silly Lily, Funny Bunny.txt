I'm climbing up the walls of your
Head over heels built up house
I scream and I lean in vain tonight
Remember the words that I said
I keep on knocking at your door with my head
As you're silly, Lily
I keep on knocking at your door with my head

As you're funny, bunny
I'm craving for your leftover kiss
Tasting like drops of cold rain
I'll drink and I'll drown and ruin the whole world
So think of the words that I said

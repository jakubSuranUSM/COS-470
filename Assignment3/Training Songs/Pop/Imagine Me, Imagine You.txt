Doo lang doo da lang a lang doo lang
Doo lang doo da lang a lang doo lang

Heavenly eyes come see the moon
I think it's shinin'
Or would you rather up my room
For wine and dinin'

Imagine me imagine you
Inside each others mind what would we do?

Doolang da lang alang doo lang

Following lines around your palm
Your heart is huntin'
Don't you look any further
It's mine your wantin'
Imagine me Imagine you
Inside each others eyes what would we see?
Imagine me Imagine you
Inside
Each others arms what would we do?

Doo lang doo da lang a lang doo lang

Look no further
Look no further
Look no further
Creulest almost 
Always to ourselves
It mustn't get any better
Off!
It's in our hands 
It always was
It's in our hands
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands
Well
Now aren't we're scaring ourselves
Unnecessarily
Aren't we trying to hard?
'Cause it in our hands
It's in our hands
It's all here
It's in our hands
Look no further
Look no further
It's in our hands!
It always was!
It's in our hands!
Yeah!!!
It's in our hands!
It's in our hands!
It's in our hands!

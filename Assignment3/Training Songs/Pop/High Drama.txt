Obviously something's got to be done
I'm such a drama queen every time we meet,
And you don't give a shit.
A junky, an addict, a slave for your love
But I'm not in love
I'm just obsessed with hearing you say
"Yes please Markus come to me".

I'm high on you and on drugs,
It is the worst combination of addictions.
High on you and all drunk
This is when I make my big mistakes.

Obviously something's got to be done
Or else I'll end up like one big bleeding heart
And that's not good at all.
Bought myself a video game
To get entertained in an easy way
But I saw through that
I'm far too smart to get fooled by myself.

I'm high on you and on drugs,
It is the worst combination of addictions.
High on you and all drunk
This is when I make my big mistakes.
High on you and on drugs,
The worst combination of addictions.
High on you and all drunk

The worst combination of addictions.

I don't understand
How we drift so far away.
I keep on holding on
But your hands are feeling so numb.

Nobody told me that there would be days like these
I'm falling baby, can't you see?
And you're in no hurry to keep me from coming undone.
Take a look at what we've become.
Where do we go from here?
I don't want to disappear.
Our hearts are on parade
So you can watch them fade.

I don't understand how the worst of times
Get stuck in your mind.
I'd like to take away
All the stupid things that we say.

Nobody told me that there would be days like these
I'm falling baby, can't you see?
And you're in no hurry to keep me from coming undone.

So you can watch them fade.

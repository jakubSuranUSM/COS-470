We need to lay in each other's arms
There's nowhere else to go
It's all so easy and I want you to know
There'll never be another one
Who could get this close to me
Everything you give to me
Is everything I've dreamed of
Even when you turn your back now
I can feel you reaching for me
Even when you walk away
I still know where you're hiding

I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I've seen your tears fall when
You thought you were alone
I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it

You try to make like I'm not there
To show me how you feel
You don't have to hurt me
With the hurt that you won't reveal
There'll never be another one
Who could get this close to you
I can give you everything
That you've ever dreamed of
Even when you turn your back now
I can feel you reaching for me
Even when you walk away
I still know where you're hiding

I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I've seen your tears fall when
You thought you were alone
I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it
I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
The more you try to hide your love
The more it shows

I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it
Feel the loving' in me
I need it

I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
The more you try to hide your love
The more it shows
I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it

I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
Your eyes says yes
Even when you tell me no no
I can't believe 
You've got a heart of stone
I can't believe it

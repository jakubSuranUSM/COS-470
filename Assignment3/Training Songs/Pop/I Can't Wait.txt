For your love, I just can't wait
For your touch, I just can't wait
And for your slinky smile, I just can't wait
And for your angel heart, I just can't wait

'Cause when you hold me, I just melt away
And when you hold me, I like to hear you say
Night to night and day to day
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait for your love

For your whisper soft, I can't wait
For your bright night eyes, I can't wait
For your silky sway, I can't wait
Oh, you know that I'll be so glad
That you came today, I can't wait

Oh, when you hold me, I just melt away
And when you hold me, I like to hear you say
It's night to night and day to day
Ok, I just can't wait, I just can't wait
Oh, I can't wait for your love

Oh, for your love, well, I just can't wait
Oh, for your tender touch, I can't wait
For your slinky sway, I just can't wait
Well, heart to heart, I'm telling you, baby

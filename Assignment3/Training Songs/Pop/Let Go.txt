You are golden 
You are pure 
You are golden, boy 

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Your problems 
I?m here for you 
Just try, just try, just try
To stay sober 
It?s eating you 
And they say you are a monster 
But what I see is a child 
Your eyes, your eyes are glowing red 
And your tongue has caught on fire 

You are golden 
You are pure, boy 
You are golden 
Boy

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
Let it go, let go of your fire 

You play, you play, you play
Up to them 
But they?re not around 
Don?t be, don't be so rough with me 
When you are a gem 

And they ask how i can love you when all they see is this 
But I see the things that you cant contain 
And what it does to you

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
let it go, let go of your fire

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
let it go, let go of your fire

Boy
You're pure
Boy
You're pure

You are golden
You are pure, boy
You are golden, boy
You are golden
You are pure, boy
You are golden, boy

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
Let it go, let go of your fire (tell me, tell me, tell me boy)

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
Let it go, let go of your fire (tell me, tell me, tell me boy)

So let go, let go of your fire 
Let it go, let go of your fire 
Live it up till we crash 
In the smoke and the ash 
Let it go, let go of your fire (tell me, tell me, tell me boy)

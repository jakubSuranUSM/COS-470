My only reason
Love is my only reason and love can make you crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is coz I love you and that's all
Boy I love you and that's all

My friends? think I'm crazy 
'Cause I'm running around with you
But they don't know you like I do I do?.
You're so impossible so unpredictable 

I know they don't have to tell me
But my heart made up my mind 
It's so irrational, so irresponsible
It may not make sense

But it's making me feel so deep
My only reason
Love is my only reason and love can make you crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is coz I love you and that's all, boy I love you 

And that's all
3:30 in the morning and you're asking why I'm still here?!!
My life would probably be safer if you disappear, don't disappear no no
It's like a burning flame that stronger in the rain

I ask myself why I do this over and over again?
But with your pain
I still can't walk away until every chance gone
I'll be holding on 

My only reason
Love is my only reason and love can make you crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is coz I love you and that's all, boy I love you 
And that's all

I don't even have a choice, I have no choice
This kind of situation has a life of their own
So why is my love enough to explain
Why am I acting this way?

Is just ?cause?.
My only reason
Love is my only reason and love can make you crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is coz I love you and that's all, boy I love you 
And that's all

Everybody loves a clown, so why don't you?
Everybody laughs at the things that I say and do.
They all laugh when they say me coming,
But you don't laugh, you just go home running.

Everybody loves a clown, so why can't you?
A clown has feelings too.

I joke around at a party when you are there.
But you don't laugh, you don't look, you just don't care.
If you wondered why this clown is crying, look a little closer, inside I'm dying.
It's not easy, you see when you're a clown like me.

I don't know how to say that I love you,
Cause you would smile and say tell a joke or two.
Yes, I'm a clown, but I don't want to be.
Why can't you see the other side of me?

Guess I'll be the guy who plays the part
Of a clown with a broken heart.

Dreaming of your love, and not knowing where to start. [Repeat: x4]

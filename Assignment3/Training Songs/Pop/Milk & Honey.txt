I ain't trying to be broke this year
Finna go to get dough like it ain't no joke this year
Gotta hustle and flow round here
I just wanna be up on the dough getting more 'round here
But the paper keep slipping through my hands
Soon as I get it got to give it up again
Got me feeling like I'm sinking in the sand
Need a dollar gotta come up with a plan

So I can party with everybody
Without out no worries or cares
I wanna pay instead of saying
Can someone help me out here
I wanna feel like I can deal
With whatever comes my way
I'ma double the grind turn nickels to dimes
'Til next round is on me

Gimme milk and honey
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gotta get this money
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gimme milk and honey
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gotta get this money
Make it rain never stop
Gold on the bottom with the platinum on top

Milk, honey
Milk, honey
Milk, honey

Milk, honey
Milk, honey
Milk, honey

Gimme me that money you owe me you pay me
I put in my work made it crack like the 80's
Come up off that gravey don't do nothing crazy
No if, ands, or maybes, you bet not be shady
I ain't trying to be last this year
Finna mash on the gas and come up on some cash this year
I just wanna have funds this year
I just wanna have fun this year

Been down too long but my game is strong
So I know I'm bound to come up
Get the stacking on and my paper long
From the sunset to the sun up
I wanna feel like I can chill
Not worried 'bout the money
I'ma double my grind turn nickels to dimes
'Til next round is on me

Gimme milk and honey
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gotta get this money
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gimme milk and honey
Ay ay a-a-ay
Gotta get this money
Make it rain never stop
Gold on the bottom with the platinum on top

Milk, honey
Milk, honey
Milk, honey
Milk, honey
Milk, honey

Make it rain never stop
Gold on the bottom with the platinum on top
Gold on the bottom with the platinum on top
Gold on the bottom

Gimme milk and honey
Gotta get this money
Gimme milk and honey
Gotta get this money
Make it rain never stop
Gold on the bottom with the platinum on top

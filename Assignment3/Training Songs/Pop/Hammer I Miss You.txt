And the boys in the alley ways
All bending at the knees
Trying to find something to f*ck
Trying to find something to please

Hold on to
Hold on to
Hold on to
Hold on to
Everything

Hammer
I miss you

And every hour that passes
While I'm living in the dark
Reminds me when we saw the boys
Bending at the knees

Hammer
I miss you

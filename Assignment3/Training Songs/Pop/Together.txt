I feel you,every time my heart beats. and love grows stronger as the days go by. And you don't have to say that you love me. We're good together coz we're two of a kind.

Bridge
And i,i need you to light up my life. I need you to keep me alive.

Chorus
Wherever you are,whatever you do. Every breath that i take,i'll be thinking of me and you,wherever you go,you know your not alone. So hold on and be strong coz you know we're two hearts beating as one.

So close,there is nothing between us
With every beat,i feel you more and more. I always thought that true love was beyond me. But you brought heaven right to my door.

Bridge
Chorus

This is where you belong,because we're one and the same. (never be lonely) You are the reason i live,The reason i'll never be lonely again.

Wherever you are(Wherever you are)
Wherever you are(Wherever you are)

Wherever you are,you know your not alone(You know your not alone(Not alone) (woo-hoo!)

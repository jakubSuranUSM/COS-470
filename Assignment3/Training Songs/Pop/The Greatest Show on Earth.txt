Mary Poppins killed a dream today
Locked it up and threw the key away
It was a very old and dusty dream
Everybody knows -
There's no time for happiness today
Got a date for lunch a PLASTIC TRAY
Got a deal to sign her life away
Got an early grave she's gotta make
And we are all insane
Hold on
Slow down
You'll never get to heaven on this merry-go-round
Turn on
Turn round
You know you're going nowhere
If you keep on going round
The merry-go-round
Christopher Robin blew his friends away
Wrapped 'em up and moved up Barnsley way
Got a job he's milking PLASTIC TRAYS
Got a line in filling early graves
Round and round and round and round he goes
Where he stops well no-one seems to know why
They've forgotten just what he could be
He's the same the same as you and me
We are all insane
Hold on
Slow down
You'll never get to heaven on this merry-go-round
Turn on
Turn round
You know you're going nowhere
If you keep on going round
The merry-go-round
The merry-go-round
Where you go-there you go-round
Go on
Slow down
You'll never get to heaven on this merry-go-round
Turn on
Turn round
You know you're going nowhere
If you keep on going round
The merry-go-round
La la la la etc.

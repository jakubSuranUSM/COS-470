The day that did not exist
I sat all alone
The date did not exist
In my mind the storm
That beat the shore
The day that did not exist
I was never warned
The date did not exist
There was no-one home
There was nothing wrong
There was nothing done
The day that did not exist
I was not alone
The date did not exist
I unplugged the phone
And rode out the storm

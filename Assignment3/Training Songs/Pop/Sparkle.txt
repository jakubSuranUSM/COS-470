Oh someone has just excited me
And made me know where I want to be
Where are you now?
But this sparkle couldn't stand the chill
In the darkest room of our world
Where am I now
And everywhere we go
We always run
From what I don't know
And we think we have the answer
Ah but we've not
And now we've been on our own for ages
So what have we done?
She's broke many people with her ways
Your pale eyes water as her body decays
She's on her way down
Forget about her all in a bath
But these words are scratched on her chest
"Where are you now"
And everywhere we go 
Whether we run, walk or crawl
You turn to me and I still don't know
And we think we have the answer
But we've not
Ah here she comes
But she's been on her own for ages
So where do we go?
Now she's convinced she's found the exit
But it's to what
She says "the things that you don't know"
"things you don't know"
Now she knows I know that she knows
But she can't see that I do
And she thinks she have the answer
But we've not
Ah here she comes
But she's been on her own for ages
And what has she done?
And she's convinced she's found the exit
But it's to what?
She says "the things that you don't know"
"things you don't know"
Oh the things that you don't know
When I'm feeling low?.

You stalk in - givin me a bad thrill 
You just look cool - and you're dressed to kill 
And I feel that you 
Think you're a big seducer 

You come close - look into my eyes 
And I feel that you're livin in disguise 
It's so dead straight clear 
You are just a lucky loser 

Oh well I know 
That you're gonna get blind 
When I'm through with you - all you gotta do 
Is to go away - I won't tell you no lie 
I know - you should keep it in mind 
You're not good enough - just not rough enough 
You are one big lie - you're a swanker that's why 
I know - that you're gonna get blind - ohh 

You're so vain - but you feel so hip 
If you need results - baby here's my tip 
Get yourself someone 
Who's of the kind like you are 

Of course I know - what you want me to do 
But you ain't no good - I'm too good for you 
Baby just get lost 
Ain't no place that's too far 

[Chorus] 

If you want you may dream of me 
But I'll never be your reality 
What you deserve - 
'Somebody undemanding 

[Chorus]

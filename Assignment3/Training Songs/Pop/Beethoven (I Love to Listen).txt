I love to listen to
I love to listen to

Take a girl like that and put her in a natural setting like a cafe for example. 
Along comes the boy and he's looking for trouble with a girl like that, with a girl like that. 
Who knows what they'll decide to do? Who knows what they'll get up to? 
I'd love to know, wouldn't you?

[Chorus 1:]
I love to, I love to listen to
Love to, I love to listen to
I love to, I love to listen to
Love to, I love to

[Chorus 2:]
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to

You think you know just what you want but you have used that weapon against me. 
Did I tell you I was lying by the way when I said I wanted a new mink coat? 
I was thinking of something sleek to wrap around my tender throat. 
I was dreaming like a Texan girl. A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything. 
A girl who thinks she should have something extreme.

I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to

[Chorus 2: x5]

Now there's a rumor around the world
That every man, woman, boy, and girl
He and she, you and me, we will all be so free
I know together we'll work it out

We're gonna vote for liberty
For every color, race, and creed
We can love who we please
Over land, cross the seas

We come together in unity
No need to scream and shout (at each other)
I know we can work it out (every sister every brother)

Someday (when we'll all be together)
Somehow (and it will be forever)
Somewhere
Sometime

Somehow (we'll be together if we just try)
Someday (people get up on your feet)
Somehow (come on let's dance in the street)
Somewhere

Sometime
Somehow
We can love who we please
Over land, cross the seas
We come together in unity

We're gonna turn these worlds into one
A new community of fun
No more push
No more shove

In the village of love
We come together in harmony
And then we vote for liberty
For every color, race, and creed

We can love who we please
Over land, cross the seas
We come together in unity
No need to scream and shout (at each other)
I know we can work it out (every sister every brother)

Someday (when we'll all be together)
Somehow (and it will be forever)
Somewhere
Sometime

Somehow (we'll be together if we just try)
Someday (people get up on your feet)
Somehow (come on let's dance in the street)
Somewhere

Some way
Somehow
We can love who we please
Over land, cross the seas
We come together in unity

Someday (when we'll all be together)
Somehow (and it will be forever)
Somewhere
Sometime

Somehow (we'll be together if we just try)
Someday (people get up on your feet)
Somehow (come on let's dance in the street)
Somewhere

Some way
Somehow
We can love who we please
Over land, cross the seas
We come together in unity

I don't want to hear a thing,
She's a teaser
Teases me in any way she can
And she leaves me in the rain
But I need it,
Addicted to this sympathy she fakes,
(Yeah) I don't want to play the game,
When I see her
Blinded by the body she got made by some dude in the USA,
You won't believe me,
Man you won't believe how well she fakes.

She makes through my regrets
She's screwing with my head
You know I stick around to please her (please her)
I don't think with my head
Nobody's gone through yet
She's screwing with my head
A teaser (teaser)

She laughs at everything I say
And then leaves me
Leavin' me to pick up all the pills for her hair
And she's the docket front in all my holiday
and roll me stuff she stuffs with every single way
oh it's a oh no !
Summon her !

She makes through my regrets
She's screwing with my head
You know I stick around to please her (please her)
I don't think with my head
Nobody's gone through yet
She's screwing with my head
A teaser (teaser)

Oh yeah ! One more time !
No, she won't give you anything you want oh no!
No, she won't give you anything you want oh no!
I said No, she won't give you anything you want oh no!
I said No, anything you want oh no!

I don't want to hear a thing,

You don't have to tell me, girl, because I know
Baby, don't you think I knew it long ago?

Baby, you don't have tell me
'Cause I already know, you see
Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye

There is someone new who gets your kiss now
What about the times before - don't they exist now?

Whoah baby, you don't have tell me
Baby, 'cause I already know, you see
Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye
Have a little lesson now

Baby tried to be a middle guy
Baby when I know what is on your mind
Baby you don't have to tell me goodbye

Go ahead, tell me that's life, each day if you could
You are giving me a taste of life but good

Whoah baby, you don't have tell me
Baby, 'cause I already know, you see
Baby, you don't have to tell me goodbye

Baby tried to be a middle guy
Baby when I know what is on your mind
Baby you don't have to tell me goodbye

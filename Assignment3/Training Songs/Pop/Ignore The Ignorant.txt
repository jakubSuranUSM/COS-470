In these passionate places
There's a piece of me in every town
And the dialect changes
They never seem to wear me out
Yes the war is over
But no-one ever told my heart
That it's all a laugh because
I'm throwing England to the dogs
But anyway

To be in the right
I'd give my life
But you must see it through
It's now down to you

Although you want the boy that is
You will never change the boy that was
And though he lives in a hotel
He seems to scrub up rather well
It's just a shame you can't
Ignore the ignorant
Because you see them
Every day

To be in the right
I'd give my life
But you must see it through
It's now down to you
To be proven right
I'd give my life

Ignore the ignorant

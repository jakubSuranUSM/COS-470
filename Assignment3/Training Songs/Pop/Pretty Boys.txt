Pretty boys - on my tv screen
Teeth so white and hair so clean
Pretty boys - sing and play guitars
Pretty boys get to be big stars

How do you rate my sex appeal from one to ten
Is my image just a bit confusing
Maybe i should get a facelift, start again
Maybe i should trade my pointed shoes in
'cause talent don't count
For pretty boys

Those promo people got a lot to answer for
You can take your face and see just where it fits
Be a pretty pawn in someone else's war
Your baby blue eyes - somebody else's wits
Equals success
For pretty boys

I want to see a human being on my tv set
Want some action for the fat and thin man
They're getting closer but they ain't got robots yet
Just a hero with a smile like a tin man
No brains and no heart
Just pretty boys

She run away with a joke of her man
But the laughter is not on me
Tears are not enough
When your drowning to be seen

But i got a way to try to forget
But i cant get over you
It aches me from inside
And then it beats me til im blue

*/(There) We said the words we never mean
Walk away with somebody's dream
Thats the way we live our lives
Someone else eyes/

Love is a lonely harbour i know
But its still the place to be
Standing on the key side
Just staring at the sea

I guess i could always try to pretend
But i know it isnt true
All that ever comes back 
Is my fear of losing you

Repeat *

There we said the words we never mean
Walk away with somebody's dream
With somebody's dream
We walk away
Thats the way we live our lives
With someone else eyes

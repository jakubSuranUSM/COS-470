Ooohhhh...

Life's been so good to me,
Has it been good to you?
Has it been everything
That you expected it to be?
Was it as good for you
As it was good for me?
And was it everything
That it was all set up to be?

Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...
...now is that gratitude?

Now is that gratitude?
Or is it really love?
Some kind of reality 
That fits just like a glove?
Now is that gratitude 
For everything I've done?
Or is it something else 
That's got me on the run...?

In the middle of a big tornado,
On the tip of everyone's tongue...
In the belly of a giant whale,
All the girls just want to have fun.
In the look of a frightened neighbor,
In a big warm bed at night,
In a broken elevator,
In the teeth of a dog that bites.
In the middle of a revolution,
In the look of a child's face,
In the silence of the dinner table,
In the stillness of disgrace.

Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)

But when I think of you,
And what you've done to me,
You took away my hope...
You took away my fantasy...
I once had lots of pride,
The world was in my hands.
I lived way at the top,
Of castles made of sand.

Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes. 
Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes.

In - in the middle of a big tornado,
On the tip of everyone's tongue.
In the belly of a giant whale,
All the girls just want to have fun.
In the look of a frightened neighbor,
In a big warm bed at night,
In a broken elevator,
In the teeth of a dog that bites.
In the middle of a revolution,
In the look of a child's face,
In the silence of the dinner table,
In the stillness of disgrace.

Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...
...now is that gratitude?
Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...
...now is that gratitude?

Life's been so good to me,
Has it been good to you?

In the middle of a big tornado,

Ohhh... [repeat chorus in background] ...ohhh...

Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes. 
Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes.

Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...

Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...
...now is that gratitude?

You are the one you makes a difference
But I am the one who makes the waves
All down the line this makes us different
So all our dreams may stay awake

You know sometimes things get so strange
And all we do may go astray
Wrapped in your youth these things won`t harm you
And they don`t hit you like a train

Say... won`t you see her
I heard she`s waiting at your door
Oh I hope you won`t keep near her
I know she`s bound to want it all

She`s uncommon, she has one face
And her heart beats to your tune
When she speaks, she speaks of only your name
Then she repeats it like a fool

Hey... you can`t say you don`t want her
You know you let her through your wall
Oh I hope you don`t keep near her
I know she`s bound to want it all

You are the one you makes a difference
But I am the one who makes the waves
All down the line this makes us different
So all our dreams may stay awake

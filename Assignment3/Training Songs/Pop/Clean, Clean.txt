Pogo Johnny kicked me in the head,
Aimin' for the floorboards but they picked me up instead
Through the ringing of the night before
Said, 'the engines running gotta pay a call'

Johnny drove the halftrack
'Cause we could not find the jeep
Wake me in the morning gotta get some sleep
Driving all night out of fear
Got in the ribs every time he changed gear

I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
Gonna go where we've never been
I'm gonna, take a ride gonna pick up the team
(Pickin' up, pickin' up the team)
God you know how it's hard to keep the fighting clean
Clean clean
Clean clean
Clean clean

Pogo Johnny gonna fight the war
Chaplain in the morning at the local liquor store
Pogo coughin' bad from diesel fumes
Johnny tell the chaplain go and polish his tombs

Lying on the wasteground with a blanket on his face
Indicating that he's left the human race
Helmet open where the world came in
Gotta keep your head if you wanna win

I'm gonna take a ride, gonna pick up the team
Gonna go where we've never been
I'm gonna, take a ride gonna pick up the team
(picking up, pickin' up the team)
God you know it's hard to keep the fighting clean
clean clean
clean clean
clean clean
clean clean

Squad, quick march! Squad Dis-miss!

Clean clean
Clean clean
Clean clean
Clean clean
Clean clean

Lost a million in our very first attack
Clean clean

Don't you worry cause you know we'll get them back

Clean clean

So important people of God
To get into the very presence of God
Nothing else matters now
Fact, I want you to find yourself right in the Holy of Holy
I see his presence 

I'm in his presence 
While I'm there thanking him, I know that I have a right 
Whatever I need, He will supply

I believe tonight somebody just wants him to open up the windows of Heaven for you
Let it rain, send down your blessings Lord
I just need you to move in this place tonight
I just need you to move in this place tonight

He's doing it right now
Hallelujah

Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain (help me somebody, say it tonight)
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain (Lord, let it rain)
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain (Oh oh, let it rain)
Open the flood gates of Heaven (I want everybody to say it with me tonight)
Let it rain, let it rain

I want you to say it without the music one time, come on
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain (say it like you mean it tonight, come on and say it)
Open the flood gates of Heaven (oh oh oh. oh)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, one more time, one more time say it for me now)
Open the flood gates of Heaven 
Let it rain, let it rain

I just want you to be quiet for a moment, let the music play
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Anybody needs the rain, anybody needs the rain, anybody needs the rain, anybody needs the rain,
Come on and, say it, say it, say it

Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the flood gates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain

I don't know about you tonight
But I feel the rain
I feel the rain
I feel the rain
I feel the rain
Anybody feel the rain (I feel the rain)
Anybody in this place feel the rain (I feel the rain)
Is there anybody in here, you feel the rain? (I feel the rain)
I feel the rain (I feel the rain)

Maybe you need to look at somebody and tell them
It's raining (it's raining)
It's raining (it's raining)
It's raining (it's raining)
It's raining (it's raining)

Full gospel come to tell you 
It's raining (it's raining)
It's raining (it's raining)

Can I just thank you for rain, Lord, yeah? (it's raining)
Can I just thank you for rain?
Can I just thank you for rain?

Come on, say all that
Open the flood gates of Heaven (that's all I wanted to do, that's all I wanted to do)
Let it rain, let it rain (let it rain, let it rain,  let it rain, yeah yeah)
Open the flood gates of Heaven (oh oh oh)
Let it rain, let it rain

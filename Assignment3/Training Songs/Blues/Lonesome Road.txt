Look down - look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up - look up
And seek your maker
'fore Gabriel blows his horn

Weary toting such a load
Trudging down - that lonesome road

Look down - look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

True love - true love
What have I done
That you should treat me so

You - caused me
To walk and talk
Like I never did before

Weary toting - such a load
Trudging down that lonesome road

Look down - look down 
That lonesome road
Before you travel on

The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me
 
Take one fresh and tender kiss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
Add one stolen night of bliss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
One girl, one boy; some grief, some joy

Memories are made of this
(of the sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
Don't forget a small moon beam
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
Fold in lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
Memories are made of this

Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays These are the dreams you will savor
With His blessings from above
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
Serve it generously with love
(The sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)
One man, one wife, one love through life

Memories are made of this
(of the sweet sweet memories you gave to me
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)

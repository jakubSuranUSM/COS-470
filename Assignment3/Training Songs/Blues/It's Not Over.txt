It's not over til God says its over
It's not over til God says its over

He's with you throught stormy weather
The God I serve Oh he fails you never

He's a man of his word, its no over
He'll make a way of escape, its not over

O just hold on to your faith, he has the last say
He's never lost, he never lost a case

It's not over til God says its over
This too will pass, oh it gonna work out in your favor
God is using you to show victory
Just step out an walk in your destiny

He's a man of his word, its not over
He'll make a way of escape, its not over
O just hold on to your faith, he has the last say
He's never lost, he never lost a case

You can't go on what it looks like O we walk by faith an not by sight not by sight.
You must believe in what Jesus... oh oh oh oh ... Belive in what he says... awww

He's a man of his word, its not over
He'll make a way of escape, its not over
O just hold on to your faith, he has the last say
He's never lost, he's never lost a case

he's never lost a case, o he'll step in right on time

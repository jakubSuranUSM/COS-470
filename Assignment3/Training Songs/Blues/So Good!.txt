So good, I just can't tell it all
So good, I just can't tell it all 
So good, so good
I just can't tell it all

Not enough time to tell you how He saved my soul 
Not enough time to tell you how He made me whole 
Not enough time to tell you how He set me free
(He's been so good to me)

So good, I just can't tell it all
So good, I just can't tell it all 
So good, so good
I just can't tell it all

So good, so good 
So good, so good
So good, He's been so good
I just can't tell it all

Just can't tell it
Just can't tell it 
Just can't tell it 
Just can't tell it all

You've been good 
You've been good 
You've been good
Tell it all

I can't tell it all
I just can't tell it all
I can't tell it all
Tell it all

So good, I just can't tell it all
So good, I just can't tell it all 
So good, so good
I just can't tell it all

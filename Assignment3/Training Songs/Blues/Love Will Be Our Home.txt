If home is really where the heart is 
Then home must be a place that we all share 
for even withour difference our hearts are much the same 
And where love is we come together there. 

Wherever there is laughter ringing 
Someone smiling, someone dreaming 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home. 
Where there are children singinig 
Where a tender heart is beating 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home 

With love our hearts can be a family 
And hope can bring this family face to face 
And though we may be far apart our hearts can be as one 
When love brings us together in one place. 

Wherever there is laughter ringing 
Someone smiling, someone dreaming 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home. 
Where there are words of kindness spoken 
Where a vow is never broken 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home 

Love will, love will be our home 
Love will, love will be our home 
Love will, love will be our home 
Love will, love will be our home 

Wherever there is laughter ringing 
Someone smiling, someone dreaming 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home. 
Where there are children singinig 
Where a tender heart is beating 
We can live together there 
Love will be our home

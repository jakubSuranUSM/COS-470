We have come into this house 
To magnify the Lord 
Lift up holy hands, make a joyful noise 
Holy Spirit have your way 
Let there be praise in the house today
Praise in the house today 

Oh magnify the Lord with me
let us exalt his name together 
As we enter into the house of our Lord 
We'll sing praises, praises to our King

Let there be praise
let there be praise in the house today 
Let there be praise, praise in the house today

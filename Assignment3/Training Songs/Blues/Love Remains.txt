We are born one find day
Children of God on our way
Momma smiles and daddy cries
A miracle before their eyes
They protect us till we're of age
Through it all, love remains

A boy moves on take a bride
And she stands faithful by his side
Through tears and sweat
They build a home
And raise a family of their own
And they share joy
And they share pain
But through it all, love remains
Kingdoms come and go, but they don't last
Before you know the future is the past
In spite of what's been lost or what's been gained
We're living proof that love remains

I don't know baby what I'd do on this earth without you
We all live
And we all die
But the end is not goodbye
The sun comes up
And the seasons change
And through it all, love remains

An eternal burning flame
Hope lives on, and love remains

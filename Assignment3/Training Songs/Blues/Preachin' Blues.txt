Mmmmmm I woke up this mornin' 
Ah, blues walkin' like a man
I woke up this mornin' 
Ah, blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues 
Give me your right hand

And the blues fell mama's child 
Tore me all upside down
Blues fell mam's child 
And it tore me all upside down
Travel on, poor Bob 
Just can't turn you 'round
The blu-u-u-u-ues 
Is a low-down shakin' chill
(Yes, preach 'em now).

Mmmmm mmmmm 
Is a low-down shakin' chill
You ain't never had 'em,
I hope you never will
Well, the blues 
Is a achin' old heart disease
(Do it now. You gon' do it?
 Tell me about it.)
Let the blues 
Is a low-down achin' heart disease
Like consumption 
Killing me by degrees

I can study rain 
Oh, oh drive, oh, oh, drive my blues
I been studyin' the rain and 
I'm 'on drive my blues away
Goin' to the stil'ry 
Stay out there all day

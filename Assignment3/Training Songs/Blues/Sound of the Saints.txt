Oh I love to hear the song of creation
The wind and the rhythm of the rain
Oh the thunder it speaks of your power
But there's something in the sound of the saints

I've been washed in the roar of the ocean
Found peace in the echoes of a cave
And the trees of the field they clap their hands
But there's something in the sound of the saints

From the lips of those you saved
A redemption song will rise
With a sound so full it cracks the sky

Whoa oh ooh we sing allelujah
Whoa oh ooh we sing amen
Hear the sound of the saints as we march on the Zion singing
Allelujah amen
Singing allelujah amen

I will hear the chorus of the angels
A forever symphony of praise
I long to hear the voice of my Savior
And He hears us the sound of the saints

From the lips of those You saved
A redemption song will rise
Every tongue every tribe hear the church Your bride

Whoa oh ooh we sing allelujah 
Whoa oh ooh we sing amen
Hear the sound of the saints as we march on to Zion singing
Allelujah amen 
Singing allelujah amen

Our hearts will rise our songs shall be
Jesus Christ our Savior King forever
Our hearts will rise the saints will sing
Of Jesus Christ our Savior King forever forever

Whoa oh ooh we sing allelujah
Whoa oh ooh we sing amen
Hear the sound of the saints as we march on the Zion singing
Allelujah amen
Singing allelujah amen

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you and you alone were meant to be
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I really love you
Really I do
there's no one casn take the place of you
I've given you my heart

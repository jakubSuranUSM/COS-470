Step up and meet Mr Sunshine well I never had it so good
Once I was lonely and cryin' the blues
And then you came along and put wings on my shoes
Hey look at me wearin' a smile on my face
And just yesterday I thought I never would
Well thanks to the love you brought into my life I never had it so good
Step up and meet Mr Sunshine...

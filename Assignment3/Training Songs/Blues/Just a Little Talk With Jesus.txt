I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in, 
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above, 
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole. 

Now let us, have a little talk with Jesus, 
Let us, tell him all about our troubles, 
He will, hear our faintest cry, 
And he will, answer by and by
Now when you, feel a little pary'are wheel turning, 
And you, know a little fire is burning.
You will, find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. 

Sometimes my path seems drear,without a ray of cheer, 
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way. 

I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears, 
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to m in prayer, he knows my every care, 
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

All your love I miss loving, all your kiss I miss kissing
All your love I miss loving, all your kiss I miss kissing
Before I met you, baby, I didn't know what I was missing

All my love, pretty baby, I have in store for you
All my love, pretty baby, I have in store for you
Well I love you, baby, I know you love me too

Oh, oh, oh, baby, you know I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, you know I love you baby
I love you baby, oh I love you so

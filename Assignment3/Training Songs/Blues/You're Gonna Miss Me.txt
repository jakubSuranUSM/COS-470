Let me tell you people
A low down thing or two
I just can't stand that
Old evil way she do

She gonna miss me, yeah
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby
When I'm dead and gone

Came home this mornin'
She wouldn't let me in
She said, "Go away baby
I got too many friends"

You're gonna miss me, yeah
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby
When I'm dead and gone

Hard to love a woman
When the woman don't love you
She'll treat you so low down 'n' dirty
'Til you won't know what to do

You're gonna miss me, hey
You're gonna miss me baby
You're gonna miss me woman
When I'm dead and gone

Well, bye, bye baby
I hope we meet again
You won't be so evil
When you won't have too many men

You're gonna miss me baby, yeah
You're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me woman
When I'm dead and gone

What a friend we have in Jesus 
All our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry 
Everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit 
Of what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry 
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptation 
Is there trouble anywhere
We should never be discouraged 
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit 
Of what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry 
Everything to God in prayer

Can we find a friend so faithful 
Who will all our sorrow share
Jesus knows our every weakness 
Take it to the Lord in prayer

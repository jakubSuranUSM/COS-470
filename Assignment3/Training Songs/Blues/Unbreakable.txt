When you're a prisoner of hope
There's a fire in your bones
And what I love about it most
Is it don't matter where you go

Yeah we may make a wrong turn
We may stumble or get burned
We may miss the perfect mark
But the very best part

Is Your Love's unbreakable, unmovable
You'll never turn Your back on us
Your heart's unchangeable, unshakable
Living water that will never dry up

Oh Your Love, oh Your Love, oh Your Love is unbreakable

We've been rescued by peace
And promised every need
When it's harder than it seems
I will trust and believe

Your Love's unbreakable, unmovable
You'll never turn Your back on us
Your heart's unchangeable, unshakable
Living water that will never dry up

Oh Your Love, oh Your Love, oh Your Love is unbreakable

From the beginning to the end
One thing remains, one thing remains
Your Love is greater than anything
No height, no depth can separate

(Unbreakable, unchangeable, unmovable)
(Unbreakable, unmovable)

'Cause Your Love's unbreakable, unmovable
You'll never turn Your back on us
Your heart's unchangeable, unshakable
Living water that will never dry up

Your Love's unbreakable, unmovable
You'll never turn Your back on us
Your heart's unchangeable, unshakable
Living water that will never dry up

Oh Your Love, oh Your Love, oh Your Love is unbreakable
Oh Your Love is unbreakable

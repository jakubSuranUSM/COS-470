Oh babe
Little lady dying to find 
The love that she can call her own
She can't be alone 
And that's where she's calling my name, ooh yeah
See I know that she can love me deeply
If she could have the time
To get her look just right
And then maybe she could be mine
[1] - Cause she's just tryin to shine
To find something to get out of life
When will she realize
That the answer is right they're in front of her eyes
She go crazy thinking 'bout things 
She can't afford to have today, heh
She need to come on and love me for me
I've been known to make a way, oh, oh, oh, ooh wee
I know me and I can't love her like that 
I can be different from another man
Cause she's so fine
And somehow or someway
I'm gonna make that girl mine
[Repeat 1 (2x)]
Do you baby?
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, uh-huh
Oh,uh yeah, hey, hey
[Repeat 1 till end]

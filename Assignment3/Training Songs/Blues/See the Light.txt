It doesn't matter where you are
Or what you're doing
You could be somebody's hope, yeah
You really don't have to look that far
To see if you can take the light
That lives within and guide the way that leads to him

Raise your hands, testify
That the world may see the light
Everyone can make a difference
Take your candles, hold 'em high
So that they light the darkest sky
That the world may see the light

All around us everywhere
Are people hurting
Oppertuinties to love
Make the most of every day
Of every morning
That it gives for us to share
Take the time to show you care

Raise your hands, testify
That the world may see the light
Everyone can make a difference
Take your candles, hold 'em high
So that they light the darkest sky
That the world may see the light

Lord we pray that all we say and do
Everyone would see you and only you
Take our lives Lord, and let it be a sign
You can take a broken heart and 
Bring it back to life

Raise your hands, and testify (yeah)
(Raise your hands, take a stand)
(You know that)
We can make a difference

Raise your hands, testify
That the world may see the light
Everyone can make a difference
Take your candles, hold 'em high
So that they light the darkest sky
That the world may see the light

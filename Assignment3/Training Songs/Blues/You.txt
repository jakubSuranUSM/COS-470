I would give up
All the girls
Because I want you
To be in my world

You?re so special
You look so good
I?m glad that I found you
Cause I never thought I would

And all these things make me believe
That we were meant to be
Cause I don?t want to be lonely
Just be my one and only
Cause I want you to see
That all I want is you
To rock me through the night
Tell me it?s okay
When things don?t go so right

I know I have been found
But I still believe
That one day I will wake up,
You?ll be next to me
Cause all I want is you

And maybe I?ve been looking
But I just can?t find
You baby, I?ve gotta have you
I can?t get you off my mind

You, to rock me through the night
Tell me it?s okay
When things don?t go so right

I know I have been found
But I still believe
That one day I will wake up,
You?ll be next to me
Cause all I want is you

To rock me through the night
Tell me it?s okay
When things don?t go so right

I know I have been found
But I still believe
That one day I will wake up,
You?ll be next to me
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Cause all I want is you
Yeah, cause all I want is you.

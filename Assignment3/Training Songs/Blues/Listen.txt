Over the fields
And silently I go
Listen, listen, listen
Over the waves
And into the morrow
Listen, listen, listen

Thunderous sound
Oh, rocking in my footsteps
Echoes resound so I can hear

[Chorus]
Listen, listen listen
To the beat of the drum in you
Listen, listen, listen
To the beat of the drum in you
Pounding, sounding
Voice in the silence of my soul
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen

Over the way through radiant pleasure
Onward I'm bound toward heavenly treasure
Thundurous sound, oh rising in the distance
Echoes resound for all to hear

[Chorus]

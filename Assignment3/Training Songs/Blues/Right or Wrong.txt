Right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Though I wake with the same old regret

All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you

Oh, right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
'Til I wake with that same old regret

All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
And in your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you

All along I knew I'd lose you
Still I prayed, oh yeah that you'd be true
And in your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you

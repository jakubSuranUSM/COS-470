Don't think for a moment
I never felt the pain
You can't imagine
The hurt and the shame
They put the nails through my hands
Pierced my side, please understand
It wasn't easy, but it was worth it

It wasn't easy 
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it

I didn't have to do it
But I did it anyway
'Cause I really love you
So much I took your place
I died for your sins, yes I'm the one
Don't take it lightly, what I've done
It wasn't easy, but it was worth it

Oh, it wasn't easy 
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it

I left my throne, my purpose was the cross
Shed innocent blood, I paid all cost

It was worth it
It wasn't easy 
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it (but it was worth it)
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy but it was worth it

Yeah, (it wasn't easy) It wasn't easy, no, no, no
(It wasn't easy)
(It wasn't easy) but it was worth it 
(But it was worth it) it was worth it, it was worth it, it was worth it, yes it was
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy
It wasn't easy 
But it was worth it
It was worth, ooh
No, it wasn't easy, no, it wasn't easy
But it was worth it

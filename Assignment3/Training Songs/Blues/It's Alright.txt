It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Jesus made it alright
It's alright, it's alright

I thought that it would knock me down
But both feet are standing on the ground
Sticky, sticky glue got me stuck on You
Can't nothing ever come between us

Can't nothing make me let You go
Can't nothing never stop my flow, no, no, no
This is how it's been all these years
After the tears You stepped in and made it alright

I can't help but love You
The way that You take care of me
You stepped in and told me
That I will be alright, alright

This heart, it beats for You
The way that You take care of me
I'm so glad You made it alright

There He goes stepping over the junk
There He goes blocking me
From the bump, thump, thump, if I should fall down
You pick me up, up, up, up, up, ooh

You're the reason I'm alive
You're the reason I survived, You're the reason, ooh
This is how it's been all these years
After the tears, You stepped in and made it alright

I can't help but love You
The way that You take care of me
You stepped in and told me
That I will be alright, alright

This heart, it beats for You
The way that You take care of me
I'm so glad You made it alright

(Rain)
You've been my umbrella
(Wind)
A wall that would cover me

(Fire)
You blow out the flame
(You stepped in)

(Sickness)
You've been my doctor
(Whatever)
Because of You love
I know that it's alright

It's alright, yeah, it's alright
It's alright, girl, it's alright
It's alright, woman, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

I can't help but love You
The way that You take care of me
You stepped in and told me
That I will be alright, alright

This heart, it beats for You
The way that You take care of me
I'm so glad You made it alright

(Rain)
You've been my umbrella
(Wind)
A wall that would cover me

(Fire)
You blow out the flame
(You stepped in)

(Sickness)
You've been my doctor
(Whatever)
Because of You love
I know that it's alright

I can't help but love You
The way that You take care of me
You stepped in and told me
That I will be alright, alright

This heart, it beats for You
The way that You take care of me
I'm so glad You made it alright

Made it alright
Darkness into the light
Pressure off of my life
He made it alright, alright

I'm free to be me
To give Him all the glory
I'm happy as I can be
(He made it)
Alright

I can't help but love You
The way that You take care of me
You stepped in and told me
That I will be alright, alright

This heart, it beats for You
The way that You take care of me
I'm so glad You made it alright

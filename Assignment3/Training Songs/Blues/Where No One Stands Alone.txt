Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart was afraid and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day from here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone
[ guitar ]
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall with great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way...

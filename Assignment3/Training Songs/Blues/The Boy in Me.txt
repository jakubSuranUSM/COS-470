I remember not too long ago
Batting base balls, boxin' with my shadow
Climbin' trees, climbin' walls
Yearned to be six feet tall

If I knew then what I know now
I would've been content to play
And not to rush my hand to take the plough

Oh Jesu-you-us, bring back the boy in me
Put your hand on my hear-eart
And let me run free
Woh-oh-woh Jesu-you-us, my eyes need help to see
And I want to be the boy in me-ee-yeah

I remember it like yesterday
I realise my childhood slipped away
Chasin' plans, chasin' dreams
Silhouettes of what I jused to be

And I know now what I knew then
Not living in the past
But I wish I could go back again

Oh Jesu-you-us, bring back the boy in me (bring back the boy in me)
Put your hand on my hear-eart
And let me run free
Woh-oh-woh Jesu-you-us (bring back the boy in me)
My eyes need help to see (bring back the boy in me)
And I want to be the boy in me

Oh Jesu-you-us, bring back the boy in me (bring back the boy in me)
Put your hand on my hear-eart
And let me run free
Woh-oh-woh Jesus (bring back the boy in me)
My eyes need help to see (bring back the boy in me)
And I want to be the boy in me (bring back the boy in me)
The boy in me (bring back the boy in me)

(Bring back the boy in me)
(Bring back the boy in me)
(Bring back the boy in me)
(Bring back the boy in me)
(Bring back the boy in me) (fade)

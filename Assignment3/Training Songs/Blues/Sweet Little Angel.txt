Got a sweet little angel people [thank you]
I love the way she spreads her wings
I've got a sweet little angel, people
I love the way she spreads her wings
When she spreads her wings around me
I get so hot and everything

You know, I ask my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill
Asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill
You know I ask her for a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my babe should quit me
Oh, I do believe my eyes would die
Oh, if my babe should quit me
Oh, I do believe my eyes would die
Cause if you don't love me me little angel
You will be the reason why

Strength
Oh.. He gives me
Strength to make it, Strength to take it
I've got the strength to know that
Everything will work out fine
Strength to suffer, Strength to conquer
I've got the strength to know the blessings
 of the Lord are mine

[Chorus]
Oh...be strong in the Lord in the power of 
His might
Know in your heart every battle He will 
Fight
Oh......
My strength
(Strength in my darkest hour)
(He is my strong tower)
(Strength to know you're coming soon)
(I know your strength can be renewed)
Be strong, you be strong
I was strengthened in my spirit when
He spoke to me
No more fear, I have peace
Who the Son sets free, I know clearly is
Free indeed

[Chorus]
Oh..
My strength
(Wait on Him, He's coming soon)
(I know your strength can be renewed)
(Strengthen my spirit, my inner man)
(He upholdeth me with His hand)
Oh... He gives me strength
(I can win a soul) I can do it
(I can reach my goal) I can do that, too
(I can keep the victory) I can do it
(For the oil of God's on me) I can do that, too
(If He tells me to wait) I can do it
(I've got the strength to obey) I can do that, too
(I can do it, yeah) I can do it

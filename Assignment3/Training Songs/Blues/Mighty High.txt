[Chorus]
Take the load off your mind, ride the Mighty Glory, 
Listen to my story, and ride the Mighty High. 
Take the load off your mind, ride the Mighty Glory, 
Listen to my story, and ride the Mighty High.

Get up off of your feet. 
Heed what I'm saying, 
Heed what I'm saying, and set your mind at ease. 
You see, I was just man, a lonely man in need, 
God took all my troubles, 
Yes He did, and set me free. 

[Chorus]

Now He led me to discover the fact that I could be, 
You want to Let Him be your leader,
So He can set You free

Now listen to my story, listen to my plea. 
Let Him be your leader, He'll end your misery!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

[Chorus]

Come on and Ride the Mighty High! 
Come on and Ride the Mighty High! 
Come on and Ride the Mighty High!

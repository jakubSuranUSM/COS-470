Troubled in mind, I'm little blue
Bet you, I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry Lee Lewis's, back door step someday

I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind

Well, they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord, they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face

Well, goodbye, baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too
Oh, don't meet you over yonder, baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you

Troubled in mind, when I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
On, on my back door step
Some lowdown, lonesome, mother humpin' day

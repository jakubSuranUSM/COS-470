There you go again
slippin
Doin the things you said you'd never do again
You hear me callin your name,
you're hiding
But I know just where you are
So close but yet so far
Turn around and see the miles you've come
Do you really want to go back
Just to start again
Oh my friend
I can't bear to see you go out that way
Don't make the mistake of letting go
Hold on to me your slippin

Pretending everything is okay
In the front of the crowd-your smilin
But after everyone's gone, you're all along
You're not fine-you're slippin
Take off the mask with me
I see your heart, it's hurting
If you want to stay with me, I need honesty
Don't play with me, You're slippin

Can't make it on your own, stop tryin
I've got the power to keep you from fallin
If I could just have the chance to show you
What real happiness is like
Together we'll win the fight

We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We are goin' down Jordan
We're gonna walk the heavenly road.
We are goin' down Jordan...
I was living my life as an Anglican.
Let me tell you how I changed to a baptiste man.
I was living my life as an Anglican.
Let me tell you how I changed to a baptiste man.
One night I was walking down Frederick Street
Poor and hungry
No shoes on my feet.
I passed the door that said: "Down with sin" !
It was the smell of food that pulled me in.
We are goin' down Jordan...
Well
The leader woke up and shook my hand
Said:"Iwant you to be a holy man"
Right away I made a quick decision
My stomach was groaning for this true religion.
I started over to get some food
When some of my sisters approached me in a mysteric mood.
Duck me in the water for five times
I couldn't see a thing I cause I was almost blind.
We are goin' down Jordan...
You got to moan
Children
Moan
You got to moan
Children
Moan
And if you want to go
To heaven when you die
You got to moan
Children
Moan.

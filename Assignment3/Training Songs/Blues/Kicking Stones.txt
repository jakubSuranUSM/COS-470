I remember sitting in my old man’s truck
Watching him and all the other men
Down on their luck
Standing around a fire
Fighting off the cold
Smokin, swearin, kickin stones

You know hard times
They turn a good man bad
Make him do things
Out of anger
He wish he’d never had
And me and mama
Wed watch him rolling home
Smokin, swearin, kickin stones

Kickin stones
Kickin stones
Down a long
Windin road
There was smoking, swearin, kickin stones

All the dark days
Turn into years
And all the hard times
They sure stole a lot of tears
But there came a time
When I had to move on
From the smoking, swearin, kickin stones

Kickin stones
Kickin stones
Down a long winding road
Brought me here
Brought me home
Where two boys
Broke my home

They come running
They come laughing
When I start singing
They start dancing
We go walking hand in hand
Kickin stones
Kickin stones
Kickin stones

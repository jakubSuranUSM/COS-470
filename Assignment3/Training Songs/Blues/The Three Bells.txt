There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

All the chapel bells were ringing 
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing 
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love"

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing 
Was for Jimmy and his wife

Then the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless, oh Lord this celebration,
May their lives be filled with love"

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away (Bung, bung, bung, bung)

Just a lonely bell was ringing 
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing 
To our good ol' Jimmy Brown (little Jimmy Brown)

And the little congregation 
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation, 
May his soul find the salvation,
Of thy great eternal love"

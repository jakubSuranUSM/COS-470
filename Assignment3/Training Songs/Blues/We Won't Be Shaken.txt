This world has nothing for me
This life is not my own
I know You go before me and I am not alone
This mountain rises higher
The way seems so unclear
But I know that You go with me so I will never fear
I will trust in You

Whatever will come our way
Through fire or pouring rain
No, we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken
Whatever tomorrow brings
Together we'll rise and sing
That we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
No, we won't be shaken

You know my every longing
You've heard my every prayer
You've held me in my weakness 'cause You are always there
So I'll stand in full surrender
It's Your way and not my own
My mind is set on nothing less
Than You and You alone
I will not be moved, oh

Whatever will come our way
Through fire or pouring rain
No, we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken
Whatever tomorrow brings
Together we'll rise and sing
That we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken

We will trust in You
We will not be moved
We will trust in You
And we won't be shaken

We will trust in You
We will not be moved
We will trust in You
Yeah, we won't be shaken

We will trust in You
We will not be moved
We will trust in You
Yeah, we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken

Whatever will come our way
Through fire or pouring rain
No, we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken
Whatever tomorrow brings
Together we'll rise and sing
That we won't be shaken
No, we won't be shaken
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
No, we won't be shaken
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
No, we won't be shaken

i been travellin travellin
don't know where to go
i been everywhere baby
don't want to go back no more
left home when i was a kid
all i ever did was roam
now i want to settle down baby
but i ain't got no happy home
i ride the cart from chicago
never been inside a passenger cart
the rods are all i know

so sorry baby
that i've got to go
so sorry baby
that i've got to go
by this time tomorrow i'll be a long ways down the road

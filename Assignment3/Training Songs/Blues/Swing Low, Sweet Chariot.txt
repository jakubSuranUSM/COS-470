Well I looked over Jordan and what did I see coming for to carry me home
A band of angels a coming after me coming for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot a coming for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot a coming for to carry me home

Well if you get there before I do coming for to carry me home
Tell all of my friends I'm a coming too coming for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot

Well I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down coming for to carry me home
But still my soul is heavenly bound coming for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot
Swing low sweet chariot

Ain't no love for you
You tried to change my mind, but
Ain't no love for you
No love anymore

You played your tricks on me and still hoped I would stay
I was too dumb to realize
That you were just another guy who touched my body
But I know you were lacking size
I'm gonna look around
I can do better than you
Not gonna put me down
You have just faded from my mind

Ain't no love for you
You tried to change my mind, but
Ain't no love for you
No love anymore
Ain't no love for you
I hate your way and I got
No more love for you
It's all over now

You didn't notice that I felt this bad so far
Yeah I got news for you my boy
I'm getting tiered of you so fast
That you'll be wondering
But I just want to be alone
Don't wanna give me up
It's much too late for that now
I'm gonna make you drop
You won't be seeing me no more

Ain't no love for you
You tried to change my mind, but
Ain't no love for you
No love anymore
Ain't no love for you
I hate your way and I got
No more love for you
It's all over now

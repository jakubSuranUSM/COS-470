Show me where the centre is
The centre of your universe
I'll put a hole in it

If I could get in your head
And walk those twisted narrow halls
I could open some doors
Maybe clear the cobwebs, shed some light

Show me where the borders are
The boundaries of your consciousness
I'll reach them and tear them down
And you won't have those limits anymore

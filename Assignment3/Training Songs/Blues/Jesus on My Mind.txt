I see dark clouds coming my way
I know they're gonna try to rain on me
They're almost here but I must say
I'm just as happy as can be

Oh
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Before you know it 
Everything's just fine
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind

I see a giant right in my path
I know he's gonna try to do me in
He's mighty big
But I must say
I'm not the least bit afraid of him

Oh
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind
The situation might look so awful grim
But that's when I just stop and get my mind on Him
Before you know it
Everything's just fine
Just because I've got Jesus on my mind

Oh
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Well
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
On my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
Well
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind
On my mind
Don't you know I've got Jesus on my mind

Turn your head and look down the road
There's a story to be told of home
No one with more love to share
Mom and dad are waiting there, home

I was taught some long ago
To keep your eyes upon the goal, home
When you die, if you live right
You spend each and every night, home

No one with more love to share
I've got love who's waiting there, home
Now when we finish with this song
We'll back up and get along home

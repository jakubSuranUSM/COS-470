Don't be discouraged 
Joy comes in the morning 
Know that God is nigh 
Stand still and look up 
God is going to show up 
He is standing by 

There's healing for your sorrow 
Healing for your pain 
Healing for your spirit 
There's shelter from the rain 
Lord send the healing 
For this we know 
There is a balm in Gilead 
For there's a balm in Gilead 
There is a balm in Gilead 
To heal the soul 

Healing for the soul

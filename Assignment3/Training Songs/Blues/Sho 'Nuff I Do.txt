Well I came home one mornin', found my baby gone 
Well you know I always lived all alone 

Oh, I love her, 
Yes, I love her 
Sho' nuff I do 

First time I saw her, on a Friday night 
I told her baby, I told everything was alright 

Oh, I love her, 
Yes, I love her 
Sho' nuff I do 

I saw her one mornin', she was goin' round the street 
She was shakin' hands with every man she meet 

Oh, I love her, 
Yes, I love her 
Sho' nuff I do 

I raise my hands once again 
Baby if you please, baby please understand 

Oh, I love her, 
Yes, I love her 
Sho' nuff I do

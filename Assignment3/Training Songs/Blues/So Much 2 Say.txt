Gotta make this quick
Gotta make it stick
Better begin
So listen up
Won´t you give an ear
To hear a hip communique
So much 2 say
So little time
(And it flies when you´re having fun, so)

Takin´ it slow
(Only got about a minute)
Ain´t aprapos
(Not too many seconds in it)
And none too spare
A consequence some are unaware of
As many through sequential and historic ages...
Hold...(...have been)...your horses
No time for excess chitter-chat mess (What?)
So much 2 say (Oh!)
So little (time)

If you can be attentive
The talk´ll be preventive
--A cure for cataclysmic strife
The rule is not exemptive
But it is redemptive
--A formula for richer life
So much 2 say
So little...

Time is the indefinitely limitable durational
Within eventuality distinguished from infinity

We hath not much time...
And yet we have
So much 2 say
So much 2 say
So much 2 say...

Meaningful moments
Are far and few between
You gotta seize the meaning
(If you see what I mean)
Say what?

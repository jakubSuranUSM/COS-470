Down life's highway
All alone I've trod, I always put my trust in God
But you'll find out that your silver and gold
Won't pay the price to protect your soul

Oh, I want the Lord to protect my soul
(Oh, I want the Lord, to protect my soul)
To lead me on to the heavens home
(To lead me on, to the heavens home)
My life down here will soon be o'er
(My life down here, will soon be o'er )
(I want the Lord)
And I want the Lord, to protect my soul

There's many a church down life's highway
Where the people sing, rejoice and pray
Why don't you stop at one and join the foll
And ask the Lord, to protect your soul

Oh, I want the Lord to protect my soul
(Oh, I want the Lord, to protect my soul)
To lead me on to the heavens home
(To lead me on, to the heavens home)
My life down here will soon be o'er
(My life down here, will soon be o'er )
(I want the Lord)
And I want the Lord to protect my soul

When this old world is doomed in sin
You'll cry, oh Lord, please let me in
But it'll be to late to make your goal
So ask the Lord, to protect your soul

Oh, I want the Lord to protect my soul
(Oh, I want the Lord, to protect my soul)
To lead me on to the heavens home
(To lead me on, to the heavens home)
My life down here will soon be o'er
(My life down here, will soon be o'er )
(And I want the Lord)
And I want the Lord to protect my soul

Oh, I want the Lord to protect my soul
(Oh, I want the Lord, to protect my soul)
To lead me on to the heavens home
(To lead me on, to the heavens home)
My life down here will soon be o'er
(My life down here, will soon be o'er )
(And I want the Lord)
And I want the Lord to protect my soul, my weary soul

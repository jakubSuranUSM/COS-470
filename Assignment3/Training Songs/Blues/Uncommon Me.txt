Born the one of a kind mold
And original from one second old, oh
Where did I go wrong?
Somebody let me know

Some choices that I made
Are the reason that I'm in this place today
I'm not where I wanna be
I don't recognize me

So I wanna head back in Your hands
Wanna follow Your plans
Don't wanna be lost no more, maybe a long way home
But I won't make a move till You tell me to

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

My reflection kinda had me fooled
I was looking at a man
That I never knew, knew
It was normal to see so I thought it was me

I never meant to change
I'm just glad I realized
Before it was too late, way too late
I need another chance to get back to who I am

So I wanna head back in Your hands
Wanna follow Your plans
Don't wanna be lost no more, maybe a long way home
But I won't make a move till you tell me to

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

There are things that are meant to change
Like the seasons and the time of day
But You made me
In the image of You

So until the end of life
To be like You is my one desire
I don't care, Lord, whatever it takes
I'ma get back to the man You made

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

Oh Lord, it's me again
Please don't let my current circumstances
Turn me into a common man
See I just wanna be, be the uncommon me

Oh, this is my prayer today
Oh, I don't ever wanna change
No mistake the way You made me
Wanna be the uncommon me

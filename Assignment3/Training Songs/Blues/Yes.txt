I said yes to your number and yes to you datin' me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said, "yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me"
But when I say, "no, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)

I was with my crew
You was watchin' me baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I
Said hello to you
You asked me where I'm from
I ask you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you

I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)

I said, "don't call no more"
It is cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face baby
The first time I said no

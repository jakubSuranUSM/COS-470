It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on, all right
It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on, what I say

It's got that soul in it, baby
You can't meet that beat alone, all right
It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking bout that beat, all right

It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking bout that beat, what I say
It's got that soul in it, baby
You can't help but pat your feet, all right

Well, it makes you wiggle, it makes you move
Puts your body in the groove
You want to holler oh, you want to shout
Makes you wanna work it on out

It's got the whole world shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong, all right
It's got the whole world shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong oh, what I say

It's got that soul in it, baby
You can't meet that beat alone

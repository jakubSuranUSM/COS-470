I'm giving you all my heart, and all that is within
I lay it all down for the sake of you my king
I'm giving you my dreams, I'm laying down my rights
I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life

[Chorus]
And I surrender all to you, all to you
And I surrender all to you, all to you

I'm singing you this song, I'm waiting at the cross
And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss
For the sake of knowing you the glory of your name
To know the lasting joy even sharing in your pain

[Chorus]

And I surrender all to you, all to you
And I surrender all to you, all to you

Give it all to you,
And I surrender all to you, all to you
And I surrender all to you, all to you 

And I surrender all to you, all to you
And I surrender all to you, all to you

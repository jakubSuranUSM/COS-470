Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me
Promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me, promise me

Told you before, this was fun, nothing more
Than just messing up the bed (Messing up the bed)
Always been cool knowing me, knowing you
Now it's messing with my head (Messing with my head)

No, I never rush
I never jump
I'm not the type
So look in my eyes

And tell me the truth tonight
I'm reaching for proof 'cause I
Can't mess around with someone like me
If it's safe to love you, then promise me
I'm getting too high to fall
Feel naked and vulnerable
Come lay it down for me honestly
If it's safe to love, love you
Then you should promise me

Nothing to see, it's not you, it's not me
It's just water in my eyes (Water in my eyes, yeah)
Give me a break just to steady my chest
This all hit me by surprise (Hit me by surprise)

And no, I never rush
I never jump
I'm not the type
So look in my eyes (Look in my eyes)

And tell me the truth tonight
I'm reaching for proof 'cause I
Can't mess around with someone like me
If it's safe to love you, then promise me
I'm getting too high to fall
Feel naked and vulnerable
Come lay it down for me honestly
If it's safe to love, love you
Then you should promise me

Promise me you'll never change
Promise you'll catch me if I start to fall like the rain
Promise me we'll find our place in this crazy world
And you'll be there when I call out your name
I promise I got you, promise we'll make it
As long as you promise to fight through the pain
But most of all, need you to promise one thing
Just promise our love, it don't wind up in vain
Promise me you'll never change
Promise you'll catch me if start to fall like the rain
Promise me we'll find our place in this crazy world
And you'll be there when I call out your name
I promise I got you, promise we'll make it
As long as you promise to fight through the pain
Just tell me one thing

Tell me the truth tonight
I'm reaching for proof 'cause I
Can't mess around with someone like me
If it's safe to love you, then promise me
I'm getting too high to fall
Feel naked and vulnerable (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Come lay it down for me honestly (Ah, ah, ah)
If it's safe to love, love you
Then you should promise me

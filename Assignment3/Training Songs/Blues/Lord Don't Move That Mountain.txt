Now Lord don't move my mountain
But give me the strength to climb
And Lord, don't take away my stumbling blocks
But lead me all around

Oh Lord you don't have to move the mountain
But give me the strength to climb
And Lord, don't take away my stumbling blocks
But lead me all around

Lord I don't bother nobody
I try to treat everybody the same
But everytime, I turn my back
They scandalize my name

But oh Jesus
You don't have to move my mountain
But give me the strength to climb
And Lord don't take away my stumbling blocks
But lead me all around

Now when my folks would slay me
These things they will try to do
But Lord, don't touch 'em
But wiithin their heart
Make em give their life to you

Oh Master 
You don't have to move my mountain
But give me the strength to climb
And Lord don't take away my stumbling blocks
But lead me all around

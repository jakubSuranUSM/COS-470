He's the man who'd bleed for me 
Not making a sound or cry 
He suffered as a guilty man 
His innocence was the crime 
While other said come down and save yourself 
He was saving my life 

remember, I will remember 
What He did for me 
Remember, I will remember 
How He died for me 

early Sunday morning came 
The stone had been rolled away 
They stepped inside the empty grave 
Alone in dismay 
They were thinking he was gone 
They were not believing 
Death of the lamb did bring 
Forgiveness and healing 
Why do you seek Him here among the dead? 
He is risen! 

remember, I will remember 
What He did for me 
Remember, I will remember 
How He died for me 

I know it's You who lives inside of me 
I know it's true the peace of mind you bring to me 
Your sacrifice has now set me free...i will always... 

remember, I will remember 
What He did for me 
Remember, I will remember 
How He died for me

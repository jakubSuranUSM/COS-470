Lately I've been winning 
Battles left and right
But even winners can get 
Wounded in the fight
People say that I'm amazing
Strong beyond my years
But they don't see inside of me
I'm hiding all the tears

They don't know that 
I go running home when I fall down
They don't know Who picks me 
Up when no one is around
I drop my sword and cry for just a while
'Cause deep inside this armor
The warrior is a child

Unafraid because His armor is the best
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest
People say that I'm amazing
Never face retreat
But they don't see the enemies
That lay me at His feet

They don't know that I go 
Running home when I fall down
They don't know Who picks me 
Up when no one is around 
I drop my sword and cry for just a while 
'Cause deep inside this armor 
The warrior is a child

They don't know that I go 
Running home when I fall down
They don't know Who picks me 
Up when no one is around
I drop my sword and look up for a smile 
'Cause deep inside this armor
Deep inside this armor
Deep inside this armor
The Warrior is a Child

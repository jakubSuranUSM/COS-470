We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint 
Is just a sinner who fell down,
But we couldn't stay there,
And got up

We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
We fall down
But we get up
For a saint 
Is just a sinner who fell down,
But we couldn't stay there,
And got up

Get back up again 
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
Get back up again
For a saint 
Is just a sinner who fell down
And got up

We don’t need another political uprising
We don’t need another conqueror on the scene
What we need is a special word, that will bond within our hearts
And give us direction from above

We need a word from the Lord
A word from the Lord
Just one word from the Lord
Will move all the doubts

And cause the sun to shine
And give peace of mind
Speak Lord, speak

Lord, we lack Thy wisdom and Thy understanding
Lord, we lack the very love You showed Your Son
Lord, we’ve altered in Thy ways and we stand so much to gain
So give us Your word Lord, speak Lord

We need a word from the Lord
A word from the Lord
Just one word from the Lord
Will move all the doubts

And cause the sun to shine
And give peace of mind
Speak Lord, speak

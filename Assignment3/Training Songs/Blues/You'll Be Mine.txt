You so sweet, you so fine,
How I wish, you was mine.
Honey, I'll be your love,
You'll be mine. You'll be mine. You'll be mine.
You so nice, you so true,
I'm so glad, I love you.
Honey, I'll be your love,
You'll be mine.
You'll be mine.
You'll be mine.
Tell me pretty, pretty baby,
Is you gonna try?
If you said, maybe,
Hang on baby til the day I die.
It is true, I love you.
I don't care, what you do.
Honey, I'll be your love, You'll be mine.
You'll be mine.
You'll be mine.

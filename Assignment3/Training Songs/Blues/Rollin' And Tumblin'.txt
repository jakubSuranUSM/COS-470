Well I'm rollin' I'm tumblin' I'm shooting up all night long
Well I'm rollin' I'm tumblin' just the whole night long
Well I woke up this morning, didn't know right from wrong

Well I'm tumblin' skyscraper, risin' up El Paso town
Well I'm lookin' at skyscraper, that's all that's left of El Paso town
Well don't let nobody tell ya, they're gonna team my playhouse down
I'm gonna get some enchiladas
Come on hot sauce

I say hey, hey, hey bring me the girls galore
I say hey, hey, now go bring me the girls galore
You know that every time I see them they have me on the floor
Salivating, scratch up the lacquer on the table

The chicken man

Well the other side of the world 
Is not so far away as I thought that it was 
As I thought that it was so far away 
But the other side of the world 
Is not so far away 
And the distance just dissolves into the love 
Into the love 

And the New Jerusalem won't be as easy to build 
As I hoped it would be 
As I hoped it would be easy to build 
But the New Jerusalem won't be so easy to build 
There's many bellies to fill and many hearts to free 
Got to set them free 

But I see a people who've learned to walk in faith 
With mercy in their hearts 
And glory on their faces 
And I can see the people 
And I pray it won't be long 
Until Your kingdom comes 

And I know that the gates of hell 
Are not prone to prevail 
As I thought that they were 
As I once thought they were prone to prevail 
But I know that the gates of Hell 
They have been destined to fail 
I see Satan impaled on the sword of the Word 
On the sword of the Word 

And I see the people who have learned to walk in faith 
With mercy in their hearts 
And glory on their faces 
And I can see the people 
And I pray it won't be long 
Until Your kingdom comes 

And I can see the people who have learned to walk in faith 
With mercy in their hearts 
And glory on their faces 
And I can see the people 
And I pray it won't be long 
Until Your kingdom comes 
The other side of the world

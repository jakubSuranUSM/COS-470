When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
[ guitar ]
On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...
[ guitar ]
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...

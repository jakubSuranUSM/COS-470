Oh oh oh swing down, swing swing
Swing down, swing swing
Swing down, swing swing
Swing down, swing swing

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side

Well Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
Thought he heard the rumblin' of the chariot wheel
Not so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
Well I've got a home on the other side

Well now I got a mother in the promised land
Never 'spect to stop until I shake her hand
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side

Well Ezekiel got a ticket, he got on board
Chariot went a bumpin' on down the road
Not so particular 'bout the bumpin' of the road
Just wanted to lay down his heavy load

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side

Our Father 
which art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
thy will be done
And earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day
our daily bread

And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
Forever, Amen

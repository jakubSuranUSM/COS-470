Woh tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you?
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through

Woh tell me darlin', am I right, am I wrong?
I said tell me darlin', am I right, am I wrong?
I'm determined to know, little girl you comin' home
Come on home baby

Now, now listen to me baby, while I hold your hand
Don't want anything from you but be your lovin' man
Now tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you?
Because the words I have to tell you, they will linger through the years
I love you, Honey

Woh tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you?
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through

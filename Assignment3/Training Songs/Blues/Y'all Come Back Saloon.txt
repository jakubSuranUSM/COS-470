She played tambourine with a silver jingle
And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes
But the one most requested by the man she knew as "cowboy"
Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back Saloon.

In a voice soft and trembling, she'd sing her song to cowboy 
As a smoky halo circled round her raven hair 
And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders 
Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer.

Faded love and faded memories
How the linger in her mind
Miles and years played the cowboy
Like and old melody out of tune and out of time.

Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo 
He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love 
Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song 
He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home.

She played tambourine with a silver jingle
And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes
But the one most requested by the man she knew as "cowboy"
Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back Saloon.

She played tambourine with a silver jingle
And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes
But the one most requested by the man she knew as "cowboy"
Was the late night benediction at the Y'all Come Back Saloon.

And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes

When Israel was in Egypt's land
Let my people go
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
Let my people go

Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh, Let my people go

So Moses went to Egypt's land
Let my people go
To make old Pharaoh understand
Let my people go

Thus spake the Lord, bold Moses said,
"Let my people go,
If not, I'll strike your first born dead
"Let my people go"

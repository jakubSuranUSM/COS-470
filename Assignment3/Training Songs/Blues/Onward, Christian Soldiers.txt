Onward, Christian Soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before

Christ the royal Master
Leads against the foe
Forward into battle
See His banners go

Onward, Christian Soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before

Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod

We are not divided
All one body we
One in hope and doctrine
One in charity

Onward, Christian Soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before

Onward, then, ye people
Join our happy throng
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song

Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing

Onward, Christian Soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before
Amen

You can have my heart
You can have my soul
Anything you want
All I need is you
Always on my mind
I spend all my time
Thinking about you
Is all I seem to do

[Chorus:]
Cause there ain't nothing like (love)
You being in (love)
Lord you gave me (love)
Sent from up (above)
Ain't nothing like (love)
So happy in (love)
Feels so good yeah (love)
Always be in (love)

I will never leave
Or never go away from you
I'm aiming to please
Anything you want I'll do
Look me in my eyes
I won't tell no lies
Or play you for a fool
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I love you I love you I love you (yes I do)
I need you I need you I need you (love you)
I love you I love you (ooh)
I need you I need you (yeah)
I love you I need you I love you

I love you I love you I love you

Ain't nothing like
And it feels so good to me
Makes me wanna say 

I just wanna say yeeeaaah
Yeah yeah, oh love love, your my
Love, love, love, love

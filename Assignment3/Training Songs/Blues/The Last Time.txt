Just outside of Fort Worth, Texas, one ninety-nine
There's a rundown strip of night clubs, been there for a long, long time
Get on, now, towards Jacksboro, do you see the neon flashin'?
Hell, man, they got it all there, if you're lookin' for some action

They got the Craps game at the Black Cat, strip tease at the Duce
And over at the Skyline, it's always loud and loose
The winos bummin', the rich folks slummin'
Watch out, man 'cause the cops ain't comin' down to

Jacksboro Highway, Jacksboro Highway
Jacksboro Highway, there's always something goin' down

You better watch your back, boy, you better cover your bets
The further down that road you go, the rougher it's gonna get

Remember standin' at the ? lounge
Broken glass and blood on the ground
Better forget every thing you see
Even if it's murder in the first degree

Out on Jacksboro Highway, Jacksboro Highway
Out on Jacksboro Highway
Always somethin' goin' down

The winos bummin', the rich folks slummin'
Watch out, man 'cause the cops ain't comin' to

Jacksboro Highway, Jacksboro Highway
Jacksboro Highway, there's always something goin' down

You're gonna need somebody on your bond. (2x)
Way after midnight, when Death come a-creepin' in your room
You're gonna need somebody on your bond.
 
I heard the voice of Jesus callin', singin' of his rest.
"If you're lost in the wilderness, come lay up on my breast!"
 
You're gonna need somebody on your bond…
 
When Jesus come to save us, nobody heard his call:
"You can run, but you can't hide;
Who's gonna have your soul?"
 
You're gonna need somebody on your bond…

Deep in the morrow of sin I was sinking
There was no one to guide my way
All my life I was in the shadow till I heard the Savior say
If you give heed to the blessed promise and become a child of mine
When you enter the gates of heaven, you will shine (shine) shine (shine) shine (shine)

Oh, I'm gonna shine (oh, I'm gonna shine)
Like the stars in the morning (in the bright morning)
Many mansions (many mansions) will be mine (will ever be mine)
When I enter (when I enter) the gates of heaven (glory, hallelujah)
I'm gonna shine (hallelujah) I'm gonna shine

Jesus Lord is now my refuge and He leads me by the hand
He will be my steady comfort till I reach the glory land
So press along with the hopes eternal, springing into his heart of mine
When I enter the gates of heaven, I will shine (shine) shine (shine) shine (shine)

Oh, I'm gonna shine (oh, I'm gonna shine)
Like the stars in the morning (in the bright morning)
Many mansions (many mansions) will be mine (will ever be mine)
When I enter (when I enter) the gates of heaven (glory, hallelujah)
I'm gonna shine (hallelujah) I'm gonna shine

We were burdened with many affections often when unsightly things we hear
But we'll all be like our Savior when we reach that home up there
Daily I'll walk in His dear footsteps growing more like Him all the time
When I enter the gates of heaven, I will shine (shine) shine (shine) shine (shine)

Oh, I'm gonna shine (oh, I'm gonna shine)
Like the stars in the morning (in the bright morning)
Many mansions (many mansions) will be mine (will ever be mine)
When I enter (when I enter) the gates of heaven (glory, hallelujah)
I'm gonna shine (hallelujah) I'm gonna shine

What a difference you've made in my life.
What a difference you've made in my life.
You're my sunshine day and night.
Oh, what a difference you've made
In my life.

What a change you have made in my heart.
What a change you have made in my heart.
You replaced all the broken parts.
Oh, what a change you have made
In my heart.

Love to me was just a word in a song
That had been way overused.
But you gave love a meaning,
So i joined in the singing,
That's why i want to spread the news.

What a difference you've made in my life.
What a difference you've made in my life.
You're my sunshine day and night.
Oh, what a difference you've made,
(what a difference you've made,)
What a difference you've made in my life.

What a difference you've made in my life.
What a difference you've made in my life.
You're my sunshine day and night.
What a difference you've made.

Difference you've made in my life.
(you're my sunshine day and night.)
What a difference you've made.

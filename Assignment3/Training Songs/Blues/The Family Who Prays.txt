The family who prays
Will never be parted
Their circle in heaven unbroken shall stand
God will say "enter, my good faithful servants"
The family who prays

Never shall part

Satan has parted fathers and mothers
Filling their hearts with his envy and hate
Heading their pathways down to destruction
Leaving their children like orphans to stray

The family who prays
Will never be parted
Their circle in heaven unbroken shall stand
God will say "enter, my good faithful servants"
The family who prays

Wars and tornadoes are taking our loved ones
Leaving us tearful with sad aching hearts
But we shall join them over the river
For the family who prays
Never shall part

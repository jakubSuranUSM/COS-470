I heard my Saviour calling me he save my soul he set me free
I know he'll never let me fall praise out I heard my Saviour call
I was a sinner traveling on a weary road so far from home
But now sweet heaven is my all praise out I heard my Saviour call
I heard my Saviour calling me

I'm on my way to better land and there I'll join that heavenly band
All through the ages I will sing hosanna is my heavenly king
I heard my Saviour calling me

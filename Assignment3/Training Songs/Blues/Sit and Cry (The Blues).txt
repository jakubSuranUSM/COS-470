Oh, I've got no one to have fun with
Since my baby's love had been done with
Well, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Well, no one to call me sweet names
And my heart is filled with pain
Oh, I only think of you
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Blues found in my bloodstream
Blues found in my home
Blues found in my soul
I got blues all in my bones

Oh, no one to depend on
Since my baby's love had been gone
Oh, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues

Oh yeah
Come here, baby

Oh, no one to depend on
Since my baby's love has been gone
Whoa, I don't know what to do
I sit and cry and sing the blues
I sit and cry and sing the blues

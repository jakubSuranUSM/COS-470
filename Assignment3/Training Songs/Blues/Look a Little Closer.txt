I met an old friend today in the cafe on the hill
To see him after all these years somehow did not seem strange
We laughed and reminisced about the life we used to live
And I could tell at least with him that nothing much had changed
An invitation to the party was all he had to offer
Everyone will be there and all the high you need is free
As he checked the time and he paid the check he said we ought to hurry
And I could tell the one he was talking to .......was the old me...and I said

Look a little closer
Can’t you see that I have changed?
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Look a little closer
I’m not the one I use to be
I gave my heart to Jesus and He gave a brand new life to me

As we began to leave the table and started for the door.
In my heart there was a stirring and I knew there was something more
In his eyes there was an emptiness that only Jesus could fill
It reminded me of how I use to be before I accepted him...
After an awkward moment he broke the silence when he said
I hear about a savior or was it something that I’ve read?
But I don’t need religion there’s nothing to it anyway
I asked him if he wouldn’t mind if we took time to pray
Lord help him look a little closer
Help him feel your loving touch

Remove the blinders and change his heart surround him with your love.
Lord help him look a little closer...help him know that you are near..
Do for him what you have done for me...lord set my brother free!
Jesus makes a difference, He is everything you need

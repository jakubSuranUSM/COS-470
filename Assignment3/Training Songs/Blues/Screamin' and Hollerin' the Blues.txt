Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below 
Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below 
I ever get back home, I won't be back no more 
Oh, my mama's gettin' old, her head is turnin' gray 
My mama's getting old, her head is turnin' gray 
Don't you know it'll break her heart
Know, my livin' this-a way? 
Ever woke up in the mornin', jinx all around your bed? 
Ever woke up in the mornin', jinx all around your bed? 
Children, I know how it is, baby 
Turned my face to the wall and I didn't have a word to say 
No use a-hollerin', no use a-screamin' and cryin' 
No use a-hollerin', no use a-screamin' and cryin' 

For you know you got a home, mama, long as I got mine 
Hey, Lord have mercy on my wicked soul 
Oh, Lord have mercy on my wicked soul 
You know I wouldn't mistreat you
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, for my weight in gold 
Oh, goin' away, baby, don't you wanna go? 
I'm goin' away, mama, don't you wanna go? 
I know you wanna go, baby
Take God to tell when I'll be back here anymore

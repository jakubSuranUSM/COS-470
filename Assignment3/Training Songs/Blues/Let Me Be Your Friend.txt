Many times I've thought about you
Many times I've wondered why
That you'd ever go and leave me
And this heart you taught to cry

Darling wait until I see you
Since you say it is the end
Though I know that you don't love me
Won't you let me be your friend

As I lay upon my pillow
Thinking of you in my dreams
Are you happy with another
I'm so lonesome here it seems

Do you ever think about me
Will you love again someday
Will you ever think my darling
Of this heart you stole away

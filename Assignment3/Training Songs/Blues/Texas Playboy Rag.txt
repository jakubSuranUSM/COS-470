Oh, Mister fiddling man, please strike up the band
And play that Texas playboy rag
There ain't no rhythm aroun' that rides right on down

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag

When I hear that tune you see?
And memories start to roam of my Texas home
When I hear that melody

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

Oh, mister fiddling man, now you understand
Why I love this melody?
To me it's more than a song
It takes me along back to where I long to be

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

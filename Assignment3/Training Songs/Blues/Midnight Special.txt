One day, one day, Sir
I was walking along
I heard that special
Singing a lonesome song

[Chorus]
Oh, let the Midnight Special
Shine her light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine her ever lovin light on me

If you ever go to Houston
You know you better walk right
You know you better not stagger
You know you better not fight
Because the sheriff will just arrest you
You know he'll carry you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
Oh Lord, you're penitentiary bound

[Chorus]
Yonder come little Rosie
How in the world do you know?
I can tell her by her apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
Goes a marchin to the Captain
Says I want my man

[Chorus]
Now here comes jumpin' Judy
I'll tell you how I know
You know, Judy brought jumpin'
To the whole wide world
She brought it in the morning
Just about the break of day
You know, if I ever get to jumpin'
Oh Lord, I'll up and jump away.

[Chorus: x 2]

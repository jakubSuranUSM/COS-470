Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the specter, he has been here, too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived, yes, I have now

I'm going back to the border (going back)
Where my affairs, (going back) my affairs ain't been abused (going back)
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes, I have

Holy Moses, I have been removed
Holy, holy, holy Moses, can we live in peace?
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man standing over there
What's his color, do you care?

Holy, holy, holy, holy Moses, can we live in peace?
Lord, help me now (holy, holy, holy Moses)
Can we live in peace?
Oh, holy Moses, can we live 
I wonder can we, can we, can we live
In peace?

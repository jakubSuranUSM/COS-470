The best thing in life is free
You can give it to the birds an' bees
I need money, I need money
I need money, oh, yes that's what I want

Your love gimme such a thrill
But your love don't pay my bills
I need money, I need money
I need money, oh, yes that's what I want

Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
I need money, I need money
I need money, oh, yes that's what I want

A whole lotta money, a whole lotta money
Whole lotta money, oh, yes that's what I want

Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get, I don't want
I need money, I need money
I need money, oh, that's what I want baby

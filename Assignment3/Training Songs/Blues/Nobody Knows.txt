Nobody knows, Lord, the trouble I've seen;
Lordy, nobody knows my sorrow.
Yes, nobody knows the trouble I've seen;
But glory hallelujah!

Sometimes I'm standing crying,
tears running down my face,
I cry to the Lord have mercy,
help me run this all race.
Oh Lord, I have so many trials,
so many pains and woes,
I'm asking for faith and comfort,
Lord, help me to carry this load.
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen;
Well, no nobody knows but Jesus. well, well,
No nobody knows, oh the trouble, the trouble I've seen;
I'm singing glory, glory glory hallelujah!
No nobody knows, oh the trouble, the trouble I've seen;
Lord, no nobody knows my sorrow.
Well, well well, no nobody knows, you know the trouble,
the trouble I've seen;
I'm singing glory, glory, glory hallelujah!

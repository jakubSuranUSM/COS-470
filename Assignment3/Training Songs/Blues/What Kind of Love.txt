Before I knew your name
You knew my every breath
Before I knew my way
You walked my every step
Before I understood what love could be
You gave yourself to me

[Chrous]
What kind of love is this?
What you would lay down your life
For someone such as me
I'll spend my lifetime wondering why
The beauty of heaven chose here in my heart
To pour out his perfect gift
What kind of love is this?
The times when I forget
I hope that you still can see
How grateful I am
For how you've been to me
'Cause of all the many gifts I have known
Your love stands alone
[Chorus]
The beauty of heaven would pierce his own heart
To give me this perfect gift
What kind of love is this?
What kind of love is this?
What kind of love is this?

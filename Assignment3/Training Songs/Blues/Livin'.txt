[Chorus: x2]
I like
Living this kinda life,
I'm living a blessed life.
I like
Living kinda life,
I'm living a blessed life.

I can speak to mountains, they will be moved.
I can speak to dreams, they will come true.
I can tell my troubles, to get away.
God gave me the power, to make my day.
I'm no longer walking, on sinking sand.
I'm just steady restin', in my Father's Hand.
I'm blessed when I come, and when i go.
Everyday I'm living, living in the overflow.

[Chorus: x3]

[Bridge]
I'm blessed when I come,
and when I go.
Everyday I'm livin',
livin' in the overflow.

[Chorus]

Vamp [Repeat: x2]

I'm living, I'm living
Oh I'm Blessed.
I'm living, I'm living a blessed life.

End

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm living a blessed life.

Oh, oh,oh,oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm living a blessed life.

Way up, way up, way up, way up
High up in Jerusalem when I die,
Way up, way up, way up, way up
High up in Jerusalem when I die,
God knows I'm gonna
Walk in Jerusalem
Talk in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Be in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem when I die, oh
Be in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Shout in Jerusalem
Pray in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem when I die
Uhmm
When I get down to the river
I'm gonna stick my sword in the sand
For I spy the old ship of Zion
She took a many to the Promised Land
Way over in Beulah
Where there ain't no dying there
Where the saints shoutin' victory
Oh, they singin', Lord, everywhere
Way over in Beulah
I hear the voice of friends I've known
They been gone on, gone on to Glory
Well, well a long time ago
They been waiting
They been watching
They been waiting at the beautiful gates
And one day I'm gonna meet them
Oh, I'm gonna sing forever more
Way over in Beulah
I see the captain beckoned to me
Well, he's calling all God's chirrun'
Oh, to meet him on the Promised Land
God knows I'm gonna
Walk in Jerusalem
Talk in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Be in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem when I die, oh yeah
Hey, be in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
Shout in Jerusalem
Sing in Jerusalem
High up, oh, in Jerusalem when I die.

Relent to your useless devices
Retreat, your last line of defense
Regress to the hollow relationships 
That shield you from yourself

Relent to your fortress of skin
Retreat, anything to distract
Regress to your hands 
As they cover your eyes
But you can't help 
But peek through the cracks

Cold, hard dread swelling into parallels
To everything you ever 
Said you'd repel
Once with a glimpse now
Second your guess it's
Tough to admit and 
Admit and admit that

Your fate's still undecided
Return
Return
Return

Relent, to the terror 
That distances you
Retreat, to the habitual grins
Regress to the deception, 
Quiet and tame
Once was transformed, 
Now exactly the same
Remember when you nearly 
Plunged into embrace?
But instead you've chosen 
To keep it all at bay

Return to yourself

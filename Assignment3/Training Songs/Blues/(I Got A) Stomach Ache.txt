Come on, ooh, come on
Come on, baby
Ooh, I got a stomach ache

When you rock, you know you look so good
And when you walk, baby, you know you look so good
And every time you walk down the street
You wave outside to the blind

Met a fisherman on the curb
He said, "Hey where you going?"
I said, "Look here man, I'm going my way"
He said, "Lookie look, boy, ain't that a crying shame"
I said, why he said, he said, "I got a stomach ache"

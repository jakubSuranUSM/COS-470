They told you that you couldn't do it 'cause you washed up
Ain't like them bad girls, said you should get your sauce up
But I got this plan and you might not understand
I'ma go hard as I can, and I'm gon' be the boss of it
Just watch me do this, put no limits only swagger on it
Walk right up to the front where I belong and brag on it
Go to the top, I'ma give it all I got
Might take a lot but we ain't gon' ever stop

I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want and I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
I'm powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable, nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
No, no, no, no, no, 'cause I'm unstoppable

I dream about it, I go get it, that's how I do it
Not in the stars, I'm not lucky I just pray through it
Fall on my face and I make mistakes but I
Don't let it break me 'cause I'm still on my way

I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want and I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
I'm powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable, nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
No, no, no, no, no, 'cause I'm unstoppable

Come what may, I rest in His safety
Winds may blow, the waves won't overtake me
Tears in my eyes but I'm still gon' survive
'Cause He's incredible, He's powerful
And I will rise from the bottom 'cause He said so

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
I'm powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable, nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
No, no, no, no, no, 'cause I'm unstoppable

Nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
Fall, no-oh
I'm unstoppable

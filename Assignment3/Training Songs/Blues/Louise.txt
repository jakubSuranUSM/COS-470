Louise, sweetest girl I know
Louise, sure the sweetest girl I know
Come all the way from St. Louis, way down to the gulf of Mexico
Louise, baby you better hurry home
Louise, you better hurry home
Somebody fishin' in your pond, Louise since you been gone
Louise, Louise come on home
Louise, Louise come on home
They catchin' your precious, and then grindin' up the bone

It was a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
It was a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not a thing there could I find
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not a thing there could I find

I dreamed I went out with an angel, and had a good time
I dreamed I was satisfied, and nothin' to worry my mind
But that was just a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not an angel could I find

I dreamed I played policy, and played the horses too
I dreamed I win so much money, I didn't know what to do
But that was just a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not a penny there could I find

Dreamed I was in the White House, sittin' in the President's chair
I dreamed he's shaking my hand, and he said, "Bill, I'm so glad you're here"
But that was just a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not a chair there could I find

I dreamed I got married, and started me a family
I dreamed I had ten children, and they all looked just like me
But that was just a dream, Lord, what a dream I had on my mind!
Now, and when I woke up, baby, not a child there looked like mine

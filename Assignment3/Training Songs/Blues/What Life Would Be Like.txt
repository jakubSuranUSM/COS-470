I wish I was more of a man, have you ever felt that way'
And if I had to tell you the truth I'm afraid I'd have to say
That after all I've done and failed to do
I feel like less than I was meant to be

What if I could fix myself maybe then I could get free'
I could try to be somebody else who's much better off than me
But I need to remember this
That it's when I'm at my weakest I can clearly see

He made the lame walk and the dumb talk
And He opened blinded eyes to see
That the sun rises on His time
Yet He knows our deepest desperate need

And the world waits while His heart aches
To realize the dream
I wonder what life would be like
If we let Jesus live through you and me

What if you could see yourself through another pair of eyes'
What if you could hear the truth instead of old familiar lies'
And what if you could feel inside the power of the hand
That made the universe, you'd realize'

He made the lame walk and the dumb talk
And He opened blinded eyes to see
That the sun rises on His time
Yet He knows our deepest desperate need

And the world waits while His heart aches
To realize the dream
I wonder what life would be like
If we let Jesus live through you and me, yeah, yeah

All our hearts they burn within us
All our lives we've longed for more
So let us lay our lives
Before the one who gave His life for us

He made the lame walk and the dumb talk
He opened blinded eyes to see
That the sun rises on His time
Yet He knows our deepest desperate need

And the world waits while His heart aches
To realize the dream
I wonder what life would be like
If we let Jesus live through you and me, yeah, yeah
Let him live through you and me, yeah, say yeah, yeah

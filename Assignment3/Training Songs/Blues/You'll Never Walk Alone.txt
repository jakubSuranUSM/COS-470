When you walk through the storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
For at the end of a storm it's a golden ray
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the rain
Walk on through the storm
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

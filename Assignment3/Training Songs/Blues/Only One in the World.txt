Tonight was quiet, I watch you sleep
The room is dark, I hear you breathe.
I wish this moment never ends, never ends.

Your breath is music to my soul,
A rhythm that I’ve come to know.
I can’t resist, I touch your skin
Again and again.

I hold you close, up close, I know you’re my baby.
I feel your heart so strong against mine.
I don’t wanna be anywhere but right beside you here,
You make me feel like

I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world tonight, tonight.

Inside these walls is all I need
Me loving you, you loving me.
I’d give it all to stay like this, just like this.

I hold you close, up close, I know you’re my baby.
I feel your heart so strong against mine.
I don’t wanna be anywhere but right beside you here,
You make me feel like

I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world tonight.

If time would disappear and leave me safe right here
Right here, with you tonight.

I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world.

I hold you close, up close, I know you’re my baby.
I feel your heart so strong against mine.
And I don’t wanna be anywhere but right beside you here,
You make me feel like

I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world,
I’m the only one in the world tonight, tonight.

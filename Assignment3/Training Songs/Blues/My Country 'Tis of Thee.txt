My country, 'tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrims' pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring

My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above

Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong

Our fathers' God to Thee
Author of liberty
To thee we sing
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light
Protect us by thy might
Great God, our King

Our glorious land today
'Neath education's sway
Soars upward still
It's hills of learning fair
Whose bounties all may share
Behold them everywhere
On vale and hill

Thy safeguard, liberty
The school shall ever be
Our nation's pride
No tyrant hand shall smite
While with encircling might
All here are taught the right
With truth allied

Beneath Heaven's gracious will
The stars of progress still
Our course do sway
In unity sublime
To broader heights we climb
Triumphant over time
God speeds our way

Grand birthright of our sires
Our altars and our fires
Keep we still pure
Our starry flag unfurled
The hope of all the world
In peace and light impearled
God hold secure

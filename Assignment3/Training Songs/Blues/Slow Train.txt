It's a slow train
But it's moving on
I've got my ticket 
Don't don't pass me by
If I don't get on ooh
I'll break right down and cry
Only got a one a life
To live on this earth
Oh get me there
Won't you please
Conductor sir
It's a slow train
But it's moving on
Now everybody got a ticket
You you and me
It's up to you to catch the ride
That's how its got to be
Everyone oh yeah
Has to prove he's a man
Oh make it easy
On yourself
'Cause there's no helping hand
It's a slow train
But it's moving on

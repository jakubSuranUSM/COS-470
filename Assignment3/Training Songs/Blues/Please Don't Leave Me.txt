Please don't leave me anymore, darling
Partings are so sad my dear
For you're the only one that I love, darling
Can't you tell that I'm sincere?

We were happy once, my dear
Happy as could be
And now that we have things patched up
Just stay here with me

And love me as you have before, darling
For I'm so in love with you

Please don't leave me anymore, darling
Partings are so sad, my dear
For you're the only one that I love, darling
Can't you tell that I'm sincere?

We were happy once, my dear
Happy as could be
Now that we have things patched up
Just stay here with me

And love me as you have before, darling
For I'm so in love with you

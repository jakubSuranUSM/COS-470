Lord, here I am again
In search of a quiet place to rest
I'm walking in a wilderness
That always puts me to the test
My hope is in the truth
I have no strength apart from You
So when I need to hear Your voice
I have a choice

These steps of life I'll climb
To reach a home to call it mine
On holy ground right by Your side
Is where I need to be
A higher place
Sierra
A higher place
Sierra
A higher place

The miles, they stretch ahead
They twist and turn and never end
Shaking my confidence
'Til I run to Your arms again
That's when, You lift me up
In sweet communion's holy cup
I see the valleys down below
I won't let go

Strolling past temptation avenue, 
You hear so many voices calling you; 
Maybe you'll step in and take a quick look around. 
Try to walk through it, 
And you're gonna fall down. 

[CHORUS ]
You've gotta run away, 
Turn around and run the other way; 
Don't even look in the direction 
of a thought you should not entertain. 
You've gotta run away, 
It's a prison that is calling your name; 
You just can't win if you play, 
So run away. 
There comes a time when you must stand and fight, 
When the darkness tries to overcome the light; 
But sin that is dressed up in the color of gray, 
Is only defeated 
When we run away. 

(chorus) 

Don't put yourself in that position 
Where sin can make it's proposition; 
And if you find that you have fallen, 
You gotta get up, get ready to run 
Next time sin comes calling, calling. 
(
chorus)

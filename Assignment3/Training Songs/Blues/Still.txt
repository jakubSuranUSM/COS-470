I can't make it without you

It's been a long time since we've been together
So much has happened some good some sad
But yet our love with time become strong
So let us sing the ride we've had

It's been a long time
Such a long time
Though a long time some things never change

I'm still addicted, still lost without you
I still celebrate heaven still I live for
Still in the mean time, still for always
And still iou, still!

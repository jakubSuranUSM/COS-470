My sister's little boy came in the kitchen one evening 
While she was fixing supper 
And he handed her a piece paper he had been writing on 
And after wiping her hands on an apron 
She took it in her hands and read it 
And this is what it said: 

For mowing the yard five dollars 
And for making up my own bed this week one dollar 
For going to the store fifty cents 
And playing with little brother while you went shopping twenty five cents 
Taking out the trash one dollar 
And for getting a good report card five dollars 
And for raking the yard two dollars 
Total owed one fourteen seventy five

Well she looked at him standing there and expecting 
And a thousand memories flashed through her mind 
So she picked up pen and turned the paper over and this is what she wrote: 

For the nine months I carried you holding you inside me $ no charge 
For the nights I sat up with doctored you and prayed for you $ no charge 
For the time and tears and the costs through the years 
There is no charge 
When you add it all up the full cost of my love is $ no charge 

For the nights filled with grey 
And the worries ahead 
For the advice and the knowledge 
And the costs of your college 
There is no charge 
For the toys, school, and clothes 
And for wiping your nose 
There's no charge son 
When you add it all the full cost of my love is no charge 

Well you know when I think about that 
I think about the day that Jesus went out to Calvary and gave his life as a ransom for me 
When I think on the words "if any man be in Christ he's a new creature" 
I like to think about the very minute that he shed his blood 
My debt was paid in full 
And I want you to know today 
When you add it all up 
The full cost of real love is no charge

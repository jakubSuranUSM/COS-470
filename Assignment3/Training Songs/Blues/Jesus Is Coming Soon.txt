Jesus is coming soon 
Jesus is coming soon 
He tells us in his word to watch and pray
Jesus is coming soon 
Jesus is coming soon 
Be ready for he may come today
We'll all meet together in the garden some sweet day
If we read and spread the gospel news
So let's all be ready so we can enter in
Oh don't be late he may take you today
Jesus is coming soon...

Don't take his love for granted 
As you travel through this world
Be thankful for the likes he's given you
So walk the straight and narrow 
For God's love is the way
Lift your eyes for heaven 
And pray every day
Jesus is coming soon...
Be ready for he may come today

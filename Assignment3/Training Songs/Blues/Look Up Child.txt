Where are You now
When darkness seems to win?
Where are You now
When the world is crumbling?

Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy

Where are You now (where are You?)
When all I feel is doubt?
Oh, where are You now
When I can't figure it out?

Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up

You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know You're in control
Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know You're in control

Oh I, I-I-I, I hear You say
I hear You say

Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, oh-oh-oooh
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child, ayy
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child, oh-ooh, ooh, oh-oooh
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child, ayy
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
(I hear You say, You say, You say) 
I hear You, I hear You calling my name, oh (Look up child, ayy)
I hear You say, You say, You say (look up, look up)
Look up child, ayy
Look up child, ayy
Look up

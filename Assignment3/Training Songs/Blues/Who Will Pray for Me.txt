My rough and rowdy ways have kept me from his grace
But there's hope for me 'cause momma?s faith is strong
She's the only hope I've got to keep me in touch with God
But who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?

who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?
Who'll ask His forgiveness from then on?
Who'll care enough to talk to God?
When her pleading voice has stopped
Who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?

I guess, I'm just too weak to fall down on my knees
And talk to God like a man on my own
He knows who I am, she mentions me to him
But who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?

who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?
Who'll ask His forgiveness from then on?
Who'll care enough to talk to God?
When her pleading voice has stopped
Who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?
Who'll pray for me when momma?s gone?

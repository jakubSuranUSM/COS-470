There's joy over there
There's joy over there
There's joy over there
There's joy on the other side

There's peace over there
There's peace over there
There's peace over there
There's peace on the other side

I've got joy in the morning
Joy at night
Joy in the evening
There's joy on the other side

I've got joy in the morning
Joy at night
Joy in the evening
There's joy on the other side

I'm gonna say hello to my mother
Say hello to my mother
I'm gonna say hello to your mother
Because there's joy on the other side

No more dying there
No more dying there
No more crying there
Because there's joy on the other side

Oh, I've got joy I the morning
Joy at night
Joy in the evening
There's joy on the other side

Joy in the morning
Joy at night
Joy in the evening
There's joy on the other side

Oh, I've got joy in the morning
Joy at night
Joy in the evening
There's joy on the other side

I've got joy in the morning
Joy at night
Joy I the evening
There's joy on the other side

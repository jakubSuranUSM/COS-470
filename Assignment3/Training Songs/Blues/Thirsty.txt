[Repeat: x2]
My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing
Father I'm thirsty
Thirsty for you

[Repeat: x2]
My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing
Father I'm thirsty
Thirsty for you

Let me drink from the fountain 
That never shall run dry
The fountain of everlasting life

For if I drink of your water I will never thirst again
Let me draw from your living well

[Repeat: x2]
My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you 

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing

Father I'm thirsty 
Thirsty for your touch
Please cleanse my heart, Lord
 
I am thirsty
I need you like never before 
Cleanse my heart, Lord

I am thirsty
Lord I can't make it without you Jesus 
I tried it on my own 

I am thirsty
Breathe in me Lord, breathe in me Lord
I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty for you
Oh Oh Lord, yeah

This time it's not my friends nor my family
But it's me, it's me oh Lord
It's me, It's me oh Lord
Oh

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus.
Sing his mercy and his grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be.
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory!

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be.
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory!

Onward to the prize before us.
Soon his beauty we'll behold.
Soon the pearly gates will open.
We shall tread the streets of gold.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be.
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory!

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be.
When we all see Jesus,
We will sing and shout the victor—
Sing and shout the victor—
Sing and shout the victory!

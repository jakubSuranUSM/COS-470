Jesus (Jesus) 
Oh Jesus (Jesus) 
Oh how I love 
Calling your name 
Oooh Jesus (Jesus) 
Oh sweet Jesus 
Everyday your name is the same 

When my troubles surround me 
And I didn't have to dispare 
Lord you told me 
That you'll be right there 

It seems like all my problems 
Had just begun 
I didn't have to worry no more 
They were already won. 

Ooh Jesus (Jesus) 
Oh Jesus 
Oh how I love 
Calling your name 
Ooh Jesus 
Oh sweet Jesus 
Oh every day 

Your name is the same 
Yeah

I remember the time 
When I felt so all alone 
When I needed you Jesus 
All I had to do was call 

Sometimes in the morning 
Sometimes late at night 
But when I got off my knees Jesus 
Everything was alright 

Oooo oh Jesus 
My rose of Sharon 
My lily of the valley 
Calling your name 

Oooh Jesus Jesus my mountain mover 
Everyday 
Your name is the same 
Ooh Jesus nobody but Jesus 
Oh how I love I love I love 
To call on your holy name 
Jesus nobody but Jesus 
Everyday hallalujea your name is the same 
My mother Jesus my fathers Jesus 
I love calling your name 
Ooh come on Jesus 
Ooh come on Jesus 
Ooh come on Jesus 
Nobody but Jesus

Well I have sung "Amazing Grace" since I was just a child
And I've joined in on "It Is Well" at least a thousand times
And singin' "Jesus Loves Me" is a precious memory
I remember when "Just As I Am" first brought me to my knees
Oh, but here I am surrounded by some things I can't explain
But the truth is still the truth in the moments my heart breaks

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
I can still sing it now

Oh, it's not always easy to join those melodies
But how sweetly they remind me of what I still believe
A voice that's raised in times like these may be the truest praise
'Cause I've never been forsaken and that will never change

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
I can still sing it now

"Great Is Thy Faithfulness"
A mighty fortress is our God
"Standing on the Promises"
"Blessed Assurance" Jesus is my...

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
If I could sing it then
Well I can still sing it now
How sweet the sound that saved a wretch just like me

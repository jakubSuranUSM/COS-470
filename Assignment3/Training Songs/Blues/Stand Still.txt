The Father has a plan. Though it's hard to see it now 
You f eel you're walking all alone. But He is there no doubt 
When the storm around you rages, And you're tossed to and fro 
When you're f aced with life's decisions, Not sure which way to go 

Stand still and let God move, 
Standing still is hard to do 
When you f eel you have reached the end, 
He'll make a way for you 
Stand still and let God move 

When the enemy surrounds you, And the walls are closing in 
When the tide is swiftly rising, And you wonder where He's been 
Friend, there never was a moment, That His arms weren't reaching out 
You can rest assured and be secure, God is moving right now 

When you feel you have reached the end, He'll make a way for you 
Stand still and let God move 
The answer will come, But only in His time 

Stand still and let God move, Stand still and let God move

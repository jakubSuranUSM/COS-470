I'm goin' back, back to the shoeshine stand
I'm goin' back, back to the shoeshine stand
I'll be singin' the blues while I shine your shoes
I'm a soul fixin' man

Been on the road both day and night
I heard mama callin'
Heard my papa cry

I'm goin' back, back to the shoeshine stand
I'll be singin' the blues while I shine your shoes
I'm a soul fixin' man

Heard Mama talkin', Papa too
They said, "Come on home boy
You got to shine them shoes"

I'm goin' back, back to the shoeshine stand
I'll be singin' the blues while I shine your shoes
I'm a soul fixin' man

I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back
I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back
I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back

I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back
I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back
I'm goin' back, I'm goin' back
Got to get back to the shoeshine

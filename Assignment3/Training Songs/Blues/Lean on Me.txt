[Bono] Oooooohhh
[Kirk] This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
[R. Kelly] Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
[Kirk] You can lean on me

[R. Kelly] There's a man (oh yes)
Standing on the corner
He has no home
He has no food
And his blue skies are gone (yes it is)
Can't you hear him cryin' out

[Crystal Lewis] And there's a girl
Searching for a father and a friend
Praying that the storm someday will end
But instead of walking away
Open up your heart and say

[Choir] I am here
You don't have to worry
I can see...
[Kirk] I can see your tears
[Choir] ....your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
[Kirk] Yes I will
[Choir] Friends are there to catch you when you fall
[Kirk] Here's my shoulder
[Choir] Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me

[Kirk] halleluia
[Mary J. Blige] Ooooohhhhh
[Kirk] Listen

[Mary J. Blige] Oh, there's a child
Who is sick and begging to be free
But there is no cure for his disease
He looks up to his mother and

[Choir] As she hold (holds), his hand (hand)
[Bono] Prayin' that someday
The sun will shine again
[Kirk] And the pain?
[Choir] And the pain will end
[Kirk] Pain will end....Come on

A single heart
Groaning for its own creation
Then gave itself to suffer in our place
A living sacrifice of one
Would be the price for all

Enough for every nation
Every walk of man
Enough for all our shame
Enough for all the darkness in our land

[Chorus]
With one love
Heaven changed the world forever
And no heart will ever be the same
One hope was born to save us
And one maker lives to make us stronger
With one love

A single soul
Pouring out itself to heaven
Can bridge the gap to reach eternity
If every one of us will join
Together, love as one, there'd be

Enough to reach the nations
To fill these city streets
Enough to make a difference
Enough to feed the hunger and the need

[Chorus]

Enough to reach the nations
To fill these city streets
Enough to make a difference
Enough to feed the hunger and the need

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Well, you ask me if I'm happy
If I have sweet peace within
If I'm worried 'bout tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end

Well, I'm satisfied with my Jesus
When He knocks I let Him in
He'll go with me through the valley
For I know He is my friend

Satisfied, satisfied
Well, no troubles can ever get me down
Oh, when my eyes are closed in death
With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied, hmm

Hmm, if my friends they all forsake me
And they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow

Oh, it won't matter over yonder
When I reach that other side
For I'm a gonna sit down by my Jesus
Satisfied, I'm satisfied

Satisfied, satisfied

Oh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don't let my soul be lost

Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
For he's the one that'll guide me on
All through my life I've been a sinner
Now I'm right with God so I'm travelling home

Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
Oh, praise the Lord I'm ready to go

My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
That beautiful land I'm going to see

Precious mem'ries unseen angels sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me as the sacred past unfold
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold

As I travel on life's pathway know not what the years may hold
And as I ponder hope grows fonder precious mem'ries flood my soul
Precious mem'ries how they linger

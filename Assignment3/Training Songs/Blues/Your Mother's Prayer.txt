You lived through the crash on the highway it's a miracle you're here today
You say Lady Luck was ridin' with you but it might be that your mother prayed
You were saved in the war over yonder
You say your good luck charm pulled you through
But the only reason that you might be living
Is your mother just might have been prayin' for you
Don't give Lady Luck all of the credit it might have been your mother's prayer
She holds the key to the powers in heaven and pleads with your Maker up there
Now you call yourself lucky and believe that it's true
But your mother just might have been prayin' for you
[ steel ]
Don't give Lady Luck...

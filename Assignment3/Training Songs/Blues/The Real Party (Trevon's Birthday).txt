Somebody up in here tonight
Needs a breakthrough
And you came here looking
Expecting for something to happen for you
Well I come to let you know that if you
Get your shout and your dance
Make some noise move your feet and your hands
While you've got a chance, you ought to get up and give god
All you can
Don't you know you've
got the victory
I came to lift him
higher
We love you
Let the people say
hallelujah

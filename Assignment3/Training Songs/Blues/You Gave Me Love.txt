You gave me time when no one gave me time of day,
You looked deep inside while the rest of the world looked away,
You smiled at me when there were just frowns everywhere,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

[Chorus:]
That's why I call You Saviour ..... that's why I call You Friend,
You touched my heart ..... You touched my soul,
And helped me start all over again,
That's why I love You, Jesus ..... that's why I'll always care,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

You gave me laughter after I cried all my tears,
You heard my dreams while the rest of the world closed it's ears,
I looked in Your eyes, and I found the tenderness there,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

[Chorus:]
That's why I call You Saviour ..... that's why I call You Friend,
You touched my heart ..... You touched my soul,
And helped me start all over again.
That's why I love You, Jesus ..... that's why I'll always care,
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer.

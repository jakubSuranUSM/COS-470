I remember them so clearly mom and dad loved them so dearly
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where I learned about salvation from the book of revelations
In an arbor by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
It was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Many times I have departed from the way of life I started
In an arbor by the side of the road
But each time the devil's caught me I remembered what they taught me
In brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the side of the road
Where the mighty light of God's great mercy flowed
There was prayin' shoutin' singin' till the country side was ringin'
Brush arbors by the side of the road
Old brush arbors by the of the road

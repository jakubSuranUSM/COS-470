{Project Pat} 
Don't you get mad at me cause your broad den chose-a
Glad to see the truck when I pull up
Gon' pop the lock big botty hoppin' in now
Dark skin, gold teeth mann you know we in now
I know that's your baby momma 
I know that it hurts some
You know when we get together 
I'm gon' let her twurk some
Let her hit the blunt some
No time of the month some
Pull out a condom
Then I make a run some
Freaky as she wanna be
I'ma let her gonna be
She can be herself anytime that she get wit' me
Backseat action riverside relaxin'
Flick out the DVD that ass I'm waxin'
I'ma keep it real wit' cha
I'ma let her deal wit' cha
I don't fight over hoes I'ma let the steel hit cha
All on the town talkin' bad tryna down me
In your heart really sad boy you betta crown me

[Chorus]
I, I choose you baby
Oh I, I choose you baby

(Project Pat)
You fuckin' wit' my lut' 
When you lay on yo' child support
She alwayz give me half of that on my car note
Hundred spoke rims sittin' slick on the Escalade
Couldna been the king of heart mane baby got me paid
First of the year tax time keep me wit' a smile
I'ma  get a extra couple g's claimin' yo' child
Yeah that's why I know
This is the world that we living in 
Don't get hot, stya about my game, and quit meddling
Pedalin' in these weed sacks
Nigga give me feedback
I don't need no stems dog
You can get the seeds back
Always been a hustla
That's were shit is diggin'
Do just like I tell her to
And wit' no renigen
Her lips and my brain
We can go a long way
On her arm my name
Got that for her birthday
I say that's the only way I gotta have it
Branded for life
All the ass I'ma grab it

[Chorus]

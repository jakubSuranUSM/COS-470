I wish that I had given everything I had to give
I don’t wanna be without you
You’re the only reason that I live
I never realized how much I missed you
Until the day you were gone gone gone

I should have told you (I love you)
Showed you (I love you)
Took every chance to stand behind you
And now you’re gone and all I can do is

Doubleback
We gotta doubleback
Found myself again in the wrong direction
GPS love is a lost connection
Now I gotta turn around
Doubleback
If I’m gonna find your affection
Then I need to doubleback

I really could have treated you better
I could’ve been a better man
But I had with you was precious
I really didn’t understand
I just couldn’t see it coming
You started makin other plans, other plans

I should have told you (I love you)
Showed you (I love you)
Took everything to stand behind you
And now you’re gone and all I can do is

Doubleback
Gotta doubleback
Found myself again in the wrong direction
GPS love is a lost connection
Now I gotta turn around
Doubleback
If I’m gonna find your affection
Then I need to doubleback

No one else I’ve seen is good enough
So I finally reach the point of giving up
I don’t know what else to do
Could it be another you?
So until then I gotta…

Doubleback
Gotta find my way back
Found myself again in the wrong direction
GPS love is a lost connection
Now I gotta do…
Doubleback
If I’m gonna find your affection
Then I need to doubleback

Doubleback
Gotta doubleback
Found myself again in the wrong direction
GPS love is a lost connection
Now I gotta turn around
Doubleback
If I’m gonna find your affection
Then I need to doubleback

Doubleback
A way to find myself
Found myself again in the wrong direction
GPS love is a lost connection
Now I gotta turn around
Doubleback
If I’m gonna find your affection
Then I need to doubleback

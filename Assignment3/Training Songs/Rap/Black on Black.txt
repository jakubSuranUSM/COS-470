‘Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up, (damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain’t even one way, nigga (two niggas most)
Stay down until you come up, nigga
Four songs, nigga, (Blood Money, let’s go)

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(Stay on back, nigga, do what you gotta do)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how real niggas pull a rebound back
See I never came back in that black on black

Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I’ma tell him ain’t nothin’ left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin’ straight
All they gotta do it wait, tell a nigga I’m a Chef
How you think a nigga went and got that race?
Could have went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it’s about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put 10 karats on my daughter ear, f*ck it
She deserved every rock, I done sold out in public
Do anythin’ for my Destiny’s Child
She a Beyoncé, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin’ like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain’t no Kirby Puckett
Let the shade fear clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin’
Cause I’m black on black like, yeah
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the throttle, she can’t even find the gears

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
(Talk to ‘em, homie)
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
(Stay down until you come up)
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back
(How you bounce back nigga, nigga do what?)
See I never came back in that black on black

Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don’t fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma’s kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin’ my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I’m ’bout to put on
And now I’m ’bout to kill these niggas
So you might not see me ’til tomorrow’
’til I get it, then my palms start itchin’
Soon I hit the block, then my bong gone missin’
See, I’m ’bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I’m goin’ there to find me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I’m goin’ there to sell him a pigeon
My parents told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said it is then a lil’ more

If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, “Now, Oprah got a billion dollars
And you know what near her”
Type of shit I tell myself while starin’ in the mirror
What!

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
(Talk to ‘em, homie)
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
(Stay down until you come up)

Met man named George, straight drop, no whippin’
Electric off, everything’s boilin’ in the fridge
I ain’t bathed in a week, I was smellin’ like pickles
Street showin’ no pities, still gettin’ to the business
? break it down, sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
When flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don’t even know a nigga livin’ how I’m livin’
I don’t even know how many times I’ve been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call …
Bought two things, had the third one off issue
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that’s a nino
Eighteen sales, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the …
Real rap talk, keep it real, don’t believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I’ma leave you
Dirks cuts the water ‘fore they kick a nigga dope
Try to flush it down the toilet but the dope just flow
Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin’, but I ain’t the one to panic
Double homicide, broad day, that’s my jacket
Tried to bird feed, cut through on my jacket
And I take change, I’m a serve when they askin’
Come from out of town, I’ma test, none or less

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back
(How you bounce back nigga, nigga do what?)
See I never came back in that black on black

It’s okay, daddy, I’m not scared
I know baby, the rest of the world is

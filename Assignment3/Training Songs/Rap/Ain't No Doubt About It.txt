Game, drop top bent-a-ley (bentley)
Gucci belt buckle fresh out of italy
I'm a baller, literally
Haters are swine flu, you're killing me
I'm looking down on you from where the ceiling be
Me and my niggas swarm on you like the killer bees
My chick riding shotgun, billie jean
Half belizian half from the phillipines
Niggas energy, is like they got the heaves
Sick of me think they wanna nine milly me
But they ain't for rat tat tat-tat tat
My bullets sing like their registered to ascap
Need I say more out in singapore
Everything I do exotic I don't need to bring a broad
Mr. red carpet, I don't do awards
You want it I done it 5 million on tour, offshore.

I just wanna touch ya, girl
The way you move (the way you move)
Oh you make me love it, yeah
Cause lady, you cool! 

That's the way (that's the way)
You can move it baby (you can move it baby)

To come join our table (to come join our table)
Don't you worry (don't you worry)

Cuz you're the star (you're the star)
Everybody looking at you (said looking at you)

Yo pharrell, I'm ri-ri-diculous
So so sick with it
You can call me cancer but I don't smoke cigarettes
Come through in a 'rarri same color as licorice
If I ain't with her my b**ch like "this my nigga's s**t"
Haters beware, I can see clear
Through the lens on these black louis vs yeah
Something 'bout mary, make me wanna blow up
And b got the dizzy like for me when I show up
Whip game crazy I call it all kinda
You a big fish to swim the piranhas
Used to call me "dope game" when I came from jose
Now I play the roosevelt and I cop rose
Niggas be like yo you lease that? no way! 
California slim license plate st. tropez
Eat at a table full of toupees, lobsters
Been a mobster since the two-way holla

I just wanna touch ya, girl
The way you move (the way you move)
Oh you make me love it, yeah
'Cause lady, you cool

That's the way (that's the way)
You can move it baby (you can move it baby)

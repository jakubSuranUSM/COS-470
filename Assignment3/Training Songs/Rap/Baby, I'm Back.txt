Ho
Yeah
Said everything that you want me to I'll do it
Tell me what the word is already [x4]

[Chorus]
Don't look no farther!
Baby I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you (anything you want me to, I'll do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (I'll be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)

Now I'm back in a flesh
Feelin' so blessed, back in your corner suga', suga' don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, I'm back in your zone
Baby I'm back in your vibe, now I cant be denied I can lie I'm on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side andale arriba
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be your keeper
These words comin' out the speaker, true love is off the meter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now im home,
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone,
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome,
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone,
Let my spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet,
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so saucy and I get respect,
You don't have to look no farther, you dealin' with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

[Chorus]

I was gone for a minute, (ooh)
I was gone for a minute, (ooh)
I was gone for a minute, (ooh)
I was gone for a minute, (ooh)
Now I'm back let me hit it (ooh)
Now I'm back let me hit it (ooh)
Now I'm back let me hit it (ooh)
Now I'm back let me hit it (ooh)

[Chorus x2]

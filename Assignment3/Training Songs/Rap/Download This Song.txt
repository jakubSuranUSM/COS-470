It's 2006, the consumer's still pissed 
Won't take it anymore so I'm writing a list 
Don't try to resist this paradigm shift 

The music revolution cannot be dismissed 
$18.98 Iggy pop CD 
What if I can get it from my sister for free? 
It's all about marketing Clive Davis see 

If fans buy the shirt then they get the mp3 
Music was a product now it is a service 
Major record labels why are you trying to hurt us 
Epic's up in my face like don't steal out songs Lars 

While Sony sells the burners that are burning CD-are's 
So Warner EMI hear me clearly 
Universal music, update your circuitry 
They sue little kids downloading hit songs 

They think that makes sense 
When they know that it's wrong 

Hey Mr. Record man the joke's on you 
Running your label like it was 1992 
Hey Mr. record man your system can't compete 
It's the new artist model file transfer complete

I know I'm rhyming fast but the message is clear 
You don't need a million dollars to launch a career 
If your style is unique and you practice what you preach 
Minor threat and jello both have things to teach 

I've got G5 production concept videos 
Touring with a laptop rocking packed shows 
The old-school major deal it makes no sense 
Indentured servitude the costs are too immense 

Their finger's in the dam but the crack keeps on growing 
Can't sell bottled water when it's freely flowing 
Record sales slipping down 8 percent 
Increased download sales you can't prevent 

Satellite radio and video games 
Changed the terrain it will never be the same 
Did you know in ten years labels won't exist? 
Goodbye DVDs and compact disks 

Hey mister record man what's wrong with you 
Still living off your catalog from 1982 
Hey Mr. record man your system can't compete 
It's the new artist model file transfer complete

You know we just wanted a level playing field. 
You've overcharged us for music for years and now we're just trying to find a fair balance. 
I hate to say it but... welcome to the future

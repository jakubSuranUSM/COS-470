Got goals to be big as a billboard
Hit the tours sell out venues like the Fillmore
I had to change on them had to detour
Had to switch roads
Niggaz had switched rolls
Start winning and you know how the rest goes
I wonder what these niggaz really mad for
Looking for much more
Looking for no rivals
Made a Lic and niggaz acting spiteful
That’s alright though, all part of the cycle
Tell the truth I ain’t worried about your likes bro
No
I am do me on daily my nigga keep living my life
I’m living it right, rise and grind
Thank god I'm alive
So much I survived
So much I survived
I cut all my ties
I’m done wit you guys
I left you behind
Can’t come on this side
When you speak I’ll never reply
To the girls who curved me before man
Look at me now
All up and down on your playlist
Put a heart next to this I’m your favorite
On my big Sean, nigga finally famous
If you confused about it let me explain it
I’m big as billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as a billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as a billboard
Big as a billboard
About to blow in this bitch like a four-five
I'm at they're neck with the flow, call it bow tie
No Chains nor drake but no lie
You're good with the slice I want the whole pie
I never miss I always hit the bulls eye
See I keep it jumping up in here like a low ride
Flow lit, stay lit like a bon fire
Time spent, getting bent, making more fire
Liquor got my head spinning like four tires
Games A1 Man I got the sauce now
Cause we are nothing alike
My goal is to slaughter whatever's in sight
Put karats on my daughter off verses I write
Cause I bang on a beat whatever the type
I'm up, way up, yea I'm so high
Game time
Steph Curry I’m the high light
For the record competition give them cyanide
Only driven by my vision, y’all so blind
I got goals reach
Off the speech
Get that house on the beach
Take care of my mama
look out for my sisters
keep bringing that heat to the streets
Stay lit like it’s Christmas
Give bands to my misses
That makes the whole circle complete
Wake up, and get money, repeat
Don’t believe, soon enough you will see
I’m big as billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as a billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as billboard
Big as a billboard
I’m big as a billboard
Big as a billboard

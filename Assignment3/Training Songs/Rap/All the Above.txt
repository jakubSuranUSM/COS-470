Yo Pain you ready? (yeah-ayy)
Mane lets lock and load (yeah)
Just Blaze, Nard turn me up (yeah, yeah-ayy)
B, I think we got one, here we go (yeah)

Tell me what do you see (see)
When you looking at me (whoa, whoa, whoa)
On a mission to be (be)
What I'm destined to be (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor and all the above (ayy)
All the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, unstoppable Maino)

Listen, really what do you see (see)
When you lookin' at me (me)
See me come up from nothin'
To me livin' my dreams
I done been to the bottom
I done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich
Headed straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block
Look how I rep for the hood
I get nothing but love now when I come through the hood
Gettin' this fortune and fame
Money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
'Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look and you can tell that I am destined for greatness

Tell me what do you see (see)
When you looking at me (me, whoa, whoa, whoa)
On a mission to be (be)
What I'm destined to be (be, whoa, whoa, ayy-ayy, whoa)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor and all the above (ayy)
All the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

It's easy to hate
It's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand
Y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nikes
Picture you livin' in my life
Picture you stuck in a cell
Picture you wastin' your life
Picture you facin' a charge
Picture you beatin' the odds
Picture you willin' to bleed
Picture you wearin' the scars
Thank you for makin' me struggle
Thank you for makin' me grind
I perfected my hustle
Tell me the world ain't mine
You been seein' me lately
I'm a miracle, baby
I refuse to lose
This is what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father
Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't
I envision Obama
I envision them diamonds
I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect
All my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it
That I'm makin' this statement
Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

Tell me what do you see (see)
When you looking at me (whoa, whoa, whoa)
On a mission to be (be)
What I'm destined to be (whoa, whoa, ayy-ayy, whoa)
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor and all the above (ayy)
All the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

Now we can go to the spot (spot) or if I'm out on the block (block)
I hustle hard cause its all the same (they know, they know)
And you know that grind don't stop (stop)
Just 'cause I rose to the top (top)
And everybody knows my name (they know, they know)
Hey, still grindin' (still grindin')
Still hustlin' (still hustlin')
No more pain (no more pain)
No more sufferin' (no more sufferin')
From my lady's and my shorties and my thugs
Get that cash and the shine and the love
And all the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

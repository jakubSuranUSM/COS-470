Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl

You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin off lookin bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl

Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like purr
She loves to stir it up purr
I can hear her purring up
Cause she's the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (ohh)

We can meet up at the hutter house for the tiki
So stand by like a booty pass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass

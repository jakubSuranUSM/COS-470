Yeah, yeah
We gon' stay trippy for life man
Yeah, I'm 'bout to take your girl

Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to the big face hundreds, just bounce
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

I love the way she slow dance
She make me throw more bands
Grabbing ass with both hands
She in luv with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick
I was thinking different
Clap that ass, light that blunt
Baby, let's get ignant
She strips for the G's, break cash lightly
She got double Ds, and ain't shit free
Came with my goon but I'm leaving with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain't finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while I'm getting high
As propellers on a helicopter
Let's do it again, me, you and your friend
We don't even need a room, gimme head up in my Benz
Where my double cup, time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can't afford to f*ck

Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to the big face hundreds, just bounce
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

Hands is on her you know what
'Cause bands'll make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast
My pants be on that too much lust
And I'm bout whatever baby
Take a photo, I'm looking good
And these breezes are so beneath you
Understand you're misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
All of these pussy niggas, only under influenced
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack
And a bucket but we nothing but pack
Bald-headed scallywag, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those

Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to the big face hundreds, just bounce
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy,
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do Montana line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna f*ck, I just found a replacement
Feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna f*ck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike
But I keep these girls in check
Working for that money
Bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat
Bounce it sweat

Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to the big face hundreds
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her goI can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
First time I saw her
Thought that I would lose my mind
Just had to have her
I had to have her (all mine)
The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling I ever had before
You give the kind of lovin'
Make a brother wanna come for more and more
She's the one I adore
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
Just can't believe it
She's got me open all the time
She knows I'm never leavin' 
Can't be wrong
Cause it feels so right
The way you make me feel 
Is like no other feeling I ever had before
You give the kind of lovin
make a brother wanna come for more and more
She's the one I adore
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
No one can do what you do
When you do what you do to me
And I can't believe 
Can it be that it's me
That you're feelin
It's ecstasy
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
No one can do what you do
When you do what you do to me
And I can't believe 
Can it be that it's me
That you're feelinIt's ecstasy
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

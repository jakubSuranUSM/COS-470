Yeah, yeah, one more time
Seventies s***, got the lean
S*** is leanin', it's to the left
It's just leanin', dribblin'
Like he gave it a bag of dugy
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash
It's just leanin' and s***, seventies (The Lord Tariq)

Ah-yo I been through many places
Done many things
Seen the eyes of many faces
From New York to Texas

To the faces on Rolexes
Not a racist or sexist
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz
Nothin' less than a Lexus

Bubble eye with V-V-S's
Trouble minds and troubled times
Stacks, I'm tryin' to double mine
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines

Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin' for this n**** to try
I'm bubblin' mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time

I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defendin my son's rhymes
'Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence

Bustin' off I'm runnin' into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
'Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it

Puffin with my family, my b****, my money or my music
Makin' killas say he's too sick when he do s***
But I'm on some new s***, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new b****
And the s*** do kick, word

[Chorus: Lord Tariq]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Fat Joe and my man
On the East side of town wit a blunt in my hand
Soundview, Monroe, Castle Hill, Bronx Dale
Rose Dale, Academy, Lafeyette, Cozy

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Fat Joe and my man
On the East side of town wit a blunt in my hand
Commonwealth, Theriott, White Plains, Randall
Omestead, Bointain, Colgate, Watson

[Fat Joe]
Play rap loud, politicin' business
Wit the crack crowd, fact file, funny how I never seen a rat smile
My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now
But still could blaow any n**** actin' irate now

F***in with me's worse than duckin' police
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin' your niece
Murderin' beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys

Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin' up things
And takin' over City Hall

My s*** is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, n****s is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broken negative nore

Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest
Real Bronx n****s that's heartless that spark s***
Regardless, n****s shouldn't have tried that s***
That's why mothaf***as gotta die like this

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Gunz my man
On the South side of town wit a brick in my hand
Forest, Melrose, McKinley, the boulevard, Washington
Patterson, Courtland

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Gunz my man
On the South side of town wit a brick in my hand
Brook Ave., Cryprus, Hunt's Point, Saint John, Little Vil.
Trinity, Creston, Walton

[Peter Gunz]
I had a dream that a team had a scheme keepin' the beam
On my head like a infrared he's dead, but I redeem
Now I'm back n****, it's on n****
Run n****, Joe n****, Pun n****, Lord n****

Gunz motherf***ers ain't really knowin' I'm really goin'
And feelin' I'm showin that my main objective is Benz and Lexuses
Cop Rolexeses, get bigot in Texases
So fierce b****es they be callin' me exorcist

Far from a devil, I'm God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun
Got beef with this n**** with hits and s***
Chips and s***, run around here switchin' s***

Tellin' people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin' school you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless

The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a glock nineteen, and I'm a pop like steam
Tryin' to stop me and mine from eatin' you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads n**** to stop you from leakin'

And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin'
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth
That's me, that's it, buryin' s***, right in the earth

[Chorus: Peter Gunz]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Big Pun and my man
On the West side of town with a gun in my hand
174th, Vyse Ave, Bryant, Longfellow, Hoe Ave
Crotona Park, Boston Road, Prospect

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Big Pun and my man
On the West side of town with a gun in my hand
Lambert, Tremont, Concousre, Jerome Ave.
3rd Ave, Ogden, Webster, Simpson

[Big Punisher]
Yo we the Bronx avengers
Partners in these peelan adventures
We the monster n****s in your dreams that be stompin ya senseless
So be consciencious, if you march against us I'ma call my gentas 

And you nondescripters gonna have to face the consequences
We large placentas and you small change
Hittin' n****s long range, wrong gauge
Leavin' n****s John Blaze

Crime pays if you nice with yours
The Bronx is where you fight for yours
Ice your cross, slice cigars, light cigars
All day, wylin' freestylin' in the hallways

Broadway ain't got more drama than Watson off of Colgate
This ain't the old days shorties was bustin', ain't no f***in jokin'
Some n**** called me a German, I had to bust him open
My brothers holdin' me down with heavy artillery

Chevies and Willies be chilin' in front of every facility
Joey from Trinity so he raps Forrest
You could save the best for us
But you still better place your bets on us

The Bronx baby, where the best get blown
My restin zone, come on n**** test your throne
I'm blessed with chrome, so leave your vest at home
I don't aim for the chest b****, strictly necks and domes

[Chorus: Big Punisher]
I'm on the Cross Bronx with uh three of my mens
Runnin up in your spot with a mack in my hand
Pure energy, checkmate, Blue Thunder, Obsession
Pulp Fiction, Purple Rain, Punisher, South side

I'm on the Cross Bronx with uh three of my mens
Runnin' up in your spot with a mack in my hand
A-T-L, L-A, Chicago, Detroit, D-see, Carolinas, Boston, N-why

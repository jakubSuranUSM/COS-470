Ay what you blind, need some glasses to see?
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me,
What you blind, need some glasses to see?
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
What you blind, need some glasses to see?

Yea I'm hot nigga, I say I'm burnin' up
Me the rare nigga, I'm still turnin' up
Add the fire it to the flame
Who mention Bankhead didn't say my name?
I'm Mr. Got 'Em 'fore the L-O
Learned the recipe, gave it to the other fellow
Ask Pony, Marlowe, Hero
He know, I know, she know, he know
I been had cash
Oh lord, I done found my swag
Nigga say he from the Westside
Well god damn! It must be two sides

[Chorus]
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
Well mention Bankhead, they're not lyin' it's me,
What you blind, need some glasses to see?
Done done it all, done done it all, I've done it all, I've done it all
What you blind, need some glasses to see?

They call me the done done, done done it all
The cars, done drove 'em all
L.A.! We to' down the mall
These bitches, we done fucked them all
Yea cause I'm that nigga
Bankhead, who's that nigga?
"Units in Da City," I done flipped them
Da rep! Shit, I done killed them
Bumpin' system, see the shit my way
Got them CD's and them thangs on the highway
We get it in 'til six in the mornin'
Chiver St., Bowen Homes, me and my homies!

[Chorus]

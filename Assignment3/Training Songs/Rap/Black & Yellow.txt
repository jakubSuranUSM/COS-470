Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Erry'thing I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Reppin' my town when you see me you know erry'thing
Black and yellow

I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in

Black stripe, yellow paint,
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't (hoes ain't)
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede insides, my engine roaring
It's the big boy, you know what I payed for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game I'm balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Erry'thing I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Reppin' my town when you see me you know erry'thing
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow

Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
Them bitches love me 'cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
This ain't for one night I'm shining all weak hoe.
I'm sipping Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up 'cause every nigga that I'm with tailored

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Erry'thing I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Reppin' my town when you see me you know erry'thing
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow

Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crown underneath them clouds, can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna f*ck with them cats,
Smoke weed, count stacks,
Get fly, take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high,
She wantin' she feel that,
Convertible drop fill, eighty seven the top peeled, back

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Yeah yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Reppin' my town when you see me you know erry'thing
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow

Uh
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Erry'thing I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Reppin' my town when you see me you know erry'thing
Black and yellow

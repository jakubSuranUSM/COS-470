Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the

You dig in; you're dug in now; you cry for help
But can someone really year?
You're pulling; you're tugging, trying to save yourself
But no one seems to care
When you walk the world alone, whoa, whoa
Will you find your way back home?

[Chorus]
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon
Don't mess with the dragon

You're falling; you're crawling, searching in the dark
Your heart is full of fear
You're crying; you're tryin', want to find yourself
But you can't look in the mirror
When you walk that lonesome road, whoa, whoa
Don't forget your heart's your home

[Chorus]

When you walk that lonesome road
Don't forget your heart's your home

[Chorus: x2]

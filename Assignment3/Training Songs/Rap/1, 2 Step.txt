This beat is
Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic, this beat goes right through my chest
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party
Grab somebody, work ya body, work ya body
Let me see you one, two step

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

This beat is
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
Jazze made it
So retarded, top-charted, ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No I can't control myself
Now let me do my one, two step

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

We gon' drop it like this

It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drops, our bodies will go
So swing it over here Mr. DJ
And we will, we will, rock you

It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drops, our bodies will go
So swing it over here Mr. DJ
And we will, we will, rock you

I shake it like Jello, make the boys say "hello"
Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's
But they ain't got nothin' on me
Because I'm five foot two, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophisticated fun, I eat fillet Mignon
And I'm nice and young, best believe I'm number one

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

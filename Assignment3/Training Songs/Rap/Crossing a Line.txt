They'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
'Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

I don't know how to warn you for what I'm gonna say
'Cause you're holding so tight to what I'm taking away
I got demons inside me so I'm faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them or I give them a voice

And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
Holding back things you don't know
And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
You're not gonna like where this goes

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
'Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

It's not about status, we know it never was
'Cause what good is the kingdom when you’re missing the love
This is not a goodbye now, I'm not going away
No I don’t have the answers but I do have the faith

And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
Holding back things you don't know
And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
You're not gonna like where this goes
No

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
'Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
'Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

So I'm crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

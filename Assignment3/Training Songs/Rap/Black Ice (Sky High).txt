Do you ever see that stuff that be
When it get cold that is that s*** you can't see?
See that s*** happens sometimes.
Yep, black ice.

Now you know and I know I done bumped every hole in the wall
Did catch that phone call most of why'all did admit 
Thought it was tall, Gipp flipped like a dip
Slipped fell on some black ice
Did you think twice, homeslice come in he went
Satisfied got bars can't s***
Meetin' coast to coast yeah ( ? ) man do-si-dos 
Too many coming close coz

[Chorus]
Touched what I never touched before, seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

Circulate like a Sunday paper
Capers caught tony tone with cheap flicks
Good pick pay hard watch the hard turn sideways
Pick the tale for real sale for the who lose cash
Flesh keep your life for now
Feeling good and warm with the rug tight
Thirty five degrees nippy tonight, don't forget the chapstick
Lips dry quick when the jack out make you want to cut out
Take the slack out some people black out 
Hibernating to a cave blackout

[Chorus: x2]

I been in it for the past few days
Tighter than fades I know my plays now can I rap? can I adapt?
Now really sure yeah who's that looking over the shoulders
Of those writing dreams
Feening for the taste of menthol missed class stayed in the hall
Looking for a squeeze play better yet a holiday
Stayed away from the pyramid board game 
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang, cash before fame

Sky high [Repeat: x10]

Now who done stepped in? the n**** the be	-I-g the secret weapon boy
Slicker that black ice throwing them flows like rice at weddings
So quick flexing, you speaking sum' that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like icebergs, chryslers and buicks
Some n****s ain't on their jobs so them suckers tend to lose it
Abuse their privileges now their whole village is shot to pieces
'Cause n****s be biting that same stupid s*** I mean that feces
Boy don't beat me if you ain't got no work 
I'm strictly about these verses like the ones you hear at church boy
Search boy, talking about your dough and punk like lurch boy
Every time I heard your rhyming like a f***ing jerk boy, simp, yeah!

Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me you eardrum 
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns 
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain but what pertains 
To cocaine it a thing that rain
See summer roll around n****s all about change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived 
The temperature dives
November just died
December's alive 
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual way to bring home the bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own taking me all wrong 
We've all indulged in the bulge of these no-nos
No you ain't solo, its cause lower levels you can go
Take sun people put them in the snow

[Chorus]

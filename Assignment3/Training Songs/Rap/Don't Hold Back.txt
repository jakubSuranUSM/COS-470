[Hook x2]
Don't hold back, baby throw it don't front it
Give it to me good like you friend, girl touch it
Run it, straight down the center like a sprinter
5-4-3-2-1 enter

[Verse 1]
They talks a lot about ya vibe, ya makin' me feel ya inner thoughts
MJG, want to dip in the sauce
Knock it off, fantasy scenes of me and you
Plenty other women that dream of being you
Cute face, good attitude, small waist
Girl ya number one in the race the rest chase
Baby first of all ya look at me close searchin' for lines
Thankin' that you can get in my mind, thankin' that I'm
A lightweight, left fly straight in one wait
Lay it down over the world in one date
Pure P-I-M-P-I-N-G
Both of us grown no need to pretend we
Ain't prepared for the houses with the marble floors
Three staircases with the antique doors
All day, valet hit the place your ride
With thirty-five rooms just in case you tired
Amazon, let's have a marathon in the bedroom
Come stout, 6'3" with any leg room
I know what to do if ya know how to act
Now say it to yourself baby don't hold back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
As we begin ya perfume clouds the room, Soft Rain
Sprinkle down homie massage away the pain
I been standin' here scopin' ya girl from across the club
Suave House outtas for real, show us some love
We can peel  off into the night and do it right
And leave two streaks in the street and we outta sight
Space-age, still don't nothin' move but the hits
So baby shake it to the front and the back right quick
Last call for alcohol, what do you prefer (Baby I don't drink)
Well that's cool what about hers
Swang it over to me sugar I don't need no slack
Let me see it, let me see it girl don't hold back

[Hook x2]

I see you lookin' at the ice
Thankin' bout a way to be my wife
Dollars signs in ya eyes, not tonight, skirt tight
To the hip, bend over bust a whole to the slip
Now mesmerized gauging at the lips on the tip, of that thang
Shaved down lookin' high hay
Freaky thoughts travel through my brain all day
Listen baby, when I saw you in that mini-skirt
It made me want to really go to work
Wonderin' could I get them legs straight up in the sky
Lay down and watch the silly fed blaze roll by
You and I kick back when we through gettin' high
Intoxicated folks don't lie, don't try
I can picture us posted in the bed buck wild
Humpin' like it's goin' outta style, stay awhile
Now smile, naw better yet say ahh
Do it in the back of a car like a star

[Hook x4]

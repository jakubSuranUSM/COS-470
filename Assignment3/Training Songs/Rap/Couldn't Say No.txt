Damn 
All I could do 
All I could say 
Is that I'm sorry 
(Sorry sorry sorry sorry) 

Listen 
I know I really messed up this time 
But just here me out 

Oh you should've shown me a little more love 
(But still there ain't no reason) 
For me to walk out on this thing called "us" 
(But you keep giving me the feeling) 
That I should throw the towel in 
('Cause we can't keep each other, no way) 
'Cause me out in front of my friends 
Not giving a damn how I feel 

I don't even want 
(I don't wanna be the guy that tricks around on you) 
And you don't even know 
(How many times I asked your momma what I should do) 
And it's my fault 
(And it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through) 
I got bad news that I gotta break to you 
I know you gonna act a fool but I gotta let her know 

I had a girlfriend pinned up (hey) 
In between that week we split up (cause you need to know) 
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no 
(I think it's time you know) 
Every time I see you wit her (ooh) 
I think of how I was pickin' them legs up 
It's a shame when a man just can't say no 
Oh, yeah 

Now see what is done is done 
And I realize now ain't no takin' it back 
I committed the worst crime I could ever do to my girl 
(Damn, she ain't never goin' forgive me) 
Every time that you threw a fit 
My two-way she hits saying, 
"I'm on the way" 
Putting it down, in and out, 
Up and down anyway I'd say 
But baby girl I really didn't wanna 

(I don't wanna be the guy that tricks around you) 
You don't even know 
(How many times I asked your momma what I should do) 
She didn't even know 
(And it's my fault I'm in a situation I may not get through) 
I got some real bad news to tell you 
And I know you gonna act a fool 
She really needs to know 

I had a girlfriend pinned up 
In between that week we split up 
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no 
(It's gonna be bad but I gotta let her know) 
Every time I see you wit her 
I think of how I was pickin' them legs up 
It's a shame when a man just can't say no 
(I couldn't say no) 

And it's bad 
(I done messed up) 
Gave up all I had with you 
Just for a fast 
(Piece of pleasure) 
That could never replace you 
One more chance (one more chance) 
(It's a treasure) 
Girl you made mistakes too 
Girl

I had a girlfriend pinned up 
In between that week we split up 
(Remember when we broke up) 
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no (I couldn't say no) 
(And every time I see you with her) 
Every time I see you wit her 
I think of how I was pickin' them legs up (I think of how I was gettin' up in her) 
It's a shame when a man just can't say no 
(It's a shame, oh, it's a shame, oh) 

I had a girlfriend pinned up (I had a girlfriend pinned up) 
In between that week we split up (in between that week we split up) 
It was lookin' so good I couldn't say no (ooh, no no) 
(Say no, babe) 
Everytime I see you wit her (ooh)
I think of how I was pickin' them legs up (ooh)
It's a shame when a man just can't say no 
(I couldn't say no, I couldn't say no) 

(Ah I just couldn't say no)

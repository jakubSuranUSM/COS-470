Hit it
This is a broadcast from the universe 
Supersonic bionic, metaphor, megahertz 
I'm on a mission with the mic in the holster 
Spread the love from coast to coast 
Hereâ??s the dose of editing:
My only enemy's inside of me 
Trying a lot of me but my degree's in the anatomy 
Of thoughts as they rotate, like planets round the sun 
I observe them one by one, like a scientist 
Once again kids we be breaking the rules 
Taking the school, the MC's playing the fool 
What do you do, when all eyes are looking at you 
For the answers to impossible questions that ain't true 
That when I fall back 
Recognize magnetic attraction pulling light down to this physical fraction 
Makes me human, that why I humanize 
I came to make it break and make it equalize 

There's no need to run, staring at the sun 
There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

I'm back from sabbatical, this mathematical magical stealth with the microphone 
Seeing knowledge as self 
Itâ??s here to elevate, regulate, or discombobulate 
The weight of illegitimate fate now. 
Whatever the time, remember the mind's not the body 
It's probably my last time but maybe not 'cause I've 
Got a new style, it's what's up 
Pain of the people means pop don't stop 
Ladies and gents this is schoolhouse rock 
Changing the plot, hip-hop with me or not? 
Ripping apart, its stereotypical art 
Holding me back 'cause rap's not afraid of the dark 
Jimi Hendrix was a hero to most 
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host 
All the unknowns, they were heroes to most 
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host, equalize 

There's no need to run, staring at the sun 
There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.
Gimme a beat 
Gimme a beat 

There's no need to run, staring at the sun 
There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

I'm walking down this open road 
I've got to shake this heave load 
I know there's things in life I'll never see 'cause heaven only knows 
Take this heavy load 
Down this open road

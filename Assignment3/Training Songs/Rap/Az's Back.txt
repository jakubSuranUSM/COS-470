(Verse 1)
Everybody want to take chills
It's either that or nigga want to play sales
Try tha floor when I bound wit a fake bill
When I see seven niggas I don't say shit
Motherfucker like me try to stay big
Who you got laying down in a "stay there"
If a whips I can do it any kind of way
From this A to the Crist to the Chardonnay
Through the belt, from tha pipe to the parkway
Everything a nigga touch is like park-ay
Get it right, bill nigga let it light
From the stand though, two mil, living life
And this chicks from the streets better get it tight
Their pussy laid out better get it right
So where we at now

[Chorus: 2.5x]
AZ's back (come on)
(Where we at now?)
Where we at?
(Talk to me, talk to me now)
AZ's back
(Ga,Ga,Ga,Ga)
Where we at?
(What you want, what you want)
AZ's back
(What you like, what you like from me now)

(Verse 2)
No niggas from both coast 
Everybody built pride but they hold toast
No joke, f*ck co' but a whole load
Lone cones got bombs and .04s
'91 put cha stickers wit the low cone
Who's down getting' blunted and tryin' blow smoke
Take notes, love cars only one side
Always talk to blend in wit the young guys
Hustle up, play the block til the sunrise
F*ck wit us, bro', f*ck you just gon' die
That's that, where are the real hard haters at?
Only who jack niggas sittin' back
Hit the broad, let 'em ball, nigga play it all
want to walk wit cha guns, nigga make the call
Where we at now?

[Chorus]
AZ's back (come on)
(Where we at now?)
Where we at?
(Talk to me, talk to me now)
AZ's back
(Ga,Ga,Ga,Ga)
Where we at?
(What you want, what you want)
AZ's back
(What you like, what you like from me now)

(Verse 3)
Run away from the funny style,
Cut those fake niggas wit tha funny smile
Every hater in the game want to run me out
Everybody that's broke want to run their mouth
What that be about the time nigga see the cloud
Won't stop til every last dollar, we even now
Give it all back, bills in a small stack
Stack a whole lotta shit in the door crack
Where we at now?

[Chorus]
AZ's back (come on)
(Where we at now?)
Where we at?
(Talk to me, talk to me now)
AZ's back
(Ga,Ga,Ga,Ga)
Where we at?
(What you want, what you want)
AZ's back
(What you like, what you like from me now)

AZ's back, y'all better watch out
AZ's back, y'all better watch out
AZ is back...

[Chorus] - repeat to fade

I handle tools like hammers and wratches 
Gats wit metal attachments, how you want it metal or plastic 
Disrespect your fam bastard, close your casket 
Then I give 'em a can of hold your ashes 
Visions of the killer for we rose a passin 
True killer, true thug, never show no passion 
Hit your rug, hit your ceiling, if I know if you stashin 
Wrong, nigga da rug, nigga know who you passin 
Fresh year from rammin off da zany's fours and perks 
Keep da semi handy jammin you for war or work 
Niggas like da border goin bizurk 
On the roof bangin dat swat, lettin off shots and spurts 
Dey tryin to trap me in da back of da yard 
Man I'm lettin every cat fall hittin from da cap to da sarge 
Can't see me back in da yard, two wacks back to da wall 
Use da two gat stash pack in da wall 
Picture Mac liftin up racks in da yard 
I had da block shiftin up knocking off racks by the yard 
Dope from dem dudes, smokeless, confused 
Shit, dey ain't know if dey want a crack from da saw 
Switch dey life, straight from da pipe to da straw 
Coke in dey vein, what you want da dope or da cane 
I open da game, to sniffin da D, X to da Z 
Hot shit from B-Sig consecutively

Y'all niggas crazy think dat Free won't draw da lev 
Prefer da nine but I got da four four instead 
I move dymes who your dyme get her home in da bed 
Tell dat triflin bitch I want more than head 
Free might spark at ya clip take more than bread 
Guns and bricks while young bulls hug da block 
Dey love da strip, help 'em get chains and watches 
Guns and kicks, Freeway my name is priceless, flow is sick, 
And remember if you lie on Free 
Lie in da lake, while your bitch lies on Free 
She ride on da snake and my whip over her key 
We ride in da jakes, empty clips hop on Amtrak 
Out of da state, broody shit, you and yo man, right outta ya case 
Hold dis clip blow your brain right outta ya face 
Flow legendary, hotter than Mase 
Dude Free never where we outta da case 
Roc-A-Fella pop criss til we outta da case 
Form da hood nigga Nikes, Delts, and 'Lo Sport 
Hood niggas just like me, belted and blow court 
Hood chickens just bite me well and blow squad 
I was 16, 12,000 wit no job 
And I skipped school, gripped a bitch wit no ride 
See the crack smoked leave bitch wit no thighs, no tits 
Rob hustlers wit no clips, no guns, left niggas wit no chips 
And the flow runs like da Mississippi River 
And your hoe comes, ya bitch hear me when I whisper 
Silence all guns hit 'em fo-fo-fo-fo-for dey hit ya 
If we comin for you than nigga we gonna get ya

(Yeah) {sample repeats throughout song} 
Uh, get on up now {x2} 
(Move) {sample repeats throughout song} 
Move it {repeat throughout song} 
(Get on up) {x2} 

Feel the vibe and let's move it 
Never losing out the funk that we got 
Think that you can hang? Why don't you just prove it? 
Come on and take a chance with me and why not? 
I see one, no two, no three, four on the dance floor 
Gonna give you more of what you want for damn sure 
Skip the talk and just dance 
And if it's too much then get the lead out your... 
Ask me no questions and I'll tell no lies 
Crank it up, it just amplifies 
I'ma dance, I'ma dance 'til I drop 
This the jam y'all, get on up 

(Get on up) Get on up now 
(Get on up) Get on up now 
(Get on up) Uh, get on up now 
(Get on up) Yeah, get on up now 

Can I get a witness with this funk with the quickness? 
Microphone swiftness is my business 
Checkin' out the brothers with the funky stride 
You don't want to dance honey, drip step aside 
As I move to the left can I get a little (funk)? 
As I move to the right can I get a little (funk)? 
Two times in the center as I kick a riddle 
My name is Carmen Electra and I ain't in the middle 
This kind of funky beat is what I dream 
So if you want to get a feel of this cream 
Hop 'til you damn near drop 
This the jam y'all, get on up 

Uh, get on up now 
Uh, get on up now 
Yeah, get on up now 
Uh, yeah, get on up now 

We're gonna dance, dance, dance 
Dance, dance, dance 

All aboard, all aboard 'cause I'm gettin' funky 
As you know, as you know I'm a party junky 
Gettin' live to the rhythm 'cause I want to 
Tryin' to spread it 'cause everybody else ought to 
Clap your hands, clap your hands like you really want to 
Get the wallflower people all out of the corner 
How many times I gotta stop the clock? 
Cause this the jam y'all so get on up! 

Dance, dance, dance 
Dance, dance, dance to night 

Get on up now 
(Get on up) Get on up {x3} 
(Get on up) {x8}

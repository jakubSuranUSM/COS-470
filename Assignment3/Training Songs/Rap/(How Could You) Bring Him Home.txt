I got the first flight out when I finished up the tour, because I missed you
I even flew home a day too soon, all because I couldn't wait to kiss you
"Oh, how she will be loved"
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be
Remembered for the rest of your life

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

I know you know I passed on every girl because I thought I really loved you
And you know that I'd never put anyone or anything above you
Because I loved you
And it was that love (It was that love)
That made me lose my head, and now it's too late
One day too soon
You'll regret it for the rest of your days

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

Hey
Oh
Hey
Oh

Please, God, forgive
Me for what I did
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in
And seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same

Please, God, forgive (No)
Me for what I did (No)
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in (No)
And seen what I seen (No)
I know any man would have done just the same
Because I

Never thought that I'd do something like that

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home? (Bring him home)

Hey
Oh (Bring him home)
Hey
Oh

Hey
Oh
Hey

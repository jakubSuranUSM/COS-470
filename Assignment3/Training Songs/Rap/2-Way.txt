Don't worry baby, you know I'm satellite connected

So hit me on my 2-Way and put it on me now

I see how you be lickin' on that chocolate swirl,
I know you want me over there to rock your world,
Hit me on my 2-Way and we can get it on.

Hit me up and let me know,

If you don't I'll hit you on the cell,
Holla at me later, honey you can feel it baby I can tell,
Later I'll be ringing on your bell.

Baby matter was,
Happenin because of the hunnies in ma car
Here we're skinny dippin and we're eating caviar,
Chillin' by the pool, Shaggy smokin' a cigar,
Multi-platinum and counting, you have to be star,
To do it like we do it, like a genie in the jar,
Hit me on my pager, maybe later we can talk,
Naked by my crib we can hang by the bar,
My crib is on the mountain, Shaggy from afar,
Have hottie, hottie wit dem legs ajar
You got me ?, hot like a ?,
You wanna get involved well let me know where you are.

Put it on me girl

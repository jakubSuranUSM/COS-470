Ahhh you don' did it now.
Chaos you should of put this one in the vault man.
They not ready
They don't know what's commin man
Oh we gonna drop this on them right here
Ya'll ain't ready for dis!
Ya'll ain't ready for none of dis!

Your boy's a bad man
And we invadin' the streets
Make all 'em clapper-rappers scurred
They be droppin' the heat
Shocked the world now I'm standin' alone
I flip fools like them clamshell cellular phones
You can't help but nod ya head to the track
F*ck the watered-down rap, we be takin' it back
Give it to ya straight, ain't no chasin' it
Check ya self in the mirror, ain't no facin' it
'Cause you...playin' the roll and you plannin' to fold
This the masterplan, we got the planet on hold
We all over the streets like ya favorite sneeker
Breakin' up ya sound like a drive-through speaker
Everything that I be spittin' is strong
After I rock, fast-forward through the rest of the song
We the monkey wrench, that's gonna ruin ya plan
And don't f*ck wit John Cena, I'm a bad, bad man

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

We devils, rockin' ambient levels
We set loose among hot tunes to instrumentals
When cats got one-liners, I drop several
And I think it's funny you choose
Who's in progress of runnin' in place
We makin' rules and ya'll settle
I rip rappers and take responsibility
for makin' future hall of famers look third-rate
Ya'll are lost for words like conversation on your worst first-date,
And raw beats
Creep through side streets
Loose leaf notepads
That's where rhymes leak
Punch-lines, man, don't even beg
I got knee-slapping tracks, ya'll cruisin' ya leg
You a rhyme-writer, buddy? Man, that's a joke
You ain't worthy of being my secretary, man that's a quote
I flood tracks like cracks in boats
And pussy rappers choked up, wit they own rhymes in they throat

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

Turn up the microphone and feed me, I'm a beast
MCs and they beats is what I eat
16, I leave you in the street
My rhymes are sicker than gangrene in both feet
It's spreadin' up the leg and headin' for the head
Your rhymes are whack, your style is proof that the brain corrosion
Is fuckin' with ya chosen flows
I'm nice with mics, my hands'll break ya nose
Like Mikey Tyson, fightin' in his prime one rhyme
And I shake up the room one time, BOOM
To da jaw, your face is a cult-type, Where all the
The blood is not bein' mixed, jelly on the floor
My love is Compton bricks, belly on the floor
I rob you, you soft and you really ain't a problem
I solve you, 3 57 long nose revolve you
Acid in ya face, bad look, dissolve you
I'm a bad, bad man
Yeah,
Check it out,
It's Bumpy Knuckles, baby
And I want you to say hello to the bad, bad man
Come on!

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

With The Mic In My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Even in the fight Wit My Hands I'm A Bad Man
Livin In The Streets all my life I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man
I'm A Bad Man

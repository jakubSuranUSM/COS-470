Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat (yeah, uh come on)
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat (oh)
Don't stop movin' to the S Club beat

DJ got the party started there's no end in sight
Everybody's moving to the rhythm that's inside
It's a crazy world but tonight's the right situation
Don't get left behind

I can feel the music movin' through me everywhere
Ain't no destination baby we don't even care
There's a place to be if you need the right education
Let it take you there

And just go with the magic baby, I can see it there in your eyes
Flow, stop the waiting, right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop moving can you feel the music
DJ's got us goin' around round (round)
Don't stop movin' find your own way to it
Listen to the music taking you to places that you've never been before baby now

Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat (ho)
Don't stop movin' to the S Club beat (yeah yeah yeah)

You can touch the moment almost feel it in the air
Don't know where we're going baby we don't even care
Ain't no mystery, just use your imagination
Let it take you there

Just go with the magic baby, I can see it there in your eyes
Flow, stop the waiting right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop moving can you feel the music
DJ's got us goin' around round (don't stop moving)
Don't stop movin' find your own way to it
Listen to the music taking you to places that you've never been before baby now

Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat (yeah come on)
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat (don't stop movin')
Don't stop movin' to the S Club beat

Forget about your fears tonight
Listen to the heart, let it touch the sky (listen to your heart)
No need to reason why
Just listen to the sound and it makes you come alive

Don't stop moving can you feel the music
DJ's got us goin' around (round)
Don't stop movin' find your own way to it
Listen to the music (yeah yeah yeah)

Don't stop moving can you feel the music
DJ's got us goin' around 'round (doN't stop movin')
Don't stop movin' find your own way to it
Listen to the music taking you to places that you've never been before baby now

Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat
Don't stop movin' to the funky funky beat
Don't stop movin' to the S Club beat

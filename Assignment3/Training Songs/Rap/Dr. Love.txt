Come be my patient(patient)

You could call me the love doctor
I'ma make you feel better
Sometimes pain is pleasure
Lay down on the stretcher

Love sick but I got the cure
So don't you panic, babe
You'll be begging me for more
After the surgery

Tell me when you're sick again
In need of healing, I'll be there for you
Love is like a vitamin

Oh, Here's what I'm goin' do
Calling in code blue
About to rescue you, with my medicine

[Chorus]

So I hear can't eat, not sleeping
Come in for late night treatment
Oh girl, you're so contagious (It makes me)

I wanna help ya
When you're under weather
I can love it better
All you need is one dose of my vaccine

So tell me when you're sick again
In need of healing, I'll be there for you
Love is like a vitamin
I got the feeling, so let me love you

Oh, Here's what I'm goin' do
Calling in code blue
About to rescue you, with my medicine

[Chorus]

Have no fear, baby I'm here
Just show me where it hurts you babe
So that I can get to healing
And don't be afraid
Just take of dose of me
And I'll see you in the morning

[Chorus]

Let me ya doctor baby, Let me ya doctor girl
Let me ya doctor baby, Let me ya doctor girl
Oh, let me rescue you, Let me rescue you, yeah, oh

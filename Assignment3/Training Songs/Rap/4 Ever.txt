[Lil' Mo]
Baby, I'm at the point in my life
When I'm tired of playin games
I'm ready to settle down
I'm ready to buy a house
And I'm ready to change my last name
I'm ready to have some kids
Ready for the life to live
And all love has to give
I been your superwoman for so long
I'm ready to be your wife

I ain't got no issues standing in my way
I ain't going nowhere

I'm ready to walk down that aisle in all white
And dedicate my life to you (yeah, yeah)
And live together happily ever after all

[Fab]
All I been thinking bout is us
Sliding from weddings with bands on
Heading to San Juan, getting our tan on
Girl, you must be forgetting your man's long
Most tuxes I have trouble getting the pants on
And I know things run through your head when your man's gone
I come home have you saying (Oh Boy) better than Cam'ron
We upsetting they plans on
Getting they chance on
Getting they hands on F-A-B-O

[Repeat: x2]
Can you live with it, loving me for life
To have and hold forever
Baby ride or die til death do us part
Let's make it last forever

Make it last forever
And ever and ever
Can you live with it, loving me for life

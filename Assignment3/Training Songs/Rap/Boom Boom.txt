I wish every little beat of my heart, could tell you how I feel (yeah)
And I wish every little beat of my heart, could show you that's for real.(yeah)

I really don't know what you're doing to me
Everytime you're near me I can feel the beat
It's the pounding of my heart, ooh you made it start
When you do what you do to me

Oooh, It's Boom boom
Hey, It's boom boom
Yeah, It's Boom boom
Oooh, It's Boom boom
(I wish, every litttle beat of my heart, can tell you how I feel)
This Love's for real

Now I can shake this feeling but I don't think you even know 
(do you know it, do you know it, do you know it baby)
I try to hold it in, but there it comes and then there it goes, again

It's that steading pounding, I love the way it's sounding
It makes me want you more and it's just like I said before
It's the pounding of my heart, ooh you made it start
When you do what you do to me

Oooh, It's Boom boom
Hey, It's boom boom
Yeah, It's Boom boom
Oooh, It's Boom boom
(I wish, every litttle beat of my heart, could tell you how I feel)
This Love's for real

Say one plus one makes two that's me and you
And I know that you know that we know that it's, boom boom
Cos when you're there, my heart's joom joom
()
I need you and the things that you do 
Forever and I wanna stay true
Like Boom baby Boom Baby 
Boom,Boom,Boom, Boom..

Oooh, It's that steading pounding, I love the way it's sounding
It makes me want you more and it's just like I said before
When you do what you do to me

Oooh, It's Boom boom
Hey, It's boom boom
Yeah, It's Boom boom
Oooh, It's Boom boom
(I wish, every litttle beat of my heart, could tell you how I feel)
This Love's for real

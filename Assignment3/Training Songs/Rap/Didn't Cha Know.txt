Ooh hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn
Back there somewhere

Ooh hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn
Back there somewhere

Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Tried to move but I lost my way
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Never know how the cards may lay

Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know
So many times I've changed  my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

Ooh hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn
Back there somewhere

Ooh hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn
Back there somewhere

Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Tried to run but I lost my way
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Stopped to watch my emotions sway
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Knew the toll but I would not pay
Didn't cha know
Didn't cha know
Never know how the cards may lay

Love is life
And life is free
Take a ride
Of life with me
Free your mind
And find your way
There will be a brighter day

Love is life
And life is free
Take a ride
Of life with me
Free your mind
And find your way
There will be a brighter day

Love is life
And life is free
Take a ride
Of life with me
Free your mind
And find your way
There will be a brighter day

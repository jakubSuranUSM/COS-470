Ice Cube with The Lench Mob  I got it goin on 
A n**** that's livin in the city of the criminal zone 
One time can't keep the law in order 
'Cause everybody's goin crazy for a quarter 

You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area 
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin ya 
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag 
Or beat down for ya flag 

'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger 
Keep one in the chamber 
'cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son 
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1 

All the ol' school house fellows are crooks 
So I get jealous looks 
They keep thinkin did my hair grow? 
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube? 

Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay 
I keep my 9 anyway 
For the day one of my homies want to squab 
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob 

(AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) 

Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt 
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt 
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable 
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest 

I'm a menace crook 
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book 
From the s*** I took from people 
I reap all your fat s***, jack 

Back to the criminals sect 
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet 
'Cause I'm slick as slippery 
They can't get wit me, cops ain't s*** to me 

I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs 
And sweat em like sweathogs 
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the n**** that flaunt it 
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted 

Ah-yo, here's what the poster read: 
'Ice Cube is wanted dead' 
That's all it said 
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green 

Hear shots and si-reens 
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings 
So give it up punk and then I just 
Put another jack in progress 

It's the American way 
'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A 
Ice Cube - a motherf***in clepto 
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so 

Who gets the worm? 
And if I'm caught in a trap 
You know I'm a beat the wack 
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off 

FBI on my dick, stay off! 
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest 
I'm a n**** with a 'S' on his chest 
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight 
'Cause I'm scarin ya, wanted by America 

(Ah-yo Cube man, they on your a**) 

Word, but who the f*** has heard? 
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs 
Let em see a n**** invasion 
Point blank for the caucasian 

C*** the hammer then crackle, smile 
Take me to your house, pal 
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see 
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewellry 

Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D 
Had a little fly a** b**** wit me 
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be 
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV 

Damn (oh s***!) I didn't know I lucked out 
Struck out, I gotta get the f*** out 
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when 
The ol' b**** down the street must've turned me in 

'Cause the feds was out there ten deep 
I got ha**led and gaffled in the back seat 
I think back when I was robbin my own kind 
The police didn't pay it no mind 

But when I start robbin the white folks 
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope 
I said it before and I'll still taught it 
Every motherf***er with a colour is most wanted

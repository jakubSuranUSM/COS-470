The world is spinning too fast 
I'm buyin' lead Nike shoes 
To keep myself tethered 
To the days I tried to lose

My mama said to slow down 
You must make your own shoes 
Stop dancing to the music 
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

There's a monkey in the jungle 
Watching a vapour trail 
Caught up in the conflict 
Between his brain and his tail

And if time's a limitation 
Then we got nothing to lose 
Please repeat the message

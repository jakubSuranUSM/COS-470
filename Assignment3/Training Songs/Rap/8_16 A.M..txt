Stranger flowers yet, there will never come
A day that I will ever regret
The hours, days, years and the minutes
The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it
The drives on the coast to nowhere
Nothing to say just sit and stare
There's nothing like the comfort of a silence
That's comfortable, not talking small, just skip the bull
Then I find myself in servility
Didn't think that was my ability
I go a yard and a mile to make you smile
But then I'm happy see I got so many ways
To make your gaze elliptical
Got a ways to go, the future's so cryptical and I'm glad
Just another many things we've had

It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see my eyes open
I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me
The day starts carefully on the sidewalk with the dog
You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry, it's 73 degrees, January easily glides
Oh, easily glides

Stranger flowers still, if you're gonna wanna
Go another day I will, like this, make it a deal, sealed
With a kiss sealed with the feel of impermanent bliss
Today my love we shall let the world slide
Turn off the ringer and just glide
For we shall never be younger again
Then what do you see

It's 8:16 A.M. will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see my eyes open
I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me
The day starts carefully on the sidewalk with the dog
You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry, Holiday on the radio
Billie knows that is the way to go, the way to go

A place where we both can spend our saved time
Not collecting interest
Maybe the same reason we always find ourselves
Homebound I've got to do some homework
The leave response we want to leave Wisconsin
For a new life, a new trailer with an antenna and a porch
Of course we'll bring the dog

I'm saying man, What you saying homie
Different weight class you know (that's right)
I'm feeling being one of the ones you know what I'm saying
About to move all these rappers out the way 
Cause they just taking up too much space ya heard (yea)
It's time for new energy man
Let's get it

[Chorus]
I got the whips, wheels, diamonds on my grill
Money, hoes and clothes man it's all a player knows
Being broke
No nigga I don't know about that
Being broke
No nigga I don't know about that

[Bow Wow]
Listen
You see the chain, you know my pedigree
You know what it is when you dealing with the letter B
Dirty mad niggas stay mad at me, mad at me
Cause they can't show they girls what I'ma let 'em see, let 'em see
I'm leaning on all these lil busters with some money (yea)
I take they girl and I'm like usher with the money
Only difference is you ain't about to see me do
I'm up in six letting it burn singing girl do you

[Chorus: x2]

[Bow Wow]
I'm a 0 8 phantom type bandanna rocker
Me and JD is like Redbull and Vodka
And we right at it man
Live from Atlanta man
Grilled up, tatted as, since birth had it man
Stuntin' on these niggas (yea) throwing dough around
If you hear I'm in yo town best believe is going down
If I stood on my wallet ill be bigger than Shaq
Who you know under 21 who do it like that

[Chorus: x2]

[Bow Wow]
5th album (yea) still getting it
Niggas mad at me cause they ain't getting it how I'm getting it
Mister if the misters (yea) 106 and Park that is
I hear you talking but you niggas know who started this (me)
Who the hardest is and who the real artist is
And clearly who be getting it popping like this (uh)
White T (yea), red monkey jeans
When I hit the block I'm coming down clean

[Chorus: x2]

[Young Capone]
Young C fresh and feels?
Like popping out that phantom shinning brighter than a plasma
The coupe like a Nascar my dough come faster
My pockets fat as Biggie, Jazze, Big Jasper
Something like a masts so so, G 4, 2 high
The Bapes, the monkeys, the ice got me too fly
Young C and Bow that's just one of few stacks
Free shows and promos I don't know about that

[Chorus: x2]

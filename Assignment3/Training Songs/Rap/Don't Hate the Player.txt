Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game

On the sticks I been doin' this since '86
With that one big red button joy stick, I'm sick
You can never touch me couzzie
Can't bum rush me, bust or crush me

Break ya knees, pump fake ya fee
My crossover's thicka than the Black Eyed Peas
Yet sweet like candied yams
It's reported and recorded on the handy cams
It be like jammy jams

And he's no Grammy Fan
Came in a limo and leave in a ambulance
Burn like hot embers and
My cock's so big I need Hammer pants

Ouch, like f*ck yo couch
Be eatin' croutons all on ya futon
Rules on point watch how it sounds now
I'm 3 from downtown on ya brown 'round
It's casual boy, I'm town bound
You hyphy like me, well calm down

Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game

Livin' this flow, gettin' in close
Pivot and post getting Benjamin overdose
Nah, no ya don't
My goal is grope and hold ya throat

Yeah, I need more than Jenson
Servin' like Benson, it's in the bag
Sir Diesel, instantly had
Twistin' these leads 'til ya kissin' feet

My systems neat, refined, sleek mind
Deep kind of p game
Each frame of action captured
Close captioned, stacked

To my black friends we ask ya
(Lie)
In ya grill, you passionate thrill seeker
Still beneath the reefer
(Yeah)

I'll impeach ya leader
And squeeze the last drop of funk
So everybody here cop 'em some
Now you want you some
You gonna get it anyway

Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game

Really ain't nobody foolin' with plea
A Hiero sign in ya face while ya shootin' the three
Everybody came ta see me, yeah, they rootin' for me
You can't believe true can beat me and my crew in this piece

Some of the fans up in the stands is cheerleaders
Tryin' to sneak a peak or a glance at cheerleaders
At playoff time I'ma prove that we're leaders
Hard fouls in the paint, I don't even care either

If the ref eject me, the league suspend me
I'ma be on some jet skis in Tahiti with Leslie
If I miss a shot that's when the media stress me
Say I'm only lucky when I'm beating the best team

To the upmost I'm workin' my style
You but though, you get a up close and personal foul
If you end up gettin' hurt that's when they call in the traina
(It's all in the game brah)
It's all in the game, brah

Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Don't hate the player, hate the game

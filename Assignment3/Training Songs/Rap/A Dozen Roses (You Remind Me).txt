(With a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true, the makings of you)

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby, caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy, you remind me, remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys, you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true, these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby; you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And, baby, you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims, you shine

Boy, you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around, looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me, and you're my property

Looking at you, looking at another, baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist, it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips, armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip, you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine, and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

(With a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true, the makings of you)

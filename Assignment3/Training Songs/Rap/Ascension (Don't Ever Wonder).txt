Oh

It happened the moment,
When you were revealed
'Cause you were a dream that
You should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good
And feel nice and feel loved
Give me paradise

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take
Until you speak, babe
'Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
Oh
You gave me the feelin',
Feelin' in my life

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

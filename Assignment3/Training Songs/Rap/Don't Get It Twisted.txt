Twista: 

Oh yeah, yo boy Twista

The midwest, westcoast connection(westcoast) 
And this is how we puttin' it down you know what I'm talkin about 
A lil' somethin' for tha ladies 

(Chorus) 
It's not love, don't get it twisted 
I'll make you feel so good but you gotta slow down 
Its not love, don't get it twisted 
Ill make you wanna do it all night, all night

Mr.Capone E: 

Its not love comin from a straight thug 
All up in the club lookin pretty when I'm buzzed 
That's what it was, that was love 
So lady here I come so pass me the bud 
Gettin you all sprung off the tongue 
Yah cute playboy, when I stunt 
One by one you standin in line 
And one by one and I'm checkin out your rump 
And oh yes Mr.Capon double E 
Internationally known as a pimp daddy

"We love you papi" strike me for cocky but my game 
Is ultra tight have you screamin out my name 
Baby girl you lookin fine botom line 
Lady, lady there's no love from this job 
I just wanna get you hot, find your spot never wanna stop 
Hit and quit it, are you wit it? let just keep this little secret 
But don't catch no feelings when you squealin'

It's not love, don't get it twisted 
Ill make you wanna do it all night, all night

Twista: 

Today I was rollin in the mac with the shorty 
But now I gotta go and catch me a hottie 
Chillin in the club up in the v.i.p 
Now I'm after your body in the after party 
Would a jigga be up here gettin love 
Get a girl to back it up, spend the stack for the buzz 
Give a one night stand shorty tell me where you're actin 
The love in the back of the club you gonna get up in a bentley 
With a bum well let me take you to a tele where the hatas 
Can't get me hit the ass tryin to titis now give a little to the 
Homie Frank Nity and get it now give it to Mr.Capone E, 
And well talk about, its only me get the dawn with a G 
Imma never leave you lonely gotchu all in a pony, come 
And give me that there like the way I pull your hair, 
Spankin your little dairiere makin you scream 'ouch' 
Give it to you when we fucking on the couch give it to you 
When we fucking on the chair look at little mama sweatin 
Good, gettin rocked by the balls gotta hit it hard, not too 
Soft never get it twisted cause you fucking with the pistol 
When I pop you off imma drop you off its not love 

[chorus] 
Its not love, don't get it twisted 
Ill make you feel soo good but you gotta slow down 
Its not love,don't get it twisted 
Ill make you wanna do it all night, all night 

Mr.Capone E: 

I Wanna make you do it all night long. Play it again just sing this 
Song westcoast, midwest,dirty south,eastcoast ladies just drop that thong. Lets get it on, pull the alarm as playa with that Thug life 
Passion I keep on asking, reminding just a onenight 
Standding. No matter my company but baby pay a glase and if 
You got that little chance mija lets runway. Anyways all day by the 
Way I gots to leave in a rush a quit nut don't you fuss all I did 
Was just f*ck.

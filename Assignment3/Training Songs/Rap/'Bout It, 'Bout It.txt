Girl, I been longin' to make love to you
And now we're alone, so if you're in the mood
I will hold you caress you
And slowly undress you my love
That's what I'm gonna do

I can teach you things you've never
Known before I know you think
You know it let me show you more
Girl, I'm gonna satisfy the woman inside of you
That's what I'm gonna do

Don't you know I'm 'bout it, baby
I will break you off
('Bout it)
'Bout it, 'bout it, baby, baby, no doubt
Ooh, we can get it started, baby, I can set it off
(Yeah)
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, girl, no doubt about it
(I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)

What's your desire? 'Cause I'll light that fire
Baby, I'm feelin' like
I just might spend the night lovin' you
I know you want me too

(Girl, I can tell you been waitin' to explode)
(All your fantasies and every dream, I'll indulge)
(Girl, I'm only offering the love that you been)
(Waitin' for, you'll never ask for more)

Don't you know I'm 'bout it, baby
I will break you off
('Bout it)
'Bout it, 'bout it, baby, baby, no doubt
Ooh, we can get it started, baby, I can set it off
(Yeah)
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, girl, no doubt about it
(I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)

I'll put it down to you
Because it's proper
And anytime you wanna ride
Jump on, girl

Don't you know I'm 'bout it, baby
I will break you off
('Bout it)
'Bout it, 'bout it, baby, baby, no doubt
Ooh, we can get it started, baby, I can set it off
(Yeah)
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, girl, no doubt about it
(I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)

Don't you know I'm 'bout it, baby
I will break you off
('Bout it)
'Bout it, 'bout it, baby, baby, no doubt
Ooh, we can get it started, baby, I can set it off
(Yeah)
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, girl, no doubt about it
(I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)

Don't you know I'm 'bout it, baby
I will break you off
('Bout it)
'Bout it, 'bout it, baby, baby, no doubt
Ooh, we can get it started, baby, I can set it off
(Yeah)
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, girl, no doubt about it
(I'm 'bout it, 'bout it)

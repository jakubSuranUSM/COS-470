Two months prior you said you had a dire emergency
It was 1:30, my face was all dirty trying to get some sleep
Head still whirling, throw on my shearing leave my man home
Two dots yes I'm coming, yes my car is running, hang up my cell phone

By the time I arrived you was deep about five like you had beef
And then you tried to step and told me that I slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some niggaz that you thought was jigga
Who was digging me and I told you after that day we ain't cool baby, so

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

I was kinda thrown head was kinda blown but I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before, I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex like you were the next bitch who you trying to fool
You just another girl from the avenue who graduated school

Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and frontiers
Don't hang around with me at all
And now I make my music got me some new dick and I'm doing fine
And I'm still real ghetto and I still kick your black behind

Whatcha think this a game ain't nobody playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Whatcha think this a game ain't nobody playing
Thought I told you before, don't you come knockin' on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Yo, I'm ringing the phone two in the a.m. rudely awaken
Dreaming deep concentration hazy
She really couldn't peep what they was saying
At first all I know was Jag really wasn't playing at all

She left calming to speak to the John
Got the Jaguar double parked, blinkers is on
Head pulled back sneakers is on
Yo I don't know what sis told her
But she bout' to get a beatin' performed

She grabbing all up on her shirt tugging on her slacks
Jag tried to go in the grill I had to hold her back
Cool her out try to tell her to chill, lower the thermostat
You a star no need for you to stoop as low as that boy

Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm ganstar don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music, it's really not a game

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Whatcha think this a game
Thought I told you before
I was trying to be nice
Ooh girl you don' did it now
Really, really, really did it now watch out, watch out

Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

Man dawg, it's some bad b****es out here that'll ("make you do wrong")
Whoa... go on girl ("make you do wrong")
I know everybody gotta feel this
Yeah you got somebody at home
but this bad motherf***er right here goin' ("make you do wrong")

I could tell when I dropped the top
I nippled off on the block, I was goin' get into some bulls***
That's the reason why I watch for cops
And keep me two baby glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip

Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'm a be hangin' out with everybody
Never knew I should of been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party

So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans huggin' the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin' b****es up

Socializin' with everybody flirtin' with girls but got plans to go home
'Til I felt the way you was backin' up on the thing
Gettin' down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad muh'f***er) she could bass a deuce

A fine-a** Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad muh'f***er)
Take a look at them hips, and how she lickin' them lips

Like she was lickin' ice cream
Ballin' with a bad b**** that ain't yours on the scene
Listenin' to some Al Green might ("make you do wrong")

[Chorus: x2]
That's a girl that you shouldn't of f***ed with
But she so seductive, got a n**** head gone
Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home
But tonight she the type that'll ("make you do wrong")

{This n**** that you shouldn't of f***ed with}
{But he so seductive, had a b**** head gone}
{Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}
{But tonight he the type that'll} ("make you do wrong")

I got the champagne and popped the top
And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'm a tell my dawg
When he look up and realize that a b**** ain't came home

S***, he about to be rockin' it
Lookin' sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Adjustin' his body with telekenesis

Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Tryin' to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
'Cause I'm rollin' in the Hummer and the top was off

My guy sleepin' anyway and that's wha**up
But I'm paranoid, drivin' fast as f***
Thinkin' 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, askin' me what ("make you do wrong")

[Chorus]

I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Baby won't you go on back to sleep
I was at the police station, when you hangin' in the club
With you boys gettin' drunk 20 deep it'll ("make you do wrong")

If you got up with a ho
Should of told the b**** use another douche
If you was at the police station, should of smelled like heist
But you comin' in smellin' like puss what will ("make you do wrong")

Well I couldn't resist
Cause she was thick as hell and so cute
Steady comin' at me, she was throwin' it all on me
And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll ("make you do wrong")

Well I know what you talkin' about
So we can do it like this
I'm a go and ride, you can do what you do
'Cause I done met another brother with some bomb-a** .. it'll ("make you do wrong")

[Chorus]

I ain't even mad, no not like before
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass it's time to cut the lawn
Answers the hands a.k.a I cut you off

No
You ain't gonna lie to my face no more
Hit me with "I'm sorry" but I'm sorry, no
Na na na na na na na na na na
No
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone, case closed (chuck it)

(Chuck it)

You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no atention to you

I said no
No no no, a no no
No no, that's a no no
No no, I said no no
No no

You came so close
You just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan isle
Really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no atention to you

I said no
No no no, a no no
No no, that's a no no
No no, I said no no
No no
I said no (I said no)
No no no, a no no
No no, that's a no no
No no, I said no no
No no

He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week

I said no
I said no (a no no)
Look, I said no no (that's a no no) 
I said no, I said no no, no no
(No)
(No no no)
(No no no)
(No no no) I said no no
(No no no)

Parlez vous francais? I said no
Lemme translate it I said no

No
(No no no no) Portuguese? Boy you know
Japanese? Boy you know

I think, I think that was it
Yep

(You know there is two sides to every story)
See I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch
Talkin' shit like a snitch
Why you write a song 'bout me
If you really didn't care
You wouldn't want to share
Tellin' everybody just how you feel

F*ck what I did was your fault somehow
F*ck the presents, I threw all that shit out
F*ck all the cryin' it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, f*ck you right back

F*ck what I did was your fault somehow
F*ck the presents, I threw all that shit out
F*ck all the cryin' it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, f*ck you right back

You thought you could really make me moan
I had better sex all alone (ha ha ha ha)
I had to turn to your friend
Now you want me to come back
You must be smokin' crack
I'm goin' else where and that's a fact

F*ck all those nights I moaned real loud
F*ck it, I faked it, aren't you proud
F*ck all those nights you thought you broke my back
Well guess what yo, your sex was wack

F*ck all those nights I moaned real loud
F*ck it, I faked it, aren't you proud
F*ck all those nights you thought you broke my back
Well guess what yo, your sex was wack

Whoa whoa
Uh uh yea

Whoa whoa
Uh uh yea

Whoa whoa
Uh uh yea

Whoa whoa
Uh uh yea

You questioned did I care
Maybe I would have if you would of gone down there
Now it's over
But I do admit I'm glad I didn't catch your crabs
I can't sweat that cause I got to go

F*ck what I did was your fault somehow
F*ck the presents, I threw all that shit out
F*ck all the cryin' it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, f*ck you right back.

Oh oh
Uh uh yea

Oh oh
Uh uh yea

Oh oh
Uh uh yea

Oh oh
Uh uh yea

You made me do this

I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit
History is ours tonight
The people are chanting, can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Open up the doors on 'em, we playing tonight
Bring on the marching band and turn on the stadium lights
They gonna learn from me, this is our church to be
Life of a champion, ugh, so Freddy Mercury
Sneaking into Hov concerts in nosebleeds
The Hov bein' like woah
Yeah, independant, keep killing these people and don't sleep
Even the pigeon toed still standing on both feet, you know
It's obvious who's night this is
Grandparent's immigrants, couple Irish kids
Victory in my grass, gotta fight for this
The streets are ours this evening, going undefeated
I roll the dice against the staircase, uh huh
Steak season, gotta marinate, uh huh
If I happen to die tonight, put my spirit in the stars
Bury me in the grave and carve "the history was ours"
Said I

I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit
History is ours tonight
The people are chanting, can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Wake up, bitch, I ain't dead yet
And If I was in heaven, I'd be the best dressed
My closet looking like a swap meet in Texas
And maybe it's excess, but we ain't cut from the same cloth, player
Talking to a boss player
Checks like a ball player
Easy money, all lay-ups
I be pissing off neighbors
Get up off my dick and get the finger like a cross-fader
I be in my lawn chair star gazing like, woo!
All praise to the most high
Your boy in his own J's, I made it to courtside
Remember the old days and praying for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leopard
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands unto the heavens and said

I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit
History is ours tonight
The people are chanting, can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Didn't come this far to lose
Won't let death make a move
Might not mean much to you, but I'd die for this W
Let my life be something to prove
Every scrape, every fight, every cut, every bruise
I lay it all on the line, I re-write these rules
Victory in my sight, I will not lose

I ain't gonna die tonight
You can't kill me, not my spirit
History is ours tonight
The people are chanting, can't you hear it?
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

In the middle of the night
I try to cry myself to sleep 
But I can't even close my eyes
Just thinkin' 'bout you
What would I do without you
Cause I want to be there
Always there, and

Chorus:
I can't let go
Deep inside I want to let it show
Cause I know I gotta let you go
But I don't even know
Don't want to know what I'd do
If I were without you

Been denying it
Avoiding it for awhile
But I, I can't hide it
The fact we need to be apart
I want so much to be with you
But what am I supposed to do
When I love you

repeat chorus 2xs

shoop doop do do shoop doop do do do do do
(repeat)

Baby won't you help me sing
I always thought this would be
The perfect kind of love for me
But now I know, it's plain to see
That things won't work out just for me
But I need to know, please let me know
If you're gonna be alright
Cause I love you

chorus to fade

(softly)
Don't you see the tears in my eyes
Can't you see that I've been crying

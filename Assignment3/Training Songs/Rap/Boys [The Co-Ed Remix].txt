For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time, it's over now
I spotted you dancin'
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I shake shake my thang
Make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I want to see what you can do

What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryin' to sound conceited but
You and me were meant to be (yeah)
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys
To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys
And when a girl is with one
Boys
Then she's in control

Pull your girl off the dance floor
Whisper in her ear
Must've said something about me
'Cause now she's lookin' over here
You lookin' at me, with that sexy attitude
But the way your girl's movin' it
It puts me in the mood

What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryin' to sound conceited
But me and you is just meant to be
I'm from N.E.R.D, aren't you Britney
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty thing

Girls
I can't think for no one
Girls
Gonna be here all the time
Girls
I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls
But I know she ain't touchin' mine

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys
To love her and to hold
Boys
And when a girl is with one
Boys
Then she's in control

Like that
Here we go
Have no fear
Baby what are you waiting for?
Uh uh
Lemme see what you can do

Boys
Sometimes a girl just needs one (I like that)
Boys (I like that, the way you move)
To love her and to hold
Boys
And when a girl is with one (it's gonna turn me on)
Boys
Then she's in control

Girls
I can't think for no one
Girls
Gonna be here all the time
Girls
I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls
But I know she ain't touchin' mine

Boys
Girls
Boys
Girls
Boys
Girls
Boys 
Girls

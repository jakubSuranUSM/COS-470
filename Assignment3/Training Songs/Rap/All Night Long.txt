Yeah, want to feel the vibe 
Want to feel the vibe  want to feel the vibe! 
Want to what? Yeah 
Want to  what? Uhh yeah (come on) 
Every body c'mon uhh 
Yo yo (all night long) 

[Common] 
During divine hours I use mind power to refine 
Flower girls and make em feel like black pearls 
Get they minds off acrylic nails and the rap world 
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl 
Made signs built in lodges, we be in garages 
Discussin' who we boned and who God is 
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners 
I kick it for the Chevy riding head to backstreet leaners 

[Erykah Badu (Common)] 
All(uh) night (yea yea, what?) (HAH)
All(huh, uh) night (whatcha say now B, what?) 
All (yeah, yeah yeah) night (Ow! ow)
(To freak it with the) All (now let me get a piece of this) 
(Let me get a piece B) Night

[Common] 
Check it, check it 
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail 
Trying to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell 
Locked in this Grid like a Tupac tale 
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail 
My third eye is my rail, on this Illa-thought 
With afro-centric stamps I'm mailing thoughts 
To my Gods held in court 
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk 
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk 
I guess the hustling is the unspoken Gospel 
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago 
E Bottom, here's the bottle 
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel 
(Come on baby) Bust it 

[Erykah Badu] 
I just want to rock you 
All night long 
All (come on baby) 
All night long, all night long,
All night long, on and on and on and on (come on baby) 
I just want to rock you (all night long) 
All night long (all night long) 
All (on and on and on and on)
I (all night long) just want to rock you (all night long) 
All night long (all night long) 
(What? Yo-yo, yo-yo yo-yo check it, check it)
On and on and on and on

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense 
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses 
Opportunity and the beat knocks 
Women, give me rhythm like beat box, but it's the year 
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash' 
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks 
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike 
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got sight 
Like a destruction worker, when it's time to build 
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's "Time to Kill" 
In perseverance I'm a find a meal, and provoke 
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat 
It go

[Erykah Badu (Common)] 
All, night, all night 
All, night, you got it goin' all night 
All, night, y'know, y'know it all night 
All, night (yea, yeah) 

[Erykah Badu] 
I just want to rock you (one more time) 
All night long, (ebb in feelings) 
I just want to rock you (I ain't sleeping) 
All night long (all night long) 
On and on and on and on

[Common] 
Check it 
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat 
Some people got ignorance confused with bein street 
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet 
Arguing over thick broads and meals with no meat 
Had the cold feet for a second 
Mega-niggas in my box throwing suggestions 
Had me checking myself and double checking, I popped the "Resurrection"
In the mirror I only heard my reflection 
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections 
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections 
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents 
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips 
Writing niggas with stripes, I hold posture with 
Popping shit to fat broads, wearing ostrich 
Giving 'em voice mail, tracks are like County 
To them I voice-jail, if you believe in Heaven 
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell? 
Why is this choice Hell? 

[Erykah Badu] 
I just want to rock you 
All night long, (keep going) 
I just want to rock you (keep going, keep going, keep on) 
(And don't you give up) All night long (ah keep on, ah keep on) 
(ah keep on, ah keep, ah don't you give up) 
I (all night long) jus' want to rock you (all night long) 
All night long (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) 
On and on and on and on (keep it going baby) 
(If you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) 
I just want to rock you (all night long) 
All night log (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) 
(all night long) On and on and on and on 

All (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) night 
All (and if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) night 
All night 
All night 
All night 
All (don't stop now) night (no no no, no, uh-uh) 
All (you bet' not stop) night 
All night 

Yeah, Common Sense, and Badu

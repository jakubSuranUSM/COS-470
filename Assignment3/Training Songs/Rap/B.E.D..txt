I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly
I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly

Ay, what it is what you wanna know?
I done ripped about a hundred shows
You'll be coming back to me
Ay, you'll be coming back to me
Always worried 'bout them other hoes
And you'll be on me when the money flows
And they be looking out for Quees
And they be looking out for Quees
Bitch bad, no Kanye
When we do it, do it our way
2015 Wanya
I don't give no damn 'bout what ya mom say
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit
Twenty one with no kids
'Bout to rain on a bitch (what)
I'mma rain on a bitch

I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly
I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly

Baby girl, she the action
Don’t know why you actin
She on ready-set-go, she will never let go
Need it all, f*ck a fraction
Know she think I'm Michael Jackson
Billie Jean, moon walk
I need the front and the back end
She in love with the fashion
But she in love with the flashin'
Bitch, this ain't ya money
Bitch, I spend it on you ‘cause you know I have it
With my woes in the six
Ex hoes, yeah, they sick
I'mma rain on a bitch
Let me rain on a bitch

I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly
I know you wanna love
But I just wanna f*ck
And girl you know the deal
I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grinding slowly

Rollie wrist, I'm the shit
Twenty one with no kids
I'mma rain on a bitch
'Bout to rain on a bitch
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit
Twenty one with no kids
I'mma rain on a bitch
'Bout to rain on a bitch
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit

'Bout to rain on a bitch
Rollie wrist, I'm the shit
Twenty one with no kids
I'mma rain on a bitch
'Bout to rain on a bitch

[Chorus]
Girl I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl things are still the same
Girl I gotta go, I can't stay
We stay together putting the front on
I'd rather be on my own

When we first met things were fine
We went out to dine
We strolled the beach, holding hands sharing quality time
What happened between then and now
The love we shared was lost somehow
(my friends tried to tell me)
That we're moving too fast
But how could I know the feelings would pass
It wouldn't last
I know I should've left a long time ago
But I stayed to see
Still hoping and praying you still love me

[Chorus: x2]

Listen
I took you in treated your children as mine
Then we laid and made love
And you had my son what a precious time
I did all that I could to get through to you
To let you know girl it's you I was living for
(but you let your mind play games on you)
Then when I'm not around
You think that I don't know
That you're passing time with the guy next door
I gave you all that I had
You didn't love me one ounce
So like a basket ball I gotta bounce

[Chorus]

Bridge
Listen
Baby can you tell me
Where I went wrong yeah
All I ever wanted baby baby baby
Was a happy home (ohhh) to call my own (ohhh)
I can't take no more (no doubt)
So I'm telling you
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye

[Chorus: x2]

Break it down
Break it down
Um
Cause I want to talk to my people this evening
Come on
And let em know it takes a fool to learn (it takes a fool)
That love don't love nobody
That's why I can truly say in my heart
Love don't live here (love don't live here anymore)
Good God almighty
Baby you hurt me so bad
But oh I'm mighty grateful
Love don't live here (love don't live here anymore)
Oh
It's alright, it's ok
Gonna move on anyone (I can move on)
Yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Baby you hurt me so bad
I gotta move on
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I gotta go I gotta leave baby
Cause love don't live here
Um
I think I leave it alone now
Yeah yeah yeah yahoo hmmm

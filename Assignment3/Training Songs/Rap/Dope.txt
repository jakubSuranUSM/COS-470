Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now hold me close
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Okay) Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Yes, yes) I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Uh, alright) Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now hold me close

Anonymous bending corners with burners on us
Come and ride a minute
Birkin duffle a hundred thousand in it
Aye, nigga, roll up
Anyway, D'Usse mixed with lemonade
Feeling good like I'm dealing yay, moving ten a day
Time limit never
Could do this shit forever
Can't even put it in words, how I am in love with her
From slinging work on the curb, hustling drugs with her
The jet ride 50 million, a wonderful feeling
Shit, I'm high as a motherfucker
Don't ask me shit, make me lie to you motherfucker
Man truth is for real, feel like Dre and Pharrell
Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim, shawty hell on the scale
And still the game enticing me, like every time I see her
They like to pop a seal, high enough to see Aaliyah
For real, and man I know the art of chill
You don't know how good it make a nigga feel

Boy I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you really get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker

This winter shit got me high as a bitch
Dripping sauce, kicking flavor, super fly with the shit
Don't need a gram to get laid, an ounce to get paid
G Kush to roll up, the drink to pour up
Anyone know us, they know trap shit in our DNA
Numbers on a need-to-know basis, this ain't no Q&A
I promised Dre that I would put the game on lock
And ain't no taking that shit back, put it on everything I got
Goddamn
Aventador, hopping out a Lamb
In residential areas flyin', I'm getting out of damn
Ma'am tell your son he better watch it, 'cause we rollin'
And disrespect is not an option in my neighborhood
So watch how you talking to me
Even if we know you hating, then that is all it can be
'Cause if call in all the niggas indebted to me
Find you ass OD'd
Dead as can be

Boy I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you really get me
High as a motherfucker

Okay, counting’, watching, call it that old thing
Blowing gasoline to put my hat on lean
Where I stay all they say is “F*ck Trump”, all day
Two or three pistols, lead with me and a Wraith
She brought an ‘O of kush to me and a six pack
Okay, well, I’m about to roll it up and hit that
Now I’mma make her wipe me down like a wet sink
Ride it like a jet ski, pass it to the next bitch, aye

Boy I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you really get me high
I'm high as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker

Look, I'm telling you, man
Yeah, you can get the high I'm on
I mean winter got me blowed, man
I swear, haha
Dre! Where you get this shit, man?
Yeah, from the westside own, man, you dig
You know, I swear to God man
I ain't known a bad day in so long
You know, thank God
Aye man, life ain't, life ain't like this for you, man?
I swear to God, you should pray more
Yeah, bankrolls on bankrolls, man, you dig?
Aaliyah, we miss you
Yeah, oh, alright
Yeah, yeah, well that's swell
Well that's swell, uh

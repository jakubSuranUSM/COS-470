I heard the phone ring, it's you 
Telling me all I do is neglect you 
The first thing that I wanna say 
You know I've been working hard all day, baby 
I don't trip on what your friends say 
'Cause you know they all want me anyway 
You know that I'll be true to you 
My love can't start until 

After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long 
After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long

And now that 12 o'clock is here 
I wanna please you and I'm being sincere 
The rest of the night is yours and mine 
We're gonna chill, relax and unwind baby 
I go to work tired each and every day 
'Cause I spent the night before pleasing my babe 
You know that I am true to you 
But love can't start until 

After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long 
After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long

You, you will never be alone 
'Cause I know just how to keep my baby satisfied 

After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long 
After 12, before 6 
I want you all up in my mix 
I wanna make love to you 
All night long

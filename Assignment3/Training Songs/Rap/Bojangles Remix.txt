I see the way you move and I picture you nude
Baby keep movin' that thing, baby keep movin' that thing
I wanna take you to the boom boom room
So we can do it like boom, boom, boom, boom

Pleasure, yes, God bless
I love my women rated triple-X
Let me show you how we do it 'round here
Man the women they don't fake it they get naked down here

It's da bottom, no bras no drawers
Da bottom, where they holla "Take it off!"
Da bottom, where we turn out daughters
Just to plan a lick on the father, we got 'em

Take it back to the floor, jigga, jigga, jigga
Bend over touch toes, jigga, jigga, jigga

Take it to the, take it to the house
Party, I'm a take it, I'm a take it to her mouth
Boy I'm a take 'em, I'm a take 'em to the South
Where them schools got classics like Jay-Z's "Reasonable Doubt?

Pit is always reppin' for them boyz up the road
For them boyz on the block yellin' "We base blow"
Watch where ya at 'cause they will tag ya toe
Liberty City'll leave yo? ass John Doe

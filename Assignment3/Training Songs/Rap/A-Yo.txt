Even though we love you
You know we don't have that much time
To really, really, really f*ck with you
[Repeat: x2]
F*ck with you

[Fam]
I be cuttin' the f*ck up and down
Side to side, all around
All the time, often now (with a raw sound)
Who's the man, damn, fam can jam
Rush, rumble, ram, slam
And kickin' tall cans

[Diesel]
Stop the presses, hold up, stop the damn presses!
I'm next up to flex, mic checks to address this
Feelin, feelin
I got a feelin
Adrenaline, got me tremblin
I got the style
Can't hold it back 'cause I'm too damn wild

[Fam]
Oh hell no, a rugged road rebel flow
Hell yeah - why'know
Same brotha, scarface, braided afro
Outlaw, rottin raskal

[Diesel]
Guess who, the hooligan you hate to see
Yesterday was in your face, but now I'm in your tv
The same nigga from da bricks
Fightin clicks for kicks
I don't care; I really don't give a damn
Smack yo' up and pass you to my swingin fam

[Fam]
Poof, now be gone (ok)
Cause this is how we play every rottin' single holiday

[Chorus: x2]
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go

[Fam]
A-yo, a-yo, is it so, is it so?
Please tell me no, oh no, no, oh no, no
You claim to be schizophrenic
But practically panic
When me and my clique roll tight and thick
Like the titanic
They should have it banned
Ghetto pass revoked, stands branded
My choke, you couldn't manage
The yolk do too much damage

[Diesel]
Pop goes the diesel
No, never that, don't try and dirty-mac
You rodent, you river rat
Raps counter-react, they counter-attack
You're a tat for tat that's wack
And it bee's like that, black
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Giving props to KRS-1 for staying true to the ghetto streets

[Chorus: x2]

[Fam]
Here I come, with nothing ever so harder
Niggaz in every hood, welcome my style back like carter
Huh, two times for the hoes
May I exposed to those
My mack daddy ride flows
(flow on then, nigga, hey, don't let me stop ya)
Get in my way an' I'll stop, drop and mop ya
Like that, oh, what ya gonna do now?
Niggas running and ducking, there's a riot going down
But ain't nothing new to my clique or my town
I tell you I'm good with these klickow-klickow

[Diesel]
You have run an over turn
When my lyrics start to burn
Like the chronic in the blunt
And you can't front on the skunk
That's kicking in like jail toes
Who knows what the f*ck goes on
You're trying play me, you're dead wrong
So all you silly slipping slouches
I be flipping on ya
Pop the lip, I have my fist steady sticking on ya
I mean, man, I'm like amazing
And you know ain't no fazing
This double I bunch been ripping and raging

[Chorus: x4]

[Fam]
118 - ha!
235 in the click
115, you know what I'm saying?
I got my road dogs, my cruddy click
Naughty with the by with the nature
You know what I'm saying?
Niggas can't f*ck around
Don't know why they act like they can
Ha-ha-ha
Yeah
Inglewood, illtown
Double I
Double I
Double I
Don't even try
Double I

(Hey, hey, yo Rottin razkals in this, nigga)
My cruddy click
My road dogs
Naughty with the by to the nature
And we out, but we don't hate ya

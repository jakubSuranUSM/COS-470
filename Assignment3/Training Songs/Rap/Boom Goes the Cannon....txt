Uh
Yeah

Boom! Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit-spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating? Nah
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! Goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' take the war and run them outta here

Check it out
That's my right hand man we like the Bobbsey Twins
You got my back, I got your back when the shots begins
We grew up in the slums, broke bread together
When worse came to worse, rolled out the weather
Had faith, knew it couldn't be this bad forever
And once the sun shined, it could only get better
Birds of a feather, we on the same page
Since high school, four crews, whatever came our way
Your kids is my kids, vice-versa
You ain't ask who the beef with, only where the burner
Never blink a eye, or back down just hold the fort down
From Q.B. to Strong Isle, my soldiers running wild, we wyldin'
Courtesy of projects houses
And though you not here, you lookin' down at me smiling
We took a oath to keep the name afloat
We Infamous forever, homie, the ultimate G.O.A.T.S

Boom! Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit-spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating? Nah
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! Goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' take the war and run them outta here

Yeah, yeah
We are at war, no man is safe
You can't hide forever
Die on the battlefield to rise up and take power
It's 32,000 troops in New York harbor
We outgunned, out manned, and outnumbered
It's 32,000 troops in New York harbor
We out planned, out our minds pushing forward
We a powder keg about to explode
Wish we had a man like Hamilton to lighten the load
Send the word, get 'em
He want to fight, he got the hunger
Yeah, I was just like him when I was younger
Uh, head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr, but look
Dying is easy young man, livin' is harder
It's gon' be pools of blood in New York Harbor (Rah!)
Gunfire and cannonballs, it's on, son
Pools of blood in New York Harbor (Rah!)
Willin' to die in Revolutionary War, dunn

Boom! Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit-spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating? Nah
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! Goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when
Boom! Goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' take the war and run them outta here

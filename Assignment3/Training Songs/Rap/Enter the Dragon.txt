Yiggy yiggy yaw if you want to play
Yiggy yiggy yaw when the dragon slay
Yiggy yiggy yaw if you dare to stay
Yiggy yiggy yaw yiggy yiggy yay

Can you dig it?

Praise the lord if you pick up the chase
Daytona 500 you got no case in the speed of life
Move real fast,trace my tracks you better step on the gas
All around the world, we all want to go
Some take the road others go with the flow
U.f.o or mirrorball, disco dancing pussy galore
In a black shirt and a red tie
In a leather jacket that looks real fly
"we can plan a murder or start a religion"
Being infinite that's our decision
Organized chaos brings out the noise
Hey ladies,it's just me and my boys!
So let the engine work like a thousand man marathon
Hu! enter the dragon come on!

Yiggy yiggy yaw if you want to play
Yiggy yiggy yaw when the dragon slay
Yiggy yiggy yaw if you dare to stay
Yiggy yiggy yaw yiggy yiggy yay
Enter the dragon! hu!

Front back side to side
Hit low and then we kick high
Enter the dragon! hu!
Front back side to side
Hit low and then we kick high

Kick in the door *blaaau* said it before, my friend
Caught up in the game my life won't be the same again
We're here to take a stand and stand my man
Won't jump on the bandwagon or the train, my friend
The mass is not a fashion or a trend
We're not the saint that go marching in, my friend
And by the way let me say "va g√∂r do len?"
Watch out when the dragon blow out flames
Yiggy yiggy yaw inhale
Yiggy yiggy yay exhale

Abracadabra!

Time to bail, make me disappear from this fairy tail
Better get, get it right
Tell you what, what it's like
When you want, want to try
Reaching up, up the sky
Hitting low, low and high
Mash up, mash up your life, cut the crap
I wa wa-want the knife

Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yay
Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yay
Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yay
Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yaw
Yiggy yiggy yay

Yiggy yiggy yaw if you want to play
Yiggy yiggy yaw when the dragon slay
Yiggy yiggy yaw if you dare to stay
Yiggy yiggy yaw yiggy yiggy yay

I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, trying to make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, got them boys caught up

I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down (slow down)
You don't know me (don't know me)
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now (go now), back up off me (off me)

Oh, I got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

Oh, I'm much wiser than you think that I act like, you know
Just because I'm a teen it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie, boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now, back up off me

Oh, I got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

One day, wheezy
Baby, tonight's the night
And them girls are on me like white on rice
And I get them to the crib late, two on one
I'm already high, now it's you I want
Take a jet into the sunset, you won't come
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up your little wrists till you're blue and numb, um
You're dealin' with a buster, mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
If I were you, I'd tell my homies "I'll holla"
And if your man ain't me, why bother?
I go by the name Carter, I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checkin' out the charts on the charter
Number one spot: Wayne and Paula

Uh oh, got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, oh, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy

Uh oh, got them going crazy, you see, uh oh
Head over heels for me, oh, uh oh
Weak in the knees for me, boy, uh oh
Cause you so damn easy (no, no, no, no, no)

Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy

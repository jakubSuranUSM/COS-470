Did you ever had a concrete wave
Did you ever had a concrete wave
Did you ever had a concrete wave
What it’s say, what it’s say
Pay me cracks just next to 
Pay me cracks just next to 
Pay me cracks just next to 
Money was spent to 
What you do to feel me 
Will bring one down just once sleep for

Did you ever had a concrete wave
Did you ever had a concrete wave
On back to the golden 
Do the top my hand goes burn
With thoughts of you I never learn

Ah ah ah ah do you want em, noh
Ah ah ah ah so you want me, noh
Ah ah ah ah do you want em, no
Ah ah ah do you want me

Did you ever try to burn a breeze
Did you ever try to burn a breeze
Did you ever try to burn a breeze
Like a it’s not easy
Have a little few too flame
Have a little bit few to fire
Have a little bit few fame
Watch it burn watch it blame higher
Won’t I or quite alright
If you don’t tell blaze hand tonight

Did you ever try to burn a breeze
Candles the trees
Did you ever
See grant see grants on your fine
If you can’t whisper to some whine

Ah ah ah ah do you want em, noh
Ah ah ah ah so you want me, noh
Ah ah ah ah do you want em, no
Ah ah ah do you want me

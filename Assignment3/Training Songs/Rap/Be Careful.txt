[Sparkle] 
Two years ago, promises is all I heard
Wait a minute, let me finish
Two years ago, promises is all I heard
Out of your mouth
Now you want to walk away boy
And tear down the walls in this house
You used to tell me sweet things
Sweet things in the morning time
Now all you do is hurt me
And think that everything is fine

[Chorus]
You better be careful what you say to me
'Cause it might turn around on you
You better be careful what you do to me
'Cause somebody might do it to you

Now who was there for you when your ass was out of work?
All by myself, taking Little Man to church
So quick to hang up the phone, when I step in the room
Then you want to turn it all around
I'm gettin' tired of playin' fool

[Chorus]

[Sparkle]+(R.Kelly)
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

[R.Kelly] 
Two years ago, didn't know you had male friends
Wait a minute, let me finish
Two years ago, didn't know you had male friends
Off up in college
I found out you're still reaching out to some of them
Misses Busy Body
You used to listen to me
When you were down and lost
But now, you don't even respect me
Ever since I got laid off

[Chorus]
Now who gave you money when your ass was broke, without a dime?
And even though Little Man is not my child, I made him mine, mm hmm
So quick to run to your friends
And talk about, what we do in this house
And then you want to party all night long
What the hell you talkin' 'bout?

[Chorus]
[R.Kelly]+(Sparkle)
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

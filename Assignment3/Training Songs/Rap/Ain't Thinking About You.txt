Not goin' let it stress me no more

I won't put up wit' you and yo' drama
No, not tonight
(No, not tonight; I ain't thinkin' 'bout ya)
Your insecurities ain't gonna stop me
No, not tonight
(I'm gonna get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you)
I did everything that you wanted me to
I was everything that you wanted me to...
Floss up in the street, representin' you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No, still not enough, so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you
(Get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you)

[Chorus:]
No, oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo
I won't play myself no more
No, oh, ooo, oh, oh, ooo
Said, I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this, oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you
(Get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you)

You fuss at me 'cause yo' girl think I'm fly
(Just how the hell can you say that's my fault?)
But if they're undressin' me
(Won't you tell yo' girls to check they eyes?)
Starin' at yo' guy, oh
I was everything that you wanted me to...
I did everything that you wanted me to
Floss up in the street, representin' you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No, still not enough, so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you
(Get up, get out, ain't thinkin' about you)

[Chorus]

Go on and fresh fit, and gas up the whip
And get where I'm a get tonight
Said, I tried my best to be your best
And now I'm stressed out
Pop a bottle or two wit' you and my crew
Ain't thinkin' 'bout you tonight
Stress somebody else
I am gonna enjoy myself tonight

No, oh, ooo, oh, ooo
Said, I won't play myself no more
No, oh, ooo, oh, ooo
Said, I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this, oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you
(Get up, get out; ain't thinkin' about you)

[Chorus]

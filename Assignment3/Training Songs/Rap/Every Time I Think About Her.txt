Oh Ah ha!

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my Ã¢??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

Every time I think "hey, have you ever been in love?"

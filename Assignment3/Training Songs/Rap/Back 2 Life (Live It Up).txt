Steady, are you ready?
Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

Goin’ through a dark place, dark time
And I couldn’t even see the light (light)
Had my back up against the wall
I was feelin’ like do or die (die)
But what don’t kill me make me stronger
I know it’s gonna be alright (alright)
So we celebratin’ here tonight (tonight)
Yea we celebratin’ life tonight

The time is now
Gotta make it count
So before we die
Let’s go all out

We gotta live it up (up up up up)
Champagne in my cup (cup cup cup cup)
DJ turn it up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea we gotta live it up (up up up up)
You know we don’t give a what (what what what what)
So till my time’s up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Back 2 life

Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

All the tears and all of the prayers
Every single one of y’all showed me (showed me)
So the love I’m givin’ back to y’all
Is bigger than the whole country
From England, to Japan, to Jamaica
To right down to MIA
We don’t stop, we go hard
Let’s get it in cause we young and free

The time is now
Gotta make it count
So before we die
Let’s go all out

We gotta live it up (up up up up)
Champagne in my cup (cup cup cup cup)
DJ turn it up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea we gotta live it up (up up up up)
You know we don’t give a what (what what what what)
So till my time’s up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Back 2 life

Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

Here’s the king!

OK, them suckas tried to bury me
Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain’t no scarin’ me
Apparently, you don’t understand who I am (who I am)
It’s trouble man, hundred grand in my pants
Whippin’ dropheads hardtops fit to sell Maybach’s
Maserati’s, Ferrari’s, that money I don’t play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shinin’ on them make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Lookin’ for me to roll over and die
Who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, come back to life
I guess this is me ballin’ in the afterlife
Let’s get it

Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

We gotta live it up (up up up up)
Champagne in my cup (cup cup cup cup)
DJ turn it up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea we gotta live it up (up up up up)
You know we don’t give a what (what what what what)
So till my time’s up (up up up up)
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Back 2 life

We at it again

Ok, I got my bathin' apes, check, outfit, check
No need to iron, might need to iron
Wit these jewels on, it?s likely they'll be iron
Ask mami dancin' beside me if she ridin'

Or what she sippin' on, mink got my fitted on
She somethin' vivid on, we came to get it on
Came to get it on, drink a lil' here
Everybody throw a drink in the air
It's goin' down, come on

I stepped in da party like whoa
What's da deal wit it? Ain't no hands in da air unless it's a drink wit it
Honeys lovin' 'cus they know I rock da bells in here
Thugs wit me 'cus they know I roll wit Kells and dem

Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
And I'm glad I brought my ass to the right party

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no going home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Stack my chips, make dem hits and
I can tell that y'all love my shit
And got my shirt off, wit my Timbs on
Here all night so you know it's going on

Mami shake it like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a tangerine
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
Glad I brought my ass to the right party tonight

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

No more excuses, now in the two doors exclusive
And everything is all inclusive
We can do it all if my boys included
On da phone wit her friends invite 'em all, let's do this

Get things juicy, it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty
New Kells playing feelin' on yo' booty

Keys to the Ferrar, leave in the garage
Starts wit a massage, ends wit m√©nage
Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m., gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m., on my way to the tel
But then around six, same thing, different chick
XL mag, perfect fit, now to the bridge, let's go

Baby showin' me all these crazy things
Got me nibblin' on her belly ring
'Bout to get into the swing of things
She keep rubbin' againist my swinga thing

We off up in the other room so hot
Shorty's about to take off that pink tank top
All I wanna say is, shorty drop it like it's hot
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Ooh, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all fucked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts, ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo, it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home, the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body, it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Da, da, da

Yo Jeff what's shakin' man
Whats up dude
Ay man remember that girl you know when I was walking to school
She used to diss me everyday (yeah)
Man the record came out she called me 2 days ago
Man my phone is off the hook with people asking me for tapes and free records
I ain't with it
Word man 
Bust this

This rap is for the people in the past who were against me
Who snapped at every opportunity to diss me
Put me down like I was nothing treated me like a jerk
Now I'm seeing the pay off of all my hard work
But now that its my records on the reel
Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
For those in the past who dissed me don't deny it
What? Your sorry? Don't even try it

Word man
People are a trip
Putting everybody down what's up with that
Word man I gotta let em know I gotta
Bust this

I used to know this girl by the name of Teresa
I did all I could to make her release her
Emotions to me but she just wouldn't do it
She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it
I used to walk to school everyday of the week
Watching Teresa walk on the other side of the street
One day I finally got my heart up to speak
She dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
So I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne
But all I got from Teresa was
(leave me alone)
Bought new clothes to wear every place
But all Teresa would say was
(get out of my face)
So I gave up this quest for Teresa
But then on the day my record was released
A strange thing happened when it came on the radio
Teresa broke her neck just to say (hello)
I looked at her I said you must be foolish
Why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said
(oh I apologize)
I looked deep into her dark brown eyes
I said you ignored me for months on end
Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend
You didn't talk before so don't talk now what be quiet
What you really like me? Don't even try it

Man she had a lot of nerve man (word)
But man she ain't have half as much nerve as that record producer
The one that dissed us man
What up

When I first started rapping I had one idea
And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist
I'll give my all and work my hardest
But when I took my song to a record producer
He told me that I better go drink some rap juice or
Something because my song was really absurd
He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
Yo my ego was shattered he busted my groove
I could hear him cracking up as I left the room
I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
The title was girls ain't nuthin' but trouble
Hopefully I found someone who had faith
He lifted my ego back up into place
His name was Dana Goodman (chill) he thought the song was on track
So two weeks later it was out on wax
It busted up the charts like a hydrogen bomb
Up up up it climbed climbed climbed
People eat their words that said I couldn't achieve
Now they have no choice bit to believe in me
Then no sooner than my record came out
That same old producer started calling my house
One night he called me about half past 12
I've got some cash if you wanna sell
I said you big stupid half wit idiot
I told you before that my record was a hit
I just laughed like some kind of kid
Now don't you regret what you did
I wish you'd get off my tip now that's my request
See he who laughs last always laughs best
Okay I'll be reasonable you wanna buy it
Okay I'll sell it psyche don't even try it

You know what I'll tell you sumthin'
I got this so hard man
I'm a tell you sumthin'

Yo Prince you remember when we first started out
How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house
Word man I remember those good days well
Well chill out man cause I got a story to tell
About five years ago I began my quest to be the best DJ in the whole US
There was a lot of DJ's striving in my spot
They were putting me down every chance I got
Never cut me a break on any given night
They used to all look at me and say
(Jeff's alright)
But when your magnificent cuts were released
All of that left has ceased (word)
When you and I used to do our shows
All the crowd would say is Ho
Yeah time after time we were tearin' it up
While you rock the mic and I rocked the cut
But now that I'm making a name for myself
All those DJ's are like
Yo Jeff whats up
All that stuff is dead nope I ain't with it
They'll push me on the street and say
(yo Jeff how bout a ticket man)
To your very next show
But I say no
And I tell them where they can go
I cant believe that they have the nerve
To hop on my tip now
Yeah man word
Just the other day homeboy approached me on the street and said
"yo Jeff how bout a record for free"
Man the way you dissed me you better go buy it
But man we're friends for real don't even try it

Man straight up you know how it is
Word
Maybe they'll know not to diss next time
We let em know
Cause I ain't with it
Aight Jeff chill

Good to see you, love, I know it's been a while
It’s obvious you're doin' good, look at you now
Heard you broke up with your man, what’s that about?
We should catch a drink or two, how long you around? Yeah

So tell me what you need to
Get back to you and me, you
Got me rememberin'
Just how fuckin' good it used to be (Ayy)
Need you in my life
So I gotta tell you right

(I will always want you)
I will always want you (So long)
Oh, I will always want you (You can feel it, girl)

Girl, I broke your heart with conditions
I did it all in hopes that you'd listen (To me)
Now he don't need to be in your life
And truth is, girl, neither do I (Oh)

Get back to you and me, you
Got me rememberin'
Just how fuckin' good it used to be (Ayy)
Need you in my life
So I gotta tell you right

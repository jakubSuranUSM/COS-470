Tonight is the jam
I'll be there till dawn
I'm going down, I've got my big hoops on
Pant leg so wide, I've got my backpack on
I'm gonna hear my favorite song

Hey hey hey, what's the scenario
That boy keeps passin' my by
I said no diggity, no doubt
I thought I told you I was fly
Yeah he and all of his friends they
They got that hair like high five

I donâ€™t wanna talk about sex
Wanna express myself tonight

I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day 
Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day

I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never seen something like that

That boy gonna feel my poison
I know he can't stand the rain
I wanna be down with ya baby
Back and forth, back and forth
Back, back, back and forth
You got my rump rump shaking
I'm another bad creation, I'm real
And I never have to fake it fake it
Ya know I gotta move quick
And I gotta move slow
Cause there no end in the road

I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day
Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day

I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that

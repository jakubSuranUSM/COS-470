(Hey babe)

Race home, open the door, run upstairs,
Throw my bag on the floor, log on, two seconds later,
I get a message from you saying 'hey baby'

Been going crazy thinking bout you all day,
So much to tell you, boy I feel the same way,
Can't wait to see you, just you
And I cause every night I've been thinking what it would be like.

I get a rush,
More than a crush,
Almost love,
Makes me feel high,
Every time I think about us.
Even though we talk every day I still can't get enough,
I'm out of pulse, getting kinda close, almost love.

I'm 5'6 your 5'10, 14, 15, talk twenty four-seven,
34, 24, 36, talk twenty four seven,
For-ever, l-o-l, you and I,talk twenty four-seven,
G-2-g, x-o-x-o, uh, uh, uh, twenty four seven

Give you my number,
You call, we were both nervous,
Said nothing at all,
I was breathless, you were speechless,
Said it good to finally hear your voice,
Started talking, kinda random,
Said you were a shy boy, for such a fly boy,
You said it's you that makes me feel that way,
I'm like sometimes even I don't know what to say

I get a rush, more than a crush, almost love,
Makes me feel high,
Every time I think about us.
Even though we talk every day I still can't get enough,
I'm not opposed,
Getting kinda close, almost love.

How I wish you were here now,
How I, how I, how I, how I wish you were here,
How I wish you were here now, b-b-b-boy, b-b-b-boy,
Boy, boy, boy how I wish you were here now,
Boy, boy, boy, wish you were here now.

See his hat cocked, can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With the blue STL on, who that but me?
Who else behind the tints of the new GT?
The continental all blue got em feeling real blue
Till they stomachs stick too, fo real, they grossed out
19's I come, 22's poke out
Just to see when they roll out, I'm killin'' the folks now
His money just chingy, my money it fold out
Man, this happened vegas, and they hit me for a mil' worth
How many rappers man can tell you what a mil' worth
All my life damn worryin bout a meals worth

I'm def'er than Jermaine, you could say I'm so so
Player tailor made, that's a no no
Sure it a 'aftermath', but I ain't a doctor
Squad full of 'BG's', city full of them choppas
Way more 'Game' than the kid with the G-Unit
Cracks by the gram an hour, that's a G-Unit
Like Ciara when I'm keeping the 'Goodies'
'cause' I'm Jazzy like Pha with a tank in the Hoody
I'm Like..

Yeah, you need to make your mind up
Ain't see her by now, you ain't gon' find her
She looks good, but she looks finer
Like (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Yeah, King Jacob, you ain't gotta know
But yet you soon will, 'cause you gotta know
Got the type that make ya baby momma OD
Like (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Okay, now let me see you do it baby,
Okay, don't be afraid go now
And don't be ashamed of how you do it baby,
Just (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

You see I'm tired of playin' games with
Niggas with money names
For real money, you lame
I put your money to shame
Ha, this ain't cynical
(Naw) This ain't subliminal
I'm physical, financial and mental to be a general
Why lil momma case you want a {soldier}
Not the type that in the tank but in the {Rover}
Yeah man you at the game orderin' refreshments
(Where I'm at?)
I'm on the floor watching my investment
Buttoned up, some call it grown up look
I like to call it havin money that fold up look
That Don Perignon, Cristal cold up look
Got her (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Okay, now let me see you do it baby,
Okay, don't be afraid go now
And don't be ashamed of how you do it baby,
Just (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

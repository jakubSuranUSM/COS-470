It took a keys and Jay-Z to get this city poppin' now
Rob base Snoop Dogg to get it rockin' now
Big money talking, Mayweather, Paquiao
Gucci soft up cause he cant hard top it now
Now what you boys got a death wish
I beat a mothafucka' uglier than precious
Real nigga, you can find me where the x is
Whippin' in the kitchen, both hands ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin' more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I don't buy stocks
Tell a little mothafucka' get his shine pa
Good fellas hood fellas living on my block
Nigga got a problem, I solve em (solve 'em)
A couple keys yes nigga we'll rob em (rob 'em)
Got tha 9 milli in my pants, case you niggas wanna dance
Leave a mothafucka' shakin' like Harlem (Harlem)

I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams
What's up?

Next up a homicide 
Ain't nobody seens shit
Wake up to a homicide, 
Ain't nobody dreams to
Welcome to the home of the 
Home invasion
D-E-A like to raid, 
You might get your home raided
Went up in it it l
Ike a halfback from the Raiders
Bring a half mac 
Anything for that paper
2 door phantom 
Avatar blue though
Parked outta space shit 
We call that bitch Pluto
Grown living legend 
In the hood I'm a hero,
On that minute fourteen 
Like a guitar hero
Came a long way 
From that toilet bowl white though
But I'm a be alright though

I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams

Always on my hard shit, joey Viagra
Pull up make em car sick, abracadabra
Presto magic, Bugatti's on the scene
Party's all around me like its gotti on the scene
Your money N-B-A N-F-L all legal
My niggas on the block going hard pumpin' diesel
However do you want it
Joe stay blunted
I gets off but the hoe stay on it
This is my castle but it ain't white though
Ice so bright shit shine like a light show
This my life yo go get yours bitch
Ball till we fall till the drugs hit the ball pit
Cocaine cowboys that's my thing
Do it for my niggas locked down in the bing in the state
In the Fed pen my name rings
I don't need your respect the streets crowned me King

I said we came in this bitch tonight to murder things
We gonna leave this bitch tonight a murder scene
In black from head to toe we murder clean
Do you know the name of the click that murder teams

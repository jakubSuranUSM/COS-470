Chorus:
Girl it¡¯s alright, baby
'Cause it¡¯s there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me
 
Left once again at home
Another night on your own
Ain't no fun in lovin if you¡¯re lovin alone 
How does it feel to be useless, oh no
Can you recall how close we used to be then
Can you still remember those feelings again
Seems like everytime I see you
There¡¯s a tear in your eye
Time to make some decisions
Or go dying inside
 
Rap:
Tell ¡¯em all call me a fool
But I¡¯m stuck in this love thing
Plus I¡¯m over heatin¡¯ from the rush
Our tongues touch
Kissin' fellin' fireworks
Watch the sky
I makes you smile
But you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and leave now
With my heart on my sleeve 
Memories now what I found is you
Still care you had feelings
And they¡¯re still there baby
Girl keep it real here
Are you still down?
 
Chorus:
Girl it¡¯s alright, baby
'Cause it¡¯s there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me
 
Remember that evening
I knew that you were too scared
To go all the way
But you did it to please me
You were crying it was raining
When you gave it to me
The more I see you
The more that I feel inside
And I know one day 
You¡¯ll make it back to where you can fly
Watch time go, don¡¯t cry 
Tomorrow brings better days
Let me dry your eyes
And take your burden away
 
Rap:
Only once in a lifetime
Touch my soul go slow
Baby boo don¡¯t rush the flow
Got me all weak baby
But I¡¯m strong in parts
More bounce to the ounce
With the longest sparks
Gettin' mine like fine wine
Measured in time
Many other brothers loved you 
But the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how 
To love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it
So it¡¯s properly done
Are you still down?
 
Girl it's alright baby
'Cause it's there in your eyes yeah
I can see that you want me
By the way that you smile
Are you still down for me?

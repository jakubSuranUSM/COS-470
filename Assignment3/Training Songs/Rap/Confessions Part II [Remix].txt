Yeah,listen

Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But, I gotta Get it off my chest about all Shit I've been hearing babe
I (I) thought you was that ride or die you would neva leave my side
I really made you out to be the woman that I would be with for life

I tooked in your kids, Did everything that you wanted me to
Now I see you frontin on radio interviews
Do It make you feel good to lie even though I know you wanna cry
Hey if you were gonna tell them You should of told them everything, Instead of Makein me the bad guy

If you got nothing good to say then don't, say nothin
'Cause if I really start talkin it will be somthin,
So you cheated, I cheated so be it,we need to Leave it alone, Move on
{You got real shit}

Hello, you have a collect call from the Clinton correctional facility, 
Will you accept the charges.
Yes, I'll accept it, whats up?

Sittin in my cell, HEAD ABOUT TO BURST
Wouldnt be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'll be in da grave if I didn't let it spray

I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walkin on this earth is
That night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[Intro: J.D.]
Uh, listen up listen up listen up world
Listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess
This the hottest remix I ever did in my life so so def

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions

If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth (uh, oh)
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill

And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day

You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions

Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout
Damn, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin

And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there

There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't say,matter fact dont say jack,
Everytime a nigga sittin on paystacks
Things come up from way way way back way back way back way way back

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions

The world I know
Is a world too slow.
If you don't move fast enough, keep your head low.

The world I know
Is a world much too slow.
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child.

And I want to lay in the passenger seat of a car;
We could drive around all night.
We wouldn't have to go too far,
Just look at the stars.
This night could be ours.

The world I know
Is a world too slow.
If you don't move fast enough, keep your head low.

The world I know
Is a world much too slow.
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child.

And I want a life lover that'll go that far.
We don't have to do this right.
Do you know who you are?
This ride could be ours.
Just look at those stars.

And we are never going home.
This ride is far too long to travel alone,
And the moon will shine brightly on this road.
Which way do you want to go?

The world I know
Is a world too slow.
If you don't move fast enough, keep your head low.

The world I know
Is a world much too slow.
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child.

And I want a life lover that'll go that far.
We don't have to do this right.
Yes I know who you are.
This ride could be ours.
Just look at those stars.
Baby, we could be stars.

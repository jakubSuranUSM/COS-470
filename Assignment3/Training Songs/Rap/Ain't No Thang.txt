A nigga ready from the get go (blowe, blowe, blowe)
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre, can yo punk ass come out to play?
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with you'se better off, dead
Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, pull his file, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do, but no (no, no)
I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away, this ain't goin' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up nigga, if you want some

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps(players), Mack daddies(East Point)
It's all about that see's in yo chest(It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps(players), Mack daddies(East Point)
It's all about that see's in yo chest(It's the joint)

Well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause, it's the
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we goin' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix, yeah
It was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae, ya big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international player, coming through your stereo

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps(players), Mack daddies(East Point)
It's all about that see's in yo chest(It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang

3-5-7 to your forehead, there'll be mo' dead
cause I'ma pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Be-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street
But in my hood hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggaz dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Trippin with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the f*ck I'm doin, I'm releasin anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm takin it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just let you know, yeah

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps(players), Mack daddies(East Point)
It's all about that see's in yo chest(It's the joint)

It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm travelin
No more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he ridin shotgun
And got my pump under my seat,
in case these yougstas wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to,
busting caps with this a heat and load it clip up after clip
I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast ya
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps(players), Mack daddies(East Point)
It's all about that see's in yo chest(It's the joint)

Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Pointe way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking glocks
Steady is the gas nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop

There ain't no mountain 
There ain't no river 
That's gonna keep me away from loving you 
There ain't no valley, no there ain't nothing 
That's gonna keep me away from you 

Ain't no mountain, ain't no river, ain't no valley 
Listen baby 

Ain't no mountain high 
Ain't no valley low 
Ain't no river wide enough baby 
If you need me call 
No matter where you are 
No matter how far 
Just call my name 
I'll be there in a hurry 
You don't have to worry, worry 

Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough' 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you 

Remember the day 
I set you free 
I told you you could always count on me 
From that day on 
I've made a mind 
I'll be back when you want, some way, somehow 

Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough' 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you 

If you need me (I need you) 
Call me no matter where you are 
No matter how far 
Just call my name 
And I'll be there in a hurry 
On that you can depend 
No need to worry 
'Cause you see darling 
There ain't no mountain high enough 
There ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you 

Ain't no mountain high enough (oh yeah) 
Ain't no valley low enough (ooh) 
Ain't no river wide enough (baby baby baby baby) 
To keep me from you 
Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from you 

Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough' 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you

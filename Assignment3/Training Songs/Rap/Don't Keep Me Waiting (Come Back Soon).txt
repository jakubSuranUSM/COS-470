Fellas, grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies, grab a hand
Step in 2's
C. West, Gunnaz
Know 112 is rockin' this

Everybody groovin'
They catch 'n' feel us
Enter the buildin'
See everybody choosin'

I'm looking for somebody
With a body that move it
Think for them women
But my hobby is my music

Still I'm the coolest
Wrist-wear stupid
Glue it, you know you had it good
When you lose it

Don't miss your train, gotta brain
Betta use it
But don't abuse it
Only if you knew it

You could stay up in news
Take you out the buck
N let you coupe it
Late fight

We f*ck until some cupid
No whinin' and dinin'
I hit it from behind and
S. Carter the diamond

I gotta part time it
Baby father home wit the kids
Couldn't time it
She laid back blusha

Rushin' for me to climb in
And this about the only time we get
So right after I hit
Before Ch-ris split

I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too

It was a college drop out
'Til a year out in Cali
House of blues
Right out the blue

Already had it in my mind
I'm rollin' out wit you
I'm tellin' see
She the one

I'm pickin out the crew
Yeah, nice lil' breezy
We busted up balcony
Watchin Kanyeezy

They gotta nigga wheezy
Yeah, tell the bartender
Bring another round
It's cool

We can go through our act
We outta town
I'm kinda feelin'
That she feelin' it too

I'm tryna hit it
Tryna figure
What she willin' to do
Yeah, I mow back a W

Room 112
I love the way she smell
She say it Varcenel
We kiss, get a tell

Spark up the L
That cranberry juice
Wit that good armedel
And we can get into some lil activities

And if it's good
You can come back and visit me

I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too

Fellas, grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies, grab a hand
Step in two's

Ladies, grab your L's
Call up all of your girls
Fellas, grab your wills
See and Neef, 112, come on

Now this goes out to all the girls
Around the world
Massages, menages
Them back stage twirls

Them bosses, them flosses
Them Diamonds and the pearls
Them sweats and the track nights
Them pros and them hills

You gotta use what you got, girl
To get what you want
Instead of givin' up that ass
Daddy smokin' the blunt

Come on and roll wit a playa
Get away from them chumps
You do both
We hit more than once and don't front

I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too

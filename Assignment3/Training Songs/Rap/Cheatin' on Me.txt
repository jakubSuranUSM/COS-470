Oh oh, I can't believe it

When I got home last night
Somethin' didn't seem right
I think I know what's goin' on
There's been another ho in my home

Cigarettes in the trash
He doesn't even smoke
Two glasses in the sink
The Dom is still cold
Trojans come in three
But one is gone

Hell no
Said I know what's goin' on

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Oh oh, yeah)

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

How could he do this to me?
Turn around and smile in my face
But he was out with somebody else
Doin' her at my place

Cigarettes in the trash
He doesn't even smoke
Two glasses in the sink
The Dom is still cold
Trojans come in three
But one is gone

Hell no
I said this brotha's got to go, yeah

So what am I supposed to do?
When I put my trust in you
And what am I supposed to say?
When you gave my love away

I gave you all my love
Repaid me with your lies
Not checkin' for your games
Don't want to hear your alibis

And now I'm out the door
'Cause I just can't take it no more

Cheatin' on, cheatin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me
Creepin' on, creepin' on
Creepin' on, creepin' on me
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me
Creepin' on, creepin' on
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on me

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Oh ooh, oh ooh)

My man's been cheatin' on me
(My mama told me there'll be days like this)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Cheatin' on me, cheatin' on me, yeah)

My man's been cheatin' on me
(Boy, I gave you everything)
(But I guess that wasn't enough)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Cuz you were givin' away)
(All of my lovin', oh)

My man's been cheatin' on me
(How could you do it?)
(How could you do it?)
My man's been cheatin' on me
(Cheatin' on me, babe)

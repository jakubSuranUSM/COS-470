(Chorus)
It's dat bad black British bigger beats bitch
From Brixton to Beanu the streets get switched
She said hard lips ching, we don't want shit no
Singing a flow and it started a tempo

(Verse One)
Sharper dan a razor, when you walkin my way
Gonna f*ck you up caught you up in the style
When I'm wise and my style, slit your wrist
Suicide, with my fists and my tongue comes like a knife
Meana-mee-za, meana-mee-za, and it's my trick
To six foot deeper dan da concrete
Comin' misty but like Shaggy "It Wasn't Me"
It was my lyrical ability on Trinity
My flem caught on billy so my lyrics are a flame
So my tongue comes in danger signs of deadly
So dey sayin it's anotha explosion, but it won't really fussy, 'cause I 
really 'em

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

(Verse Two)
You never knew about the Lyrical G, Lyrical G
Mirical, lyrically, haters fakers S-T-E-P, your boot in G-are-A-V-E
You M-I-S-S-I-N-G, or D-A-T-E to L-I-T-E
want to f*ck wit dis bad girl MC
While I f*ck wit D-why-N-A-M-I-T-E
F*ck dat, now I'm femine girl, f*ck your chat
It's time to get dhose, who don't really feel
Unfortunately and I'mma get are-E-S-P-E-see-T
Now bring your crew, your fools, your ton, your gun
Bring your dawgs, bring your men, bring your mum
Take her in like you fuckin wit sons
Cause I paid when the job is done

(Interlude) 
People dynamite's danger, the family changer
X-Zones banger, re-arranger, dynamite is danger
Now you don't know that dynamite's deadly, I'm ready
You ready, I'm ready, all's empty, dynamite is deadly

(Verse Three)
You so fun, bring your girly and cum
Dynamite is on, pussy ready on da run
Re-arrange your face like you was Jackson ta don
????????
Power failure, let's get powerfully
Let's get one ting clear, MC wit'a pussy
But I'm not be f*ck wit, I'm not to be dissed
Take another piece, just I'm just a lyricist
Lyrics hit like mic-core Ali's siss
Man's say she's script and girl's sayin she's a bitch
MC's say she's shit 'cause I'm here flippin scripts
People wit sense would say I don't want to quick snitch
Labels want to sign her, and raters like behind her
Haters want to bind her and dawgs want to grind her
Smart man stiff 'cause dey ain't even fine
'cause dey kno I ain't called Dynamite for nuttin

(Interlude)
Everywhere I step, everywhere I turn
I see da haters they can't handle anything burnt
Everywhere I spin, everywhere I go
Jealously want to my facet and they want try and steal my dough
Everywhere I step, everywhere I turn
I see da haters they can't handle anything burnt
Everywhere I spin, everywhere I go
Jealously want to my pussy and they want try and steal my dough

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

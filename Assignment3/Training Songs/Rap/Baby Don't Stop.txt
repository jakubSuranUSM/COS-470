Audrey in motion, baby, that's the way you are
A very sexy lady
You know just how to make me happy
By working me over and over again, yeah

Get on top of me
And give me what I need
Fulfill my fantasy
Throw me up and down
Make me make all kinds of sound
Baby, don't stop, I'm begging you please

Baby, don't stop what you're doing, I like it
The way you love me to, baby Baby, don't stop what you're doing, I like it
Can't seem to get you off my mind
It feel real good

I'm the vulnerable passion, baby
I have for you
'Cause of what you do
Can't seem to get you off my mind
And I'm never ever gonna try

You drive me oh so wild
With your kisses and your smile
And the love you give to me
Make love to me right now
Anyway and anyhow
I like the way you do it to me

The way you rub your nails and cross my body, baby
Don't stop, I like it baby
Make love to me right now

I want to get real nasty with you baby
Make love to me right now
I want to get real nasty with you baby
The way you want to baby

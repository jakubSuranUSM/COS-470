When it comes to sex advice I'm the one you call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats rock fashionable suits

A cla** for the youth sex ed for ya head
The do's and don'ts that should happen in the bed first
(Don't) run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure f***in with the typical horn, because

(Do) rock a Rough Ryder, cause whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier and
(Don't) take the p**** if she fighting
'Cause you saw what happened to Tupac and Mike Tyson

Especially if you're large some ho's are trife
Get you on a rape charge have you serving your life yo
(Do) get a yes confirmation before penetration
'Cause you wind up in a police station

(Don't) get with no young b**** and hit it she PG-13
You rated are she not permited
(Do) check for ID
Whenever chillin VIP with fly shorty PYT yo

(Don't) lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with fronted on who borrowed your watch yo
(Do) play the game right if ya G's tight
Then you can f*** shorty the same night yo

(Don't) trick when you don't have to you think
You ballin' you turn ya back they laffin at you
You don't gotta keep repeating you a thug
She heard you in fact, she attracted to ya man that heard you

(Do) spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The b**** throws a lil' somethin' too bro
(Don't) eat the p**** the first night
N**** bless you, we call that s*** gesundheit

(Do) set the mood right, Bali with ice
A couple Thug Pa**ion will make everything right yo
(Don't) pop s*** like you daddy-long dick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick

(Do) hit the position she will find interest in
(Don't) hit the p**** if the s*** is blisterin'
Hope ya listenin', turn up transisterin'
Hot 97 KISS FM, be	-L-S with ya hand up her dress

Chillin' with your girl while ya thinkin' bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down hotter than dress opposite sex
Pop-up the questions, I can answer them best
Signing off Dr. Knockboot at your request

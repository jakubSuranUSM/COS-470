We've been deep in the trenches
Ain't that friendship
Its not always roses (But)
Everybody knows this
We stuck in this battle field
I know just how you feel
Standing up for us (Yeah)
I'ma be a soldier

You give me hope (hope)
You give me strength (strength)
I'd give you better than I could ever give myself
Always know that (that)
I got your back (your back)
Don't matter wherever
As long as were together (we've been through too much)

We've been through too much
Time for us to group up
Come on and lets stand up now for us
This is our battle cry
Promise you that I'm certified
All we gotta do is stand up now for us
This is our battle cry

Hey Hey Hey

It's so hard when the night falls
And I don't get your phone calls
Your everything to me
You heal me when these bullets go through me
And if I had to retreat
I know you'll fall back with me
And if you got problems
You already know whose going to solve 'em

You give me hope (hope)
You give me strength (strength)
I'd give you better than I could ever give myself
Always know that (that)
I got your back (your back)
Don't matter wherever
As long as were together (we've been through too much)

We've been through too much
Time for us to group up
Come on and lets stand up now for us
Standing Up For Us)
This is our battle cry
Promise you that im certified
All we gotta do is stand up now for us

Now its time to get focused
I ain't saying nothing man
You already know this
So when called flow, then flow this
And if you need to swim
I'ma bring a boatless floatless
Now I don't need to sound so manotness
If you need something from me
Call me I got this
And I don't give you what you need from me
And I'ma be right there when I need to be

We've been through too much
Time for us to group up (C'mon)

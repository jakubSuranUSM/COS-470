Almost made ya the main thing on my agenda
When we first met I just knew you were a winner
But you had to go and mess it up for me
Provin' everything that I really thought you was
I really almost made ya

My frames Gucci afta Gucci she in Gucci too
10 chains eatin' sushi, introduced her to it
You know I would, yeah I'm good we spending fifths
Spend a few grand credit cards we push our own whips
Feel so special riding Coup certain feelings
JuJu Bean color Benz no ceiling
Middle name Faharri like Ferrari, I'm livin' fast
Catching planes, trains, buses, getting stacks of ca$h
Give your candy man, love to love dem suga' walls
Wrote your name in the sand on the beach an you ain't called at all
You jus' mad he ain't mad, I've seen it before
Thought you really wanted love, but the bitch wanted more
Well gon' chase em? then, beat ya feet run the streets
Gon' chase em then, learn how ta be discreet
Gon' chase em then, open ya eyes, what ya see?
Gon 'chase em then, 'cause there ain't nomore of me

Almost made ya the main thing on my agenda
When we first met I just knew you were a winner
But you had to go and mess it up for me
Provin' everything I really thought you was
I really almost made ya
The Center of all my attention
Every time I spoke ya name I had to mention
That you had to go and mess it up for me
Provin' everything I really thought you was
I really almost made ya

34-26-38
Somebody tell God, he left the lock off on them pearly gates
And I can?t see no wings, and her halo must be tangled in her hair
But when he check, he gon' see he missin' an angel
I just left the studio so I know I smell like Dro
She wit her friends from college, I'm wit neighborhood G?s
She said I talk country (boy you so country) laughin' and lovin' it
Swapped numbers, out of all things I straight gave her my government
It was days it was nights it was winter it was summer
Grab the Mastercard or Visa, it was my pin number
She said lets talk, I'm pregnant, okay lets do this right
Lets take that phrase, baby mama, boo, and change it to Wife
She started shaking and crying hugging harder as tears came
I said I'm happy, Ima' call Jacob you go call Ferra Wayne
I walked out, she said Ali loud and fell to the floor
Took a break and said, it ain't yours (damn)

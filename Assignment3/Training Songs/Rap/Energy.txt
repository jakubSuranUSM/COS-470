Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy energy 

[Chorus x2]
Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
And dedicate it to my favorite lover 

I'm lying in bed 
There's thoughts in my head 
I'm thinking 'bout you 
Over and over and over and over again 
What can I tell you, you got me so twisted 
Tossing and turning 
Over and over and over and over again 
So I wrote a song tonight (Tonight) 
you motivated me to write(To write) 
Tell me is it cool tonight (Tonight) 
To let you know what's on my mind 

[Chorus x2]

Rain or shine sleet or snow 
Couldn't stop the way we flow 
Welcome to my miracle 
And I'm digging on your lyrical 
Your melody is my remedy 
Lemon squeeze to my Hennessey 
The one to call when I slip and fall 
Candy coated tendency 
Just make a wish and lets make it o-fish
Back with your boy Baby Bash with some heavenly bliss 
Because your kisses on my lips, girl I'm ready to roll 
With so vicious and Bubblious, the energy's throwed 

[Chorus x2]

Boy, you know that I dig you 
I fell in love when I met you 
I love the way you make me feel 
Your energy is something real (Fosho) 
Boy, I love the way (I love the way) 
You make me feel (You make feel) 
there's something Ã¢??bout you loving me
Can't do without your energy 

[Chorus x2]

Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy energy

Oh woah oh oh, oh
I can't get enough of myself

If I wasn't me, I can be sure I'd wanna be
I'm pretty major and I'll say it out loud
Living my life in a fantasy
Living my life in my vanity
Hey mom maybe you'll see me now

I call what I see and if I judge, well, then so be
To my neighbours I'm the best thing around
Living my life in a fantasy
Living my life in my vanity
Hey mom maybe you'll see me now

All I wanna do is what I do well
Ain't a gambler but honey I'd put money on myself
All I wanna do is bottle it to sell
'Cause my brand does vainglorious much better for your health

Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
All they've said it's true
I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
I don't know about you
But I can't get enough of myself

Ha ha, funny me, life of the party, VIP
Got so much flavor, put me on the buffet
Look at them, look at them liking me
Look at them, look at what sight to see
It's so hard, baby look at me now

Who now could it be, calling the paparazzi
Well, since you're here now, baby, fire away
Look at them, look at them liking me
Look at them, look at what sight to see
It's so hard, baby look at me now

All I wanna do is what I do well
Ain't a gambler but honey I'd put money on myself
All I wanna do is bottle it to sell
'Cause my brand does vainglorious much better for your health

Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
All they've said it's true
I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
I don't know about you
But I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
All they've said it's true
I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
I don't know about you
But I can't get enough of myself

Got me a ticket, I'm heating it up
My life's a party, I'm filling my cup
It's in the woah, it's in the oh
I'll tell you that I can't get enough oh
I'm on a roll, I keep turning it up
I'm my biggest fan and I can't get enough
Oh oh, oh oh
Saying it again, I can't get enough

Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
All they've said it's true
I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
I don't know about you
But I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
All they've said it's true
I can't get enough of myself

Woah oh oh
I can't get enough
I don't know about you
But I can't get enough of myself
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh

Why can't I keep you from the cold
Seem to know the difference faces
No matter what road you travel on
You go through the darkest places

I can't tell the angels it'll be good
For you
But wanting to say blesses be the
Darkness
For bringing the life through

But I'd be lying to myself

I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the way
I feel
I had no right being so uncontent,
Being so confused,
Being so not for you

You're in love with all that you don't know
It animates your expectations
But what's the easiest way to hurt a man
Give him all he's ever wanted

Trying to tell the angels I don't
Know what to do
While convincing myself to believe
All the sadness have purpose to
Makes me hate this

I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the
Way I feel
I had no right being so uncontent,
Being so confused,
Being so not for you

And when you asked the angels to
Make you a better you
Dream all you want
Cause all the light you occupy
They will try and take it all from
You

I had no right bringing you here
Knowing what I know, feeling the
Way I feel
I had no right being so uncontent,
Being so confused,
Being so not for you

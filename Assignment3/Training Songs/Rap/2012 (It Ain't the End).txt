Oh oh
Jay Sean
Two, zero, one, two
Nicki Minaj
It's alright, oh it's alright

You know what they say
Life ain't always easy and everyday
We're survivors
So forget the day
Its all about tonight act a fool, and start a riot, be a rebel
Bottles poppin' til we cant stand
We keep it rockin' 'til six A.M.
New York to London over to Japan

Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world, oh
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like, oh
Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

Simile's, metaphors and we pop pills
Sick flow inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how to top bills
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
Lot of them tryna do it but its not real
Wasn't a rapper then I couldn't got a pop deal
White clothes in a hot pink hot wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives, you wink it goes by
So we'll just get it with no Edison
Anything goes so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy, and lets just get right
Young Money, Cash Money in the building
Lets go the world ends tonight

Have a drink with me
And lets make tonight go down
In history, in history yeah
Lets play make believe
Its the last twenty-four hours and this
Whole world is ours eternally, eternally

Hey
Bottles poppin' til we cant stand
We keep it rockin' til six A-M
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
We gonna party like

Party like, like its the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's thousand and twelve
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world, oh
We gotta live like its the end of the world
We gotta party like, oh

Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up
It ain't the end of the world, no
No I'm not gonna follow
Anything that they say anymore
It's never to late to start living
So let start it with here right now

Party like like its the end of the world
We gonna party like like it's two thousand and twelve
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other

Turn it up
Turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world, oh
We're gonna live like its the end of the world
We're gonna party like, oh
Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up

The world
Because the world keeps spinning
The world keeps spinning around

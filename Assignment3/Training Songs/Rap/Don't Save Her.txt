Welcome to the hypnotize zone
Today you'll hear the story of Russell Resthaven
And the day he tried to save his girlfriend
Here's the story

Man, you won't believe what done
Happened to me now, man
What?

I let this nigga come out my house and he fucked my bitch
But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though
Man, f*ck dat hoe man, you can't be tryin' to save that bitch
My nigga and them housed the hoe on Brown and Frayser

Man, I spent cheese on her and everything
And I bought rangs and some mo' shit
I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin' marry
You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man

I love her man, I love her man
Quit lying man, I love her man
I gotta marry her man
I'mma marry her

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

I'mma introduce me, Project Pat, I keep it real
I'mma introduce you, you's a sucka faking deals
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife

I don't even get why you be eating out her draws
You done bought the bitch a phone
Now you screening in all the calls
It's about 4 a.m., she ain't nowhere to be found

Somewhere wit her friend, dick in face and turned to ground
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go
Suckin' dick, chewin' cat, and I hear she on that blow
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew

Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew
I know just what to do, you can ask the hoe to leave
Once the bitch pack her shit, hurry up and run them streets
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before
It's a U.F.O. or a hoe that wouldn't go

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Jackie's simple, Jackie's quicker
Jackie likes to suck a dick-a
All she wanna do smoke a blunt get a drink of liquor
Lip-ah to the balls booty even enough to smell dodie

You be tryna, save a sweater but you need the fuckin' letter
Be the bitch she really is-a, suck my dick, you goin' kiss her
Hating hoes, try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her
Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell

Call her up there, nig man there's a way-a
She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda
Camcorder caught on tape, did I stutter man
I should of fucked her in her mouth fast, she be taking all cash

Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas
Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her
Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa
Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava
You'll never get the bitch 'cause she wit that West Haven

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved
(Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward)
Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Got one in the chamber fo you weak ass cowards
And I'm tired of you niggas goin' saving dese bitches
Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get 'em

I ain't trying to be a trick, I'm just sayin my dog
Let a nigga get deep down in them draws
Take her over to my dogs so we can do 'em ya'll
Everybody can do it, let's just have a ball

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power
Too many niggas out here cowards
They be saving dem hoes they be paying them hoes
But a nigga like me can not go

I'm be kickin' in doos I be fuckin' dese hoes
I be slamin' 'em down like Dominoes
Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro
In and out dese hoes does like, "Whoa"

Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her
Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power, don't save her

You're gonna rock to this 
You're gonna drop to this 

10 o'clock,weekend 
Bout to head out to the garden of eden 
Go my shelltoes and my cap on 
Before I hit the door I got to get my cellphone 
Bout to call my boys and see what's up? 
Are you rollin with this chick or what? 
Meet me at the spot 
I'll be the one round the back in the drop top 

Chorus 
Dj, gimme a beat I can rock to 
I want a joint you can drop to 
The ceiling is caving in 
The speakers is rumbling 
Dj, gimme a beat I can rock to 
I want a joint you can drop to 
The ceiling is caving in 
The speakers is rumbling 

Turn it up, bump the bass 
'Cause we bout to tear the roof off this place 
Shake ya ass, check ya glass 
Put your hands up, let the track blast 
Yo, this beat it so ridiculous 
I think this dancefloor's about to bust 
Everybody on the wall 
Better press 'cause it's bout to be last call 

We ain't trtrying to leave the club 
Now let me show you how to get crunk 
Hit the floor, lock the door 
It's time to go 

Repeat chorus 

If you came to dance, clap your hands 
Ladies grab your man and 
Feel the bass, go uhh-uhh 
All in your face go uhh-uhh x2 

Repeat chorus x2 

Give me a beat I can 
I want a joint you can rock to 
Give me a beat I can 
I want a joint you can rock to

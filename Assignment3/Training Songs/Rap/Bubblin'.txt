I think you're 'bout it 'bout it,
No man could ever doubt it,
You're looking so delicious,
Could this be the night that we uh,
Get close just a little,
Take it up another level,
Look,it's just plain and simple,
Could this be the night that we,
Don't fight it,
Can't hide it,
Let's ride this,
It just feels so right,

Chorus
You got the perfect body,
Love the way you're shakin' it for me,
Can we take it upstairs to the lobby,
I don't see nothing in you and me Bubblin'
How do we get started,
How do we get private
Once we get inside it's gonna be troublin'
You and me bubblin'

Why don't we get this poppin',
Top floor with no distirbing,
Room service in the morning,
This will be the night that we..

Elevator's waiting open,
Don't you think it's time we go in,
Can't keep the Penthouse waitin',
This will be the night that we uh

Clock's ticking,
Time's wasting and
You're amazing,
This just feels so right.

Chorus

Got a body like woah,
Why you waiting over there, let's roll,
Take it all the way to the top floor,
And let's get bubblin' girl bubblin' girl,
Got a body like woah,
Why you waiting over there let's roll,
Take it all the way to the top floor,
And let's get bubblin' girl bubblin, girl

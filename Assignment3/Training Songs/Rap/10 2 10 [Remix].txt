I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rise, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
Good music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than day-day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a bae-bae I swear was OG, you was a no G
Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
F*ck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talking with the same hoes
All day about how find 'em and Hov hit the same hoes
Some niggas never grew up until they grew old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
F*ck with me and you'll destroy fool
End up on the fucking Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
F*ck am I saying, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright thought if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean don

They done fucked up now, haha
Mastermind

My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bi-language
Some call it tricking cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfucking die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Coming through and I don't f*ck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna f*ck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said f*ck that nigga
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga f*ck what you thought
16â€²s of coke, all my verses be dope
F*ck XXL 'cause I'm The Source to these quotes

I've been held from ten to tens, swear I won't sin again
Bring the Hell to my residence, godly presence with presidents
My day job, it made me shit, public housing ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem, plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred, shit
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, how you do that?

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go
Have the right to loose control, don't let go

I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move to soon it would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go
Have the right to loose control, don't let go

I often fantasize the stars above are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours
Like only lovers do if I could wear your clothes
I'd pretend I was you and lose control

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking, oh yeah

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go
Have the right to loose control, don't let go

Running in and out my life has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go
Have the right to loose control, don't let go

I said you got the right to lose control, yeah
Don't let go
Don't let go control

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends
Than hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go
Have the right to loose control, don't let go

What's it gonna be, don't let go
Don't you wanna be, don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go, don't let go

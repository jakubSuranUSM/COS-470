Enjoy yourself, 9-8
Get it straight

Yo, yes yes y'all steady playin' the wall
Too young to sip alcohol at the bar
I'm ready to jet, girls actin' bourgeois
Yo Kedar, let me hold the keys to the car
I'm in front of the club tryin' to bag a chick
Tryin to get five of em, 'cause the whip seat six
Feelin' aight, chrome lookin' real tight
Watch the moonlight bounce off the pearl white
Word money, I earn money just to burn money
I'm tryin' to get this federal reserve money
There's two type of artists, expert and novice
Experts always hit the mark of they target

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon

Yo
I have the baddest foundation ever established
Me and my team bubble like Alka Seltzer tablets
Don't sleep, when it's time to creep
A little pimp like me will crawl underneath
It takes a lot more than word to move me
I don't give a P-H-U-K what you say
Actin' all wild, unprofession-al
Who got beef, I knock teeth out ya smile
My lyrical lubricant keeps the crowd movin'
You get booed when your stage show needs improvment
So if you want to see A+ the artist
You gotta Western Union me a key grand deposit
While that cat's out there steady kickin' garbage
Girls steady sayin', look I can see who the God is
You can't harm me or stop me
Even on a poor quality bootleg cassette copy

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon

Yo, yo
Take ya time, make up ya mind
The dime pieces love the diamonds and the shine
Real friends never fall in' love
Stealin' my heart, is like stealin' a car with The Club
Nevertheless I get an occasional crush
Say some romantic stuff that make you want to blush
Girls in all flavors, no matter what they race is
Rhymes amazin', makin' Craig Mack faces
Take em back to the lab and touch three bases
Take my time, don't want to catch no rape cases
Kiss her on the forehead and say goodnight
A+ y'all, and I'm out like three strikes

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (you know you gotta)
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself with me (c'mon)
You gotta enjoy yourself, c'mon (what, what, what?)

(What, what, what?)
(What, what, what?)
(What, what, what?)

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself (c

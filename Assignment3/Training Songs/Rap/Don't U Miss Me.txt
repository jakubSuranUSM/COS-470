She miss me, she miss me not
She miss me, she miss me not
She miss me, she miss me not
She miss me, make love, make love

She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
Uh, get higher baby, make love, make love

I've been wanting you
And I'm feeling you
Let me take you out tonight
Baby I can make it right
D-D, make your body h-l-t
And leave you d-are-i-p p-i-n-g

Don't you miss me baby
(I make that love that)
Drives you crazy
(You drive me crazy)
Girl I know you ready
(So bring that ass)
Straight home to Teddy

Don't you miss me baby
(I make that love that)
Drives you crazy
(You drive me crazy)
Girl I know you ready
(So bring that ass)
Straight home to Teddy

Turn out the lights, boo
I'mma chase you around this room
We can play peek-a-boo, I see you
I'm still your fantasy
I'll put your mind in ecstasy
Baby you're next to me
Right where you need to be

Baby let me sing to you
While I do this thing to you
Honey let me lay you down
Let me kiss your body all around

Girl won't you pack it up
Baby let me smack it up
Teddy's ready for you
So tell me what you want to do

Don't you miss me baby
(I make that love that)
Drives you crazy
(You drive me crazy)
Girl I know you ready
(So bring that ass)
Straight home to Teddy

[Joie]
Oh ha ha
Papi now, you're
But you  
I miss you but 
You miss me too
If I leave it there tomorrow
You gon' cry boo hoo
So I, let's make truce
If I give this to you 
Would you know what to do?
I won't miss the way you ring my phone
I won't miss
Ignore you're home
Chulo loco nigga
With this 
You sweat a deal 
Wish you had six figures so
Bring that dough to Joe 

[Guy]
We can do it on the sand under moonlight
And if you come tonight
You can feel this buried treasure
(Make love, make love)
Girl you turning me on, your body's tight
And if you come tonight
You can feel this buried treasure
(Make love, make love)

Don't you miss me baby
(I make that love that)
Drives you crazy
(You drive me crazy)
Girl I know you ready
(So bring that ass)
Straight home to Teddy
(Repeat 2x)

I miss you papi
(Repeat 8x)

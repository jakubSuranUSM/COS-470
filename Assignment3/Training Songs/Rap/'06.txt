Next time on Poppy Street

Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, f*ck what's wrong, f*ck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine
There's niggas gettin' paid over there
And niggas got it made over there
I'm finna bring the gang in the builâ€” *static*

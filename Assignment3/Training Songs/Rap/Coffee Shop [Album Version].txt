Welcome to Starblocks
It's Young Dirty.
Who sent you?
It's Young Dirty.
Oh, okay, what you need?
Hey, I need some of them thangs, man.
How many of 'em?
Two of 'em, give me two.
I got you, pull on around to the window, pimp.
A'ight, shawty.
Ay, ay, ay, Joc.
What up, Pacman?
'Cuz, cuz out here say he need two of them thangs
Oh yeah, he want two of 'em?
Yeah, hey, Joc
What up?
You know the motto!
Yeah
Hustle by any means, nigga!

[Chorus:]
First, I take they order like the (coffee shop)
Then I steam it up and cook it like the (coffee shop)
And then I serve it out the window like the (coffee shop)
(Yeah, I'm comin' in, got my rims sittin' real big)
And it ain't no returns at the (coffee shop)
Man, I make that paper stack up at my (coffee shop)
One hit 'n they'll be back to the (coffee shop)
(Yeah, I'm comin' in, got my rims sittin' real big)

Okay
It's just another day at the coffee shop
I grab them coffee beans, time to heat them coffee pots
Turn them lights on, J's rush the parkin' lot
This the neighborhood's number one stop 'n shop
No regular, we only serve the best
For the low low, cheaper than the rest
I'm takin' orders; tell me, who's next?
Only cash, no credit, no checks
When your car stop, welcome to Starblocks
Wanna triple your knot? Invest in our stock
And now we doin' numbers, like the closeout
Make sure you shop wit' me before it's sold out

[Chorus]

We cook it in the morning, sell it durin' midday
Whip the cream same color as your latte
I tell 'em "vamonos," that's rapido
You need some mota? You go call Gorilla Zoe
You can get the coca if you got the get-it-green
Colombian, and I ain't talkin' coffee beans
Twelve to twelve
It's always someone on the scene
Starblocks - we get it out by any means
Coffee shop, trap spot, hand to hand, get my guap
Pockets still ounce for ounce
Set for set, razor chop
Rockstar, rollin' rocks
Piano keys, work the block
Welcome to Starblocks - we trap like the coffee shop
Let's go, see

[Chorus]

Ah ha, ah ha, okay
Everybody on the block know my nick name
When you drop by, just ask for "Whip Game"
And all my money get counted when the shifts change
They get into it, I'm a let my four-fifth bang
If you need the number, 1-800-Starblocks
Coca latte damned to make ya heart stop
And now the haters hot, so they run and tell the cops
They shut us down, we set up shop on another block

[Chorus]

We gotta get it, baby.
What they see outside?
(Yeah, I'm comin' in, got my rims sittin' real big)
Hey, Pacman.
What up?
When we in the South, where they gonna find us at?
You oughtta know. (Coffee shop)
When we on the west coast, where they gonna find us at?
At the (coffee shop).
What about up top, shawty, where they gonna find us at?
At the (coffee shop).
Hey, kids, please, don't do drugs.

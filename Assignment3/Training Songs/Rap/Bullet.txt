Yesterday I was sitting. recalling. reminiscing
Trying to remember whenever there was nobody listening
Before the hugging and the kissing, the booing and the hissing
All I had was just a vision,
All I had was my ambition
Your love without condition
Kept me swinging when I'm missing
My eyes upon the prize
Kept me striving for the mission
When I was down for the count, falling out of commission
I can hear you voice now screaming out "son, listen"
Get on up, don't give up, though you struck opposition
Time to buck all that stuff, find out what's you condition
Like a pull in my soul, like keys in my ignition
Call you all my commission, my love and my vision and

It doesn't matter if they call me wrong
Doesn't matter if they steal my song
Doesn't matter if we're all alone
It doesn't matter at all

'Cause I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea
I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall
To show you it's for real

Remember when we used to flow together back in the park
You would slang guitar licks under the stars in the dark
You'd say let's grow together as this world falls apart
I was holding on to hope but hardly holding a spark
All the rhymes that I wrote you'd call dope from the start
I'd be like a pure note. like a quote on the mark
You'd go to every show and promote from the start
From the beginning we've been building much more than this art
Remember bearing scars in you car to impart you heart
You cared enough to call my bluff through the junk from the start
That's why you're holding onto half of my heart
You've been there through the times,
Through the nights that were dark and

It doesn't matter if they call me wrong
Doesn't matter if they steal my song
Doesn't matter if we're all alone
It doesn't matter at all

'Cause I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea
I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall
To show you it's for real

It doesn't matter if they call me wrong
Doesn't matter if they steal my song
Doesn't matter if we're all alone
It doesn't matter at all x2

'Cause I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea
I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall
To show you it's for real

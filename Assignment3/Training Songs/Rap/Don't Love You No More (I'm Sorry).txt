For all the years that I've known you baby 
I can't figure out the reason why lately you've been acting so cold 
(didn't you say) 
If there's a problem we should work it out 
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now 
Like you don't even wanna talk to me girl 
(tell me) 
OK I know I was late again 
I made you mad and then it's throwing the pan 
But why are you making this drag on so long 
(i wanna know) 
I'm sick and tired of this silly games 
(silly games) 
Don't figure that I'm the only one here to blame 
It's not me here who's been going round slamming doors 
That's when you turned and said to me 
I don't care babe who's right or wrong 
I just don't love you no more. 

Rain outside my window pouring down 
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry 
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down 
Now it's, too late, to turn it around 
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry 
I guess this time it really is goodbye 
You made it clear when you said 
I just don't love you no more 

I know that I made a few mistakes 
But never thought that things would turn out this way 
Cause I'm missing something now that your gone 
(I see it all so clearly) 
Me at the door with you inner state 
(inner state) 
Giving my reasons but as you look away 
I can see a tear roll down your face 
That's when you turned and said to me 
I don't care babe who's right or wrong 
I just don't love you no more. 

Rain outside my window pouring down 
What now, your gone, my fault, I'm sorry 
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down 
Now it's, too late, to turn it around 
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry 
I guess this time it really is goodbye 
You made it clear when you said 
I just don't love you no more 

Don't say those words it's so hard 
They turn my whole world upside down 
Girl you caught me completely off guard 
On the night you said to me 
I just don't love you more.

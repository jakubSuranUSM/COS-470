Wont you let me come through and see you or something
What we gon do?

My bodys gon talk to your body
And then
Your body's goin' talk back to mine
And then
My body's goin' say to the bedroom
And then 
Your body's goin' say its about time
And
I'm a strip you to ya secrets
And then

And then
I'm gon give pressure where needed
And then
And when were down we gon repeat it (oh)

I'll scoop you in the bently
And then
We roll

And then
Some wine glasses of govea
Get lovely

To the crib

Get touchy
And then
Oh oh oh

Will sit out by the pool
And then
Ill make it sexier for you
And then
I'm grippin' on ya thighs
And then
And then I'm starin' in ya eyes
And then
I got you moaning out real soft like
And then
Now you screaming so lets move inside
And then
Ill show you to the bedroom
And then

And then some

And then some come get some

And then some

And then some

And then some come get some

[Chorus: x2]

I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast, starin out to Africa
Accolades, Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as f*ck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight,' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead {"No time for looking back, it's done"}

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords
They at pause, bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack, they lost
Wipe a lot, no time for looking back, it's done
Golden era over and dead, I'm over your HEADS~!

We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

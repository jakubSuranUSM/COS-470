I tote P89's on me all the time
My rhymes is serious I'm kill'em every time
While I'm... sunk in that 745
I am... feel like a jet when I ride (when I ride)
So I ride n**** feel me on cruise control
Game tight n**** lose your hoe
I smoke... take a few pulls of the refer
Ridin under the tint doin the duece fever
Need some so I check the beeper
Before B.I.G. pasted he pa**ed the number to Katrina
Get it right the game still remain
And I'm married to the s***, you n****s still engaged
Nothin change, twelve gauge still POP!
If you n****s want to jump at the ROC!
You can come witcha BLOCK! If you want to
Yea Ease the same
I bet it all on dice so I could freeze the chain (now that's game)
All you hoes is a show (your truck come with a chaffeur?) Ma fa'sho
You know Ease the truth, they say sex is a weapon
You'll be dead when I shoot

[Chorus: (Memphis Bleek)]

Block tick rabbit when I'm finger f***in'em
F*** a vest, tell ya boys have a bullet proof truck with'em
It's Geda K the young horse, and M. Ease of course we gettin cheese
Draw we don't squeeze, and SUV's on two-fours with t.v.'s
Probably with your b****, playin the backseat
And you know I hit it, ain't the type to chill with it
Type to get rid of and never go to the crib with her
S***, I move according to plans and still visit... park
And still kick it and pick my n****s up
And you know we be dro smokin, toten, loc'n
Live from PR or Oakland, b**** its Get Low let me know what's up
If you get it the truck get in position to f***

Ya better keep your chicks intact... cause I walk like a pimp, talk like a mack

And lock the streets again,ain't no police and him
Got cops on the payroll, killers on the lay low

The cats out the bag, but blast out the mag
Send them words back in your mouth... out ya a**
Talkin s***, all you get is cleaned the f*** up
I ain't steamed the f*** up either
Hire the team but me, myself, and I-rene
I come through and lean you f***er, I'm tryin to keep n****s from killing you
You still talkin s*** to me, you now as smart as you appear to be
I got dumb-dums for dumb-dumbs
I'm a right man, got a educated left hook in a right hand
F*** like whoa, got a flow like damn
The new thug life be the Roc-A-Fella fam
No disrespect intended
But if you offended can't take it back... handle your business
I'm just staten facts, the whole worlds against us
And we will not surrender, and we will survive
Turn out ya lights like Teddy Penta-Gra**
Get ready for the coldest winter a**, I proceed..

She barely good but good with curse words
Spend all my money up, smoke all my herbs
Crash the coupe, make her count that too
No matter what ya do you're still my boo
She run the streets more than I do, boo the doo
Can't talk to ya cause she keep an attitude
Hid the stash, hit the cash, ain't ask to borrow

Haters here they come but she's a chicken on the run

Rough sex while I pull your hair
Lookin up ankle bracelet in the air

Ooh little mama over there with that toe ring
Roll it in cocaine and hide it in propane
Niggaz intimidate, why because she's wrapped up
Play that, touch her the wrong way and get slapped up

Hell short or tall ah hell I love all y'all

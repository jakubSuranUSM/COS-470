I don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
I don't need you to give me your strength to make me feel I'm strong
I got all of this strength that I need here inside my own two hands
All that I want is your love and respect for who I am
What I really need comes from deep inside of me

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
Don't need you to make me strong 'cuz I'm strong all on my own
Doesn't come from outside, this beauty I know
Comes from inside my soul
Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty

I don't need you to believe in me to make me know I'm worth believing in
I don't need you to lift me up high to know I can stand tall
(I can stand tall)

I can stand my own ground
I can stand proud upon my own two feet
Don't have to be part of somebody else to be complete
What I really need comes from deep inside of me

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
Don't need you to make me strong 'cuz I'm strong all on my own
Doesn't come from outside, this beauty I know
Comes from inside my soul

Don't need to come to you for confirmation
Because I finally found too, this revelation
What I really need
(What I really need)
I'm gonna find inside of me
(Find inside of me)
Not in somebody else
Respect comes when you respect yourself

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
Don't need you to make me strong 'cuz I'm strong all on my own
Doesn't come from outside, this beauty I know
Comes from inside my soul

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to make me feel beautiful
Don't need you to lift me up, I can stand up on my own
Doesn't come from outside, this beauty I know
(I know)
Comes from inside my soul
Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty to know I'm beautiful

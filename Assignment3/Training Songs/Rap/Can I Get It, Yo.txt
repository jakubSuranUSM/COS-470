Multiplatinum, waxin' 'em while I'm maxin' 'em
"Who's House?" God's House, so chill while I'm taxin' 'em

Rappers poppin' mad smack, about the King of Rap
Ten million sold, seven digit contract

Beats hardcore, diesel like the Schwarzenegger

Respect the black crown
Sounds underground
Any stage they built
Run tore it down!

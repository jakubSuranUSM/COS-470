Who is she?
That be pagin' you and callin' all night?
Just tell me please
Ain't no need for you to try and lie now.
Where did you go
When you said that you where gonna be here, boy, don't ya know?
Today I followed you over her crib.

Ya must've been crazy, crazy and dumb,
Ya thought I didn't see ya now didn't ya
Tried to sneak by me now didn't ya, didn't ya
Ya gonna be sorry cause I aint the one
Ya tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya didn't ya.
Now I, won't cry
Cause honestly I knew it all the time but,
Deep inside the love I had for you was keeping me blind, but
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of giving yaw scrub-ass niggas my heart.
Now boy, you and that broad
'bout to meet with the lord.

Cause now it's too late
(What are you gonna do)
I lost my control
(puttin' my trust in you)
Keep this on ya mind
(Every last dog gets caught some time, bye-bye)

Ya must've been crazy, crazy and dumb,
Ya thought I didn't see ya now didn't ya
Tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya, didn't ya
Ya gonna be sorry cause I ain't the one
Ya tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya didn't ya.

Sorry,
I didn't mean to do what I done.
I'm only wrong for lovin' you too much,
Now I'm sittin' in these damn 'cuffs, locked up.
(Damn)
Ya must've been crazy, crazy and dumb,
Ya thought I didn't see ya now didn't ya
Tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya, didn't ya
Ya gonna be sorry cause I ain't the one

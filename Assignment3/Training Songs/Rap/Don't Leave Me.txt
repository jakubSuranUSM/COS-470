No baby no baby no baby
No, no, no

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, I'll go insane

No baby no baby no baby
No, no, no
No baby no baby no baby
No, no, no

You've got your problems baby
And I've got mine
Let's just spend it all by putting it together, yeah
When you say you love me it don't mean a thing
If you care, you'll be there, like you used to be, yeah
I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay, oh
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away
You'll make this grown man cry

Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight

Forget my pride girl, I beg you
You're my heart, you're my soul
You've got so much control
My love runs deep within the ocean and sea
But if you sail away
You'll take a center piece of me

Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight

(No, don't go)

Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight

Stay, stay, stay
Stay right here with me forever
Stay, stay, stay
Stay right here with me forever

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, crazy, crazy, insane

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, I'll go insane

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, I'll go insane

Stay, stay, stay
Stay right here with me forever
Stay, stay, stay
Stay right here with me forever

No baby, no baby, no baby

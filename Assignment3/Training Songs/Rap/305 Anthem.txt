It’s that little chico Pitbull
This my way of letting my city know
I’ll ride for ‘em! I’ll cry for ‘em!
Bust five for ‘em! And most of all, 
Fucking die for ‘em!

Hey three O five! till I die!
Hey three O five! till I die!
Hey three O five! till I die!
Hey three O five! till I die!

[Chorus]
I’ll ride for my motherfucking click! for my click!
I’ll die for my motherfucking click! for my click!
I bust heads with my motherfucking click! with my click!
If a nigga talk shit, watch my shit go click!
Click, click, click, click!
I’ll ride for my motherfucking click! for my click!
I’ll die for my motherfucking click! for my click!
I bust heads with my motherfucking click! with my click!
If a nigga talk shit, watch my shit go click!
Click, click, click, click!

Man, I’ve been on the grind, 
One in the head, sixteen in the nine
I’m extra man! The game is mine, in due time 
It’s all right, I’m patient man!
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I’ve done some dumb things, but for the most, 
I’ve played it smart
Who cares if you run things
Cuz I’m as live as one O six and park!

This game is nothing,
But a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks!
Only the strong survive, it’s do or die
Get it right! That’s why I roll for my peoples!
Cock back, go to war with my peoples! 
Break bread with my peoples!
Man I’ll die for my peoples!

Everybody knows is truth 
That’s why they respect 
Everything that I do
Everywhere that I go
Every fiend, every foe
Every bitch, every hoe
Man I sold it all!
From the weed to the X 
From the X to the blow
Mark my words I’m next to blow!
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B to the U, double the L!
Me I’ma sell like ice cream in hell!
This for my peoples that’s locked up in jail
I’ma succeed, I’m never gon' fail!
Papo just watch! 

[Chorus]

Man I’m watching the game closely
Uncle Luke that man done coached me 
He told me the who, what, where’s, and why’s 
How to cross T’s, how to dot I’s 
Little did he know he created a monster!
Pitbull nigga, I’m that monster!
DB, them chico’s is monsters! 
Lil’ Jon, that nigga is a monster!
Everybody in the click is well equipped
Ready for pit to take over shit!
This here is not a game, this here is our lives…
We can’t f*ck this up, we gotta get it right
If you wit us and you ready for war
Then let’s ride!

Let’s show ‘em how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in they house
Since them boys think they spit fire
F*ck it! put the gun in they mouth!
Follow me now
All these bitches wanna swallow me now!
All these niggas that I don’t even know
Wanna holla at me now
Cuz the wanna be down
But f*ck ’em man!
Me I turn it up a notch 
To my hustlers be careful when they murdering the block!
To my killers be careful when you burning up the glock!
Last thing you wanna be is running from the cops
Pit’s ‘gon take it from da bottom to the top!
Haters can hate, but it aint ‘gon stop!
Everybody knows I’m blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock! ha!

[Chorus]

Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!
Hey three O five! Till I die!

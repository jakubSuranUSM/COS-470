Don't leave me alone don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone (leave me alone)

Boy why don't you just lay with me
Stay with me
I would love it if you had your way with me
'Cause I just can't get enough of your touch
You do the things I need to me so much
I don't want to let you leave I don't want to let you go
You not even here with me so don't leave me alone

Don't leave me alone (no no oh) Don't leave me alone
(Don't leave me alone oh ohh oh)
Don't leave me alone (yeah ohh)

Now if I could just be with you breathe with you
If you were to ask me I would leave with you
I will go around the globe as long as I know
I would be right by your side wherever you go
I ain't gonna let you leave I don't want to let you go
Ohh I need you here with me

Don't leave me alone (Hey I don't want to leave you alone)
Don't leave me alone (I don't want to see you go ohh don't go)
Don't leave me alone (Don't go don't)
Don't leave me alone (ooh hey)

One of the reasons that I never want to be alone
Cause I don't like what happens to me when I'm in your arms
He feels like home
Let me go oh baby baby cause my heart's mine
From inside out
Only you could do it to me baby you could do it to me
So I gave it you all love

Don't leave me alone (I just want to be in your arms all night long)
Don't leave me alone (I just want to be in your arms all night long)
Don't leave me alone (oohh)
Don't leave me alone
Don't want to be alone
(I just want to be in your arms)
Don't leave me alone

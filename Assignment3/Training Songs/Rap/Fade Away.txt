All day (All day), everyday (Everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way (Made a way)
Day to day, man that's the only way (Only way)
They gon' know my name until it fade away (Fade away)

Fade away (Fade away) fade away (Fade away)
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way) Fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kid, gotta get my son back
'Cause when they coming through that system don't give a f*ck about you
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Drop into work and get hit by a Hyundai, f*ck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'mma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'mma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'mma ride in the dead of it yeah
Yeah I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

Fade away (Fade away) fade away (Fade away)
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way) Fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

Tell me what I really really give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
F*ck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
So I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention, want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture, no metaphor
I’m being real with ya but it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Goin' ham, fill a dam, in a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission but back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life, no inhibition, life or death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when inside the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'mma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'mma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

Fade away (Fade away) fade away (Fade away)
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way) Fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

Fade away (Fade away) fade away (Fade away)
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Way, way, way) Fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

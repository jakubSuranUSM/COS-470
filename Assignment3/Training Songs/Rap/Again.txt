Ooh baby, aah, lady
Ooh baby, ooh baby, oah

Listen, a lot of time
She waited patiently by the phone and I didn’t call to say
'How are you doing or what is going on?'
She told me deep inside, it's tearing up her heart
And it’s very hard for her to stay in love
When her heart is thrown apart

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you, I give it up to you

You're beautiful, so colorful, just like a rose
Girl, you’re even more beautiful to me
When you take of all your clothes
There’s no perfect relationship, they all got flaws
So don’t worry I'll make it up get ready
'Cause I’m taking you out

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you, I give it up to you

Girl, you’re the best thing
That could ever happen to my life, my life
So I don’t wanna make things worse
From now on I swear that I will make sacrifices
'Cause I don’t wanna hurt you girl

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you, I give it up to you

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you

Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!

Sometimes you can be in love and having fun
And still not know what's goin' on
Or on the other hand you separate, thinking that the feelin's gone

Feels like forever when we're together
I knew that we are destined
So here's the last chance for the last dance
For us to bring back the dream

So baby come and rescue me, I'm burnin' up!
I got some fire for you to see, I'm burnin' up!
Baby come and take me there, I'm burnin' up!
Trust me you should, Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin' up! I'm burnin' up!

What you need I could offer
By any means I support ya neglectin' ya need would be torture
Things that I torture like blowin (fiya) in the Porscha'
Doin' high speeds while i toss ya
A straight gentleman,
born with ape adrenaline girl ya gotta faith I'm sizzlin'
Hot when I drop numbers like New Kids on the Block
The  like sh' who that kid in the drop
Emergency shorty hot to the third degree
How many ah wanna swerve with me
Refrain from serving thee
The game never heard of me
I got something for you herbs to see
So why even run away been put the gun away
Sign with Bad Boy first hit with Dunaway
And Neptune track hot like summer days
This wet Loon block hot now one away

In the midnight, wait a minute
I can be in a lonely place yeah
Then along you come with the sweetest thing to say
And put the sun in my day
I'm ready for you to rescue me, I'm burnin' up!
I got some fire for you to see, I'm burnin' up!
Baby come and take me there, I'm burnin' up!
Trust me you should, Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin' up! I'm burnin' up!

So baby come and rescue me, I'm burnin' up!
I got some fire for you to see, I'm burnin' up!
Whoo oh, I'm burnin' up!
Trust me you should, Hurry up!
Baby I'm just burnin' up! I'm burnin' up!

Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!
Burning up! My heart is like burnin' up!

Every night before I sleep
I thank the Lord for givin' me anther day
So I can be with you
'Cause I ain't never seen a face
So beautiful in every way
I can't believe that I'm here with you

And I cry 'cause I-I'm so in love
'Cause you don't know what it means to me to finally find someone
I was searchin' for the perfect girl, the woman of my dreams
And now she is in love with me

And even though I've been around the world
Never did I find a girl
That makes me feel the way you know you do
And even though love has been kind to me
Never did I dream
I would find me a girl like you

Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, yeah

When I'm makin' love to you
I call your name, that's what I do
So you won't have no reservations and
That you're the only one for me
My heart is yours and, girl, that is for eternity
You know we make the perfect combination

And I cry 'cause I-I can't believe
'Cause you just don't know the half of it
Or what it means to me
To have finally found the perfect girl
The angel of my dreams
And now she is in love with me

And even though I've been around the world
Never did I find a girl
That makes me feel the way you know you do {You know you do}
And even though love has been kind to me
Never did I dream
I would find me a {Me a girl, me a girl, me a girl} girl like you

Da-da-da-da-no-no
(Da-da-da-da-da)
Da-da-da-da-no

You're only the best thing, girl {Ooh, little baby}
That ever happened in my life {That ever happened in my life}
You are my angel {Yeah}
The angel and the apple of my eye

And even though I've been around the world
Never did I find a girl
That makes me feel the way you know you do {You know you do}
And even though {Even though} love has been kind to me
Never did I dream
I would find me a girl {Find me a girl, me a girl, me a girl}, oh, ooh, no

And even though I've been around the world ('Round the world)
Never did I find a girl {Find a girl} (Oh)
That make me feel the way you know you do {You know you do}
And even though {Even though} love has been kind to me
Never did I dream
I would find me a girl (Find me, find me, find me a girl like you)

Ah-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da
Baby
A girl like you

Turn it up, turn it up
Feel the love, feel the love
In the air, on the streets, all around
Now let's go, let's go

Don't be afraid, it's inside of you
No time to wait, you've got nothing to lose
Right now the world lies at our feet
Want you to come with me

By the end of this line I'ma have you all singing to my song, to my song
We'll be dancing in the burning lights, you know the energy's so strong
And we're feeling alive
I-I-I, never felt so alive

Here we are, here we are
Staring up at the stars
We can do anything that we want
So come on, come on

Don't be afraid, it's inside of you
No time to wait, you've got nothing to lose
Right now the world lies at our feet
Want you to come with me

By the end of this line I'ma have you all singing to my song, to my song
We'll be dancing in the burning lights, you know the energy's so strong
And we're feeling alive
I-I-I, never felt so alive
Never felt so alive!

Come on
Ooh yea yea
Come with me
Let's never leave
Everything you've been waiting for
Everything you've been waiting for
Is right here, right now
And don't you feel so alive?

By the end of this line I'ma have you all singing to my song, to my song
We'll be dancing in the burning lights, you know the energy's so strong
And we're feeling alive
I-I-I, never felt so alive
I never felt so alive, oh

Baby baby baby, baby baby baby
Baby baby baby, baby baby baby

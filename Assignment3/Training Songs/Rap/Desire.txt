Dry your eyes, I am here, ready to catch your tears,
When they fall into my hands.
I understand what you demand, I see what you want to give,
And the love that you have.
Desire, brings a passion new,
And let your taste for life become sweet again.
Desire, brings a passion new,
And it turns sweet sweet again.
Carve out a life that brings new dreams,
Don't suffocate yourself, in the thoughts of your past.
Just give me you love, and give me your trust,
And I'll fall asleep holding you.
Desire, brings a passion new,
And let your taste for life become sweet again.
Desire, brings a passion new,
And it turns sweet sweet again.
Give me your love and give me your trust.
Give me your love and give me your trust.
Give me your love and give me your trust.

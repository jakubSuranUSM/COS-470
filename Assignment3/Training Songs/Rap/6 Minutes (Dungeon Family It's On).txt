360 seconds it's on, unlimited firsts from calibers unknown
Come wit it in ya verse or take a job and stay gone
I don't care if it's rehearsed or off the top of your dome
With this specified time you can do as you please
Make a decision to create life or spread death and disease

We got 360 degrees of emcees
That make these rap niggaz sound like they swangin' from trees
Everythang from brain food to puttin' broads on they knees
We do it all for the love and never all for the cheese

Hot tub, bubbling like warm water call me, hot tub
Cut your wife and daughter like a meat cleaver, we be the Dungeon Family
Niggaz up under the step from A T L to over stand me
D F, is the clique I represent, puffin' purple
Poppin' poppers, spittin' straight pimp shit

Conversation without compensation, we sensed it
It's not to mention yo' girl, your persistant in
Nothin' physical happened but give me 6 minutes
When ya off, somebody gonna fit in it

Say no names, wear my hair longer than your first strang
Yo' girl wish she was drafted for the Georgia drill team
But I ain't gon' say no more
You need to catch somebody else I'm 'bout to hit the door, I'ma

6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on

Fine lil' mama, my home gon' be a palace
Laid out like a salad, keep a nigga from malace
I'm movin' things to the south
A dog like me need a pussycat 'round the house, with a row bone

Ain't nothin' like me, you baby with no clothes on
I'm tired of runnin' the streets all night
And a girlfriend ain't gon' stay down witcha like a wife
I can't let all you girls get to my head
'Cuz you know what I want between them legs

Hey I'm just walkin' outta foot locker strollin' through green briar
Stepped in the food court just gonna but a bean pot
Ay cool cool cutta, cut her to the finch
If a girl gotta future behind her, I'm up in it

And I like a pretty lady with a tailback mouth
'Cuz if you hit the right spot, she'll go back runnin' her mouth
Now every time I meet a girl she puttin' her hand in her purse
And when my next record drop I ain't wearin' no shirt let's do it

6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on

Hats off, nigga can we put a fist in 'fore we handle business?
Hallelujah, for the bank
Benzes, houses, hummers, tanks and all that
Gon' see, that they meet shack in the end

The world was my enemy, that's who was my friends
On the strong delucious, unstoppable, followin' the tradition of men
Can't say aww look at that man
He's too dirty for industry dead ass, or is he!

Five minutes and fiftynine seconds gone by
Are you really ready for this lyrical high?
We can shoot without bullets, D F to the fullest
Should it, ever come to light it's true art, not hype

Comin' strong, take the mic, make sure it's tight
I rock a party all night
With my team on the right, straight ready for the
Lights, camera, action, Ms. Jackson

6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on
6 minutes, 6 minutes
6 minutes, Dungeon Family you're on

Introdu, introdu, introducing ice cold water
We stay sharp as a broke glass bottle
Just as sure as four quarters make a dollar
Ten dimes do too and I ain't take none shorter

Pay attention to every quote we say
'Cuz I got this here like it's in stores today
Holla ready to rock, when he step on the scene
'Cuz shorty stay clean like, shicka-ding shicka-ding

Well I can be that and you need that, freaky D that
And if you want your monologue and open come and seek me
A few done fried man or we can bligh man
I'm the guy that kill ya cat and, I dare you to defy me

If you can time me, I promise in sixty seconds
You'll be intriged and overwhelmed and obligated to rewind me
That reminds me and my name is the Divinely
Human see and I hope you had a freaky time fuckin' with me

6 minutes, 6 minutes

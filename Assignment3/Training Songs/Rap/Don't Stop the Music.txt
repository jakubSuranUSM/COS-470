Alright, yeah, yeah

This little girl didn't care what anybody said
She got the whole world dancing to the music in her head, yeah
They loved to trash her bad, laugh at her and call her names, oh yeah
And now they all try to copy her, isn't that a shame?
Oh, it only made her stronger

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get out there and don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby, come on, baby, come on

He knew that he was different, this sucker couldn't win
They didn't dig his vision, they tried to fit him in
But there's no room for losers until they make you change
And then you love them, tell me how much longer?

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get out there and don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby, come on, baby, come on

You've got a perfect mind, you've got a perfect smile
You're unlike anybody, got your own shine, come on
If you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no pain
Baby, it's your decision, only you can break the chain

Music's like love floating in the air
You can reach out grab it everywhere
Just for your love, you can put it on
You were put here on earth to make goodness for people
Better make it worth living while the world's still spinning, come on

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get out there and don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby, come on, baby, come on

Don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby, come on

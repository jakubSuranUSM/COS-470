Gold handsome ice on your face
You dun love the money race
Look how much you made
[?] shoes, you got tricks up your sleeve
Take it to the head to f*ck on your face
Love you more than the drugs I take
Neglection from the underworld got you virally
Still falling from the same game you fell for privately
You ought to be where you say you are, but roses don't grow overnight
You took a few bites, I didn't think you was aight
I'll try to get over in my after-life, this life right here ain't aight
I don't even know how I fell for your type, this shit aight

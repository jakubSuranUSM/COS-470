Back up, back up, back up, back up
Back up back up back up back up ease off
This goes out to all area crew (yes yes)
To my BK crew to my QB crew
My LI crew, my Shaolin crew
My Dirty South crew

Atlanta, North Cakalak'
For all my fam, all area crew
Yeah man!

Yes, the first cut should be the deepest
To penetrate beyond the muscle wall's inner regions
First you was icing me, connect with the staring at the speakers
Heard the rhyme, head high, what ya staring at ya sneakers
You shy now, got a lot of things on your mind now
You don't feel fly now, you hunting the exit sign down
F*ck what you heard, cause I snatch the grapevine down (yea yeah)
Don't understand how I ran the line down, rewind now

Yo We be the most magnetic, so athletic
Leave your peeps on the side so they can watch you and your mans get it
Take the arch rivalry stance up on the podium
And give the flavor to niggas but keep it low on sodium
Possess shit that got you wondering how we holding 'em
Things that'll lay you out like a piece of linoleum
Bring who-ever you want, we bout to bug son and bounce
Down to Henry Hudson, after I bust one!

The hottest Negroes en Los Estados Unidos
Hotter than Reno when discovered by Bugsy Siegal

From East West North and South I got joints for all of those
Heavy aquatic water flows keep them on they toes
Tell them thugs that want to be CEO's to be derobed
'Fore I wear your little dumb ass out like Easter clothes!

Yo, yo-yo yo-yo
It's like a freak show, soon as my heat blow
Sometime I speak slow so people understand my street flow
And while we keep it hot, we got the most shine up in
This whole shit, me and Mos spit and blow the show quick

Watch out!  Your pussy sound get bucked Souf
Mos 'n Bussa Rhymes too bad man-a-shutout
Watch out!  Give a damn what fancy car ya hop owt
Shut down your game like the NBA lockout

Ya better watch out!  I'm bout to black on niggas

Blowing my raps on niggas, now let me mash out
We fatter than the biggest ass chicks poking they ass out!

Thinking about all the ways to connect me to your world 
Not enough, to replace, all the details on mind cold 
Like a bad, when the spring has come too early, and I wait 
For the summer, 

I try to deny that is something more, that I need 
Not just an echo 
I need to get that high that I felt before 
And the greed, just won’t let go 

Your body is like music, baby 
I wanna play it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only feel it when 
Our bodies making music baby 
I wanna do it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only hear it when we are as one 

Soul to the skin, as I run from my patience wearing thin 
But my heart has begun a revolution deep within 
So I know, but I have to find a way to your embrace 
Once again 

I try to deny that is something more, that I need 
Not just an echo 
I need to get that high that I felt before 
And the greed, just won’t let go 

Your body is like music, baby 
I wanna play it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only feel it when 
Our bodies making music baby 
I wanna do it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only hear it when we are as one

Your body is like music, baby 
I wanna play it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only feel it when 
Our bodies making music baby 
I wanna do it again 
Your body is like music, baby 
I only hear it when we are as one

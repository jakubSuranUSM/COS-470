All in the club like what? Rugged dressed up 
Hair messed up  gold on my neck 
Don't sweat y'all show respect Poppa on the set 
Death threat  I come a long stretch you can bet 
Love is love  for real for real 
Feel what you feel Park Hill 1 0 3 0 4 
Rock caps til you can't take no more  it's war 
Prepare for darts  martial arts 
Let me shine keep me and mine  Son of Song 
Took too long, back throwin' darts, without remorse 
Dart holocaust, slang boss 
Remain top hip-hop, drop you to your knees for these 
Big CD's, you heard it through the grapevine 
Killer Beez 

Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

Face to face I break bread every time 
In the world I hold mine, play it 
Now check it, see if you can comprehend 
These crossover rappers that lost they origin 
Run from the Wu this time it's more trouble 
I'm comin' for the wreck so y'all could never bubble 
Never concerned about rabbits, after my cabbage 
Cherryheads, and parrots 
Won't live in the barracks, we Don Hoe 
Buckwild with the flow, how we do 
Timbo's and full boot, vocabulary pitfall 
F*ck all, more clothes than the mall 
Let's brawl 
Wu-Tang broke radio laws, the opposite of mines 
Is yours, from sea shores to bankrupt 
I conduct, erupt like Holyfield 
Third seal, third chamber's from the hood 
Branch out, and everytime you see Don 
I'm up to no good, motherfucker 
Splash that 

Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

I'm all alone, I feel trouble in the street 
City heats, ghetto beefs, trick or treat 
Call Chief, mad beef with MC's 
Entity, Killer Beez one machine 
Intervene, on scene self esteem 
We gleam at night, it seems like 
We too hype, hop y'all like checkers 
Projectors, we break laws, get yours 
We break jaws reunite, we upright 
It's alright, out of sight, out of mind 
T take time I develop, heads swell up 
Shut the hell up, add on, you been warned 
Mics get torn in half, I drop math 
Don't laugh, a bloodbath with this here 
Rap Shakespeare, beware, Donna-might 
Brown skin with the satellite, I represent 
Buckwild and Street Life like two cent 
For real, for real 
Love is love, for real, for real
Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

Everything is everything, reality 
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
Ain't always everything, and everything 
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 

The other killers, have already shown up 
Now it'll be your turn, to die too 
We're ready anytime!

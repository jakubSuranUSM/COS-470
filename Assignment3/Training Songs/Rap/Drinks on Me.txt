Uhh, uhh
Yeah {*belch*}
Ahh shit
One of them motherfuckin days
What happened to all the motherfuckin pussy around this motherfucker?
{*long belch*} Bitch gone, f*ck it
Goin out tonight, uhh

[Verse One]
A nigga bored as f*ck
I've been sittin here perkin since four o'clock
With a fifth of Remy in me gotta get me to the club now
I'm feelin freaky I can see me makin love now, time to roll out
Call Kevin it's a quarter to eleven
Come scoop your homey and hit Club 227
It's like heaven, bitches everywhere and they just all tight
Fill a hoe up with drink and we fuckin tonight

I know I seen ya in a magazine, or maybe I'm trippin
This drink got me slidin when I'm ridin that I'm sippin
Just made it to the club and already got some action
Maybe it's the candy 500-SL that got 'em reactin
Once you in girl you ain't gotta think about a drink
Just meet me at the bar, you and yo' potnah, me and my cousin Ant Banks
We can do it live one time just so you'll notice me
Half-ass naked girl have me "Fiendin" like Jodeci

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Drinks on me baby, all night
All the drinks that you need baby, drink on
You can drink get your double up, drink it up
Drink it up baby girl 'til you ready to f*ck

[Verse Two]
I got my Rolex glistenin and the bitches be whisperin
Ant Banks is gettin the pussy and they know I be listenin
And I'm peepin out the haters who be hatin my name
Don't hate the player motherfucker hate the motherfuckin game
It's a shame I'm the regulator
I'm at the bar buyin hoes brand(?)new-seperators(?)
Back it up baby, s-slow baby take yo' time
After two more of these drinks shit that ass is mine

Might just be me but you movin like one of them private dancers
Doin your duty, bumpin and grindin on ME witcho' big ass booty
Baby got me twisted if she think it ain't all gravy
As much money as I spent you you must be my lady
Half black and filipino is the ingredients that it be
Got me hollerin UNNNNGHHH, how you do dat dere like Master P
"I Got the Hook Up" from X.O. to Alize to Hennessy
It's the artist formerly known as Captain Save-A-Hoe, now get..

[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Bitch on the dancefloor feelin it
She got a drink in her hand and the bitch is spillin it
all over me, gotta lick it off
Got my hands up her coochie getcha wet'n'soft
I know you love it youse a tramp and you know it too
It ain't too much shit yo' ass won't do
I'm playin with the titties now baby showin 'em
Cause bitches let the drank bring out the real ho in 'em, why'know

They say that freaks come out at night, so let it be
I'm tryin to get nationwide with these freaks like BET
Once again like they say the gin'll make you sin
So babygirl let me ask you - let's be friends
Let me quench yo' thirst and I'll make it right
With some full service drinks all through the night
Oh you want to show yo' ass and act bad well scratch yo' itch
Yo DJ cut the music so I can act like my other cousin Too $hort
and call this baby hoe a BEAATCH!

[Chorus]

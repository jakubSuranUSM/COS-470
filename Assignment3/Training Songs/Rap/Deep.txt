[Verse 1]
Don't you know sky is the limit
I'ma keep on reachin'
So much love to give
So won't you come and get it
Bring yo body, undressed and yearnin' (Yearnin')
Got the candles burnin' (Burnin')
Baby, I'm determined (Ah yeah)
Let me go downtown, damn I wanna have it
Lick around and pat it
Your goodness and your savvy
You know I'm gonna answer your request
I'm the one you would finesse till the mornin'

[Chorus]
Let me go deep, deep (Deep), deep, deep
I wanna break you down all night (Break it down, go)
Wanna go deep (Deep), deep (Deep), deep (Oh, yeah) deep
Let me make your body quiver just right (Just right)
Let me go deep, deep (Oh), deep (Yeah), deep
Just tell me how you like it girl (Tell me how you like it)
Cause I'm goin' deep (Deep), deep (Deep), deep
(Deep, deep, deep, deep, yeah)
Inside your body, your body (Oh)

[Verse 2]
We'll do it in the shower (Yeah)
For about an hour (Oh)
Move over to the counter and bring you out (Scream my name)
We're not close to endin' (No),
It is just beginnin' (Oh, yeah)
We're stretchin' out the episode (Oh)
Let me do it one more time
Downtown, even lower, pick you up over my shoulders
Ride you in a rollercoaster, ooh you're so wet
That just made me more excited
Girl, you got my fire lighted
Since you tried it I'm gonna shock you

[Chorus]
Let me go deep, deep, deep, deep
I'm gonna break you down all night
Wanna go deep (Deep), deep (So deep), deep (Oh), deep
Make your body quiver just right (Just right)
Let me go deep, deep (Deep), deep (Deep), deep (Yeah, yeah)
Tell me how you it done (Tell me how you like it)
Cause I'm goin' deep (Deep), deep (Deep), deep (Ooh), deep
Tell me how you like it

[Verse 3]
Sky is the limit (Oh)
I don't wanna end it (No)
I just wanna go on (On and on and on, yeah)
You got my head spinnin' (Spinnin?)
The way my body?s twistin' (Twistin')
Give in to me, baby boy, oh

[Chorus till end]
Let me go deep, deep {Deep}, deep {Oh}, deep
Just give it to me, girl, give it to me, girl
Wanna go deep, deep, deep, deep
I'm gonna make your body quiver just right
Let me go deep, deep, deep {So deep}, deep (So deep, oh)
Tell me how you like, tell me how you like
Cause I'm goin' deep, deep, deep (Oh, oh), deep (Oh)
So baby, baby, baby, come on
Deep (Come on), deep {Come on}, deep (Come on), deep

Wanna go deep, deep, deep, deep

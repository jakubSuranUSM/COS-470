When I get you all alone 
I'm gonna move in nice and close
Ain't nobody gonna interrupt my game 
Ever since you've been hanging around 
I've been trying to figure out 
What I can say to you to get some play 
Couldn't we do what we did last night again 
Baby you and I'd be better than friends 
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further? 
Every night when we say goodbye 
How can I help looking in your eyes? 
Wondering why you and I haven't hit it 
Can we get it on 

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright 
Thinking about making my move tonight 
I can't pretend that you're only my friend 
When you're holding my body tight 
â??Cause I like the way you're making it move 
I like the way you're making me wait 
At the end of the night when I make up your mind 
You'll be coming on home with me 

Yeah you know you got it 
And you know I want it 
I can't wait to take you home (you know you got it and I) 
I don't want to be rude at all 
I just want to be where you go 
Think what we could do alone 
Couldn't we do what we did last night again? 
Baby you and I'd be better than friends 
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further 
Every night when we say goodbye 
How can I help looking in your eyes 
Wondering why, you and I haven't hit it 
Can we get it on? 

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright 
Thinking about making my move tonight 
I can't pretend that you're only my friend 
When you're holding my body tight 
â??Cause I like the way you're making it move 
I like the way you're making me wait 
At the end of the night when I make up your mind 
You'll be coming on home with me 

When we first met yo that deal was faded, 
You spent like my D's the way we compensated; 
Just another day around the way 
With me up close so every thing OK. 
'cause I'm not like the rest 
Indecision with the best 
Plus for my full court press 
Because they hated- 
How's it go? 
Hah- 
Yo, faded.

I'm kinda faded but I feel alright 
Thinking about making my move tonight 
I can't pretend that you're only my friend 
When you're holding my body tight 
â??Cause I like the way you're making it move 
I like the way you're making me wait 
At the end of the night when I make up your mind 
You'll be coming on home with me

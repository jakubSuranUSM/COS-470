[The Game]
Hey to Bust I think I got, the answer for all my problems

[Busta Rhymes]
What the f*ck you talkin' about, nigga? Wha-What's that?

[The Game]
Belvedere, and Banana Snapple

[Busta Rhymes]
Look, get the fuckin' ass up, nigga
You over there tripin' up yaself nigaa, 
You need to fuckin' calm, everybody bounce, nigga

[The Game]
I'ma man, and most of these niggas
Don't know how to be man, I got a son

[Busta Rhymes]
And what the f*ck you talkin' about, nigga, 
C'mon nigga, let's take ya ass to your crib, man, 
You're tired, nigga, and put your drink down, nigga, we got to go, nigga

[The Game]
One more shot

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank
Like (la la la)
Now I'm sittin' in this goddamn cage
Reminiscin' about my day
With your blood all over my Slate
As the devil sings (la la la)

[The Game]
Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' 'Gin & Juice'
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangster, cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the f*ck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after T-Boz got slapped
When Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was OK to say "F*ck The Police"
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do "Start From Scratch"?
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the f*ck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a rap - its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know I don't agree wit' what he do
But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as f*ck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo Game

[The Game]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo Game, wake up nigga

[The Game]
I'm up man, I'm up

[Busta Rhymes]
We get you crib, nigga, get the f*ck out the car, nigga, get up man

[The Game]
This aint my house, my house is, is green

[Busta Rhymes]

[The Game]
Alright, Hey Bus

[Busta Rhymes]

[The Game]
I got love for you Bus, you're my nigga

[Busta Rhymes]
Get to your fuckin bed, go sleep, nigga, you're tired

[The Game]

[Busta Rhymes]

[Girl 1:] Oh cutie got it goin' ON!
[Girl 2:] Cute? What? That dirty motherfucker?
[Girl 1:] You buggin'!
[Girl 2:] Ain't no buggin', he's some ugly motherfucker.
[Girl 1:] You buggin', no -- look at his disposition, shorty gotta stride!
[Girl 2:] What stride? Ugly motherfucker, he ain't shit.
[Girl 1:] See, that's my plate, brother may kill me like that.

[Girl 2:] I don't see nothing, you ain't blind, sisso.
[Girl 1:] True, true. Just look at him, just look at his disposition!

[Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Approach the school nine thirty, you're late
This time happy the solution was my date.
Get in your class, walk to your chair
Pop is all you see and then occasionally stare
At the teacher, more, tune in to we're clocking ya.
Lean back at this girl kept clockin' ya hood
Simulated from a (sensimilia) blonde,
Tell the young girl "Baby, you're the one I want."
She doesn't respond, pretends to ignore
So you say to yourself, it be her old and sore mentally
Pitchin' lies, the aim on the board as hot and wild pussy
You cannot afford this
Oooh, what slim and trim was my inner friend
Dear, quietly I want him to know my boots,
To rap out loose in my class,
But I kept sayin' the size of my dick and that ass.
So I turned around to arrange a date.
Swinging episode, baby number one's gotta say it
She popped a gum, cold twist to come
I said "Baby, how you feel?"
She said "Sure"
Then I said "sure", I just found my thrill
Wear it in the classroom, know I'm Blueberry Hill
Cause what I said just bottled her hate.
She put her face on the chest, this is what the bitch said:
"Because of you I ain't hurting, but then my within my heart
Cause no, I'm not right to be flirtin, but our relationship has to start.
You're the one that I'm clocking, stop or you could stop mockin'
Don't want you to see me cry, this is why, this is why, this is why!"

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I met a girl named Chandra, from way down yonder
The apple of my eye had a Snapple and some fries
Forgot the catsup, that's when I pressed up
"I've been watching you mowing your lawn"
The thoughts were flowin, while I'm holding the palm
"Hey what's that on your menu?", from there we continued
And talk about this and that we chit and chat
Sipped on the Coke then I stroked the back
As she giggled and I wiggled to the bra
She said "nah!", that's when I noticed her pah
Big Tank, who did nothing but the spank
At parties, drink Bacardi and didn't think
Just act silly, with his brother Willy
Another hillbilly gettin ill with the Philly
And moonshine, but it's a new time of day
On the stoop doing the Patty Duke
OK, it's like that old flip flaps through the shower caps
The platform shoes to Apple Jacks
Chub chub!!

[Interlude: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Yo, you niggaz, niggaz be actin like
They be lovin them, them them fancy bitches
I, I likes me a nasty bitch
Bitch that's willing to do anything at any given time
Bitch gotta be nasty 'cause I'm a nasty nigga
I do anything baby, I wouldn't give a f*ck what it was
I'll, ah, anything - I'm a nasty motherfucker girl

[Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard]
I'm just sittin' right, in my class at a quarter to ten right?
Waiting patiently for the class to begin right?
Teacher says "open up your texts, you! read the first paragraph on
Oral sex!"
I said "Oral sex!, what kind of class is this?!"
Yo, next to me said "what's wrong with you man?, this is a lesson that
Makes you feel fine, kinda ease your nerves and relax your mind!"
I said "Don't try to use no hypnotic spell!"
She said "Be my assistant, I'd show rather tell!"
My knees buckled heart started to drop
My dick grew to a size that my nerve couldnt stop
I tried to run! She yelled out "freeze!"
Pulled down my draws, dropped to her knees
Ripped of my draws as if she had claws
Broke the rules that defined sex laws
She responded quick, with a slick, welcoming kiss and a ice cream lick
Oooh I begged, I begged, "Easy on my balls, they're fragile as eggs."

Part 2 coming up...

Swear I be sitting here thinking ’bout the shit that we’ve been through
And all I know is girl I’ll owe 100, 100, 100 favors
I owe you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors

Niggas all talk, it’ll never change
Keep on choosin do your thang
All them favors, I call her like a driver
Drowning in that pussy, and I’m a soul survivor
Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don’t never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof
Man I heard about an angel

Now I’m sitting here sippin’ on the last bit of vodka
All I ever see is your face
Swear I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is girl I’ll owe 100, 100, 100 favors
I give you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors
Now I’m sitting here sippin’ on the last bit of chi..
All I ever see is your face 100 favors

Prices with the life, rollin on them dice
Spent a mill on a flight
Flew back and she bounced back
High speed, all gold
Lord of the ring, we live that life big time
Big time, 100 times I gave my bitch the sunshine
Harley Davis, Harley Davis,
Twin came I gave my bitch a 100 favors

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud thought that tuition was fuckin stupid
Me I was runnin’ wild hittin’ licks in my mothers’ Buick
Confusing you like my style even though I was broke and do..
Sticks em up, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic plus the difference was
I wasnt rich as f*ck you still would depend on us
And I missed a crush that we had every time when winter Decemeber come
And we had tempers and arguments dissagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I’m shootin’ himself
And the paramedics wont come even if you scream for help
Dont let love die, you regroovin’ yourself
I’m losing’ on tool looking at you from poo hoo thats dealt
So when I reminisce the coupon we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your things got to pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day he’ll read what you saw, now I read for us both
Thats 100

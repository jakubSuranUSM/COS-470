That’s how many ounces in a brick
36, 36, 36, 36
That’s how many ounces in a brick
That’s how many ounces in a brick

Whip that s***, whip my wrist
I might whip your b**** if she ain’t with that s***
Young whippersnapper, I might eat that snapper
Got a yellow b****, gotta whip them at ya
All I know is soda bakin’
All them other n****s fakin’
Watch them n****s fall to pieces
All them other n****s flaky
Did it for my city sellin’ crack out my building
Now I ride around with a crack in the ceiling
Exhale, Ziplock, flip-flop with them burglar doors
Yeah, I got that hard work
N****, you are unemployed
Residue all on the floor
Just made a mil so you know that’s what I’m hungry for
Get it how you live

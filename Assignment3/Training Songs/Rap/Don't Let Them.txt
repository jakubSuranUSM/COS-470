Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Some say that I am a fool to love you 
And some say that I am too dumb to know what's right for me 
But only I can live my life, and only I can feel my heart ache 
I never claim to know everything but I know when your loves away 
I can't sleep and I can't eat and I can't live and I can't breathe 
So don't make a fool of me, just love me 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Now they say that me loving you will hurt me 
And they say its a matter of time before you break my heart 
But even when we're far apart I always feel that you are with me 
I hope and pray almost everyday that our love never goes away 
'Cause I can't see where I would be without your love all over me 
So don't make a fool of me just love me and say 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away  

Baby your all, all that I need, need in my life, right here with me 
Baby your all, all that I need, need in my life, right here with me 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away

Baby you a song (hey)
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise (le' go)

I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio
I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio

She was sippin’ on southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My windows down my seat back my music up when we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard, and that’s just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy like er’thing about ya
Don’t change a thing, no way, you stay the same I gotcha
Life’s all that, all that, head to toe you all that
Tell ol’ boy he call back, send a text say “fall back” (‘Cause)
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on shorty let me show you what the fast’s like
Whippin’ cross the border Florida into Georgia
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every hood er’ry town with you
And this drop top Chevy painted real slick
It’ll look a hell of a lot better when you up in it (you up in it)
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my (roll my) oh

Well baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio (Get the windows down and cruise)
I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio (Get my windows down and roll)
I got my windows down and the radio, get your radio

And she came with her best friend
So she 'bout to f*ck it up, f*ck it up, f*ck it up, f*ck it up
And she is a good girl
But tonight she’s cutting up, cutting up, cutting up, cutting up
Smack her on the booty if it’s real for me
Make it roll like it's going down the hill for me
And she 'bout to turn up
If you 'bout the drama
Then it don’t concern her
She all on the stage
Got the place 'bout to burn up
She f*ck it up
Watch her shake Tina Turner
It’s all about you
Girl tonight it’s 'bout you
Make the whole club stop whenever she come through
One time for me two

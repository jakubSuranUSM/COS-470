[Intro - Juelz Santana]
Uh, Santana, let's do it
Yeah, DipSet

[Verse 1 - Juelz Santana]
Man where ever I go, I hold it down
I blow it down, you see me, believe me it's (Going down)
These hoes love me to death, they mumble under they breath
Lovely duets, boy, I'm (Going down)
I thought Mary J. was under my steps, nah I'm just playing
Love when ya sweat, keep singing (Going down)
I'm so fucking amazin, like Jordan to the league
When he first came in, it's (Going down)
I know you mad, my career's blowing up
Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)
Slowly but surely, so coked to the shorty's
Caught by the boys, the judge says your (Going down)
I had to call up my lawyer, gotta make court
And yawning, it's four in the morning, it's (Going down)
I need be out by the morning
Man the police need me to be out by the morning, or nothings (Going down)

[Chorus - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)
But, wouldn't believe it, couldn't believe it
Look I succeded, it's (Going down)
Baby keep walking wit ya hip, I keep walking wit a limp
Yeah you talking to a pimp it's (Going down)
Again, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now look, I'm back stronger than ever
Money's longer than ever, longer Baretta, it's (Going down)
Man we could get it on, it's whatever
The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a
{???} believe me I done it (Going down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, mama look at me now, mama look at me how
Ya beautiful child it's (Going down)
Mama look up and smile, you made a beautiful child
Still shooting the pound it's (Going down)
Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)
You might catch me, crossing the border
Crossing the water, three ladies out and deported it's (Going down)
I caught 'em swimming, north of the border
Lost in the water, caught 'em and scored 'em, now they (Going down)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down

Life could slip away in absent minded numbness
I’m only sayin this ‘cuz I wish for the best
When you always stay in self-incarceration
I thinks it’s such a shame

Don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home
If he don’t have to he don’t want to
Don’t stay home this time no don’t say no

Oh how I’d like to diffuse your time bomb anger
It’s screaming danger danger this kind of world
Don’t care if you’re home so you better get some

Don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home
If he don’t have to he don’t want to
Don’t stay home this time no don’t say no

Everything I’m sayin’ you can dismiss
Because I sat alone on this past Christmas
I deserved to be alone
But I guess I should have gone home

Hey don’t break the mold kid just eat around it
Yeah that’s what I did
I’ll be running around the block
For no apparent reason
Somethin’ you’ll catch me doin’ in any season
Gotta break a sweat man gotta go bust out
Biddy by by by by
Good-bye to the drought, yea

Don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home
If he don’t have to he don’t want to
Don’t stay home this time no don’t say no
Don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home
If he don’t have to he don’t want to
Don’t stay home this time no don’t stay home

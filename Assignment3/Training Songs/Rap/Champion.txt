Hey hey hey
I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I've been around the map now I'm on my victory lap.

Hey hey
See I'm a champion shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashin' 'em.
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me

OK 

They see I'm shining dog, you see these diamonds dog
They say I'm shining so hard I like to blind em dog
You got a problem dog, well you can bring it on
I got at least a hundred shots and you can get em all
Hey, I did it, I really did it
I'm like a poster child for niggas that just get it get it
I'm supposed to smile for my niggas who ain't here to live it
I'm putting money on they books so they can ball in prison
And feel the spirit of a boss, duel pipe exhaust
All we know is the floss, I'm cocaine castling throwing bombs to moss
My bitch keeps the newest and the latest,
A street nigga, she know I'm the greatest.
Hey hey
Hold up that rosea, pourin' half the bottle out,
If you from where I'm from, you know where I'm flowin' out,
Overcame the odds, so we overdue them cars,
We done balled around the world, now we reaching for the stars

Hey hey
I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I've been around the map now I'm on my victory lap.

Hey hey
See I'm a champion shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashin' 'em.
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
OK 

If only I would have gotten what I had deserved,
Lord knows I would have been done left this earth,
Or either in somebody's jail rotten that's my word,
If not yourselves then you need to have them kids in church
Mistook my work for selling crack,
You should have gotten more out of that than that
My grandma would say you, boy you backwards as a hat
Whether in a trap, N-F-L draft pick or rap,
Virginia is for hustlers, hustlers get it back.
I though that life was a bad bitch bad car,
Life is with your kids watching Madagascar
In the headrest of the H-3 with crashbar
Rockin' play clothes, every days a catwalk.

Hey hey
I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I've been around the map now I'm on my victory lap.

Hey hey
See I'm a champion shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashin' 'em.

Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
OK 

Been there done that, fell off, got back
Real nigga shit, only champions can talk that.
Earn my respect, niggas hating cause they want that,
Been to hell and back, only champions can walk that.

Talk that put yo money where yo mouth is,
T off on the green, golf courses where the house is.
A long way from pumping out housing projects,
Investing in real estate weighing out my prospects

I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I've been around the map now I'm on my victory lap.

Hey hey
See I'm a champion shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashin' 'em.

Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me 
Tell 'em what you told me

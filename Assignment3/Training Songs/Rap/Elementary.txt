I hear the same old rhyme  the same old style 
The same old runner has ran the mile 
See  I don't know exactly what you know 
But what I know is that stuff gotta go 
Usually when I pick up the mic 
Something ill jumps out my mouth for that night 
I like to talk about fact not fiction 
I got some fantasy rhymes but just listen 
Everything I write is premeditated 
Suckas want to fake it  I just hate it 
Bitin' routines or sayin' somethin' kinda weak 
My words are comprehended every time I speak 
Or have spoken, no I'm not jokin'
Please don't sleep, I hope you are awoken 
Stop! Try this again, you had enough? Say when 
I am the man with the six-pack of Heineken 
I get tipsy 
But never in your life try to dis me 
'cause I don't battle with rhymes, I battle with guns 
Knowledge reigns supreme over nearly every one 
If you take the first letter of what I just sung 

You spell my name "KRS-One" 
It's elementary 
Elementary 
 
DJ Scott LaRock and I,  KRS-One 
Our mother's first son and no, we'll never run 
From complex situations like you T-O-why-S's 
Always talkin' junk, yet in jail, you're rockin' dresses 
I have arrived for the purpose of joy 
Unlike any ordinary Bronx be	-boy 
I will volunteer my services and launch an attack 
On you fake educators with your yakety-yak 
This is a fact, the teacher is here now in the flesh 
Consistently hounded by you MC pests 
If you really want to learn from me 
Don't waste time in burnin' me 
'cause ignorance and inexperience does not concern me 
I will emphasize so you will realize and come alive 
Never close your eyes, never sleep or you might take a dive 
Many people hate me, many people love me 
Some are far below me 
And you know there's some above me 
But this, my hypothesis, to conclude the story 
All you fake MC's on a mission, you bore me 
I'm the Blastmaster KRS on the mic 
Watchin' all these females rock their pants too tight 
'cause there's no other creative composition on display 
That give a full analysis and rock this way 
You will pay, eventually you all will decay 
While the DJ Scott LaRock will continue to play 
Cuttin' records, drivin' cars, and you'll know who we are 

Make a mix just for kicks 
And you'll be on our tip 
And, oh yes, there's a highlight to the show, of course 
You hear DJ Scott LaRock (Go off! Go off!) 
(Scott La Rock) (Go off! Go off!) x8 
Verse 3: 
Boogie Down Productions, no reduction to its title 
If you have a headache, toys, go and take a Midol 
We have arrived for the purpose of enjoyment 
You have arrived to make up for unemployment 
You're on it only 'cause I learned just how to flaunt it 
I breathed a rhyme upon you like a sickness and you caught it 
Quick, get off the tip, trick, you must be sick 
Like a doctor here's my bill, I wrote it out with a Bic 
Signed my name upon the bottle 'cause you know I just rocked em 
But gettin' into battles really isn't my thing 
You're probably thinking these are the rhymes for the century 
But please don't mention me 

It's only elementary 
Elementary 
All it really is to me and Scott La Rock, is elementary 
Elementary 
Elementary

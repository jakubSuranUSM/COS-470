I know some of why'all sick of songs 
Why'all be hearin on the radio-
Ohhhh (ohhh!)
So me and Timbaland gon' give that shit you never heard before
(shit you never heard before-ohhh)
It's like drinkin' liquor or weed or x whatever does you the best
My beats, are so (sooooo) addic-hictive

See'mon get krunk with me
See if you're ridin down the street
And you're bout to roll that shit up
You don't need drugs or weed
Oh nah you ain't smokin that stank shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
See'mon get krunk with me
Oh yeah you want to get krunk though?
Well pop this cd in right here and take a hit of me

My album is so, addic-hictive
My album is so addictive {*echoes}
Man bump this ballad shit

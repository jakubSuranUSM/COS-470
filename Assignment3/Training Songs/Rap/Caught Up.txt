Hm
Hm, hm
Hm

[Chorus]
(Caught up) In the middle and I know I'm trippin' (know I'm trippin', yeah)
(Caught up) Every-time I say I won't I always get this (Oh)
(Caught up) Somebody help me out, I'm fallin'

I'm lovin' two and it's gettin' the best of me...
How can I chose when both of them are what I need?
Searchin' for an answer, let me know (let me know)
What is the price to pay for ignoring the rules?
What do I do when I, I have to play the fool?
I need to find an answer, what I need (what I need)
Caught up

[Chorus]

No matter how I try, I just can't help myself...
Don't wanna break it off with either one of them
And still I just don't know, I don't know (I don't know)
Caught up
Can't live a lie
Cause time always reveals the truth
This needs to stop cause I, I got too much to lose
Knew that this could happen, oh I knew (oh I knew)
Caught up

[Chorus x2]

I don't wanna be less than a lady
Back and forth between it's drivin' me crazy
Know it's wrong, but I want my way
Oh, caught up

[Chorus]

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Caught up

[Chorus]

Please help...
Where does love go? (love go)
I'm so caught up in this love triangle
I find it hard to reveal the truth
Between the two
Two baby, oh baby, oh

Where does love go?
I'm so caught up in this love triangle (find it so hard)
I find it hard to reveal the truth
Between the two, I'm so confused
Him or you?

[Chorus x2]

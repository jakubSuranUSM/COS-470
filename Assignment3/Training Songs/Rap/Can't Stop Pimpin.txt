[Bridge]
Baby I just want you to know
That I don't trust you but I need you
And I can't let you go no
And baby I just need you to promise me
That you won't hurt me or desert me and the everything I need

[Chorus: x2]
But I can't stop this pimpin'
I just can't stop this pimpin'
But I can't stop this pimpin'
I just can't stop this pimpin'

[MJG]
Ain't no way I can control my P.I
See why women hit the strip and want to be my bitch (bitch)
Break them heels off and make me rich
Now which one of these old tramps you gonna pick
I'm the M-J-G
I be rolling in big classics
Caddilacs, top drop back, hoe its a habit
Ain't no rabbits in my hat
No drinks on my allie
Let's stay spending some money to f*ck challie
I'm a pimps baby
Cut me I bet ya I please bitches
Ain't no shame in my game
I needs bitches to increase my dividends 
I'm living in shit that looks like I'm making the killing in
I'm a plan maker
I'm the man that can break a school girl down to be in the grand shaker
In a strip club somewhere near you I makes it happen
M-J-G slash breaking these bitches slash rapper

[Chorus: x2]

[8 Ball]
I'm a dog bitch
You ain't in love with me at all
Got ya hand out trying to get something from big ball
Look I told you I hang with niggas that pimp hoes
Shaking every trap and collecting from strip shows
I'm a fat player with a mouth full of gold
I be smoking plenty dro
But I don't put none up my nose
Qualification for any selection I'm making
Fast talking, street walking, non-stop trip breaking
They don't keep nothing dough
They bring it straight to daddy
You catch them stealing dog
You beat that ass badly
If you not a pimp or broad on the strip
You might not understand this pimping falling off my lips
Just don't fake it player cause it ain't hard to spot
You think you balling you square like a match box
See I can't help baby
I was born with it
Real hustler have to beat the street and go and get it

[Bridge 2: x2]
See I don't want to 
I do need to
Cause I know I can't trust you
I can't be you
So I'm hopin that one day that you can be true
Cause all of my plans involve you

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Sam]
Well I'm Big Sam, got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches
But I got much more
Short hair, long hair in them fitted suits
Prada boots and hoes that think they cute
But bitch come short with my cheese
Hoe you ain't seen in me
You bets go get me my cheese or you can limp for me
Cause I'm a breaker man and I'm a pimp you see
And I ain't got time for you chickenhead, tricks you fleas
Cause I P-I-M to the P 
Pimpin' these hoes ain't a thing to me
Been breaking these bitches since '79
Pimpin' they ass for them nickles and dimes
And don't give me no excuses
When it come to my money
Cause I'm Nino Brown and you G-Money
And I'm a motherfucker nigga you will never try
F*ck you hoes cause I'm a pimp 'till I die

[Chorus]

[Bridge 3]
Tell me why (tell me why)
Why you won't stop (why you won't stop)
Your pimpin' baby
Cause I need you baby (baby)
See ya won't stop ya pimpin'
See ya just won't stop ya pimpin'
Ya won't stop ya pimpin'
See ya just won't stop

[Lil Jon]
Won't stop, can't stop this pimpin', know what I'm saying
Its ya boy Lil Jon, 
Lil Jon them East Side Boyz, Ballin-G, my girl Oobie
Doing this shit for Memphis to H-town to the ATL
This pimpin' ain't going never stop, no matter what a motherfucker do
Like my boy Big Ball say "spades ace pimpin' fo' ever" 
Bitch!

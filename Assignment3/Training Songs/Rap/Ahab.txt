Call me Ahab, what, monomaniac
Obsessed with success unlike Steve Wozniak
On the hunt for this mammal that once took my leg
With my warn down crew and my man Queequeg
“You're never going to find him!” He's a big sperm whale
“The ocean is enormous!” Shut up, we're setting sail
This scar that you see that runs down my face
Has scarred my soul and inspired this chase
Mental sickness has got me on the run
Full speed ahead! This is American fun
There is wisdom that is woe, so welcome to my life
It was fine until Moby scarred me like a knife
Towards thee I sail, thou unconquering whale
To stab my spear into your white tail
The first one to stop him gets this gold doubloon
Now excuse me while I go be melancholy in my room!

CHORUS
(Got a low low feeling around me)
Bad trip thanks to Moby Dick!
(And a stone cold feeling inside)
Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what!
(And I just can't stop messing my mind up)
Whale crash so fast
(Or wasting my time)
Oh no, oh no!
The ship's got a hole, plug it up, plug it up!

“We're never going to find this white whale,
Are we captain?”

Hey Ishmael… can I call you annoying?
Grown up Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swims so fast and swims so free
With the heaven above, Moby Dick stressing me
And this crazy drenched crew below
Call it idiot pride, or call me Oedipus
My main tragic flaw… “But what about us?”
It's your battle too, crew, man vs. beast
At least have respect as we sail south and east
And north and west, look I'm doing my best
While the rain keeps pouring
we're exhausted and stressed
Pip went insane when he almost drowned,
So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown
Random ships we met warned us of our doom
They said our boat would be our tomb
Near the Mariana Trench, deep and oceanic
We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic

REPEAT CHORUS
I said, “You took my leg, and for that you must die!”
I threw my spear and hit Moby in the eye
He charged the boat, it began to sink
I said, “How about that? Hubris really stinks!”
I didn't think that it would end like this
Pride met fate, this captain got dissed
Let it be a lesson, revenge is never sweet
So I stomp my peg to this Supergrass beat!

REPEAT CHORUS

(Got a low low feeling around me)
That's it, thanks to Moby Dick!
(And a stone cold feeling inside)
Peg leg, sperm whale, jaw bone, what!
(And I just can't stop messing my mind up)
Whale crash so fast
(Or wasting my time)
Oh no, oh no!
The ship's got a hole, plug it up, plug it up!

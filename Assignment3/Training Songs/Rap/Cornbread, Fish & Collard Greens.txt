I knew just what I had to be 
When I heard you say what you said to me 
To every dude in sight 
Look like you working up an appetite for the night, check it 

By then I just sat at the back 
Peeping you out, the way you act 
Getting out of line 
And I make you get back in your place 

All is well and all is cool 
Stay in your place, don't be no fool 
Get along tonight 
You look like the type that would try to fight 
Been a friend to me, you don't want to up and 
Better play it cool 
Don't know what I might to 

[Chorus]
Cornbread, fish, and collard greens 
I got what you need 
If you want it (cause I'm pimp, girl) 
If you want it (I'm a pimp, girl) 
Cornbread, fish, and collard greens 
I got what you need (what you need) 
If you want it (I can rock your world) 
If you want it (I'm bigger juice than jheri curl 

Now tell me do you really think 
You can walk around like your shit don't stink 
I'm on to you 
Oh baby girl, I'm on to you (I'm watching you) 
Take it slow, change your speed 
If it's food for thought that you really need 
Better stake your claim, get with it 
Stay in your lane, stop swerving 

Take a seat, sit in the back 
I don't appreciate the way you act 
You need to fix yourself, hurry up and go fix yourself 
Can't do nothing, won't nothin' now 
Everything's gonna pass you by 
Better wisen up (wisen up) 
Stop trippin' on love 

Cornbread, fish, and collard greens 
I got what you need 
If you want it (cause I'm pimp, girl) if you want 
I can rock you are world 
Juice in jheri curl 

Cornbread, fish, and collard greens 
I got what you need 
If you want it (cause I'm pimp, girl) if you want 
I can rock you are world 
Juice in jheri curl 

If you let me take you there 

[Chorus: x2]

I know you used to care for me
I could tell by the look in your eyes
I thought you will be there for me
Until the day I die

Suddenly I looked around
And you were nowhere to be found
You never even said goodbye
And now I'm searching for an answer girl

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside

Don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
Don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside, don't know

Confused and brokenhearted
That's what I feel when I think about you
I thought we'd never be apart
Somebody tell me how can this be true?

Now I'm all emotional
And it's getting hard to control
If this is love, I don't need it
'Cause it cuts too deep, baby

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside

Don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
Don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside, don't know

Everyday I look over my shoulder wishin' you were there
You promised never to leave me, you said, you'll always care
(Don't know)
And now I find myself all alone with
No where to turn, tell me, what must I do?

Don't know
I didn't deserve this, baby
Can't understand
Don't know why you left me so sad

Don't know
Feel like I'm going crazy
Can't understand
Somebody tell me what I feel inside?

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know

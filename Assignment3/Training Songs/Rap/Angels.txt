Bad Boy
Maybach
You ain't even got to count the money
It's all out
Boss!
All aboard
Last train to Paris

Uh, uh
I'm a photographers dream
Count cream as my chain swing
Mack eleven for the things that the days bring
I'm after chedder Dirty Money yeah I chase cream
Patent leather like I'm Puffy in my Saleen,
I rock jewels like my niggas in the A-Team
I'm out in space can't you seem I am a A-lien
My wrist A-List, Audemar's ageless,
Bezel lit up like a billboard out in Vegas
You can't be serious baby you know I'm on
Top five but can send you to the most high
Dope boy and there's even in the bow tie
Oh boy ;cause you know I got them close ties
(all aboard) the last train to Paris
Wheels look like a ferris 
Your Jeweler should be embarrassed
Rick the Ruler my mula produce the carrots
Lets bow our heads I gave you something to cherish

Came from the heavens just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you, 
And now it's beating slow, and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go, 
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you, 
When the angels call like

If you don't wanna stay you can goo
It seems love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low, 
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin' you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin' me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin' out (there's nothin' left to do)
When they're callin' you
When the angels call like (i answer)

Uh, uh, uh
Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Army fatigued then fatigue the enemies
Look man you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin' bastard
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
I know who killed em' filled 'em 
With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts
Dyin' aint the shit 
But it's pleasant kinda quiet 
Watch my niggas bring the riot

For me, for you, 
I will tell the angels no
Let them turn back into stone
I do (I do)
Love you (love you)
It's true (It's true)

Fire, climbing
We ignore the angels call
They were warnings after all
It's cool, if I, pick you
When the angel's call like

If you don't wanna stay you can go
It seems love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low, 
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)
When they're callin you
When the angels call like (i answer)

I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go, 
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you, 
When the angels call like

If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low, 
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin' you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin' me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Yo, now I done said everythin' I could possibly say
Ask them niggas in your camp is you hotter than
J A D A K I two Ss?
A true message, y'all better wear a few vests

Live pussies 'bout to be dead dicks
I pack guns that shoot through schools, the red bricks
An' just because you mighta seen me on the award show
I'm still in the hood, nigga, gettin' raw dough

An' later on, tonight, I might be hittin' your hoe
An' I got more money, so I'm coppin' more 'dro
Everythin' I said, I meant, be, y'all gon' tempt me
To rob y'all, spend your whole stash on my empties

Yours truly, can't do nothin' to me
Think you Scarface? But you ain't see the end of the movie
I'm the type of nigga that'll take 5 cakes
Turn 'em into 5 acres, faster than 5 Lakers

Lay back, get high, tote my gun around
Throw a string on the pony so I can tote my son around
The path I walk is filled who the f*ck won't I kill
Thin as that line down the hundred that you can tell if it's real

Smooth as Sinatra, you can tell by my pops that I'm street
F*ck the forecast, I'll let you know what day'll be heat
See, I recruit smart niggas with heart, no dumb niggas
Who will kill over money, not bitches like some niggas

I think marketable, f*ck y'all niggas who stay bummin'
I'm that nigga sellin' pills at all of Howard homecomings
If you get high, I got weed an' if you get drunk, I got vodka
An' if you want base, I got popcorn like Orville Redenbocker

See, I'm bullseye, I empty my banana in your bandanna
First try, never will my bullets miss a vick
I use one to do a hit on some professional shit
Bitch, that's crazy

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Outta three-fourths of them niggas who cross your path
Minus them half ass who talk fast an' finish last
Who gon' get his cash, turn to his man an' give him half
Cock the hammer back, stood by his side an' didn't dash
When the charge is federal an' they fingerprint his ass

Who can he trust to be in front of the judge screamin'
?It's just me?, it must be more than just a nigga love
Make 'em do five joints, no contact without givin' his niggas up
Give his keys to his truck, wish his niggas luck

Call it's best fit, suggested that she let his niggas f*ck
Finger f*ck them figures up, no parole, bigger truck
Kasino is that name big enough, nigga, what?

You wouldn't bust your gat wit me if you never sat wit me
Lit up a sack wit me or hustle some crack wit me
Came through the cipher, bow down an' spat wit me
Hopped up the truck an' gave niggas daps wit me

You never laugh wit me, never went half wit me
Never been through the struggle, never felt the wrath wit me
Never slept on the same floor or hit the same whore
Ran up in the same store or with the same four

Blood thicker than water only in certain cases
You need water to live, you learn that in the basics
Better cherish your aces, bullets in the faces of the jokers
We laugh at fire, nigga, we smokers
Sittin' on the sofa, puffin' the hash, nigga, we focused
Why lie? I die where the coke is

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Can I live? Hell, yeah but you still gon' die
C'mon, nigga, you a thug but I'm still gon' cry
An' you done learned off experience, I'm still gon' ride
They kill me, you gon' kill them? I still got pride

Can I live? Hell, yeah, what? Ruff Ryders

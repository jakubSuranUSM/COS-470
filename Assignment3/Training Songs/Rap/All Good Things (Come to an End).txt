Ah, ah, ah

Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But, really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see
We miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...

Traveling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay (stay)
Young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in, and I don't cry
I only feel gravity, and I wonder why

Come to an end, come to an

Come to an end, come to an

The dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Die, die, die, die

Well, the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day
Till the feeling went away
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping
And the rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
So that they could die

[Everlast]
What, you think it can't happen?
Soul Assassins, two-thousand, word
It goes somethin' like this
I'm Vision-Quest, Fresh Fest era terror
Krush Groovie like a low budget movie
I'm Wild Style like Lee Qui√±ones
Stop ridin' on my cajones
I talk with a speak that's much unique
While you desperately seek for that Susie freak
Yo, word to Rob One he used to like the big ladies
My name's Everlast I started back in the eighties like
All up in your nostril, actin' hostile, thirteenth apostle
Going postal, holy ghost mode
While you walkin' on the host strow actin' bicoastal
Bitch, try to play the middle, snitch, wind up in the hospital
Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle
Put your money in the middle get broke like coal

[Chorus]
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate

[B-Real]
I spit out the fire you won't know what hit
Watch me lace you up quicker than the joint gets lit
I got years in this shit what do you got a couple?
If you gotta hustle, what do you want, trouble?
Lookin' at the two who go way back like chucks (way back)
With a hand on the pump by the big black trucks (fools)
You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels
The strange hoes want a piece look at these lame hoes
I stained those with hot blood and changed clothes
And main fools who want to rock the same clothes
And use the same flows, these unoriginals
Niggas, all of a sudden if anyone wants to run up
You get chastised and baptised and blood
When the gat lies it don't matter, you scatter
You run, you ungrateful most hateful leech niggas
Swallow in your misery I'm out of reach niggas

[Chorus]
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm ready to brawl
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate
Two deadly assassins makin' the fall
I'm Real, I'm Everlast and I'm takin' 'em all
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate

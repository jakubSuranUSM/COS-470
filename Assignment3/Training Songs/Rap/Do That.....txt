C'mon now, C'mon now

[Baby] 
Pretty lady go on do that dance
Pretty lady go on do that dance (c'mon now, let's go)

Touch it down to the floo' (do you like that daddy?) 
Pick it up and let's go (do you like that daddy?)

[Baby]
See I walk through the club wit my Prada on 
Vallet to da keys 'cause tha cars so strong 
Twenty four whoooo, mami know too 
Ballas come through tha side doo' wit they crew
I went left and Puff went right 
Plus we had on all that ice 
I had a bald chick he had one too

[P. Diddy talking]
Hey Birdman hold up a second
You see them ladies over there?
Them ladies singing that thing, ladies sing

Pimp game wear big rings 
Birdman drive a red Range

[Chorus: Baby]
Pretty lady go on do that dance

Just shake it, shake it, break it, break it 

Now look at you momma, oh, high cut

Wit a scarf around it wit a, coach hat 

Smack it up, slap it up, let me turn it up 
'Til you steam and you scream, I'm burning up
On the scene I seen her doing the butt 
Keep doing what your doing to her, let's go

Wipe a pimp down, touch the floo'

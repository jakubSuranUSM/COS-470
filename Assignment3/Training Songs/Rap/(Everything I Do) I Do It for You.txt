Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me then, you'll search no more

Don't tell me its not worth trying for
You cant tell me its not worth dying for
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart, you will find
There is nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don't tell me its not worth fighting for
I cant help it, there's nothing I want more
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you

There is no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way

You cant tell me its not worth trying for
Just cant help it, there's nothing in the world I want more
I would fight for you, yeah I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah I'd die for you

You know its true
Everything I do, I do it for you

When I fall for love the next time
And an arrow’s in my back.
I won’t let the pain get me down, oh no.
I won’t fight back.

Let the cupid take me wherever he wants to go.
Fly me to the moon like an old jazz love song.
Cupid, do what you want to do.
The choice is yours.
But when I get where you’re taking me,

Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
‘Cause getting to love’s got me losing my mind!

I’ve been wrecking my brain love’s so insane.
Cupid, help me please.
‘Cause Mr. Wrong keeps meeting me!
And I got a funny feeling love is just around the bend so
I’ll keep on pushing till love falls for me!

Let the cupid take me wherever he wants to go.
Fly me to the moon like an old jazz love song.
Cupid, do what you want to do.
The choice is yours.
But when I get where you’re taking me,

Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
Love’s gonna make me
Feel better, better, better!
'Cause getting to love’s got me losing

I’m not my best but I’m right where I need to be.
Might not be right here but he’s on his way to me.
Love’s coming soon.
I’ve found my prince.
It won’t be long till I’m in love with him!

'Cause getting to love's got me losing my mind

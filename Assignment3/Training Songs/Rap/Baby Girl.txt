Baby girl, she's cute, she's fine, she's sexy, she's mine
Good heart, real smart, got her head on right
Baby girl, all good from the hood
Stay together, we could blow up like dynamite

Baby girl, gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock and oh my, she's so tight
Baby girl, book a damn good meal
And I think we'll blow up like dynamite

Come on girl, get with me, let's see the city
You can stop by, let me see them tig ol' bitties
We can stay in the city, let me play with the kitty
Never been a minute man, all day with the kitty

Why you think chicks pray to get with me
Enough for that, wanted a rough [unverified] smack
Chicks cuff my gats, plus my gats
Hustle my crack, never juggle my crack

Don't trust 'em but f*ck 'em
What's fucking with that?
I'm the ill last trill, last real, last nigga
Get mills fast nigga, built the last nigga

It's just me and my chicks, give 'em my whips
They from a hood near you, ain't gotta get 'em no tricks
They don't give me no look unless they spoke to the dick
Keep a ride or die chick that like to smoke a spliff
Put it all in the air, smoke dro to get
I'm drinking H2O, I get you Mo and Cris, yeah

Baby girl, she's cute, she's fine, she's sexy, she's mine

Baby girl, all good from the hood
Stay together, we could blow up like dynamite

Baby girl, gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock and oh my, she's so tight
Baby girl, book a damn good meal

I'm a sucka for them ghetto women but I don't love 'em
I just love to f*ck 'em an' I don't trust 'em
You're looking at a hustler, baby
That's the reason why you always see me in that new Mercedes

When she look at my face she think I'm a baby
But she notice my papes and love how I made it
It was made to spin, don't help me save it
Ma get three of ya friends, let's jump off crazy

We can hit L.A. on a private jet, go to the L'Ermitage
For some private sex, I'ma smoke some haze
You can pop some Ex
Just think about tonight and forget the next, girl

You know how CMR do, ain't no love Boo
Just for our crew, sorry mammie that's just how thugs do
Some chicks on their way
So it's time to lose you

Baby girl, she's cute, she's fine, she's sexy, she's mine
Good heart, real smart, got her head on right
Baby girl, all good from the hood
Stay together, we could blow up like dynamite

Baby girl, don't you wanna ride with me?
Tonight you gotta leave your man
Baby girl, you gotta understand
(Baby girl)

I loves them girls that'll hold that work
And put they money in they bra and not they purse
Gimme brain in the car without saying a word
While I ride through the hood getting high as a bird

She don't even get mad when I don't answer my phone
She just like to brag that she been in my home
Love to bounce dat ass when she put on a thong
Baby girl, so street I can't leave her alone

I like Keisha and Tasha with they summer weaves
Lisa sitting on the porch eating sunflower seeds
Here I come flossing a Porsche at top speed
Of course I get them [unverified] while they stay on their knees

I leave them with no voice, only harmony
When they hum on these big N U T's
'Cause they into g's, 'cause they into me
No wonder my girls, why they envy me?

Baby girl, she's cute, she's fine, she's sexy, she's mine
Good heart, real smart, got her head on right
Baby girl, all good from the hood
Stay together, we could blow up like dynamite

Baby girl, gonna mob on the block
Keep her thang on lock and oh my, she's so tight
Baby girl, book a damn good meal
And I think we'll blow up like dynamite

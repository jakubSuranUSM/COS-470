She’s my favorite baby
Watch her do her thing
I’m here in the world
Nobody calling me
Like AT&T
Hater girl
They ain’t got nothin’ on you

So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah)
Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little thing, I’m glad she’s mine
And I mean no disrespect by this next line

(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a dope bitch
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a-a dope bitch

Number 3’s
She ain’t in here she walkin’ round here
dope like me
Cocaine, pasana?, marijuana
Wish you would light trees
Sold on her like keys
Feelin’ all on her like keys
So it seems
(It’s whatever you want)
You got it baby
The dopest thing I’ve seen
I’m hooked on you like d.o.p.e.
Like d.o.p.e.

So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah, yeah)
Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little thing, I’m glad she’s mine
And I mean no disrespect by this next line

(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a dope bitch
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a-a dope bitch

So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah, yeah)
Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little thing, I’m glad she’s mine
And I mean no disrespect by this next line

She dope like the shit up in my car
Feds came and she put it in her bra
So I sponsor Isabel Marants
It’s the gram and everything she flaunts
Knows when to cut up
Know when to shut the f*ck up
Know when to smile
And knows when to act stuck up
She like to talk who got it who gettin’ it
Which nigga all talk and who spendin’ it
She only like sports if she court side
And hoppin’ out the Panamera Porsche ride
She the bonnie to my clyde
The perfect somebody on the side
My dope bitch

(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a dope bitch
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a-a dope bitch

Dope bitch, my dope bitch
A dope bitch, a dope bitch,
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch,
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch,
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
I’m glad she’s mine

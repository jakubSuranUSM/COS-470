Ey, ey, ey
Good to see you, c'mon, dude, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright, okay, ah, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack, get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, sweater game
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy that
Bad, moonwalking, this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything, I record to it
And yet I'm on, let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go up, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer, nah
I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people, now
Sing this song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

(And we put our hands up)
(And so we put our hands up)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

(Let's go) na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na
(Aha) hey
(And all my people sing)
Na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na (ha, that's right, feels good) 
Hey (and all my people sing)
Na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na (you do it, Ray)
Oh (and all my people sing)
Na, na, nana, na, na, nana, na
Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Hey whoa eh there's nobody like me
Na na no
Whoa

Ma that's your man fiance trick ya baby daddy
Husband best friend or ya sugar daddy
We could cruise in the navvy
Or cruise in the caddy
I'm a tongue lick you toes girl
I know you like it nasty
Creep til ya call dough you know my waist heavy
Picture me bein' stuck in th e closet like r. kelly
That ain't likely I know that you like me
Just keep me on the low you can still be his wifey comon!

Hey mammy look like you arrested
With his hands cuffin' he be talkin' louder
He ain't sayin' nothin'
If that's how he do you
If that's what your used to
I'm tellin' you that you need to move
Party's over here you need to move
I can make him disappear you need to move
Let's stop wasting time
And let's get down to riding girl I promise you

[Chorus]
I know you got a man but he ain't nothin' like me 
he might put it down but he can't put it like me
My hood in my wood in my paper man you gonna like him gone 
cause ain't nothin' like me
I know you got a man but he ain't nothin' like me 
he might put it down but he can't put it like me
My hood in my wood in my paper man you gonna like him gone 
cause ain't nothin' like me

Hey honey you be on restriction
With da short money
It's cloudy over there
But here it's sooo sunny
If that's how he do you
If that what your used to I'm tellin you
That you need to move
Party's over here you need to move
I can make him dissapear you need to move
Let's stop wasting time
And let's get down to grinding girl I promise you come see!!!

[Chorus]

She said she like me
But she hate I got these cubbish ways
I try to work a 9 to 5 but it doesn't pay
We met the other day
Seeing you and hoolard hey!
Where you from what's your phone number where you stay
Come let me sit you in this bentely
On these heated seats
Sit us some crystal
Let you ride and see the beach
I know you probably got a man but give me a chance
I guarantee he can't do it baby like I can
Yeah

[Chorus]

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

Big dog rolling on campus, 
Bitching, me rolling in the city is my canvas
Pull over bad bitches to my right side,
niggas, they be tripping ‘'cause I'm fucking with their bitches, shit
Didn't even rhyme, but it sound good, 
She said she wanted dip over, I give her hard wood,
West side, baby, get enough call, 
Didn't bring a bat back, I just knock the doors down
Wait, my nigga, what you tripping for?
F*ck these hoes, get the door
Stack your money, make your shit clip,
Don't get caught up in your whip with an ugly bitch
Alright, train me like Eddy, 
F*ck this, I'm a pedi, 
All the bitches crazy, call me Tom Petty
Grab her hips, tell her keep that ass steady,
With that mouth good, show me, girl, don't tell me

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

Tell a broke nigga back up, 
I'm cashed up, tied up in the game, I'm stuffed up
Tuxedo bitches got a lap up,
I don't matter when the automorb throw my hat up, akup
Walk up, wondering why them bitches don't trust us,
Pussy coming in, I'ma need more rubbers,
Your bitch love us, she lick dick under covers,
Take cover, leave nothing on the tongue, girl
I like damn bitches in the valley, 
Working at them dalleys, porn star Valery,
Nice to meet, said she like the D, 
I like to be in fact like once a week
Once she get the akup, bitch, pack up,
Turn around, count the money, watch the shit add up
Turn around, get another bitch that's badder,
Ask fed up and then f*ck her faster, nigga

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

Bad bitches on my line, call it car waiting
niggas waiting on a sideline, they be hating
Four bitches on my whip, I'm a limit dating
All black karma, ask me of a nigga's hating
And I run myself like a really,
When a nigga play my songs, hand a bottle to the DJ
I rather kill her, I rather f*ck your bitch, nigga,
You're at home, I'm on the road, getting rich, nigga
Enough of that shit, let me get back to the women,
‘'cause it's taking this bitch, I'm liking what I see
Give me more bottles, I'm trying to get drunk,
Wake up tomorrow, look to my right, ask who the f*ck is you?
Please don't tell me what we do, 
Poundry, round two, high class biz', 
But best believe I'll ground you
Walk of shame, baby, let my homies crown you

Waste money before I waste my time,
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit,
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup,
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

Bone, Bone, Bone, 
Bone, Bone, Bone, 
Bone, Bone, Bone, 
So tell me what ya gonna do
When there ain't nowhere to run
When judgement comes for you
When judgement comes for you
So tell me what ya gonna do
There ainâ€˜t no place to hide
When judgement comes for you
Cos itâ€˜s gonna come for you

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

So why you gotta go and pray
You're gonna make it some day
You got a job
So why you want a raise
Why you wanna act tough
Why can't you play
This whole fame thing
Just comes one of these days
And when it comes
You'll be one of a kind
But before this
Keep all this in your mind
Cos I will hold you
To the end of the line
Want all this
You'll be mad to decline

So what you gonna do 
When everyday's the same
Try and do this shush 
Just for a glimpse of fame
Didn't mean to do it 
Just put yourself to shame
Didn't want to kill her
Just tryin' to play the game
When you reach the crossroads
Where you gonna go
Go with your conscience
Just let your feelings flow
Life's up life's down
But things can turn around
Innocent or guilty
You will soon be found

Mmmm and we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Still we lay
Still we lay

(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)

Who's that get off the train
Avirex jacket
With the poor with that rain
Why take that man's chain
No more trouble made

Livin' on the streets everyday 
So lame
People walking past
Looking at you in shame
But they don't really care
Who's the one to blame
You're gonna take the wrong turn
You're gonna lose the game
You know its not you're fault 
That life turned this way
But people don't care
Don't hear what you say
And the way it is now
Is the way it's gonna stay
There's no choice left but to hope and pray

(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)

I came from the London underground
Then I took my sound and spread it over ground
Yes I'm leveling over clouds
I'm on top but holding it down
The kings sat in his throne
My heads to big for a crown
L-O-L you can laugh out loud
S-O-O they wanna send out
Try call for help or something?
Preventions cure my cousin
Prevent this beef from buzzin'
I'm the beast that elevated from the street
And yeah I must feel I beg you talk to them there weak
Like

Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know

I roll around grinning my teeth
Yeah I am the prettiest beast
I grew out of the grittiest streets
I grew out a team that started on heat
Four years down the line I'm here
Four years down the line your there
I just laugh at those who strayed off
I'm proof that hard work pays off
On reined that road I stayed off
I became that beast with this heart
I aim for the movement
See you around stars
You hear me and know that the swaggers to hard
They can hear the fire in me on the stations
Spit to anger or my passion or that bound determination
Like

Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know

I was the underdog on the underground
I'm taking over town
They was laughing at me then but you tell me who's laughing now
I'm sitting on hits
Their babies stuck in dippers sitting on shit
I take the piss
There actually pissed
Like how did he get that far?
Rare I just kick back and laugh
I'm proof that underdogs can make it
If you get that chance then take it
Don't let talent get wasted
I'm the product of the streets
With some anger and some beats
Precisely why dint they just call in I am beast
Like

You took me of the leash

Oh I'm coming from under the ground
Tonight I'm coming up to take it down
I'm free coming deep from the sleep
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know
Now I've woken up, that's why they call me the beast baby get to know

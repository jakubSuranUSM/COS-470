(chorus)
Come on everybody, come in here and swing
Everybody come on everybody, come in here and swing

Move to a rhythm that's smooth, made to groove
Work that body baby it's a party
Shake it, funky ain't it?
Yeah, the long awaited return of fluent movement-enhanced music
Ain't nothin' but to do it
Manoeuvre to a sound that's makin' you wanna dance to it
Nod ya head, clap ya hands and shake that ass to it
Hit the floor, it's yours, assuming that's what ya came here for
Why play the wall'n'all
The flavour's so raw get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

(chorus)

Bounce to a piece that got the spot hoppin'
Bottom to top, top to bottom
Form, a bit of a break from the norm
Converge with a melodic surge and get ya groove on
Amplify the vibe supplied on your hi-fi
Level the bass to coincide with the highs then rise
Partake in a rhythm created to elevate you to a point only we can take you
Notes arranged, grooves interchange
Engage with flav givin' ya what ya crave
Praise the MC that's lacin' ya party
Maintain, do ya dance and don't hurt nobody
As I see bodies bouncing constantly
Ears consume the bom diggy 'til ya city bound
Get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

(chorus)

Get loose, feel the groove cruise, on a bassline ooze
Sweat drips as the hips of ladies gyrate and the fellas go crazy
What more could ya ask for in a joint that's packin' the floor
Plus a rapper type raw
Define the aspect of rhyme orated
Think how long ya waited to get blessed with innovative style
Providing your motivation
The duration of a jam that sounds so amazing
Cave in get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down

You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna wall around me
I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

Incarceration what I'm facin'
When I'm with you
Your watchin' my every move
Tryin' to pick up on some clues
We play twenty questions
Every time I walk in or out the door
What do you bother for (what do you bother for)
Get comfortable it's yours

It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E
Cracking stressing and second guessing
Many time and time again
We go from lovers back to friends
Got to put this to an end

You wanna handcuff me
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

I swear I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key
But yo I don't know what to tell ya (don't know what to tell ya)

Should have been somewhere relaxing
Don't compare me to your last one
I can't help it she was a fast one
A sassy one I'm a classy one

Seems like that should make you happy hun

It's gonna take (it's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E)
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T to keep my L-O-V-E

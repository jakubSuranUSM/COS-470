Uhh..
Sittin in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggaz plotin to get, uhh
Cause if it's me, it's on
Loc, the Esse wit the black knights just got stoned
And then he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch or his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
and left him with two black guys
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch lookin they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin if I'm slippin in these County Blues

[Chorus]
Niggaz f*ck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin, if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's a steady rainology

[Snoop Dogg]
See the first verse got'cho ass scared
But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
What are fools always wonderin?
Young nigga, welcome (welcome)

{*interlude*}

[Snoop Dogg]
I be "God damn nigga, what'chu gon' do?"
Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets, lick
and stuck, fucked and all that
Boy when you get out you betta not never come back
I tell you that'll make a punk hard
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Esse's is deep
And it look like they strait tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Dabbity Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
You ran out on the brotha's
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a hoe (you'se a hoe)
Uhh, and I'ma let you know (let you know)
I mean, niggaz is bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I ain't talkin 'bout all why'all
Cause I know some niggaz from the see-P-T
and some big homie's from the L-be	-see and South Central
Niggaz why'all know, why'all is the looniest
Keep it true and ya County Blues doin this

Repeat [Chorus]

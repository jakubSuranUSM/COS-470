Uh, what what, yo yo P-5-D uncut 
Check it out, yo yo, S-P uncut 
Yo yo, what P-5-D uncut, yeah yeah it's that Philly shit 
Yo yo, check it out, yo yo 

[Chorus: x 2]
You Don't See Us, but we see you 
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's 
'Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept 
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check 

Mesmerizing, state of the art caffeine 
It's over head like Omni-verse screen 
I'm not the average savage that curse queens 
I'm something from his worst dreams 

First we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen 
Grat'll hold planet by purse strings 
MC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things 
Speaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things 

Man each world, it ain't no time to recline 
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine 
Shine like jewels that spark, swimming with sharks 
Never caught speaking to NARC's, that's weak in the parks 

I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize 
Grip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise 
Take a detour, I be all that I can be whore 
Talkin' to this bitch life, had to make her my wife 

Live twice, got seven more lives to live 
I'm all out, takin' things to the fullest extent 
Help me get it down and we can split one-hundred percent 
Run a rapper through a maze like a experiment 
Word up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo 

[Chorus: x 2] 

The Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp 
Wit my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for conk 
Who pumps your heart, I made you want to rhyme from the start 
You should be more alert, then you wouldn't get hurt 

Get off your horse and on your P's and beware 
Of images you seein', did deceiving, you're scared 
And even more shook up than the scenes that's near 
I'm Dice Raw, sting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore 

Who want to piece, well it's Round One, let's begin 
I got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in 
I got shit that'll have you begging me to shoot ya 
I'm the professor, you rock a dunce cap, go get a tutor  

Yo, Okay Computer, Radiohead's knock to the future 
Shock like Kurtis, at your service 
None other than, the Fifth governing playin the cut again 
y'all clueless to what the f*ck is up again 

Yo, hard times and sufferin' 
What, my peoples in the crevices strugglin' 
'Nuff of them untie soldier thespian 
But I'm from the next e-on, supreme being that's unseen for MC'n 

[Chorus: repeat x 2] 

Yo, they all around me 'round me 
On my head, they got a bounty 
I'm tryin' to get this bell up so I can flee your county 
Triple-six, come in my mix, flood it wit tricks 

I'm sharper than rough spoons for icepicks 
Niggas price bricks till dawn, if the money is long 
Cats who play strong will inhale, then go play bong 
You wrong son, you thought I wasn't droppin' a ton 
Sit and think about the way I want to tally a sum 

Ah-yo I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you 
From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you 
Dancin' all dolly as you pussy for them folly 
I knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed 

I float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations 
When my name said out loud, you'll lose your concentration 
Dice Raw, D-I-C-E-R-A-W, you want to take it 
Otherwise, f*ck you goin' do? 

That's what I thought, nada, nothing, caput, zero 
Rough as sandpaper but still smooth as a tiptoe 
Raw's takin' over, baby don't tell me you ain't know 
A lot of kids can rap but you fuckin wit the pros 

Ya know what I'm sayin', y'all know the legendary Roots crew, it's like 

[Chorus to fade]

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

Blaming everybody who dealt your hand
But you're keepin' your on head in the sand
You should be sweatin' while you sit at home
Looking under your bed for your backbone

Instead, you ridin', bitch, till the tables turn
Till you get your check, till your luck returns
How are you expecting to find your way?
With shoulda, woulda, coulda coming out your face

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

You keep ridin' your bike in a cul-de-sac
Think you're getting somewhere ridin' piggyback
You're only gettin' out what you're puttin' in
So stick your neck out, take it on the chin

'Cause there's a whole lotta nothin' goin' on for too long
'Cause the time isn't right 'cause it feels all wrong
Wishin' like a baby you could just get on
Ain't nothin' doin' while nothin's done

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

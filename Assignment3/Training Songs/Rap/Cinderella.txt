I'm not your little princess anymore
Are you feeling this now put your hands up in the air now
Are you feeling this now put your hands up in the air 
Gonna get ya gonna (repeated)

Boy it's your problem you wasted my time and
I thought that I told you i've made up my mind.

Whatever defense you've put up, just give in,
'Cause you had it, you lost it, so don't you deny it.

I must be an insomniac if it wasn't for the way you were talkin' back
I don't need a sequel, I'm gonna fade this show to black.

[Chorus: x2]
I'm not another Cinderella
Waitin' for a Rockafella
If the shoe don't fit, then that's it
I don't need a storyteller

I can't believe it was love at first sight coz
It feels like it's over or maybe it's me

Something you said or you did or you wanted
Money can't buy and it just isn't free

I must be an insomniac if it wasn't for the way you were talkin back
I don't need a sequel, gonna fade this show to black.

[Chorus: x2]
(I'm not your little princess anymore)
(Ha ha)
Get it?

I'm not your Cinderella
You're not my Rockafella
I'm not your Cinderella
Don't want no Storyteller

[Rap]
Yeah what yo let me introduce myself
I'm the girl that you keep tryin' to play
Me for your wealth
You say that baby you're into me

But you love yourself
I don't want any of your money
Baby and I think that's funny
'Cause you're by yourself

And ah, I'm not your Cinderella
Gotta get another fella
Gotta get a man that understands 
You're just a storytella-acap

Comin at you 
Come again
(repeat 3)

I'm on the refirst verse yo I'm comin kinda swift 
Bust the lyric and the lyric that goes like this 
I can flow with the best and keep a crowd jumpin 
Like the niggaz for life and we always into something 
Star takes it away little G's got to have it 
Now its back to the lab so I can start bamalamin 
'Cause Toss is like kick it and I love to eat chicken 
From south with applause and the nine is straight clickin 
M dogs Hip hogs its a sucker free movement 
Yo Pete what up T show these suckers how its done G 
Get up on the mic and bust a funky ragamuffin

[Chorus]

Me come again me comin comin again 
Me comin at you so hard you say please come again 
Me ragamuffin rappen and me come a little faster 
So pass the raster to the ganja master puff puff puff

In 1991 I had to get out of the dope game 
I'm slangin weed and a little bit of cocaine 
Just pushin rocks on the corner on a park bench 
I made a lot of dollars but it didn't make cents 
Its easy money cause the hogs are highly organized 
One hit and a smoker stays hypnotized 
They come again comin again and its a pity 
'Cause now their all chinked out like blinky in new jack city 
They try to quit but then the hitter calls them back 
So they say don't come come near me no more 
Don't come near me no more I don't want no crack 
This smokin fantasy makes me feel irate 
Sticky sesamea pipe may we love gonjie 
So pass me the spliff and you know that I be token 
I couldn't keep track of all the weed I'm smokin 
They ask me will I quit I say you must be jokin 
'Cause I'll be smokin till my funky brain is broken 
And even then you know I still won't be the end 
Cause me comin at you so hard you tell me please come again

[Chorus]

Its been a long time comin so punks start runnin 
And if you cross my line you bet your ass will be gunnin 
I gonna rap hoes right next to the sewer 
Call me brother black hip hop contersuer 
Ground bracken fanatic Quban Asiatic 
And if you want beef I'll give you asmastatic 
A mover and a shaker big time a money maker 
I'll make you follow me and I'm out of here later 
Before I make and exit my microphone I check it 
Then I put down the mic cause I'm microphone reckless 
Now hold up just a second cause this is for the record 
And when I swing my thing then all the honey girls get naked 
Then its like my duty to grab some naked booty 
But I always flash the latex when I'm sexin up a cutie 
'Cause I'm the horny man the freakin reakin Mexican 
And me comin at you so hard you say please come again 

[Chorus]

Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the barcode
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or slit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black'n'Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop'n'Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
{"America's most blunted!"} Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

Doom! The Madvillain killin mad boom
Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The beat conductor smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough, to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't {f*ck} with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat when you try to react
Even your pops got smack
Even your moms got crack
Meanwhile!! While my bowl got packed
(Do you?) Drop X so you can have good sex (What, no)
I smoke dank so I can grow me a shank
I got the fat sack {shh} all day I'm on it
Who are we? {"America's most blunted!"}

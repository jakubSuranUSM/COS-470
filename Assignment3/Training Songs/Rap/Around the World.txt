[Jamie Foxx]
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm, just tryin' to get my money right
So let some dumb nigga take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed-out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)

[The Game]
She like black Bentley Coupes, black Day-tons
Black interior, black ridin' shotgun
Black four-five, black Air Ones
Bangin' "The Black Album," track #1
She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite
If it's gon' get me the pussy I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marques Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got halfway through watchin' "Ray" I hit
I laid it down beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what
The it's part two, in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin' Mary J. cause she don't want, +No Drama+
I'd rather take yo' ass to the Bahamas
Then give you 30 thousand a month like Diddy baby mama

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Picture me thuggin', picture me lovin' you
Like Bobby love Whitney now picture me fuckin'
Pullin' your ponytail smackin' you on the ass
Tellin' you how (I can take you all around the world)
That nigga can't do it like this
Even Beyonce couldn't move it like this
She only f*ck with +Soldiers+, that's her shit
I hate to admit it but I love my bitch
So much, I'm sittin' outside in the Benz
Thinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin', now I'm dealin'
With "The Diary of a Mad Black Woman" with Louis Vuitton luggage
She told me she was tired of The Game and rap
Quit like Ma$e then she came right back
I told you the bitch sex was wack
And you're all I need, even Jamie know that

[Chorus]

[The Game]
You know what they say, more money more problems more drama
Means more marijuana and less baby mama
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force Ones come in twos
Yeah, I like her, and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you your Burkin' bags, so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't f*ck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superheads book?
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talkin' 'bout buyin' a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing

[Chorus]

[Jamie Foxx]
Around the world with me yeah
Around the world with me, hey
Around the world with me, hey
Mmm, oh

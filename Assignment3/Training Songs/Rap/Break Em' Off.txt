I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a show 'em pourin' up a deuce while ridin' slab

I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show'em pourin' up a deuce while ridin' slab

Now I gotta work ma wood grain wheel
Poppin' trunks, poppin' pills, still poppin' seals
Higher than a hill with ma mind on mills
Piece and chain swangin', bank roll, shiny grill
Baby, I got million dollar dreams, with ma mind on cream
I'm in that mean green machine clean on 19s
Flat screens in the headrest, swangin' like a swing set
Brandy wine, paint wet, comin' down that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that Kush flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a street light, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, mustard green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta, Mac game, sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up fully loaded and sloppy
Tryin' to hit it and quit it
And walk off like Big Poppi then break 'em off

I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show' em pourin up a deuce while ridin' slab
I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show 'em pourin up a deuce while ridin' slab

Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck blow mist five 50 snow bunny
Bentley continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, dat's expensive taste
And 'em frilly ass fools we send 'em to myspace
I'm a break 'em off until the backbone broken

Stainless steel drop phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the Kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes (that's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lazers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors
I'm a show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on then u buckle up the seat belt
Swisha House, Young Don, capital TF

I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show'em pourin up a duece while ridin slab
I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show'em pourin up a duece while ridin slab

Already
Higher than the satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuverin' thru the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on 'em buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that minute maid droppa', with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the two
The fifth wheel on the ground, and the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
Ma skills is so ill when workin' the wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Wide screen mind frame, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on dat Osama, baby leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two seater feeder, it's me and a senorita
3 ounces up in the liter, and it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park
Similar to Derek Jeter (Break 'em off)

I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show'em pourin up a duece while ridin slab
I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad, I'm a break 'em
I'm a break 'em off real bad,
I'm a break 'em , I'm a break 'em off real bad
I'm a show'em pourin up a duece while ridin slab

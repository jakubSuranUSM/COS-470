[Chorus: Akon]
Don't look no farther!
Baby, I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me do ill do it)
Cause I'll be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)

[Baby Bash]
Now I'm back in a flash
Feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner, Suga Suga don't stress
Forget about the rest, let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, Baby back in your vibe
Now I can't be denied I can't lie I'm on ya
And never ever want to say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side andale arriba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper
These words comin' out the speaker
Trill love is off the meter

[Chorus]
[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone tell them squares to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet
How I keep it so saucy and I get respect
You don't have to look no farther, you dealin with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh) [Repeat: x 3]
Now I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh) [Repeat: x 3]

[Chorus: x 2]

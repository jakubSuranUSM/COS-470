Hop out, night life, Iâ€™m sorry (Skrrt)

You know we likes to party
Na, na, na, na, wheels up on the jet
La, la, la, la roll up after sex

Oh yeah, down to the core, yeah
Couldn't tell you better than I show ya
Been tryin' so hard to ignore the
Way you make that clap, Nola, Nola
See you curve in a stack in your frame, girl
Dip swerve, then I'm back in your lane, girl
Keep that ass up all night, restless
I just finger roll and finesse it
Straight up, no time for the extras

Please believe me (believe me)
I ain't talkin' Vegas
When I say I'll take you to the Venetian
Gettin' high, red eye on the PJ
Touch down, top floor in the PH
I know you hear us loud on the PA
What I'm on, give her game like EA
Ease up, baby, give me a little leeway
But make sure you keep it in motion
Wake up and know we get straight to mimosas, aw yeah
Be on the first thing smokin'
Or you, if you down, drop the roof, see me coastin', aw yeah

Dance dance dance
Dance dance dance
Makes me want to dance

When I saw you girl I knew 
That you were something out of a story book
And I told me heart that we gotta take one look 
I imagine both me and you
Doing what lovers do
Holding hands in the park
Making love girl after dark

(The ooh the ahh the ooh)
The sounds of the birds and the bees
Bringing you to your knees
Is all I want to do yeah

[Chorus]
Dance dance dance,dance dance dance
Makes me want to dance
I just want to dance with you
I just want to roll with you
I just want to be the one who really gets to know you 
I don't care and I don't mind
I will spend the whole of my time
This is what it takes for me 
To hold it down and make you mine

Every day spent like the first
Taking us right back to the birth of our love
Seems to me like I never get enough
Think about the way that we first kissed
It was a night like this
We stayed together every day, ever since

(The ooh the ahh the ooh)
The sounds of the birds and the bees
Bringing you to your knees
Is all I want to do yeah

[Chorus: x 2]
The only thing between us is the floor
The DJ's playing our favourite song
So lets not take to long
I want to dance all through the night with you
Dance,dance daaaance,yeah

I just want to dance with you [Repeat]
 
I just want to roll with you
I just want to be the one who really gets to know you
I don't care and I don't mind
I will spend the whole of my time
This is what it takes for me to hold it down and make you mine

Dance dance dance,dance dance dance
Makes me want to dance

It happened the moment, when you were revealed
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved
Give me paradise

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (don't ever wonder)

Shouldn't I realize (shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe
'Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
Woo
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (wonder) (don't ever wonder)

Shouldn't I realize (shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high 
That you're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (don't ever wonder)
Shouldn't I realize
You're the highest
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (don't ever)
Don't ever wonder
Woo
Don't ever wonder
Oh, don't ever wonder
Don't ever wonder
Never question the meaning
Don't ever wonder
Without you there's no me, don't ever wonder
Don't ever wonder
Can't you see? 
Don't ever wonder
Can't you see? 
Don't ever wonder

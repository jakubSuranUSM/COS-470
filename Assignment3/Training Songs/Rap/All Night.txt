Welcome to Tha Alkaholik function, yeah 
Yes to party down 
We came to party, we came to party, we came to party 
Yes to party down 
We came to party, we came to party, we came to party 

Aiyyo, step in my area, and I'ma bury ya 
Tha Likwit crew is blowin so the more the girl the merrier 
So bring your sexy body to the front and make some noise 
While these beats wind the Likwit homies up like Freakazoids 
Plus my style as hot as sex on a platta 
That's why your dame was open once I threw these lyrics at her 
Say what? The rhyme data ??? 
Smokin wack MC's so bad I'm at the ground evacuatin 
So hit the exits, while I'm rhyme flexin on some next ish 
That come across in different shapes and forms like playin Tetris 
So from the West it's (who?) I thought you knew 
Cool ass CaTashTrophe, from the crew with all the moves 
So pop the tops off, while I pop beats that knock your blocks off 
TASH, got the style that house any beanie bopper 
So check the time of clock while I rock the land 
"Hey ladies!" tell em whose in this jam 

(It's Tha Liks baby) 
(It's Tha Liks baby) 

Here to wet your top 
So all the ladies gather round, it's time to party down

An R&B fan, or a dope MC 
Some ol' jazz cat that won a Grammy 
A wide receiver, from Miami 
A soccer goalie or a maitre'd 
A Playboy Bunny, even if you can't see 
I don't give a damn if you security 
Or you got a degree, at USC 
My uncle, my cousin, or my auntie 
You could be one-time it don't matter to me 
Cause when you bring your ass to a Likwit show 
You gonna get wet if you in the front row 
Row, row, Ro, Ro

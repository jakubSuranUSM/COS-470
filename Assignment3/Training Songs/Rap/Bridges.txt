There was still there, cross rooms
And you said you ready to move no
What to do with heartbroken lady
Oh I just didn't know

So you put me away but I never wanted to know
Girl I never ever wanted to end this way
Despite of the pain girl I gotta let you know
I'll be coming back for you one day

So don't burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
I know it hurts but don't it burn
So don't burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
you know girl I'm just hope I get on

You said you wouldn't forgive me for all the wrong I've done
I'm a foolish boy that glap in your heart to all the feels we go

So you put me away but I never wanted to know
No I never ever wanted to end this way
Despite of the pain girl I gotta let you know
I'll be coming back for you one day

Don't let burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
I know it hurts but don't it burn
So don't burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
You know girl I'm just hope I get on

I'm gonna fight for you cuz I'll be coming back to you
I'm gonna fight til you come
Please don't let it back
Please don't let it back
Baby don't, cuz I'll be coming back to you

Don't let burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
Cuz in your arms is where I belong
Don't burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you
Don't burn the bridges cuz I'll be coming back to you

Go to school get good grades to put myself ahead
Now I work so hard for everything I got
Now who the f*ck is Jerry to tell me that I'm not?
And I say backup
Don't touch me again
I'm gonna beat your family and your best friend
I said backup, backup you're fuckin' with the wrong crew
You won't talk shit to my face but I'll talk shit to you
Why I ain't your buddy

And I say backup
Don't touch me again

If you try to f*ck me up boy, You're gonna get bucked back
And I say backup

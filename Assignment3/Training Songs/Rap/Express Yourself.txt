Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor

Put your, put your, put your back in
Put your, put your, put your back in the in the nah
Put your, put your, put your, put your, put your, put your
Put your back in
Drop the floor

Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low, now

Let’s red whine in your head down low

Shake, put your god now

Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low

Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low

Put your god , put your god, put your god

They be hating on my name but my beats they love
And they mad cause I’m hot and they wish they was
They be hating on my name but my beats they love
And they mad cause I’m hot and they wish they was
They be hating on my name but my beats they love
And they mad cause I’m hot and they (oh oh)

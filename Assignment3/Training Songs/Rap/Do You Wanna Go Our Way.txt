Now what sound of my d.j cuts
Terminators back on some ol' fools track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin' disco raps used to be whack

Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil' bit of this a lil' bit of dat
Who dropped the bomb on hip hop
Who got biggie and who shot tupac

What's forgot ain't no easy, no Scott Larock
Now what's rap gotta do with what you got
For whom the bell tolls
Is that the way the story goes 

85% believing all the videos
God knows who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose in the middle of all the woes

And def jam Negros turnin' up their nose
There's one way in no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Time to make life shine again like glass
Gotta make it shine like glass

Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine I had a dream

Da clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team
Wiped em out like a drought
Damn I'm raps tetracycline

Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot
And got hit with bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get wit

As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady 
World turned upside down
I put it down 

Why destroy what you love 
Look around 
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found

Why it all come tumblin' down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how dat sound

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

On and on to the break a dawn
Some the 100 meter dash I'm the marathon
Been around a long time
But the rhyme the same

Sound remains insane
Exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin

So I parallel the brains of Cobain
Show no shame like the pain of Kane
Gettin' mad opposition hip to the game
It's that gran ol' pe ammo

Different time different channel
Funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house

With the thickness that get dis
One two three four five attackin' they frat
Griff is back got five on it black
The track got x on the decks

Terminators back 'cause a dat is whack
On the one and two
Yeah go flavor
Pe hit the road gettin' set to explode

Fight the power for peace
Can't forget the war mode
Overload
There she blows

Here we go
Now you know 
Damn another Alamo

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

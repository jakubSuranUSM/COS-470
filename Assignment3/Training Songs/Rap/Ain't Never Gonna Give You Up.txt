Well there's not a bit of truth in what you hear
Just a whole lot of jealousy out there smearin'
My good name all over the place
Just to get you thinkin' that I'm two faced

But I would never go south
I was never dreamin' of anybody else
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is
 
Ain't never gonna give you up
Ain't never gonna let you down baby
Ain't never gonna give you up
Hey hey hey hey
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna give you up
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna let you down baby

I wanna be right there for you so don't
Believe another word cause all those low girls
Only wanna put the split between us
They keep getting off on all the fuss
But I will always treat you
Just the way I always I'd do
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is

Ain't never gonna give you up
Ain't never gonna let you down baby
Ain't never gonna give you up
Hey hey hey hey
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna give you up
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna let you down baby

Baby don't you know that I want to be with you

Ain't never gonna give you up
Ain't never gonna let you down baby
Ain't never gonna give you up
Hey hey hey hey
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna give you up
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna let you down baby

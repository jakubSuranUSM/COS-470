Don't say what you won't do
you know you'll be the first one
to go on through yes you will
don't say what you won't do you know
you'll be the first one to go on through
go on through
I know you mean you mean well
but looking at you one can't tell
you've got changes to make
cause the way you treat me girl
just ain't right
always frontin' on someone
but never think about the damage you've done
to me and it's about damn time I talk about it
everytime I do for you
you turn around and make me feel like a fool
with your actions
so much for the words
baby I love you yes
cause now I've wised up girl
It's time for me to go
You better think about it
Cause I'm here to let you know
Don't say what you won't do
you know you'll be the first one
to go on through yes you will
don't say what you won't do you know
you'll be the first one to go on through
go on through
I want to make good love to you
I want to do the things the things you wouldn't do
but your forcing me to look the other way
I'm seeing things that I really shouldn't see
girl you better hurry cause you're running outta time
and this is your last chance for you to be mine
and I'm asking you what you gonna do
tell me what you're gonna do
cause now I've wised up girl
It's time for me to go
You better think about it
Cause I'm here to let you know
Don't don't don't say what you won't do
(you won't do)
you know you'll be the first one
(first one)
to go on through yes you will
don't say what you won't do you know
you'll be the first one to go on through
go on through

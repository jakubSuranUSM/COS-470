Yeah, hey, oh
Yeah I'm feeling it
Yeah I'm feeling it
I've got gas in my veins right now, I'm feeling it
Hey
I know you see me (don't gas me)
Haha, I know you see me (don't gas me)
Far rude boy

Feel so good I might rock my sliders
Walk through the manor givin' out high 5's (hey)
I'll mix some big dirty riddim for the riders
Drop a couple jaws for the minors (yg's)
Can't forget the OG's and the old timers
Might go find me a couple fine diners
Couple entree's and a couple appetizers
No I don't drink Appletiser (no way)
Feel so good I might buy me
A German whip with the ceiling gone
Make a turn then dip with the bass on max (woo)
Yeah they heard my shit, yeah they heard my shit
(I know you heard it) streaming, no CDs
No burners skipped, got the playlist
There I don't burn and rip, on the M25
Yeah I swerve and slip, yeah I swerve and slip

Took a bop in the car, rolled up
And they said, "Sway down"
And I said, "Don't gas me!"
They said, "Fam, you're a star
Can I get a quick pic for the 'Gram"
And I said, "Don't gas me!" (My G)
Must admit. one pretty brown ting
Said she love me long time
And I said, "Don't gas me!"
I went shop and the boss man said
"Don't pay me, it's fine"
And I said (what)
"You ain't gotta gas, I'm gas, fam," (don't gas me)
"You ain't gotta gas, I'm gas, fam," (don't gas me)

Feel so good I might buy a new crep
So I look correct when I 1-2 step (hey)
Everyone looking like I don't pet
Tell 'em, "It's calm, no sweat," (calm)
Might just pull out the 12-10 decks
Might tell my man, "Pull out the jet" (what)
I wanna go China, try out Tibet
I might go bed and forget (wake up)
Feel so good I might try a bit of camping
Feel so good I might try a bit of lamping (what)
Feel so good that I parked on a
Double yellow line and I don't mind if I get a clamping (whoo)
More time I ain't ramping
Don't watch that right now it's a fam ting (hey)
Yeah they call me raskit and I do the damn ting
And it's still big dirty stankin' (oi)

Feel so good I might find me a wifey
Buy her some diamonds, have her all icey
But I love a hood girl, 'cause your so feisty
You ain't gotta be so pricey (love ya)
Cooking up a curry, or mutton and rice
Cooking up something all pepper and spicey (hmm)
Put it on my plate, yeah that'll do nicely
You ain't gotta be so shiesty
Feel so good but I still want a prenup
Now I gotta just pre without a feel up (hmm)
Tell a DJ that I demand a wheel up
And you know I blew the scene up (what)
Why you so vexed boy? Chill out and heal up
All I do is make moves and rate my tea cup
Have a Kit-Kat, rude boy, best you ease up
Take time and get ya P's up (oi)

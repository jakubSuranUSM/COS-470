Now I ain't ever been the type to
Not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant ya like her
Play ya position, just might invite ya
Party till the morning if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes,
Don't want to name a few
Don't lie either so don't ask
She might be naming you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryin' to start shit to end my ? I'm too up on my riches
Gang? been a part of me, dog, and I'ma keep winning
Never should of started me off
I love the way I'm living
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumbling to myself hoping that my shit flop
Now that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move
Dummy, find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
And yo it's still gon be left in the race?

[Chorus]
(Ayyo she got it like)

Every day, eating and taking it to the

Vixen V-12 with systems

Everybody keeping it moving
It's double are, ? this is Eve-olution, now scream

If you're really ready we're takin it to the

Vicious spit flows ridiculous

Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell ? scream my name for me

(There's more but I have no more time to sit here and type out lyrics for you 
Lazy ass so I suggest you get the lyrics to this song so I can have them. 
Thank you.)

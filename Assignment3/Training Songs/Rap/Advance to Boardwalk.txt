[ CHORUS: U.G. ]
Aiyo, get nice
Shoot dice
Skip the small talk
Son, advance to BOARDWALK
Collectin properties and profit
Expand and make dough
Yo, slide past GO

[ Phantasm ]
Check the drama as the saga starts to enfold
To advance and pass GO and get the pot of gold
In the MEDITERRANEAN
Met this fly lady, and
She had two lovers
The rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS for INCOME TAX
After this heist, son, we sittin on stacks
In this new community lookin for the Treasure Chest
Took a wrong left turn, f*ck it yo, nevertheless
It's my fault, kid
We ended up on BALTIC
Off course
But still we ain't takin a loss
There he go, READING at the RAILROAD in his Porsche
Waitin for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[ U.G. ]
Can it be so simple?
Playin in my rental on ORIENTAL
AVENUE passin through CONNECTICUT
Got to get the burn mark just to VISIT Matt Life in the clink (/JAIL)
I'm bagged for stolen minks and snatchin links
[ Phantasm ]
At ST. CHARLES PLACE
Let me check Digga and Masta Ase
And the Inc.
They own ELECTRIC COMPANY
Next is the state of VIRGINIA, with Rhamadan
And got Mad Skillz like Shaqwan
At the train station
We waitin
For my PENNSYLVANIA connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim, cause he's a SAINT like JAMES
And when you're done with the body burn em in the flames

[ U.G. }
Sippin Hennessy on TENNESSEE
With Hav and P
Seen Schott Free, asked me to walk to NEW YORK
AVENUE, bag two chicks who whips were stashed at FREE PARKING
We seen Lou Diamond with Tony Starks, then
Some kid tried to buck me
On KENTUCKY
Some gang named CHANCE wore bandanas
So I ran to INDIANA
(ILLINOIS/) ILLA NOYZ and his boys
Held me down and got my back
Pass the gat, yes, I'm just cool like that

[ CHORUS ]

[ Phantasm ]
It's after three, yo
We at B&0
Amtrak and MARVIN GARDENS
A player like Phantasm is starvin
Check the fountain and see if the WATER WORKS
While I send four
Messages up to VENTNOR

[ U.G. ]
I was on ATLANTIC
With my man Quick
To snatch jewels and hit the scale
Seen 50, didn't want to GO TO JAIL
On PENNSYLVANIA
I met Lorena
She had on Guess
She said (you need a vest
goin through COMMUNITY CHEST)
Or NC, NORTH CAROLINA if you visit
You look exquisite
????? made by PACIFIC
Kicked a SHORT LINE
Shorty was mine
She was with it
I got the digits
But never got the CHANCE to hit it

[ Phantasm ]
At PARK PLACE
Hit the Parker Brothers' safe
And made a killin
And skated with about two million
But we got to pay TAX on the LUXURY
The Cella Dwellas' plan is to expand and live comfortably

[ CHORUS ]

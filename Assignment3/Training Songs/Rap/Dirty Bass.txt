Dirty bass
I love that
Dirty bass
I love that!

Deep low when I feel loco
Don’t trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rolo, rolo
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that
I love that

Yo, I make girls jiggle, right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she ain’t that ghetto
She likes to sip the bubb', VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass
My girl got a banging trunk

Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (shoes at the door)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you’re here for)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you’re here for)
Girl, shake that dirty bass
Real girls get down on the floor

Deep low when I feel loco
Don’t trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rolo, rolo
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that

I’m going ham when the beat drop
Got beef, eat it like a pork chop
And the base pump pump like a beat box
I'm so hot, gonna fend them like a tea cup
He killer, bang got his chain
Big belly, chilling on the big
Well uh, your girl icky, give me licky licky
No smalls, all biggie biggie
Yum, she rap to the beat
Back, back it up, hit it beep beep
Come to LA, life on the beach
She give me brain screech
Glove, pop it
Dirty bass
Girls dropping
Young Money
Cash, ride it
Shake that ass, ass, ass

Deep low when I feel loco
Don’t trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rolo, rolo
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that
Dirty, I love that, dirty

I'll bang that woofer, if she's a looker
I'm cruising Hollywood at five
I don't want no hooker
I need a five for free for the free
Let's take it back to the motel
Now, I'm in too deep

Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (shoes at the door)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you’re here for)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you’re here for)
Girl, shake that dirty bass
Real girls get down on the floor
Shake it

The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake,
Make me shake, make me shake,
I love that

Deep low when I feel loco
Don’t trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rolo, rolo
Uh I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, uh, uh
I love that, I love that dirty bass, uh
I love that, I love that

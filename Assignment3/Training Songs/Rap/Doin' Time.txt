Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, and me and Louie run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder

Me and my girl got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like sh
On lock down like a penitentiary
She spreads her loving' all over and when she gets home
There's none left for me

Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, and me and Louie run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder

Oh take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will someday rise
What am I gonna be doing' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them now we've come off the shelf

Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, and me and Louie run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder

Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
Oh

Me and my girl
We got a relationship
Me and my girl
We got a relationship
My girl
We got a relationship, oh
And my girl
Take a tip
Take a tip
Take a tip from me

Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, la la, Louie want everybody
Run to the rhythm it gets harder

Summertime and the livin's easy

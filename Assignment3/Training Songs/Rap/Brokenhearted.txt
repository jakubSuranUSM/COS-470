Lonely, brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely
Brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right, oh
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love 'good-bye'

But I guess I'm lonely, brokenhearted
Life's not over, I can start again (life's not over)
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted (oh yeah)
It's a hurting thing to get over (life's not over)

No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure
So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry
But I guess I'm-

Lonely, brokenhearted (lonely, brokenhearted yeah-yeah)
Life's not over (life's not over)
I can start again (I can start)
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted (lonely, brokenhearted, yeah)
It's a hurting thing to get over

And I'm lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over, I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted (lonely, broken)
It's a hurting thing to get over (thing to get over)

So I listen to all advice
And remember each time I cried

Lonely, brokenhearted
Lonely, brokenhearted
Life's not over, I can start again (I think about you all the time)
But I'm lonely, brokenhearted (never thought I'd be alone again)
It's a hurting thing to get over (oh, you know you're always on my mind)
(I think about you all the time, can you help me sing it?)

Never thought I'd be alone again
That's why I asked you to be my best friend
Boy, you know you're always on my mind (life's not over)
Think about you all the time, I'm lonely

Brokenhearted (whoa)
It's a hurting thing to get over (it's a hurting thing, yeah)
Lonely, brokenhearted
Life's not over (my life is not over)
We can start again

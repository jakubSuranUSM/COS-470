I want to welcome y'all to absolutely hell heating
And it's truly chocka  make it to my new meeting
So take you time grab a table we got booth seating
Now allow me introduce me to my new people
You see my name is lyrics born baby and I truly mean that
From the past from the future from the new and recent
You don't believe you can read page one in you leaflet
L-why-are-see is funk philly born baby
Top of the esch-e-lon of MCing
And I think on the topic we all in agreement
I'm never running from a challenge never been sheepish
In the rap all the fame we gotta get me in
You gotta see me do my thang son I'm too fiendish
Flinging tune after tune till the wound deepens
I have a rumour human thing, it's feeling wousy like a fiend
Lead me move you to the music and the fever screaming baby

Calling out t'all area crew
we gonna make this shit happen 
right here right now x4

My life's a combination of my past achievements
With a lotta heavy lifting, lotta deep breathing
A lotta courage, lotta doubts a lotta mixed feelings
A lotta love a lotta luggage for a lotta reasons
I ain't forgot about the pain and all the mistreatments
I ain't forgot the little box they try to wiggle me in
I ain't forgot about the flower deep underneath the crowded streets
Sprouting  inbetween the cracks see me shout baby
Follow like a lock in, in the Colliseum
And you can positive I think I'm in the mausoleum
You think I'll ever hang it up hoh body stop dreaming
You think I'll ever stop oh baby now you're reaching
I won't stop till I feel my lungs stop breathing
I won't stop till I feel my heart stop beating
I won't stop speaking this week and next week
And all folks, Steep singing, hot dogs 
Stop seeing, five freezing, ice heating  
Fire palms, reading all fat fall  
Freak clear from the mountain tops screaming Baby  

Calling out t'all area crew
we gonna make this shit happen 
right here right now x4

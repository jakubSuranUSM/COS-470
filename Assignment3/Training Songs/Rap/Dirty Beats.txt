Chorus Coming down new sound
Should be thankful
Dirty riffs Dirty beats Dirty samples
Sell out show take the money
Then we cancel
Frontrows-backrows getting trampled Chorus

What, before we just left the scene alone
Got some front page headline and rap&mic zone
Are you mad? I forget what trauble understanding
What it takes to fly the globe but keep the crowds damending
More of the time of the beats you felt
Kind the smooth as you associate the cream that melt
All over tracks the states and patents are created
Like a amblem on the girl that says it's highly rated
You figured out how much energy when we lash it out
How much goes into a state when we move and bash it out
I'm no out Its not coincidence why I'm hear
Its not the lucky team who had the lucky run of cup year

Chorus

You can't buy a snatched car that jumping this hard
And bust the kind moves that cut the bone and leave you scared
It's stolen behind the picture, taken behind the faces
Take a look around see who leeds and who chases
Advancing I don't care how you feel just keep dancing
You heard me I jumped on extra tide and I flaw superbly
'cause it's coming open up the gates keep it running
Never been the once to caught your star sluming
That's an easy way rather sail the storm then a gentle tide
I find it's more exciting and besides I think it's justified
That we should blow, sky dive in the logo and let the peopleknow
40 000 feat is to climb and check out the way she go
We'are gonna wait until we got it to you realize it's a masterpiece
Treated like a prisoner whoz got no chance of a quick relase
Or realize his precious and discover the truth
And let signals be the marker point to reach for the roof
Chorus:
I don't where to stop when I see low |
I can't hold back attack, respond with draw(war) | 3x
I don't where to stop when I see low
Can you see that you see the door

What you think you could just step it of the street
If you don't get the bringing you don't get the link
That's why some people talk when they really need to think
Clearly like neeb ears don't come yearly
Our camp is truly one of a kind we meant sincerely
For real we know that you should know by now
You see it's started already you should tell by now
Exact the satisfied friends around the track
We've already started planning way to set the kind of rap
It's been ready for years but see it's all about timing
You can't expect to reach the top with out a little climbing
It make sense you can't hold back with gay fence
You look tense I move on with careful accent
And stand tall don't want to reach one but reach all
Gotta feeling that you heard already 'cause we heard call

[Chorus x2 (corect me if I'm wrong)]

Uh wait a minute now
Can you hear me out there
Lunatics, is y'all ready
Let me hear ya

I'ma sucker for cornrows and manicured toes (hey)
Fendi capri pants and Parasucos (alright)
Passadity city with one or two throws
I'm dropping outta high school
Straight into the pro's, who knows I know
That I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows
And break it down low to the flow, there you go
Now throw it on me slow
And every time I bust a rhyme, baby give me some more
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind
And I'll be right back yea that's my very next line
I use it time after time, when I'm speaking my mind
It's no matter if I'm shooting game to a pigeon and dime
I ask you who that is, talking that shit about the 'tics
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But nobody else dropping shit like dis, should we apologize
F*ck 'em just leave 'em pissed hey

We can go to the break of dawn, nigga
Money long, nigga
Go fast up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
Some say I'm wrong f*ck it I'm grown, nigga
If you ain't bout money then best be gone, nigga
I'm flashy (uh) double takes when you walk past me
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go ahead and ask me
I drive fasty, call me Jeff Gordon
In a black SS wit a navigation
See the black blazion, something smells amazing
I gotta chick rolling up half black and Asian
Another one paging telling me to come over
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the v-12 powers, weight loss powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in trump towers just to hit for 3 hours
Get the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours

Andele andale moma E.I. E.I. uh oh

They got a smash mouth of a whole ounce, of that sticky
Watch my hands under a gold spout, feeling icky
Let go off in a hoes mouth, I ain't picky
Start fronting when the shows out
What ya mean, 20 inches when they roll out
Come and get me, big faces when they fold out
Is ya wit me? Don't make me pull that 44 out
I keep it close when I the go out
Then I slide up in an esclade
Me and E getting solid like the ice capades
From heat, frosty, roger the rabbit than bugsy
You understand me, wrapped crisp like mummys

If you compare me to your local grocery
Then you'll see I got more carrots than aisle d
More bread than aisle e, you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al be	, you can meet tha 'tics in Maui (hey)

Andele andale moma E.I. E.I. uh oh

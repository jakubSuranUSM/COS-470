[R Kelly]
Wooh, Come on
Its the Piper
Marques..

[Chorus:]
You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playin' the cuts

I'm dancin' with a nice honey
And her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shakin' it up, shakin' it up

Mami don't break it
Takin' it down, taking it down
I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me

Doing what you're doing
Up in the VIP
Doing what you're doing
Girl I'm about to buy you anything you want

Get you in the coup
And take your pretty ass home
Last call for alcohol
You know how we do, yeah

[Joe Budden] 
You know we be up in the club like..

[Chorus:]

[Joe Budden] 
You know we be up in the club like..

I pull up on dubbs
Hop up out the whip
Then i'm into the club
Honies on each side

And i'm on my cellular
Talking to this chick
Got a taste for thugs
Sometimes pimpin is tough

White tees so phat
Jacob on my wrist
Super star, world wide
It is what it is

Threw a party at my crib
Lasted after
'Til 6 in the morning
Drinks and laughter

Uh oh, uh oh
Yeah its a fire
Mamas getting naughty
Got a sexy body like

Uh oh, uh oh
Being erotic, bout to wild this place out
You know how we do it up in the club

[Joe Budden] 
You know we be up in the club like..

You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up (Oh yeah)
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs (All of my thugs)
Honies show me love
DJ playin' the cuts (Ladies show me love)

Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up (Yeah, yeah)
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playin' the cuts

[Joe Budden]
Mami, you won't holla
I can spot you out the corner of your eye that tell you want to ride,
You lookin' at papi like uhhh
want to hold hands

No amp, no man, Joe can
But you and your friend can both get rammed like uhh
You's a private dancer
Low riders, when she walk pulling her pants up

Its all good baby
You know where I'm at right
In case you need be me come put it on your back side
Only if you act right

Damn it you doing it
Doing what you're doing
You're doing it to me
I picture you doing it to me like uhh

I only came out because I'm here to find ya
After the bars last call
Be at the nearest dinner
We be next town taggin'

SL waggon
You grabbin' the whip
Just off of that XL magnum
Damn it you're doing it

You and your friend
Next weekend if you're lucky we can do it again
Like uhh

[Chorus: x2]

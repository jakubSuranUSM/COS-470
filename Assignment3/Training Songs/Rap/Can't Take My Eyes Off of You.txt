You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, oh baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say it's okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, oh baby
Let me love you, oh baby

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I love you baby
You warm the lonely nights
I need you baby
Trust in me when I say it's okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, oh baby
Let me love you, oh baby

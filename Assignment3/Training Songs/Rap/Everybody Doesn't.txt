Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying

Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Just stop

I think you've got
A one track mind
You're so focused on the destination

That you're missing the ride
You tell me
You're a patient guy
But we're not having conversations
'Cause you're preoccupied

If I loved you, I would
If you loved me I wouldn't have to
If I were in your shoes
Never expect you to get down

Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off

Ooh, you're good
You try real hard
So just fill out your application
I'll let you know next year
You don't believe
When I say no
If you don't give me consideration
Then you'll have to go

If I loved you, I would
If you loved me I wouldn't have to
If I were in your shoes
Never expect you to get down

Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off

Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off

Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off

Everybody does it

Just stop

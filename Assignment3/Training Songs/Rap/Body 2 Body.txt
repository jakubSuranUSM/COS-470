Baby you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

Uh, picture your body soaking, bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers
Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels
Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feel
Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty
I was thinking you can ride me, miss Kentucky derby
Why dream about it, let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage
Gotta moan it, damn it, feels good
Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood
Damn right, so unreal
This year of the Ace, bet you she know the deal

Baby you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

Uh, so quit ya contemplating, skip this conversation
By the way you biting on your lip just gave me confirmation
Was that Chanel Five? Very sexy fragrance
Are those your real eyes? Can tell you're partially Asian
But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated
And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest
Body to body, wet as Dasani
Bet if I hit the spot, I'll make you tsunami
Change up the sheets, no time to sleep
Asked her what she thinking, she reply that I'm a beast
Yeah she replied that I'm a beast
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets

Baby you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

We'll make love on the floor, you kissing my tattoos
I'm pulling your hair you scream my name
Call me daddy, baby I got you
Girl get in your bed and lay down, down, down
Girl, are you ready, 'cause I'm gonna want you face down, down, down
Right now, you fuckin' with a real freak!

Baby you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

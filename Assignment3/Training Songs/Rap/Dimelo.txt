Oh, you got my heart beating r치pido
You got the boom like your name J-Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

We were two stepping on the dance floor
And now ya still telling me you want more
Podemos bailar 'till ya feet sore
Tengo a few moves that are top drawer (aye)
I grab your hand, we start to step (aye)
We salsa dance and move correct (aye)
She got me in deep like a scuba (woo)
I'm telling she hotter than Cuba

The way you move, the way you groove
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to Whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

Oh, you got my heart beating r치pido
You got the boom like your name J-Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Pulled up, turning up and it was you that I saw
Mamacita, nice to meet ya, started dancing some more
Back to the table, couple drinks we're just gonna pour
Then I whispered in her ear, "I've never seen you before"
Your body like an hourglass and now an hour pass (hey)
And now it's getting dark, how about we just leave this bar
We can reach the stars, pleasin' you, boo, that's my task
So me and you can go cruising see some blues up in my car

The way you move, the way you groove
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to Whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

Oh, you got my heart beating r치pido
You got the boom like your name J-Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Oh, it's a party
Oh, it's survival
Oh, it's a party
Oh, it's survival, oh

You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

The way you move, the way you groove
Makes me wanna get close to you
I had to Whatsapp my amigos
She moving like she from Puerto Rico

Oh, you got my heart beating r치pido
You got the boom like your name J-Lo
You got them hips like Shakira
Smile like Camila
Got me feeling Latino

Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
Dimelo, dimelo, dimelo
You got them hips like Shakira

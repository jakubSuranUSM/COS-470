Excuse me
I got an announcement to make
Yo, if you ain't
Never been to Hempstead

Then welcome
Where chickens
Cluck, cluck day and night
G&B

I see some chickens
Goin' crazy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two
Fix 'em up on my plate

Cluck cluck
Bodies knockin' all up in my crib
Anybody want to know
The party's till six

Somebody's knockin'
Knockin', knockin' at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She say, my man is

Comin' home from a bid
She said after tonight
She gotta be with the kids
The kids, the kids
The kids, the kids, kids

I don't want to
Bring you complications
I just want one
Night of satisfaction

After tomorrow we can act
Like nothing happened
Take this invitation
With the matching card
To the train station

She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck

I see some chickens
Goin' crazy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two
Fix 'em up on my plate

Cluck cluck,
Bodies knockin' all up in my crib
Anybody want to know
The party's till six

Somebody's knockin'
Knockin', knockin' at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She say, my man is

Comin' home from a bid
She said after tonight
She gotta be with the kids
The kids, the kids
The kids, the kids, kids

I don't want to force you to stay
If you don't want to stay
I just want to thank you girl
For makin' my day

But just in case you
Change your mind
I got a king size bed
With a bottle of wine

Paid for the Remy 'cause
I knew that she was comin'
And I didn't want to waste my time

She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck

Yo it's the innovator
In twenty years
I'll be amongst the greats
Came in grimy

Now all my clones are tellin' me
So all the cluckers want to know
If I'm a front 'em
That's when I flip out

Turn into the werewolf in London
why'all can't get no money even
If why'all gave me money
You dig?

It's the Iceberg Slim philosophy
Wyclef, G&B up in ya area
So many chickens fightin'
It look like riots in Attica

I see some chickens
Goin' crazy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two
Fix 'em up on my plate

Cluck cluck,
Bodies knockin' all up in my crib
Anybody want to know
The party's till six

Somebody's knockin'
Knockin', knockin' at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She say, my man is

Comin' home from a bid
She said after tonight
She gotta be with the kids [Repeat: x 2]

The kids, the kids
The kids, the kids, kids

Yo, I told you
Official jump off
L-I
Yo, Clef records, yeah
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder
Come on, a come on

She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck
She said I do, I do, I do, I what?
She said I do, I do, I do cluck cluck

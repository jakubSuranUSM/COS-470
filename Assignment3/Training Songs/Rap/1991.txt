Oh, là là là, flirting with a cool french dude named Antoine
Wanna taste the pastry chocolate croissant

Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number C, headed to the stars
Baby I ride with my mic and my bra
Baby I recite in the raw the appetite for life and the hunger for the more
The island of Manhattan, I was born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream it never sleep to the hundreds
Coco with the cream and abundance

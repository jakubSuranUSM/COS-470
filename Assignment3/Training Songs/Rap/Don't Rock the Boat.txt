Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

You and I together, boy, we made a perfect pair
Till we got those inner feelings and played those games of truth and dare
No, I’m not one to regret but I know I did you wrong
And it’s so hard to forget how you loved me all night long

I tried to understand my feelings why I ever played on you
In these days of danger, I really should be true
It ain't worth those silly chances to be a fool whenever I date
From right now to forever let’s remember this simple phrase

Don’t rock that boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don't fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
D-don’t do it, don’t do it
Don’t do, d-don’t, don’t

Foolishly I play the field to satisfy myself
But the true satisfaction comes from you and no one else
Ooh, you don’t have to worry ‘cause I feel the same way too
And I’ll never touch another, baby, I’m savin' my love for you

We were lucky, we found out in time
Now that we know the truth, sugar, things will work out fine
We will stay together and we’ll never drift apart
I knew just what to do to keep you in my heart

Don’t rock that boat

Let me tell you a story ‘bout a girl and a guy
The guy was too fresh, the girl was too fly
They've been together for a very long time
When they felt the sense of change in the state of their mind

They had a true love, but they just didn't know
How to talk to one another, so the feelings could show
To each other they wouldn't devote
Had to throw in that rope, had to rock that boat

The girl wanted love that was gigantic
But love was drfitin' like The Titanic
Not just knee deep, it was total knee deep
When the fly girl had to stop for keys

Who were rockin’ those freaks ahoy
She said to herself, “What’s wrong with that boy?”
To each other we should devote
Please love each other, stop rockin’ that boat

Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it ain't broke, don’t fix it
Just relax and let it flow

Don’t rock the boat
Don’t rock that boat, baby
If it don’t fit, don’t force it
Just chill out and let it flow

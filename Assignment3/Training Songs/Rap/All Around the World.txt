MB!
All around the w-w-world!
Beautiful girl, girl, girl, uh girl

Come through the gate in this place lookin' for one,
Where is that one girl?
'Cause everywhere that I go it's like I see you around.
Am I chasing you or are you chasing me?
I've looked everywhere don't know where you could be

But if you come with me now we'll make our way through the crowd!
And when they see us we'll be shutting it down! I'm goin'

All around the world!
Put your hands in the sky!
Wave em' side to side
I'm lookin' for ya!
All around the world!
Girl wherever your heart is!
I gotta find it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Wherever your heart is, I gotta find it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm lookin' for you all around r-r-round the world!

I don't know why you so shy, when your swag is so fly!
Pretty brown eyed, girl
There ain't a star in the whole galaxy that can light up the night like you
Do it for me!
So if you wanna rock on, then baby stand up!
Until the sun hits the ground, we on the dance floor!

But if you come with me now we'll make our way through the crowd!
And when they see us we'll be shutting it down! I'm goin'!

All around the world!
Put your hands in the sky!
Wave em' side to side
I'm lookin' for ya!
All around the world!
Girl wherever your heart is!
I gotta find it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Wherever your heart is, I gotta find it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm lookin' for you all around r-round the world!

B-B-Baby come closer!
D-don't make me wait much longer!
Don't you wanna be. Right here next to me, yeah
I wanna feel your heartbeat tonight!
So if you wanna rock on, then baby stand up!
Until the sun hits the ground, we on the dance floor!

But if you come with me now we'll make our way through the crowd!
And when they see us we'll be shutting it down! I'm goin'

All around the world!
Put your hands in the sky!
Wave em' side to side
I'm lookin' for you
all around the world!
Girl wherever your heart is!
I gotta find it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

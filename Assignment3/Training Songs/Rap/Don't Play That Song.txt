Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
No no no no no no no

Don't play that song for me
It brings back memories
The days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no! Don't let it play
It fills my heart with pain!
Please stop it right away!
I remember just what it said
It said (darling I love you) you Know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) you know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) you know that you lied, you lied, you lied lied lied lied

Remember on our first date?
You kissed me and you walked away
You were only seventeen
I never thought you'd act so mean
But baby you told me you loved me
You told me you cared
You said "I'll go with you darlin' almost anywhere"
But baby you know that

(Darling I love you) you Know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) you know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) you know that you lied, you lied, you lied lied lied lied

Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Stop it baby! No no no no no no no

Don't play it no more! Baby Please! Don't play it baby!
Don't play it no more! No no no no no no, stop it baby!

(Darling I love you) you Know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) you know that you lied!
(Darling I love you) yes baby you lied

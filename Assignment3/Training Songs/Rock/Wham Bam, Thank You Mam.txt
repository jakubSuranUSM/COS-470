Well she was a lady of charm
A prisoner of songs unsung
She was just a face that took
All her groovin' on his guitar
Hot cars, strange clothes, any ways your mind goes

Wham team, thank you mam
We'll boogie till the rooster crows
Oh yeah
We lived this way for so long
You said babe, never got it on
Oh no no no

Surprise surprise, I thought you ought to know
He chucked her out the door
Without a cent (cent, cent)
Papa said grab your share but don't give a bad smell

Wham team god damn the devil planks
And wants some more yeah yeah
Sha la la la Shang a dorang shang a lang lang
Shang a lang mama, Sing it mama
Say it yes yes

Close your breath and hold your eyes
Turn the corner, a surprise, and there you are
Well, Id like to know why those old freaks
While walkin' through their moves
He seeks to keep you in your stick hole
And bash away your soul...surprise
See'mon

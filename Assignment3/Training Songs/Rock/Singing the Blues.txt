Well I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night
Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you you got me singing the blues
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do but cry-I-I-I-I over you
Well I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues 
[ Harmonica ]

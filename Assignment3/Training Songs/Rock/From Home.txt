I need your loving, I can't wait long
I get this feeling, it comes on strong
I try to see you, you're always gone
From home, girl, from home, girl

You're always out in fancy clothes
Down in clubs, the late night shows
Where you get your money no one knows
From home, girl, from home, girl

You run a big expensive car
You come and go like a movie star
And with your money you could stray far
From home, girl, from home, girl

I need your loving, I can't wait long
I get this feeling, it comes on strong
I try to see you, you're always gone
From home, girl, from home, girl

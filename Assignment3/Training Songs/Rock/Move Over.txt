Move over and over, over again
Eight thirty I'm early, early again
I get up,
But I can't stand to raise my head,
So move over and over again
Move over and over again
Move over and over, over again

This feeling when I'm sober, sober again
I get up, but the pain rushes to my head
So move over, I've gone back to bed
Move over and over again

Last night in my eyes,
You were so good to me
I knowyou get hurt by my simplicity
The last thing I recall,
I've got no memory
So move over and over
Move over and over, over again
This feeling, when sober, sober again
You don't know what you are doing man
So move over and over again
Move over and over again

Last night in my eyes you've been so good to me
I know you get hurt by my simplicity
The last thing I recall,
I've got no memory
So move over and over

Once I built a castle in the air,
A home for you and I-
In a blue, blue sky.
We'd leave behind the weight of worldly care,
I thought we could fly
We only had to try.

Ah, I had to learn fast, (For your own good)
I had to learn fast
And when I knew at last (You understood)
I knew at last

Hell and heaven can be one and the same,
If you don't know how
You should know by now,
Every pleasure always holds an equal amount of pain
But it all works out,
I have no doubt.

Ah, we had to learn fast, (For our own good)
We had to barn fast.
And when we knew at last (When we understood)
We knew at last

Every kite has got to have a string for it to fly
Up to who knows where ?
Castles in the air.
So there are strings attached to you and I
Though they hold us tight
We can take flight.

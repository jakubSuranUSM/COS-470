I can see the light coming
I can see the light coming
Over the hill, over the hill

Mmm mmmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmmm mmmm

Hard Believer
Hard Believer
Won’t you believe
won’t you believe me now

Mmm mmmmm mmmm
Mmmm mmmmm mmmm

We were made for each other
won’t you believe me now
We were made for each other
won’t you believe me now

I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence
Golden like the new sun

Hard Believer
Hard Believer
Won’t you believe me now

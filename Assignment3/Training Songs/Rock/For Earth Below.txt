It is the face that is the mirror
It is the eye to look within
And the door remains open
A passing dream, calls you in
Calls you in

It is the mind that knows no distance
And how far, no-one can say
While the hand, is helplessly waiting
With his breath, a life begins
A life begins

Oh don't they see
Its just like sleeping
Please don't wonder how they know
While you dream, a child is weeping
And each tears a soul, for earth below
For earth below
For earth below
For earth below
For earth below
For earth below

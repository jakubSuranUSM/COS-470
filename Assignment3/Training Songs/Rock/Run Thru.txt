Oh shit, run! 
Oh shit, run! 
Oh shit, run through the ghetto
They will hear you
Mornin bell tolls at home
Rings loud 
Back where I come from
Calls me back
Often times 
I would hope and pray
Then faith came my way
Oh shit, run! 
Oh...
It's what appears to me 
It's what appears to me
Oh shit, run! 
Oh...
It's what appears to me 
It's what appears to me
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

I disappeared last night
While sleeping in my bed
A field of lavender beneath my head
Another planet, I'll try to map it
No user interface
It won't escape me again

And if I sleep tonight
The cosmic radiation
I won't complain
Maybe I can find the right frequency and station
I might just stay

Don't wake up
I'll be here for centuries
Sweet magnetic energy
Nothing quite like this ever has existed
But God knows how I missed it
Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading

I'll float on endlessly
Senses alluding me
This long horizon to this open sea
Not that I'm giving living not a chance
Giving luck a chance
I'll find something someday

And if I sleep tonight
The cosmic radiation
I won't complain
Maybe I can find the right frequency and station
I might just stay

Don't wake up
I'll be here for centuries
Sweet magnetic energy
Nothing quite like this ever has existed
But God knows how I missed it
Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading

Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing it's hold (Ho, oh, oh, old)
I can feel it fading

Gravity is losing control (Tro, oh, oh, ol)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing control (Tro, oh, oh, ol)
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading

Back door bitches begging me to behold
All their cash and cars platinum silver’n gold
We're like ‘diamonds in the sky’ that is what we are told
No mountain made of money can buy you a soul

Oh I can see it
Oh I can see it
Oh I can see it
Coming down
Oh I can see it
Oh I can see it
Oh I can see it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world
What do you get
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
A fucked up world
What do you get from it
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette

Banging little boys bugging me on the bus
Say they want to know who did it but the answer's really us see
I don't know you why do you want to know me
You ain't gettin what you want unless you're getting it for free

Oh I can feel it
Oh I can feel it
Oh I can feel it
Coming down
Oh I can feel it
Oh I can feel it
Oh I can feel it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world
What do you get
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
It’s a fucked up world
What do you get from it
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette

Back to these backdoor bitches begging me to behave
Jamming Jesus down my throat, no I don't want to be saved
Ain’t a chain on my brain, I'm nobody's slave
I got one foot in the cradle and one in the grave

It's a fucked up world
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
It’s a fucked up world
What do you get from it
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette
Sex and love and guns like a cigarette

It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world

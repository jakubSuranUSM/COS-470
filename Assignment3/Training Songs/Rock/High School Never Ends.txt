Four years, you think for sure
That's all you've have to endure
All the total dicks, all the stuck-up chicks
So superficial, so immature

And then when you graduate
You take a look around and you say, "Hey, wait!"
This is the same as where I just came from
I thought it was over, oh, that's just great

The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who's the best dressed and who's having sex
Who's got the money, who gets the honeys
Who's kinda cute and who's just a mess

And you still don't have the right look
And you don't have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names and the trends
High school never ends

Check out the popular kids
You'll never guess what Jessica did
And how did Mary-Kate lose all that weight?
And Katie had a baby, so I guess Tom's straight

And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesn't matter if you're sixty or thirty-five

Reese Witherspoon, she's the prom queen
Bill Gates, captain of the chess team
Jack Black, a clown, Brad Pitt, the quarterback
Seen it all before, I want my money back!

The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who's the best dressed and who's having sex
Who's in the club and who's on the drugs
Who's throwing up before they digest

And you still don't have the right look
And you don't have the right friends
And you still listen to the same shit you did back then
High school never ends
High school never ends

The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who's the best dressed and who's having sex
Who's got the money, who gets the honeys
Who's kinda cute and who's just a mess

And I still don't have the right look
And I still have the same three friends
And I'm pretty much the same as I was back then
High school never ends
High school never ends
High school never ends
And here we go again

Shammy cleaning all the windows
Singing songs about Edith Piaf's soul
And I hear blue strains of no regredior
Across the street from Cathedral Notre Dame

Meanwhile back in San Francisco
We're trying hard to make this whole thing blend
As we sit upon this jagged
Storey block, with you my friend

And it's a long way to Buffalo
It's a long way to Belfast city too
And I'm hoping the choice won't blow the hoist
'Cause this town, they bit off more than they can chew.

As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

All the orange boxes are scattered
Against the safeway's supermarket in the rain
And everybody feels so determined
Not to feel anyone else's pain

No one's making no commitments
To anybody but themselves
Talkin' behind closed doorways
Tryin' to get outside, get outside of empty shells

And for every cross cuttin' country corner, country corner
For every Hank Williams railroad train that cried
And all the chains, badges, flags and emblems
And every strain on brain and every eye

As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

And the restaurant tables are completely covered
The record company has paid out for the wine
You got everything in the world you ever wanted
Right about now your face should wear a smile

That's the way it all should happen
When you're in, when you're in the state you're in
You've got your pen and notebook ready
I think it's about time, time for us to begin

And meanwhile we're over in a 52nd Street apartment
Socializing with the wino few
Just to be hip and get wet with the jet set
But they're flying too high to see my point of view

As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

See them freedom marching
Out on the street, freedom marching
Saint Dominic's Preview
Out in the street
Look at the man
Turn around
Come back, come back
Turn around
Look at the man
Says hold on

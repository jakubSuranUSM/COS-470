All right!
Whoo!

A pretty face and a dirty love
Knew right away that I had to get my hooks in you
Yeah, yeah
I'm running low on memories
If you wanna make a buck, boy, you gotta be a tease, uh-huh
I say yeah, yeah

I need it all, baby, that's no lie
I need a lover with an alibi
I wanna fall into a love so sweet
Honey baby, baby, I'm hard
Hard to beat

A pound of flesh and a touch of bone
Smells in the air but I'm feeling so alone, uh-huh
I say yeah, yeah
Hallucination, true romance
I needed love but I only got a chance, uh-huh
And that ain't all

I tell ya honey, it's a crying shame
All the pretty girls they look the same
I wanna fall into a love so sweet
Honey, baby, baby I'm hard
Hard to beat

Whoo!

Honey, honey, I can tell

Hell!

A pretty face and a dirty love
Knew right away that I had to get my hooks in you
I say yeah, yeah
I'm running low on my memories
If you wanna make a buck, boy, you gotta be a tease, uh-huh
And that ain't all

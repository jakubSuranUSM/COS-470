She was holding somebody?s hand, 
I forget who it was I am. 
Giving up the crusades for a while,
I can't crawl another mile. 
The rags are torn, 
The sheets are tattered, 
Rat-a-tat and all the tribes scattered. 
She'll be hanging out in hotel rooms, 
I'll be tucked away in underground tombs. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades, 
When I realized no one could be saved. 
Dusty gashes we were seeing, 
This giant airfield came into being. 
The harnessed power and force of a million;
Faithful followers who sold their children.
Some return with souvenirs, 
Stick a heart in your boutonni√®re. 
Some return with tales of glory, 
All the fucking stories bore me. 
Now I'm finally giving up crusades,
When I realized no one can be saved. 
Say I know when I just don't know.
Say I love you, I don't just know. 
I was a pretender to the throne, 
I knew my cover?d be blown. 
Never could be that dogmatic, 
Whose to blame if I just heard static? 
Never known the truth of a zealot,
Whose to blame if I just can't spell it? 
Never known true righteousness 
Just the safety and vague red lust. 
I know I'll be back again someday.

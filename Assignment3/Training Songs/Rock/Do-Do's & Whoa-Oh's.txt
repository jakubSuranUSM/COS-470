This is a toast to all the people listening.
I hope it gets stuck in your head
So tap your feet and click click click you fingers
Lets make the rest of the world care

I want a song that gets attention
This is the way it goes
So hip you'll play it on your station
(Do-do's and whoa-oh's)

So hit the lights and turn the record up now
I hope you hear this in your sleep
Spin off the typical "I'll miss you baby"
Who would've thought we were so deep.

I want a song that gets attention
This is the way it goes
So hip you'll play it on your station
(Do-do's and whoa-oh's)
We'll grab a drink and kill our braincells
Then sing out the words we know
We're bringing back the lovers music
(Do-do's and whoa-oh's)

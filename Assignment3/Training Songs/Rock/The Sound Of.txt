No I will not lay down
I will not live my life like a ghost in this town
I am not lonely swear to God I'm just alone

I'm back on my feet
I can just close my eyes and forget everything
My house is empty every memory blown away

Oh the sound of the wind through my bones
Makes me laugh
At all the bodies I kissed and never knew
Oh the sound of a lover's sympathy
Falling down to the floor
Just barely out of reach from me

No I will not go back
Every word that's been hiding inside of my head
Is running blindly look behind me nothing's left

I can sit in a room
I can hear myself breathing and be quite amused
Life is simple like the wrinkles on my skin

Oh the sound of the wind through my heart
Makes me glad
For all the ones that never knew my name
Oh the sound of a lover's sympathy
I had to go
Could not stay here
They were always out of reach from me

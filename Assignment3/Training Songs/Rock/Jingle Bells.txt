Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a '57 Chevrolet
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
(He's dashing)
In a one horse open sleigh
(He's dashing)
O'er them fields we go
(He's dashing)
Laughing all the way
(Now he's laughing)
Bells on bob tails ring
Making them spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, 
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a '57 Chevrolet
Jingle bells, 
Jingle, jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er them fields we go
Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing, 
Bells on bob tails ring
Making them spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, 
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a '57 Chevrolet
Jingle bells, 
Jingle, jingle, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

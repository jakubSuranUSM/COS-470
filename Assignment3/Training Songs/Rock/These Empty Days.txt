There are things that I forgot to say
As you rushed out of the door
And they're all coming back
To haunt me like before

There are things I wish I would have said
Before I lost you from my life
As my thoughts are coming back
They cut me like a knife

I can't deal with it
I can't bear to feel this way
I can't deal with it
I can 't fill these empty days

I can't deal with it
I can't bear to feel this way
I can't deal with it
I can't fill these empty days

Oh, I wish I could have told you
The words to make you stay
'Cause it will take a million years
To fill these empty days

These empty days
These empty days
These empty days

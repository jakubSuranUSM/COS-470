Ground is shaking
Waves are breaking
The wind has lost control

The air is shifting while
It's lifting force fools gravity

A huge eruption
Vast explosions
As it bursts the earth

Water's pounding
Waves are sounding
Deadly and extreme

"But we are equally destructive"

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And it's endless stream

Alarming silence predicts
The violence that is yet to come

We are senseless
Proud while blindness
Is catching up with us

We must measure while
The pressure of nature's force expands

We feel minor, punished and meager
Betrayed by all our gods

"We are a part of it
We are equally destructive"

Equally destructive as we are
Don't you think we've also gone too far?
We are just a part of this machine
And its endless stream

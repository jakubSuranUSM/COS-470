Cheap is small and not to steep
But best of all, cheap is cheap.
Circumstance has forced my hand
To be a cut-priced person
In a low-budget land.
Times are hard, but we'll all survive.
I just gotta learn to economize.

I'm on a low budget!
I'm on a low budget!
I'm not cheap, you'll understand;
I'm just a cut-price person in low-budget land.

Excuse my shoes they don't quite fit,
They're a special offer and they hurt me a bit.
Even my trousers are giving me pain
They were reduced in a sale, so I shouldn't complain.

They squeeze me so tight so I can't take no more!
They're a size twenty eight, but I take thirty four!
I'm on a low budget! 
What did you say?
Yeah, I'm on a low budget! 
I thought you said that.

I'm on a low budget!
I'm a cut-price person in a low-budget land.
I'm shopping at Woolworth and low-discount stores 
I'm dropping my standards so that I can buy more.
Low budget sure keeps me on my toes.
I count every penny and I watch where it goes.

We're all on our uppers we're all goin' skin.
I used to suck cigars, but now, I suck Polo mints.
I'm on a low budget! 
What did you say?
Yeah, I'm on a low budget! 
I thought you said that.

I'm on a low budget!
I'm a cut-price person in low-budget land
I'm on a low budget!
Low budget!
Low budget!
Art takes time
Time is money.
Money's scarce, 
And that ain't funny!

Millionaires are things of the past.
We're in low-budgetville, 
Where nothing can last.
Money's rare there's none to be found,
So don't think that I'm tight if I don't buy a round.
I'm on a low budget! 
What did you say?
Yes, I'm on a low budget! 
I thought you said that.

I'm on a low budget!
I'm a cut-price person in low-budget land
I'm on a low budget! 
Say it again.
Low budget. One more time.
Low budget.

You said your arms are empty
And your eyes full of tears
Haven't had no lovin'
For so many years
Don't blame it on me
I'm not guilty can't you see
Don't blame it on me
I'm the same as I used to be
I try to tell ya baby
Such a long time ago
I would be your lover
If you just tell me so
Don't blame it on me
I'm not guilty can't you see
Don't blame it on me
I'm the same as I used to be
Every day is Sunday
When it come to lovin' you
I'll always love you
No matter what you do
Don't blame it on me
I'm not guilty can't you see
Don't blame it on me
I'm the same as I used to be

Every day is Sunday
When it come to lovin' you
I'll always love you
No matter what you do
Don't blame it on me
I'm not guilty can't you see
Don't blame it on me
I'm the same as I used to be
You said your arms are empty
And your eyes full of tears
You haven't had no lovin'
For so many years
Don't blame it on me
I'm not guilty can't you see
Don't blame it on me
I'm the same as I used to be

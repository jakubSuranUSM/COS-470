When you wake in the morning
?? blue
See the sun replace the moon
It isn't hard to do
When the light shines
Everything you are
And the light shines
It's there for you my love
Doo-dah-doo...
When you wake in the morning
Leave the shadows where they lie
Make the changes right away
Tomorrow is today
When the light shines
Everything you are
And the light shines
It's there for you my love
Doo-dah-doo...

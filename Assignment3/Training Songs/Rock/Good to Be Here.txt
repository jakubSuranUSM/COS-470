You're waiting for the night to come
Your eyes start shining as the sun begins to fall
The feeling something's going on
An unseen gravity starts pulling you along

Someone's by your side you came alone it's fine
Every one in here is with you

[Chorus]
Can you feel it take a look around?
Can't you hear it?
Sure is good to be here
There's no reason
We can't get off the ground
So come on, throw your hands up
Sure is good to be here with you

You feet are lifting off the ground
Floating weightless as you're held up by the crowd
Reactions speeds up then slows down
You feel like screaming but you can not hear a sound
Senses come alive take you on a ride
Delivers you to something that has been gone way to long

Someone's by your side you came alone it's fine
Every one in here is with you

[Chorus)

Your digging in your heats to feel alive
You want no way out
A burning rush of blood that makes you fight
Your living in tonight oh yes it feels so right

You're waiting for the night to come
Your eyes start shining as the sun begins to fall
Someone's by your side
Everyone in here is with you

{Chorus]

Why can't you feel it?
Why don't you look around?
Why can't you hear it?
It sure is good to be here
There ain't no reason why we can't get off the ground
So come on throw your hands up
Sure is good to be here with you

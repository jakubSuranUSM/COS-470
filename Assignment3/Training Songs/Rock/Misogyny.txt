He veers, she fears 
He's coming home to box her ears
Upside down
Welfare takes care of all the women in his lair
Upside down

And if you ask the cruelest soul, soul
You can't expect him to be home, be home
You'll always ask for one more try, try
You'll always give him one more
Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

She scrubs, he comes
She holds it in herself for months
Upside down
He's bored, she scored
The blade has got a life that's torn
Upside down

And if you ask the cruelest soul, soul
You can't expect him to be home, be home
You'll always ask for one more try, try
You'll always give him one more
Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

His bad luck, man it sucks
She's been impressed, who gives a f*ck
Upside down
She tired, growing tired
He's gonna rip her up inside
Upside down

And if you ask the cruelest soul, soul
You can't expect him to be home, be home
You'll always ask for one more try, try
You'll always give him one more
Heee-yeah! Heee-yeah!

Heee-yeah!
Upside down

And if you ask the cruelest soul, soul
You can't expect him to be home, be home
He'll always ask for one more try, try
He'll always give you one more try, try
You'll always give him one more
Heee-yeah!
Heee-yeah!
Heee-yeah!
Heee-yeah!

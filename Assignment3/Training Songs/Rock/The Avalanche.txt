I call you cabin neighbors
I call you once my friends
But I trust when you labor
And put my head to rest

But I was on the hatch
I was on the avalanche
And I had found my match
I was on the floor

I took a train from Virginia
To Illinois, my home
He said â??I knew you had it in you
A mind to make its ownâ??

But I was on the hatch
Riding on the avalanche
I tried to take it back
I was on the floor

Come on stone
Come on star
Come on snow
Come on car
Come on hands
Come on feet
Come on face
Come on street
Come on state
Come on song
Move it fast
Move it along

Come on life
Come on Lord
Make it right
Make it yours

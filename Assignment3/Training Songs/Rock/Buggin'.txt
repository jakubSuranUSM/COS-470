All those bugs
Buzzin' round
Well they fly in the air
And you comb your hair
And the summer time will make you itch the
Mosquito bites

The buzz of love
Is busy buggin' you
Well they fly in the air
As you comb your hair
And they're splattered up and down your windshield
The headlights

Well, they bite
Yeah they bite
But you can't see them there

But they bite
Yeah, they bite
But you can't tell they're there

Does love buzz?
Because that's what it does
Well, they fly in the air
As you comb your hair
And the summertime will make you itch the
Mosquito bites
 
And they fly in the air
As you comb your hair
And they splattered up and down your windshield
The headlights

Fly in the air
Comb your hair
Fly in the air
Comb your hair

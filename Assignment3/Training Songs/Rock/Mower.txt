Nothing gets in my way today
No one has the power of steel beneath them
I'll leave the world ??
And left to rot beneath the bay

It was a robin's egg and it was blue
It was a robin's egg and it was blue
It was crushed to bits and you saw it, too
And you say about these things
We say about these things
We have no idea what we're saying
Don't you stay in one place to long
They will crawl inside your shoes
They will eat you from the inside
They will make you play to lose

Cut it short, we take the easy way every time
We have no idea what we're saying

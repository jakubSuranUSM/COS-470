It's just another summer
You hear a different drummer
You're lookin' for a way to check out from this line
You wrestle with temptation
Your job is your frustration
Cause there's a lifetime chance you've got to find

Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make it happen in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' like you're trapped
You wonder should you just stop tryin'

Take the message from the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song

Inside your heart is achin'
There's challenge for the takin'
So shoot it from the hip
Believe in what you say
You're callin' this your best fight
You're lookin' for the limelight
Reachin' for a star
To guide you on your way

Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make a difference in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' like you're lost
You wonder should you just stop tryin'

Well give the glory to the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song

They give the glory to the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song

Ow!
Look out
Say hey, hey
Say hey, hey, hey
Honey, honey, honey, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Ow!
All right

And now my girl will steer you round
Something drive you blind
I move to master my machine, baby, will not stand in line
A sick boy, sick boy goin' 'round, barely losin' grip
Baby, wanna take you out with me, come along on my death trip
My death trip, honey, my death trip
A-honey, honey, honey, my death trip
Baby, my death trip
Ow!
All right

Now tell me do you care for me
Once I care for you
A-honey, come and be my enemy so I can love you true
A sick boy, sick boy fadin' out, I love it to be cruel
Baby, whip me in the heat, turn me loose on you
Loose on you
Honey, loose on you
A-honey, loose on you
Honey, loose on you!
Ow!

Turn me, turn me, loose on you
Turn me, turn me, loose on you
Turn me, turn me, loose on you
Turn me, right on, turn me, loose
Yeah!
Ooh!

Said I'm with you, you're with me
A-honey we're going down in history
Said I'm with you, you're with me
A-honey we're going down in history
We're going down
We're going down
We're going down
Going down
Going down
Going down

Blow my cool, bite my lip
See me through on my death trip
Free this slave, hear me sing
You can save me and everything
You're gonna save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
You're gonna save me, all right
You're gonna save me
You're gonna save me, save me, save me now
Save me, save me, save me now
Save me, save me, save me now
Save me, save me, save me now
Hey, now

I say I'll stick you
You'll stick me
I say I'll stick you down
You'll stick me
I say I'll rip you
You'll rip me
Come on

You'll rip me
Come on, rip
Kiss the rip
Ow!

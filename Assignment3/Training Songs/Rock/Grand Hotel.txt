Tonight we sleep on silken sheets 
We drink fine wine and eat rare meats 
On Carousel and gambling stake
Our fortunes speed, and dissipate
It's candlelight and chandelier 
It's silver plate and crystal clear
The nights we stay at Hotel Grand 

Tonight we dine at Hotel Ritz
(A golden dish with every wish )
It's mirrored walls, and velvet drapes
Dry champagne, and bursting grapes
Dover sole, and Oeufs Mornay
Profiteroles and Peach Flambe
The waiters dance on fingertips 
The nights we dine at Hotel Ritz 

One more toast to greet the morn 
The wine and dine have danced till dawn 
Where's my Continental Bride? 
We'll Continental slip and slide 
Early morning pinch and bite - 
(These French girls always like to fight) 
It's serenade and Sarabande
The nights we stay at Hotel Grand 
Les nuits qu'on passe Ã  l'Hotel Grande

So the light now is my weapon
Like a bush dried, withered in the sun
With this spark I'll go up in flames
I lay my guns down but they're too small to see
It's kinda cute how I resent to be
Everything but the instrument I am

Rage or happiness? 
So let it enfold you

A perfect life is what I am after
My first name won't be my last one
Let the light just drip into your eyes

So it's true my words are contrived
I tell lies just to get into your mind
I'm as fake as a widow's smile
This mask of glass is what I choose to wear 
So I won't ever have the need to bear
To tell the truth to anyone but me

Rage or happiness? 
So let it enfold you

A better life is what I am after
My first name won't be my last one
Let the light just drip into your eyes
And I am dead, your eyes are light

I'm just a bad actor stuck with a shitty script
All of my lines are cheap and the cast is weak
There was no music for the first time I got kissed
There was no femme fatale my mistress wasn't rich
So I've been formatted to fit your tv screen
The film went straight to tape 
I'll bow out quietly
So quietly, so quietly

Please do this now I beg
Duct tape my arms and legs
Throw me into the sea
(Please save me, please save me)
Please do this now I beg
Duct tape my arms and legs
Throw me into the sea
(Please save me, please save me)
Now watch the waves eat me 
Setting my cold heart free
I'll wash ashore in weeks
(You can't save me, can't save)
Now watch the waves eat me 
Setting my cold heart free
I'll wash ashore in weeks
(Can't save me)
You can't save me now

They wanna know what makes me tick
I'm feeling like a son of a bitch
They say I'm an emotional wreck
They think they're gonna put me in check

Ah yeah, ooo, ah yeah

Yesterday I heard heaven was getting full, yeah
And that's why I have felt so emotional, yeah

I'm' walking with a broken leg
I think she's gonna beg me to stay
If you cold only fake my death
She blew my brains and then she left(she left)

Ah yeah, oo, ah yeah, no

She said,
Yesterday I heard heaven was getting full, yeah
And that's why I have felt so emotional, yeah
Yesterday I heard heaven was getting full, yeah
I hope they do not leave me at the door, yeah

You've got that weekend coming all of the time
You've got that weekend coming all of the time
You've got that weekend
You've got that weekend
You've got that weekend coming all of the time
You've got that weekend coming all of the time

[Chorus: x 2]

Ooo, yeah

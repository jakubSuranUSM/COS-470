In the morning
Don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door

I know your name is Rita
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar

You won't need to much persuading
I don't mean to sound degrading
But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about

Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear your a mean old Jezebel
Let's go up stairs and read my tarot cards, c'mon

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh yeah

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh rock on

So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yea I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up, c'mon honey

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get down

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight your going stay with me
Hey, what's your name again
Oh no, get down, whoo, hey, oh no, woo, get yourself home, slow down babe

Fire of separation - Fire of sacrifice - Fire of purifying heat - Burned on rocky altars - Through the ancient nights - Now that fire's burning deep in me - My heart is the altar - I am the priest - My life's the only sacrifice - The sacred fire needs
Chorus:
Sacred fire - Burn Your mark on me - With Your flame brand the Name - For everyone to see - Sacred fire - Burn your mark on me - I am honored to be set apart - So burn your ownership into my heart

Fire of refining - Fire of discipline - Burn away all my impurities - fire of consecration - Carefully define - The image of the Holy One in me - I know that I am privileged - To bear the sacred light - So I will lay down everything - To keep the flame alive
(Chorus)
Sacred fire - Burn Your mark on me - With Your flame brand the Name - For everyone to see - Sacred fire

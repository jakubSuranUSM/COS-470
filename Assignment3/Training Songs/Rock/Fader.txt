It's in my heart
It's in your soul
You choose to judge
Is that your role?

Don't analyze or complicate
You'll criticize
You can't relate
And now you want 
Some understanding

What's my point of view?

Then I'll just fade away
When I hear all your lies 
I choke
Then I'll just fade away
Suffering from the times you spoke 
I fade

Regarding more?
Just seems much less
So cynical you must confess
I'm dying here
Completely blind
Your will to live 
Just dampens mine
And now you want 
Some understanding
What's my point of view?

Then I'll just fade away
When I hear all your lies 
I choke
Then I'll just fade away
Suffering from the times you spoke 
I fade

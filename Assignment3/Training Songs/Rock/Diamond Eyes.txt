To the edge
Till we all get off
I will take you away with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm

Calculate
Our embrace
Hold on (Come with me now)
Right away
Outer space with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will see us realign
Diamonds reign across the sky
I will lead us to the same realm

When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come right away with me
Come on you'll see
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will lead us to the same realm
I will lead us to the same realm

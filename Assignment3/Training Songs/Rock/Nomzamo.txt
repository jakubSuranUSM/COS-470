Look beyond the colour
Past the covering on us to see what we are
Turn the faded pages
The mark we leave on history is what we are
Every country is part of us
Irrespective of the one where we grew up
Yes you are my sister
Though we never shared a home that's what you are
And your eyes keep shining in the darkness
Defying all the chains that's what you are
Home for the homeless, hope for the hopeless
Between the lines on your face I can read...
Nomzamo, Nomzamo...
They of the silk white breast seemingly proud
They are so much more less on the day of the vow
Here's a woman who is tired and weary 
Leading resistance and still laying wreathes
How can we stand by and watch this happen?
Is this the justice we preach
It seems too much to ask for an equal, peaceful living
In a land of screams, stinging tears and broken smiles
Following through all extremes
'One who will suffer many trials'
Is this a land to inherit?
Crumbs on the table the segregated people starve
With gleeful oppression the mindless procession
Cast nonchalance out of their cars
Somewhere, sometime we pay for the crimes we incessantly do
If we believe that we are what we leave
I left a hope--what did you?
Reeling from punches which leave them winded
Reeling from laws which should be rescinded now
Nomzamo, Nomzamo...

(Bop-bop-bop singing by bass voice)

Mr. Bass Man, you've got that certain somethin'
Mr. Bass Man, you set that music thumpin'
To you it's easy when you go 1-2-3, d-d-be	-bop-a-bop
(Bass voice: You mean be	-be	-BOP-p-p-bop bop bop...)
Yeah!

Mr. Bass Man, you're on all the songs
be	-did-did-a-boom-boom, be	-dit-dit-a-boom-boom-bom
Hey Mr. Bass Man, you're the hidden King of Rock 'n' Roll, d-d-be	-bop-a-bop
(Bass voice: No no, be	-be	-BOP-p-p-bop bop bop...)

It don't mean a thing when the lead is singin'
Or when he goes "Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yah"
Hey Mr. Bass Man, I'm askin' just one thing:
Will you teach me?  Yeah, will you sing?
'Cause Mr. Bass Man, I want to be a bass man too, d-d-be	-bop-a-bop
(Bass voice: Try this, be	-be	-BOP-p-p-bop bop bop...)
Hey Mr. Bass Man, I think I'm really with it
be	-did-did-a-boom-boom, a-boom-boom-be	-dit-dit-dit-dit
c'mon, Mr. Bass Man, now I'm a bass man too, d-d-be	-bop-a-bop
(Bass voice: That's it, be	-be	-BOP-p-p-bop bop bop...)

(Scat bass duet between Johnny & bass voice)

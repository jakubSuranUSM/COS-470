When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

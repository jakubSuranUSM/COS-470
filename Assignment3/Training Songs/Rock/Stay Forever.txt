Silence in the living room
Hours feel like days
Silence when I speak to you
Your thoughts seem miles away
Crying for real 
Yes your worth the prize
Because when my mind gets clouded
I forget about our fights
 
Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end
Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end

I'll affiche your energy
Running through my veins
Chemical the love I feel
For faces without name
Crying for real 
Yes your worth the prize
Because when my mind gets clouded
I forget about our fights

Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end
Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end

This empty house is not a home
Find the will to stand alone
Without your armour
Flesh and blood have turn to stone
Find the will to stand alone
To late to turn away

Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end
Stay forever, it's never again
Our words have been spoken, 
It will come to an end

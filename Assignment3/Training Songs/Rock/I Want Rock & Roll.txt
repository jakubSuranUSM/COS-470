I want to go back to fifty-five
Ten before I was burned alive
There ain't no use in a stupid dream
My head is tired from this enthymeme
I want to hear the holy ramage
I don't mind a little ear damage
Henry Sloane in my soca soul
I'm not ashamed to say I want rock & roll
 I'd like to hear some Cubby Checker
Crush my heart with Desmond Dekker
Little itty bitty of Freddy Fender
Start me up return to sender

I want rock & roll
I want rock & roll
I want rock & roll
I want rock & roll
I want rock & roll
I want rock & roll

I want to go back to fify-five
Ten before I was burned alive
The world can be so very cold
Nothing to say except I want rock & roll
If you're going to San Francisco
Just remember it all is disco

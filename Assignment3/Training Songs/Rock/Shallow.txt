I don't remember
Did something in my past, create a hole.
Don't use your gender.
To drive a stake right through my soul.

I live to function,
On my own is all I know.
No friends to mention,
No destruction, nowhere to go

Shallow, shallow,
Give it to me, give into me
Scissors cutting out your anger
Shallow, shallow,
No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue ignore the splinter

This city drains me,
Maybe it's the smell of gasoline.
The millions pain me,
It's easier to talk to my PC.

I live to function,
On my own is all I know.
No friends to mention,
No destruction, nowhere to go

Shallow, shallow,
Give into me, give into me
Seasons caught in a triangle,
Shallow, shallow,
No good to me, not if you bleed,
Bite your tongue end on a splinter

Shallow, shallow,
Give into me, give into me
Seasons caught in a triangle
Shallow, shallow,
No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue end on a splinter

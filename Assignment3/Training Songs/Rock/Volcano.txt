Now I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

Let me say now I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

Ground she's movin' under me 
Tidal waves out on the sea 
Sulfur smoke up in the sky 
Pretty soon we learn to fly 

Let me hear ya now I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

Now my girl quickly say to me 
Mon you better watch your feet 
Lava come down soft and hot 
You better lava me now or lava me not 

Let me say now I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

No time to count what I'm worth 
'Cause I just left the planet earth 
Where I go I hope there's rum 
Not to worry soon come 

Now I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

One more now I don't know (ah he don't know) 
I don't know (he don't know, mon) 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

But I don't want to land in New York City 
Don't want to land in Mexico (no no no) 
Don't want to land on no Three Mile Island 
Don't want to see my skin aglow (no no no) 

Don't want to land in Commanche Sky Park 
Or in Nashville, Tennessee (no no no) 
Don't want to land in no San Juan airport 
Or the Yukon Territory (no no no) 

Don't want to land no San Diego 
Don't want to land in no Buzzards Bay (no no no) 
Don't want to land on no Ayatollah 
I got nothing more to say 

I don't know 
I don't know 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow 

Just a one more, I don't know (he don't know) 
I don't know (I don't know, man) 
I don't know where I'm a gonna go 
When the volcano blow

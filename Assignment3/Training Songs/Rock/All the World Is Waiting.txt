I run down the street, with all the wandering things
Everyone can see, the world is coming free
The monumental minds will dangle on a wire
The great enormous wall, eventually will fall

And all the world is waiting
To lay beneath the water
To use up from the ruins
And climb up from the bottom

I thought I heard you say, “The end is on the way”
I thought I heard you sing a million lovely things
I thought I heard you cry, a howling through the night
An everlasting scream, to echo through your dreams

And all the world is waiting
To lay beneath the water
To rise up from the ruins
And climb up from the bottom

It was always growing there, a dim light in my eyes
Coming on to lead me through the night
All at once then slowly every sound you’ve ever known
Is hummed by all the world in a drone

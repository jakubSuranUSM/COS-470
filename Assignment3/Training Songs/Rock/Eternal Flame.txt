Yes 
I wanna have it 
Yes yes 
I wanna have you now 
But I can't be the lighter 
I can't be the lighter 

I wanna go there 
Yes yes 
I wanna show you how 
But I can't be the lighter 
I can't be the lighter 

Just in case you never knew 
I can't be the lighter 
Of your eternal flame 

Oh! oceans, rivers, lakes 
That we could swim as two 
But I already own my 
Own body of water 

You'll follow me and 
Yes, yes 
I'll follow you, 
It's true 
But I'm already certain 
I've got good directions 

Just in case you never knew 
I won't be becoming 
I am the beginning 
And I'm already 
Done 

These yes days, 
They've come and gone 
Not always going to make 
The same mistakes 

It's too simple, I saw the truth 
And truth is the terror of the one 
Who feels their lace can be stained 
But I cannot stain your white lace, baby 
Even you cannot stain your white lace baby 

No 
I'll never go there 
No no 
I'll never take that route 
'cause I won't be the fighter 
I won' t be the fighter 

Don't ever push me 
No, no, don't ever make me shoot 
'cause I won't be the fighter 
I won't be the fighter 

Just in case you never knew 
I won't be the fighter 
For your eternal flame 

Just in case you never knew 
I won't be becoming 
I am the beginning 
And I'm already 
Done 

Just in case you never knew 
I can't be the lighter 
Of your eternal flame

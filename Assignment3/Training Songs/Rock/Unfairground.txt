It catches fire at midnight
It leaves the room for doubt
But every thing's so well defined
There's only one way out

And all the girls are on tonight
The colored wheels all spin
You're more aware than ever before
You need a prize to win

And all the funfair's will have one
That is the usual theme
No secret Jack in this box
To help the pain within

Quiet country roads and trees
Birds singing from a cage
You understand you just lost one
You step outside your rage

And what's left to believe in
The children in the lake?
I didn't see them go under
Let's try another take

Pass me the bottle, baby
One day you'll understand
We almost make the same mistakes
And hold each other's hands

Take this particular shade of gray
Just for a change I shout
There's nothing in this fairground
That couldn't be left out

There isn't much left to show you
Maybe the tunnel of love
Who knows we'll be there forever
Just like the stars above

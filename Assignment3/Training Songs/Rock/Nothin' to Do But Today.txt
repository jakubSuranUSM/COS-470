Been on the road too long
Most of these changes should be past
And gone
Clarify my position

Must be some kind of fool
I'm a musician
I got nothin' to do but today
Already on my way

Goodbye. I can't stop to say
Just quietly slip away
And lose myself it's the only way
I got nothin' to do but today

You think I'm not myself
You're confusing me with somebody else
I'm not so easily deceived

I am a blues man, I know when to leave
I got nothin' to do but today

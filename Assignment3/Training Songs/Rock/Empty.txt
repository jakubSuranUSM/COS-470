If I play the game 
And I win the fame
Will I be the man 
I dreamed of And if 
I woo the crowd 
And their screams are loud 
Is it really me that they love
What does it profit
What does it profit me
If I gain the whole world 
And lose my own soul 
What would be said of me
Oh my vanity, vanities 
Chasin' the wind 
I'm feelin' empty again, yeah
I'm feelin' empty again 
If I gain the whole world 
And lose my own soul 
What would be said of me
Or my vanity vanities 
Chasin' the wind 
And I'm feelin' empty again
If I gain the whole world 
And lose my own soul, ooh
What would be said
Tell me what would be said 
Or my vanity, vanities 
Chasin' the wind 
I'm feelin' empty again, yeah 
I'm feelin' empty again, yeah yeah 
Jesus come fill me again

The waterfalls trinkling 
Like bells to my ear 
The earth rolls out before me through smiles and tears. 
 
A country lost, a soul discovered
The ruin that I once was will soon recover. 
 
[Chorus]
And I know a howlin' wind runs through here Blowin' every day.
Yeah a howlin' wind runs through here Takes my breath away. 
 
Swing time is here children, for large and small 
Let's dance before the fever is upon us all.
Yeah it's a strange religion, without any god. 
The preacher walks with innocence spares the rod. 
 
[Chorus]

Hey ey hey ey
 
Swing time is here children for large and small 
Let's rock before the fever is upon us all. 
 
[Chorus]

How, I'm gonna howl, I'm gonna howl, I'm gonna howl 
I'm gonna howl, I'm gonna howl howl howl howl

There she is again
Steppin' out of her limousine, well
Looking like the cover of a twenty-dollar magazine
She's got it made and branded
If you know what I mean

She's a...natural born woman
Natural born woman
She's a...she's a natural born woman

There she is again watch her stop the Main Street in its tracks
Looking like Creole queen
Hair hangin' down her back
I say, don't look too long, boy
She'll make your glasses crack

She's a...natural born woman
Natural born woman
She's a...she's a natural born woman

Get your track
Yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, yeah...
Natural born woman
Yeah, yeah...
She's a natural born woman

Well, I'm sweatin' and I'm shakin'
When I'm bringin' you the news
You can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
That's why I'm standin' here today
Preachin' natural born woman blues

Well, she's a...natural born woman
Well, yeah...
Natural born woman
Well, yeah...
Natural born woman

Well, I'm looking out my back door
Wonderin' which place to go
Think I'll move on down to Memphis
Pay my money to see a rock 'n' roll show
Find me a sweet-heart Susie
Together we can lose control

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a...natural born woman
Yeah, yeah...
Natural born woman
Yeah...
Natural born woman
Yeah, ooh...
Ooh...
All right...

The night, she brushed her hand upon my flushed cheek
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Clouds soothe and shredded by the calico
Were, oh, so vast and quick as I was on my own now

And this time like every other time I believe that I never find
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
And I'm all alone again tonight, not again, not again, not again
Not again, not again, not again

And don't it feel alright and don't it feel so nice, lovely, lovely, lovely
Say it, say it again, aah, lovely, say it again

Well I'm unable to inhale all that the riches
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
As I'm all by myself tonight, not again, not again

And don't it feel alright and don't it feel so nice, lovely, lovely, lovely, say

If you should nervously break down
When it's time for the shakedown, would you take it?
It's when you cry just a little, but you laugh in the middle that you've made it
And don't it feel alright and don't it feel so nice, love, love, love, lovely

Say it, say it, say it again, love, love, love, love, so lovely, lovely
To do it again it's so lovely to do it again, again, oh loving again
It's coming again, it's coming again, lovely

Say it, say it, say it again, aah, so beautiful, so nice
It's coming again, lovely

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
You can dunk me in the river, gonna clean my sin
But you might as well dunk me in a bucket of gin
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
I got drunk on whiskey, drunk on wine
The Lord don't like it but the devil don't mind
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Well, I've been to church and I declare
They ain't got nothin' I could learn in there
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Well, I ain't been saved, honey, what for?
If I went to heaven I would only be bored
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do

Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do
Gonna get drunk, get my gamblin' on
Gonna get real dirty, gonna get real gone
Ain't nobody gonna love you like the devil do

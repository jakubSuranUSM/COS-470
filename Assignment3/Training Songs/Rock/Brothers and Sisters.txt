Are you still out there? Are you still out there?
Because enough is enough, I'm finished with love
But I have the guts to say I still care
Can you hear me? Can you hear me
I'm over the rush, I'm divided and lost
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up

I'm talking to my brothers and sisters
I miss the conversations between us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now

Please don't drift off and leave me here
In a sea of weird don't be fake mate
'Cause you'll lose that love
You'll forget the point and the power of words

Are you still out there? Are you still with me friend?
Because enough is enough, I won't take the brunt
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up

I'm talking to my brothers and sisters
I miss the conversations between us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now? Where are you now

I'm talking to the liars and cheaters
The ones who hide the truth to deceive us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now?
Where are you now?

Are you still out there?
Are you still out there?

I'm talking to my brothers and sisters
I miss the conversations between us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now? Where are you now?

My brothers and sisters
I miss the conversations between us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now? Where are you now?
I'm talking to the liars and cheaters
The ones who hide the truth to deceive us
There's nothing wrong with being a dreamer
So where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?

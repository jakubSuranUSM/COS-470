Went downtown to a local bar
Getting drunk and smoking tar
People there really put you down
Ooh babe you been dancing round

It don't matter what you do
I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what they say
You can have me anyway

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

really cowboy it's no joke
All my dreams go up in smoke
have a drink and I'm gettin sad
I should never have opened up my mouth

It don't matter what you do
I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what they say
You can have me anyway

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

You say you'd call me up
When you get out of school
But you know thats a lie
You're so cruel so cruel

Oh no baby
Oh no baby no no no
Oh no baby

So let me in, it works out the same
Got no job and you got no game
I played my cards and I played them fast
You don't say it would never last

It don't matter what you do
I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what they say
You can have me anyway

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you

still in love
still in love
still in love

With absence of your lessons 
The passion of your crimes 
Engulfed in heated fires 
Wet from the sweat of your nights endeavors 

Does it make any sense to come here tonight 
Oh they're trying to confuse you 
'Cause nothing works quite right 
Surrounded by a secret 

Growing old with your lies 
You can't compete with it 
Where the phantoms reside 
Can't run away with it 

Those phantoms are your lies 
Haunted by voices from deep in your minds 
Locked in memories too painful to recall 
I want to know the truth 

Surrounded by a secret 
Growing old with your lies 
You can't compete with it 
Where the phantoms reside 

Can't run away with it 
Those phantoms are your lies 
With absence of your lessons 
Growing old with your lies 

You can't compete with it 
Where the phantoms reside 
Can't run away with it 
Those phantoms are your lies 

Surrounded by a secret 
Growing old with your lies 
You can't compete with it 
Where the phantoms reside 

Can't run away with it 
Those phantoms are your lies

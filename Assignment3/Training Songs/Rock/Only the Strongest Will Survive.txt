Well my life is worth nothing to some
While to others I am number one 
And it can be so hard to know
When to try and when to get up and go.

Well this feelings reeling me in
I can feel it like it was my skin
In my head I repeated the rule
Pain is easy pressure is cruel.

I tell you only the strongest will survive.
These days you've got to kill yourself just to stay alive.

Well there's only one life that you know
It won't take you where you want to go
Yesterday was a walk in the park
But tomorrow is a step in the dark

And this feelings reeling me in
I could feel it like it was my skin
In my head I repeated the rule
Pain is easy, pressure in cruel.

I tell you only the strongest will survive
These days you've got to kill yourself just to stay alive.

Everybody's talking like they want to see the poor live again,
I'll be in the ally, get a taxi cause I'm staying in.

I'm strong enough to get you through,
Are you strong enough to help me to.

I will never do the same
I tried to stick around
To ease your troubled mind
Reached out for you in this town

It take some time to cool down
Some time to cool up...

Did you go down, did you go out of your way
I don't like this town, don't run away, yeah that's right
Too much for me, much for you, it's to dark here

I remember when we swore
We never separate
It was never a surprise
It was already made

Did you go down, did you go out of your way
I don't like this town, don't run away, yeah that's right (I tried)
Too much for me, much for you, it's too dark here

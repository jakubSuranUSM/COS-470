Life is a greenhouse gas
House of colise and masks
Pretending to be my friend
But nothing can box me in

'Cause I’m free, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah
I’m free yeah

I’ll be the first to dance
With every new circumstance
I smile out the scene I see
'Cause I decide what it means to me
'Cause I can

'Cause I’m free, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m close for your view
Was o picture of you
Before you knew
Circled in red, are the things you said
When you lost your head and god I debt
'Cause god is dead

But to whom it may concern
It’s no longer that person’s turn
It’s mine

'Cause I’m free, yeah
I’m free, yeah
I’m free, yeah
Whoa, I’m free, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I’m free, yeah
I’m free, yeah, yeah
But I’m free yeah, whoa
'Cause I’m free, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dear sirs, we regret to inform you
The norm to conform to
Does not means ... this time
But of course you can try
To reapply, for membership
And resubmit, your many sketch
When the man you scripted’s hands are lifted
To the sky
And the old you dies, sincerely
The editorial me, the editorial me, yeah.

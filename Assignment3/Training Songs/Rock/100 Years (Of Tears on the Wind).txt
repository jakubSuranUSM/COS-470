I found my place in bed
Three feet beneath your head
I wanted to stay home
And I couldn't think of nothing new
I moved like syrup (slow)
I moved I didn't know
I'd took off from my faith
And I couldn't think of nothing new
Boo hoo Boo hoo Boo hoo
Waiting Waiting
I'd been called down
Waiting Waiting
Would I rebound
Waiting Waiting
I found my place in bed
Three feet beneath your head
I wanted to stay home
And I couldn't think of nothing new 
Boo hoo Boo hoo Boo hoo

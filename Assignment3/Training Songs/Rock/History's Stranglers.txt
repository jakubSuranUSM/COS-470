Alright

I left with shaking hands, looking for danger
Details of modern love, in bed with strangers
And there is no warning, I'm not ignoring

I cut glass on my callused feet
Cause I walk through miles of make shift mud
Motherf*****s I want your blood

I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the flesh of a million strangers
Your never gonna see me closing in
Yeah, while you're sleeping

No need for safe return, is no need for your concern
There is no warning, I'm not ignoring
I follow you across the county lines
And these beads of sweat feel like a flood
You motherf***** I want your blood

I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the flesh of a million strangers
Your never going to see me closing in
Your never going to see me closing in
While you're sleeping

Breaking through your window, stabbing through your ribcage

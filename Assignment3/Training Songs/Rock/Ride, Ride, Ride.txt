I believed, this time it wouldn't be too long,
Guaranteed, but now I see that I was wrong,
Seems like our love is fading, I know the reason why,
We can't talk about it, I'm too far away to try,
And I see the train arrive - And I see the train arrive.

Every night, I laughed at all the bad advice,
They were right, and I'm the one who paid the price,
We gotta get together and conquer all the hate,
Time is runnin' out, it might even be too late,
And I see the train arrive - And I see the train arrive.

Ride, ride, ride, ride - Ride, ride, ride, ride.
So many roads to travel, So many trains to ride
So many trains to ride, Ain't no need for you to worry
Ain't no need for you to worry, Love is on my side
Don't break down, love is on our side

Ride, ride, ride, ride - Ride, ride, ride, ride.
And I see the train arrive

{Rod - Solo}
Here I am, a bunch of tickets in my hand,
Uncle Sam, Afraid I gotta leave your land,
I'm lookin' to the future, the past is dead and gone,
No peace for the wicked and time keeps me movin' on.
And I see the train arrive - And I see the train arrive.

Ride, ride, ride, ride - Ride, ride, ride, ride.
See the train arrive

And I see the train arrive -
And I see the train arrive -
And I see the train arrive - See the train arrive
And I see the train arrive - See the train arrive
I see the train arrive - See the train arrive
I see the train arrive - See the train arrive
I see the train - See the train arrive
I see the train - See the train arrive

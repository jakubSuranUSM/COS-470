Hey girl, on your toe
You were right so now let's go
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Drove out late that night
Can't go back, now don't feel bad
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Hey girl, it's a long way home
You were right and I was wrong
Sometimes life ain't fair
But did we care when we were there?

Hey girl, see my face
Hungry for the pie you made
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Where should we go from here
Far away or end this somewhere near?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Hey girl, it's a long way home
You were right and I was wrong
Sometimes life ain't fair
But did we care when we were there?

Did we care, when we were there
When we were there, when we were there

C'mon
C'mon

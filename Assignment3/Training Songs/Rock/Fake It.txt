Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-esteem along the way
Yeah

Good god your comin' up with reasons
Good god your dragging it out
Good god its the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped
So follow me down

And just fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong
Fake it if you feel like a infection
Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite

And you should know that the lies wont hide your falls
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way

And just fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong
Fake it if you feel like a infection

Woah your such a fuckin' hypocrite

Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-esteem along the way

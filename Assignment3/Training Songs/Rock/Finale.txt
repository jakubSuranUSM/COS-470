I always knew we would end up just like this
So pour me one last drink with a final kiss
Things always end up hit or miss
I'd love to tell you yeah lets reminisce

And all the words that we couldn't say
In the backyards where we used to stay
And so your parents are on there way home again
Im so sorry that it had to end

And we'll run back where we started from
We're never leavin' yeah we just begun
Supplies were endless but we just have none
You sleep your whole life and you called it fun

So wake up kid and realize you life
We're movin' closer to your demise
You getting out a familiar way
So world and stars and it's gonna stay

Your singin'
You are young and so am I
So take my hands and we can try
You are young and so am I
We'll do all we want and take it while we lie

And your hairs all gray and your shoes are worn
And the books you've read with the pages torn
You saw one person you never knew
It told you what to look forward to

And when you woke up in your sad demise
We're movin' closer to the end of your life

We're getting out of your way
We're movin' out at the end of day

We are the voices under the tracks
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 

Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back 
Drawing you forward, pushing you back

Rotten device, I'll say it twice
I'm too much, I'm too much comforted here
Costs too much too much, we'll leave you
Everywhere eyes, nowhere to die

No place to shove your sharpened heel
I'm looking looking for a tired face
In case you wanted to go
I know, I'm breathing in to the end

Calling the bluffs, talking so tough
Goodbye to the ugly steeple fear
Good times for ever after
I'm just a man 

You see who I am
I'm binding my hooks
And open the books
Dirty black hearts

Angel of Corpus Christi
You're so mystic, 
Tell me what I want to hear

I know I'm reeling in
I know I'm reeling in

To the end
To the end
To the end
To the end

I know I'll never know 
I know I'll never know

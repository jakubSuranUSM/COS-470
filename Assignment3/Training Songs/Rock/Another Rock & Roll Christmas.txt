Light the lights
Ring the chimes
Come on In, It's party time
Raise a glass for auld langs sigh
Come on, Rock it up for all mankind

It's good to see friends I know
Kissing under the mistletoe
I love to hear the children sing
It looks like Santa's gonna bring

Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas
Another Christmas Rock N Roll
Presents hanging from the tree
You'll never guess what you've got from me!

Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas
Another Christmas Rock 'N' Roll
We better hold each other tight
You never know it might snow tonight

Guys and Girls
Stay up late
So excited they can't wait

Let there be peace on Earth
Come on, Rock 'N' Roll for all your worth

We're gonna laugh (ha!)
We're gonna sing
We're gonna make the rafters ring

I'll pull my cracker
Let me be
The silver star upon your tree

Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas

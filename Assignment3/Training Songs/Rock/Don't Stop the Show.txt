From the Albums:
* No promises no debts
* 2nd Live
* The complete naked truth

You're in for a cold shower
The man's gonna cut the power
Don't stop the show
Come on baby you can fan the fire
Let the flame burn a little higher
Don't stop the show
Yeah well in case of emergency
I'm gonna send the kung-fu roadie
Don't stop the show
Time time who's got the time
Time time we've got the time
We got about an hour to get things right
Keep that rock 'n roll music goin'
Through the long long hot night
I'm ready willing and able
I'm gonna spit it all over your table
Don't stop the show

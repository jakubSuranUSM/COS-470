I tried, but I could not find a way
Looking back, all I did was look away
Next time, is the best time we all know
But if there is no next time, where to go?

she's the sweetest queen, I've ever seen
(C P L 5 9 3 H)

I could talk talk talk talk talk myself to death
But I believe, I would only waste my breath
Ooh, show me

(C P L 5 9 3 H)
(C P L 5 9 3 H)

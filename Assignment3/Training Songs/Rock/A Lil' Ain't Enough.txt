Empty pockets never stopped
Me from singing a blue streak, no
And I don't think the devil's
Ever gonna give me back
I don't think so!

'Cause stayin' 'round here takes patience
It's like a full time occupation
I've become a diplomaniac
Yes I did, baby
Hey mean old gal
You know the cross-town bus just rolled
Yeah I'm the same old number
But we still got time to go

Oh I say mama living ain't a luxury
Oh I say mama and a lil' ain't enough for me
No it ain't, no it ain't baby!
Yeah I'm believing that you needin' yo relaxation
But honey tell me can you tell that story twice?
I don't think so mama!

'Cause there's a function at the junction,
I think ya better get it all ready girl
See I was born without a silver spoon But I'm gonna make a stir
Yes I am!
Was vaccinated with a phonograph needle
One summer break; and then I kissed her
On her daddy's boat and shot across the lake
And was singin' it

Oh I say mama living ain't a luxury
Oh I say mama and a lil' ain't enough for me
No it ain't baby, no it ain't!
Mmmm, said a little ain't enough, baby!
Baby, please!! Little ain't enough, aw yeah, wow!
Was vaccinated with a phonograph needle
One summer break Same summer that I kissed her
On her daddy's boat and shot across the lake yeah!

Oh I say mama living ain't a luxury
Oh I say mama and a lil' ain't enough for me
Oh I say mama living ain't a luxury
Oh I say mama and a lil' ain't enough for me

Wasted?
Time and money and hope 
And fear of romance.
Sendin? out a letter
Sendin? out a sign that you
don't want to be here and be left behind
You made up your mind.
And when the wheels start spinning and the
Wind starts moving you around
You keep your eyes open boy,
Keep your ear to the ground?

Arrival?
Is nothing more than stoppin? for
A moment to catch your breath.
Before you get moving,
You better get your rest 
'Cause you're ognna need your strength
When you take on the world.
The world takes you on.
And when the wheels start spinning and the
Wind starts moving you around.
You keep your ears open boy,
Keep your ear to the ground?

You're leaving, leaving, leaving?
Do you believe in, Anything?

Do do do do do?

Hopeless?
Hopeless to do more and say less and feel 
More this time
I'm comin' home for Christmas
I'm comin' home 'cause I don't want to spend
Another New Year alone.
'Cause this one?s just flown?
And when the wheels starts spinning and the
Wind is blowing you around.
You keep your eyes open 
You keep your head down?

Do do do do do?

Hopeless
Nothing?s really hopeless.
It's just a little wasted time.
I'm sending out this letter.
I hope it gets to you, 
I'll see you soon.

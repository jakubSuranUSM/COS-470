Your in my air
Every breathe that I take I can't escape
Ohhh everywhere I go
I feel your stare like your there
Can't you see I'm scattered
Like memories from the past
Shattered like a bullet through glass

I'm in pieces
On what might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

You burnt your name
Into my heart where its scared
I can't erase you form me
You soul and mine intertwined
You cut the line
And I'm drifting
Holdin to the past
Memories like a bullet through glass

I'm in pieces
On what might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

Oh I can't get you out my head
Outta my head
Outta my life
Outta my dream
Broken emotion you left me in pieces

Scattered like memories from the past
Shattered like a bullet through glass

I'm in pieces
Ohhhh we might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

No I can't get you outta my head

Outta my head x 9

Look at them shuffling shuffling down
Rambling and scrambling heading to town
Hustling and bustling buzzing around
Happily waiting at the station

Look at the train the number seven-o-nine
Huffing and puffing arriving on time
Who do you think's about to arrive
The band they call the Dixieland Five

They're gonna play that Muskrat Ramble tune
The way you never ever heard it played
Get ready for the big parade
All together now one and two come on and join the happy throng
Feel the beat of that rambling scrambling muskrat song
Come on and ramble along

Look at them shuffling shuffling down
Well look at the band parading all over town
Look at the happiness going around
Everybody's up and celebrating

Look at the drummer entertaining the gang
Clinging and clanging with a bing and a bang
Changing the town from dead to alive
The band they call the Dixieland Five

You're gonna hear them play that Dixieland
You better get your reservation plan
In person on a one night stand
All together now come on folks come on a join that happy throng
Feel the beat of that shuffling scuffling muskrat song
Come on and ramble along

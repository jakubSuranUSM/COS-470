The smoke was slowly rising as the light began to fade
There were fires on the skyline from some distant border raid
There I was riding out at seventeen to join my first brigade
Many years ago 

And I chanced upon a farmhouse where the woman took me in
She gave me food and wine she gave me shelter from the wind
She delayed me from my regiment and service of my king
Many years ago 

She said, "Soldier before I lose you to the fight
Oh, my soldier, I'll make a man of you tonight"
She took me over in the fading fire glow
On that wild and misty night she was my woman 

When I rose next morning I was gone before she stood
Tore myself away from there and left without a word
The sound of distant infantry was the only sound I heard
On that morning 

And in that day I aged ten years and died a thousand deaths
I learned the feel of frozen steel and fear within my breast
But the lesson I'll remember till they lay me to my rest
Keeps returning 

She said, "Soldier before I lose you to the fight
Oh, my soldier, I'll make a man of you tonight"
She took me over in the fading fire glow
On that wild and misty night she was my woman 

And when the dice of war were thrown and victory was won
My drunken young compatriots went out to have their fun
And there was no single house they didn't burn or overrun on that evening 

And I rode out to that place again as hard as I could ride
But I found her by the cradle on that lonely mountainside
In the hands of those brave friends of mine she suffered and she died
Many years ago 

"Soldier before I lose you to the fight"
She said, "Soldier I'll make a man of you tonight"
She took me over in the fading fire glow
On that wild and misty night she was my woman

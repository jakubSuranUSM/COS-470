And I said I felt comfortable behind, well, I lied
Don't be sad, my check just bounced and so did I
And I'd like to be mine and far away in a way
And now I ask you to keep away
'Cause I have none to give so

Don't save me anymore
Don't save me anymore
Don't want to anymore
Don't save me anymore

Can you get me to work?
My clock is late and I'm not
Don't take any notice of this
It's this widow outside my window
Be apart of vicious kind of web in my head
Toss me something it took a while
'Til I found a way to loose so

Don't save me anymore
Don't save me anymore
Don't want to anymore
Don't save me anymore

Every street is choking
Looks like too much traffic on the road
No fun in driving
You wait in line forever just to go
Heavy roar of engines
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Everybody's rushing
Is it so important to be so
Where's it going to lead to
If all the rushing leads to moving slow
Heavy roar of engines
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Poison from your engine
Merges with the air we've got to breathe
Look at that congestion
Don't it make you want to pack and leave
Thoughts you've been having
Sitting in your prisons on the road

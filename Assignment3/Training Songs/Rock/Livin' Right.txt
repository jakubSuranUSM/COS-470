I'm outside, running in the morning sun 
No matter what it takes, you know I'm gonna get it done 
Pushing up the heel, fighting through the pain 
Everything to lose, everything to gain 
You know I'm on my way, I'm on my way to number one 

Feeling good, getting tight 
Cause I'm livin' right, livin' right 
Up in the morning, asleep at night 
I'm livin' right, livin' right 

I was livin' in the past, holding on to yesterday 
I knew it wouldn't last, I had to find a better way 
I had to face the truth, I had to face the facts 
I'm giving something up, I'm getting something back 
You know I'm getting close, a little closer everyday 

I look at the future, the future looks bright 
Cause I'm livin' right, livin' right 
Out of the darkness and into the light 
I'm livin' right, livin' right 

You're never gonna make it, staying on the road you're on 
And everything you're taking, isn't gonna last you long 
If you really want it, man you gotta want it bad, so bad 
Nothing feels better than reaching for the top 
Once you get started, you ain't never gonna want to stop 

I'm outside running in the morning sun 
No matter what it takes, you know I'm gonna get it done 
I finally took a chance, I never thought I would 
I'm through with feeling bad, I'm into feeling good 
You know I'm on my way, on my way to number one 

I look at the future, the future looks bright 
Cause I'm livin' right, livin' right 
Out of the darkness, and into the light 
I'm livin' right, livin' right

I stumbled up to walk straight
I hadn't had a thing to eat
And then I ate a block of chocolate
But then I couldn't sleep

Shoulders jacked back flat
But what can I ask?
Head down knees crack
Walking out

And bugs crawl over my couch
And I couldn't even shout out
'Cause they crawled
They crawled in my mouth
I tried in vain to find their home

And it's
Shoulders jacked back flat
But what can I ask
Head down knees crack
Walkin' out

I heed against stage then do it
I plead against state then do it

And it's
Shoulders jacked back flat
But what can I ask
Head down knees crack
Walkin' out

All the fallen angels
Roostin' in this place
Count back the weeks on worried fingers
Virgin mother what's'erface

[Chorus]
You don't need to sleep alone
You bring the house down
Choose your favorite shoes
And keep your blues on cruise control

All the gelded mongrel
Bear their teeth for you
Drag your feathers 'cross the dance floor
Throw your shapes electric blue

Don't fall to pieces on me

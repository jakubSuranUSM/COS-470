my waltzing days are over
thank you just the same
I wouldn't want to embarrass you
you are so kind
and I will remember this night
for years to come

I am no fool
I have no romantic notions in my head
at my age, I'm content to watch
so go on, go on

my waltzing days are over
thank you just the same
I wouldn't want to embarrass you
but you are so kind
and I will remember this night
for years to come

Oh Yeah

I heard about a person who had a broken heart
With nothing to drive him on, no hope no spark no flame
He couldn't see at all tears they were blinding him
He kept it all inside, the guilt and all the pain
You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
Why can't I stand up and try to tell him
They've got me backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
There's not gonna be no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
Oh there's no second prize

Oh no there ain't no second prize
Never never never never gonna be

Oh no there ain't no second prize

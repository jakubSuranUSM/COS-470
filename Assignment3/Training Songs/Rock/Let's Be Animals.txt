Paint on faces,
Hide in dark places,
We feel safe away from,
Anyone at all.

A secret obsession,
Holding obsession,
The very that keeps you,
Trapped inside my dreams.

So let's take of our clothes,
Run through the streets,
Scream at the moon,
And scuff up out feet,
Won't hear a word,
'Cause they probably say we're terrible,
Lets be animals.

Our mothers our fathers,
Were lovers before us,
We are just creatures,
Who were born to carry on.

Any maybe we're evil,
But mostly just people,
Afraid of living,
'Cause we might just think its fun.

So let's take of our clothes,
Run through the streets,
Scream at the moon,
And scuff up our feet.
Won't hear a word,
'Cause they probably say we're terrible,
So let's kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
And do what we please,
Won't hear a word,
'Cause they probably say we're terrible,
Lets be animals,
Lets be animals.

Kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
Do what we please.

Kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
Do what we please.

Kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
Lets be animals,
Lets be animals.

(kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
Do what we please)

Lets be animals.

(kiss in the dark,
Sleep in the trees,
Go where we like,
Do what we please)

Lets be animals.

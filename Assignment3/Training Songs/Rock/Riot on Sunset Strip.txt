I'm going down to the strip tonight
I'm not on a stay home trip tonight
Long hair seems to be the main attraction
But the heat is causin' all the action

Bright lights everywhere
Pretty girls with long blond hair
But somehow the people they don't care.
It just doesn't seem fair

To buggy cause you got long hair
Even the parents are beginning to scare
Because of the sirens

On the streets
That used to be neat
But now it's just a place for black and white cars to race
It's causing a riot
It's causing a riot!
Yeah

Bright lights everywhere

It's causing a riot
It's causing a riot!
Yeah! It's causing a riot
It's causing a riot!
Everywhere people running around
Riots everywhere
Pushing pushing pushing everywhere down pushing around

Boys, grab your guns
It's all in good fun
We're making 'em run
We're making 'em run

Your name is devastation
You filled us with frustration
You could have fooled anyone
We handed up the lucky ones

And so you stood us up
And you let us down
Now you're backing off
So we're running away
I think your brain got lost in the airwaves

Boys, grab your guns
It's all in good fun
We're making 'em run
Making 'em run
Why should I feel bad?
I'm the one
With the gun in my hands
In my hands

Why are you so scared
Of running from the takers?
Why were you so afraid
Of staying in the same place?

So you stood us up
And you let us down
Now you're backing off
You've got nothing to say
I think your brain got lost in the airwaves

Boys, grab your guns
It's all in good fun
We're making 'em run
Making 'em run
Why should I feel bad?
I'm the one
With the gun in my hands

I think it's time
We've said goodbye
Wastin' all of our time
Wastin' our time
Why should you feel bad?
You're the one
With nothing on the line

It's such a shame
How you were so afraid
Of losing it all, losing it all
It's such a shame
(It's such a shame)
How it all went down this way
Oh thank God
Tomorrow's a new day

Boys, grab your guns
It's all in good fun
We're making 'em run
Making 'em run
Why should I feel bad?
I'm the one with the gun in my hands

Boys, grab you guns
It's all in good fun
We're making 'em run
Making 'em run
Why should I feel bad?
I'm the one with the gun in my hands.
(In my hands)
I think it's time
We said goodbye
You're wasting all our time
Wasting our time
Why should you feel bad?
You're the one with nothing on the line

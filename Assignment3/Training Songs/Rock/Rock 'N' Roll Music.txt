Just let me hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that
Rock And Roll Music

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were blowin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and Roll music

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and Roll music

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo;
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music

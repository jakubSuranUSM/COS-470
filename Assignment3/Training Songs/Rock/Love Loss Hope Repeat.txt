Love Loss Hope Repeat
Carbon Leaf

Take a walk down town
And dream with me
We'll walk the parks and the empty streets
You know the seasons otta Be
Love Loss Hope Repeat

We're alone in a crowded room
Silhouetted in and ready to bloom
You know the seasons otta be
Love loss hope repeat
Love loss hope repeat

And when then high wind blows everything
Like the lion attacking spring
I love you more than I'll ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I'm workin on
I'm workin on

Take a walk downtown

Remember the days that would never end
So much time you couldn't comprehend
When the sun so slow to fade
And tomorrow was more of the same

And the easiest April Rain
Was enough to ignite the flame
And you fade out with a grin
With the company you were in

And when the high wind blows everything
Like a lion attacking the spring
I love you more than I'll ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I'm workin on
I'm workin on

And when the sky's a dusky hue
And everything is bottle blue
I love you more than I ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I m workin on
I'm workin on

Take a walk down town

And jump the train line down
And then turn around at the edge of town
Or continue down to the other side
And ride and ride till we see our lives
And see our lives from outside our city walls
And darkened halls
And the lonely calls
And when we turn around
And head back in
Everything will be new again
Everything will be new

And when the high wind blows everything
Like the lion attacking the spring
I love you more than I'll ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I'm workin on
I'm workin on

And when the sky's a dusky hue
And everything is bottle blue
I love you more than I ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I m workin on
I'm workin on
Take a walk downtown

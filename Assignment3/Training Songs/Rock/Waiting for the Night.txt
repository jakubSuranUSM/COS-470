When the darkness falls and the night time calls, that's when I'll be around
No daylight for me, I don't need to see what is happening around me
I've had my share of the bullshit out there, I ain't no fool anymore
Got my own world when daylight is gone, don't see the sun
When it's dark, it's right, meet the guys outside, hit the town, have some fun
People say we're strange, don't accept our ways, we don't fit in their world
When that's the problem I couldn't care less, don't wanna be one of the best
They've got their values and I have got mine, I'm not their kind
Waiting for the night, I'm waiting for the night
Waiting for the night, I'm waiting for the night, yeah
(Solo)
When the darkness falls and the night time calls, that's when I'll be around
No daylight for me, I don't need to see what is happening around me
I've had my share of the bullshit out there, I ain't no fool anymore
Got my own world when daylight is gone, don't see the sun
I'm waiting for the night, I'm waiting for the night
Waiting for the night, I'm waiting for the night
Waiting, I'm waiting, ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, I'm waiting, ohhh, I'm waiting... (to fade)

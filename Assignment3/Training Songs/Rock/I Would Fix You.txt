I'm in pieces,
Does no-one see it?
I am stronger on the outside,
It's easy when you know why. 
This feeling sad,
It's not so bad.
I've got friends who lift my spirits,
I've got songs that no-one hears.

Sometimes the sun shines on unkind people, 
And some nights the spotlight's on shy people.
People like you.
These things are hard to think about,
You've been broken too,
Haven't you? 
I would fix you.

Sick this morning;
Friends say it's a warning.
But they don't understand,
They don't feel bad.

The sun was hot,
The day was long.
The best day we had in ages,
Everybody there was saying.

Sometimes the sun shines on unkind people,
And some nights the spot light's on shy people.
People like you.
These things are hard to think about,
You've been broken too,
Haven't you? 
I would fix you.

Life is stressful,
When you're successful.
I am here to take it out of,
I am strong to break your fists on.
But I don't mind,
It's summertime.
Its enough to keep me smiling,
Let me be your ray of sunshine.

Don't stand still,
Don't cry,
Don't drop your hands,
Don't break your stride.

Sometimes the sun shines on unkind people,
And some nights the spot light's on shy people,
People like you.
These things are hard to think about.
I've been broken too.
Haven't you?

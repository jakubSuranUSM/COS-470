Look at you, Diana
You have grown so beautiful
Put your homework down now
Come and sit here next to me

And I'll show you again we can play
I'll teach you some new words to say
I'll show you again we can play
Play with me, Diana

Here's a kiss, Diana
Have you seen it on TV?
It's just a ticklish feeling
in the place between your knees

Now I'll show you again we can play
I'll teach you some new words to say
I'll show you again we can play
Play with me Diana

Now I've done everything for you
Would you do something for me?
Or do you want to hurt my feelings?
Do you want to run away from me?

I'm amazed, Diana
you have come to be so smart
Keep a secret, darling,
Or you'll break your uncle's heart

Now I'll show you again we can play
I'll teach you some new words to say
I'll show you again we can play
Play with me Diana

Now I'll show you again we can play
So don't be afraid of the shame
'cause I'll show you again we can play
Play with me Diana
Diana
Play with me Diana

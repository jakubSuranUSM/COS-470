Some might wake up in a doorway
Some sit in mansions sick and sad
Some decay without the glory
And never realize what they had

I'm not wasting away my dreams
In shadows and shade
Love streams
Not wasting away

Spent my childhood at the movies
With Lenny Bruce and young Joe Buck
One day you'll wake up and you're 30
And you can't even drive a truck

And I'm not living on the bum
And I'm not living in your house no more

At 3 o'clock when that bell rung
Every moment left unsung
Still yours

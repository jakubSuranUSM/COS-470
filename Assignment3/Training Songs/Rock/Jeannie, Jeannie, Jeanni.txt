Well, Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie, come and dance with me
Well, I'll teach you every dance from across the sea
Yeah, first we'll hop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll bop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll slop, rock and roll, well, do the stroll

Well, Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie, got my blue suede shoes
A pink carnation and my black slacks too
Well, first we'll hop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll bop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll slop, rock and roll, well, do the stroll

I'll be ready at eight
I keep a-knockin' at your front door
All the cats are hoppin' at the big five-four

Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie, when we reach the hall
Well, we'll rock around the clock and really have a ball
Yeah, first we'll hop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll bop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll slop, rock and roll, well, do the stroll, yeah!

Well, baby baby, you won't have to wait
I'll be ready at eight
I keep a-knockin' at your front door
All the cats are hoppin' at the big five-four

Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie, when we reach the hall
Well, we'll rock around the clock and really have a ball
Well, first we'll hop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll bop

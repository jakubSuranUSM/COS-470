Never mind that stuff, they sell from Vietnam
Get it from the Chesapeake, but never from the can
Follow my directions, it's an easy recipe
Strictly by the pound
Adjust accordingly

Don't bother with the lump, it won't stick together
I prefer backfin
And there's nothing wrong with special
Powdered mustard, parsley, a dab of mayonnaise
Just enough bread crumbs and one raw egg

Yes, indeed
Serve it up hot!
Yes, indeed
Like this

Grab a biscuit cutter and pack it till it's filled
Stick it in the reefer for a little time to chill
Butter up a skillet, fry 'till golden brown
Find yourself a beverage and wash it all down

(Doop doop, doop doo doop doo doop)
(Ah-ooh ah-oop)
(Doop doop, doop doo doop doo doop)
(Ah-ooh ah-oop)

[Chorus:]
I've got Bonnie 
Sweet, sweet Bonnie 
And all my lonely days are through 
Now, now, now I've got Bonnie
Sweet, sweet Bonnie
Made all my dreams come true

(Doop doop, doop doo doop doo doop)
(Ah-ooh ah-oop)

Once I used to cry
Nobody cared if I would live or die
But then one lucky day
I met a girl that heaven sent my way, now

[Chorus]

(Doop doop, doop doo doop doo doop)
(Ah-ooh ah-oop)

I don't drive a car
I'll never be a famous movie star, but
Still I wouldn't switch with someone else
If he was twice as rich

[Chorus]

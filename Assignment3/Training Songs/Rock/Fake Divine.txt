Destroying my faith
No, I won't fight in your games
Destroying my faith
And I don't wanna play it again

Offending my ways
No, I won't fight in your games
Offending my ways
And I don't wanna play it again

Will I be forced away
Will I be fading out with nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
But I don't know how I'm played

Will I be forced away
Will I be saved from nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
I'm gonna fake divine
And save myself this time

Instead of praise
You leave me hanging on
Then you motion me to fall back there inside
You break my strength and tease me on and on
Any moment now I'm running out of time

Destroying my faith
No, I won't fight in your games
Destroying my faith
And I don't wanna play it again

Offending my ways
No, I won't fight in your games
Offending my ways
And I don't wanna play it again

Will I be forced away
Will I be fading out with nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
But I don't know how I'm played

Will I be forced away
Will I be saved from nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
I'm gonna fake divine
And save myself this time

(So wrong, so wrong)
I'm gonna hate you for the time
(I thought you're right)
But still, I'll find my ways

(So wrong, so wrong)
I wanna take out all the signs
I won't deny

From the moment I have faced your wrath 
I never got it right
From the moment I have faced the Gods 
I never got it right

Will I be forced away
Will I be fading out with nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
But I don't know how I'm played

Will I be forced away
Will I be saved from nothing
I'm fighting to stay
I'm fighting to stay
I'm gonna fake divine
And save myself this time

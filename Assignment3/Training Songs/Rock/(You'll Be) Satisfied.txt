Searched in the dark alleyways
Where the lonely souls dwell
Went down so low
Thought you went to hell

But you see daylight in the distance
Not the end of your rope
And the light is dim
But it burns with hope

Try to find someone
Keep on walking strong
With your heart open wide
You'll be satisfied

And a bed of rocks is your bed
Walk the halls at night
Only to shake your head
Where do the lost birds fly?

Maybe you were meant to be alone
'Cause love is not an easy thing, no
It's not the end because she's gone
Can't strike out unless you swing

Try to find someone
Keep on, keep on walking strong
With your heart open wide
You'll be satisfied

I know how you feel 'cause I've felt it too
Just as bad as your searching for someone
There is someone out there who needs you

And you see daylight in the distance
Not the end of your rope
And the light is dim
But it burns with hope

Try to find someone
Keep on walking strong
With your heart open wide
You'll be satisfied

You'll be satisfied

Greetings from Sodom 
How we wish you were here 
The weather's getting warmer 
Now that the trees are all cleared 
There's no time for a conscience 
And we recognize no crime 
Yeah we got dogs and Valvoline 
It's a pretty damn good time 

[Chorus] 
Men of reason, not of rhyme 
Keep the spoils and share your crime 
Goodman, Badman, lost without 
A hope for passage on the last plane out 

There was one repressed do gooder 
And a few who still believed 
Yes I think there were five good men here yesterday 
But they were asked to leave 
So we've kept the good old vices 
And labored to invent a few 
With cake in vulgar surplus 
We can have it and eat it, too 

[Chorus] 
 
Men of reason, hide your face 
Walking backwards, plays his ace 
Goodman, Badman, lost without 
A hope for passage on the last plane out 

Here's a concept you can't dance to 
An idea you cannot hum 
There may not be an empty seat 
When all is said and done 
I'm not the guy who sings the hymns 
No bleeding heart to mend 
But I like the part where Icarus 
Hijacks the little red hen 

Someone said the Big Man 
May be joining us soon 
But I never was the type to hang 
With the harbingers of doom 
And this party is addictive 
Self-destructive, no doubt 
So I hope that someone saves a seat for me 
On the last plane out 

[Chorus]

Karl went south and walked out on his hometown
He said it was nowhere, he'd find a new job and stay there
Karl went south like he'd fade if he stayed there
It scared him, he felt claustrophobic and needed some air

Something affected him down in the desert

Karl went south with a sigh of relief
Said he'd be happy with anything different at all
Karl went south but he went through the desert
A Mexican influence followed him home in the fall

Karl came back but he isn't the same
He came very quietly, no one was very surprised
Karl came back and he works and he smiles
But if you look closely there's still something scared in his eyes

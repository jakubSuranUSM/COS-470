No I don't mind if you think I should grow my hair
And no I don't mind if you pick out the clothes I wear
But know I can keep my head when all around me are losing theirs
Because

I am who I am, and you can't change me
I've done what I can, now I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands if you re-arrange me
It all falls down,
It all falls down

Why when you dream do you see me as something I'm not?
Why don't you wake up and see all the good things you've got?
A heart isn't made out of clay
Not something you shape with your hands
Understand

I am who I am, and you can't change me
I've done what I can, now I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands if you re-arrange me
It all falls down,
It all falls down

Is the reason you ask me to change so that you'll stay the same?
Well I'm sorry if I keep disappointing you again and again
But

I am who I am, and you can't change me
I've done what I can, now I'll stand my ground
You're tying my hands if you re-arrange me
It all falls down,
It all falls down
It all falls down
It all falls down
It all falls down
I am who I am

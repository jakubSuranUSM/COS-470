Tick-tock, stop the clock
Tick-tock, stop the clock
Time keeps moving on, soon my baby will be gone
Away, poor me

Tick-tock, stop the clock
Tick-tock, stop the clock
She's gonna catch the train at three, that will be the end of me
Tick-tock, stop the clock

Tick-tock, stop the clock
Tick-tock, stop the clock
For my baby would be mine if I could just turn back the time
Tick-tock, stop the clock

Tick-tock, stop the clock
Tick-tock, stop the clock
Time keeps moving on, soon my baby will be gone
Tick-tock, stop the clock

Tick-tock, stop the clock
Tick-tock, stop the clock

For my baby would be mine if I could just turn back the time
Tick-tock, stop the clock

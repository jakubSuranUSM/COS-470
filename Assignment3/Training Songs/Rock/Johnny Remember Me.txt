When the mist's a-rising 
And the rain is falling 
And the wind is blowing cold across the moor 
I hear the voice of my darlin' 
The girl I loved and lost a year ago 

(Johnny remember me) 

Well it's hard to believe I know 
But I hear her singing in the sighing of the wind 
Blowin' in the tree tops way above me 

(Johnny remember me) 

Yes I'll always remember 
Till the day I die 
I'll hear her cry 
Johnny remember me 

Well some day I guess 
I'll find myself another little girl 
To take the place of my true love 
But as long as I live I know 
I'll hear her singing in the sighing of the wind 
Blowin' in the tree tops way above me 

(Johnny remember me) 

Yes I'll always remember 
Till the day I die 
I'll hear her cry 
Johnny remember me 

(Johnny remember me)

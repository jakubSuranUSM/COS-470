Can I Graduate, 
Can I look into the faces that I meet, 
Can I get my punk-ass off the street, 
I've been living on for so long, 
Can I Graduate, 
To the bastard talking down to me, 
Your whipping boy calamity, 
Cross your fingers, I'm going to knock it all down, 
Can I Graduate, 
Echo fading, We can't let go, 
She goes walking by in slow mo', 
Sell your Heart out for a buck, 
Go on, Fade out, Before I get stuck. 
Talking to somebody like you, 
Do you live the days you go through, 
Will this song live on long after we do, 
Can I Graduate. 
Can I look into the faces that I meet, 
Can 1 get my punk-ass off the street. 
Won't die on the vine I want to knock it all down, 
Can I Graduate, 
Echo fading, Candle blow, 
Did you flash out long ago, 
Cross my fingers, I don't know someone poked you down below. 
Can I Graduate, 
Can I get my punk-ass off the street, 
Can I look into the faces that I meet, 
I'm not waiting here for you to die, 
Will this song live on long after we do.

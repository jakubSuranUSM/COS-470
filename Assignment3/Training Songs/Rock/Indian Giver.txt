Once we were so close we were fused,
Belly to belly
And now we're standing back to back
It's strange that we should be feuding
Once we were so close we were joined,
Forehead to forehead
Now we live in our own little worlds
We don't speak the same language
Who am I? I am you and I
Who are you? You are me too
Who are we? We are you and me
Who are they? They don't matter anyway
Once we were so close we held hands
Into the evening
Now we drift into a pea soup fog
We're lost in different directions
Et tu indian giver

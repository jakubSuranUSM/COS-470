Take this world from me
I don't need it anymore
I am finally free
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise you
Oh and I worship you

[Chorus]
Covered by your love divine
Child of the risen Lord
To hear you say "This one's mine"
My heart is spoken for

Now I have a peace
I've never known before
I find myself complete
My heart is spoken for

Oh and I praise you
Oh and I worship you

[Chorus]

By the power of the cross
You've taken what was lost
And made it fully yours
And I have been redeemed 
By you that spoke to me
Now I am spoken for

[Chorus: x2]

Take this world from me
Don't need it anymore

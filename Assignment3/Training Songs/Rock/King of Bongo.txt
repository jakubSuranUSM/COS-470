Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started bangin'my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo
I'm the king of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Lookin' for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' in my boogie
King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

'Cause people like disco
And people like house
That's why they don't applause
When I'm bangin' on my bongo
They say that I'm a clown
Makin' too much dirty sound
They say there is no place
For little monkey in this town
King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

Nobody like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy
When I'm bangin' on my boogie
But I don't like no disco
And I don't like the house
'Cause I'm born to rock
I'm born to pogo
King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

When I'm bangin' on my bongo
All that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody
In my place instead of me
I'm a king without a crown
Hangin' loose in the big town
And I'm born to rock
I'm born to pogo
King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

King of bongo
King of bongo bong
King of bongo
King of bongo bong

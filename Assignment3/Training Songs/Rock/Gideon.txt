Gideon, what have you told us at all?
Make a sound, come down off the wall.
Religion- should appeal to the hearts of the young
Who are you? What have you become?

You animal. Come on
What does this remind you of?

Truly, truly we have become
Hated and feared for something that we don't want
Listen, listen. Most of us believe that this is wrong

You animal. Come on
What does this remind you of?
What does this remind you of?
Animal. Come on.
What does this remind you of?
Animal. Come on.

Well, it's rainin' again
Rainin' again
Roll up your window, honey
It's rainin' again

Said that it's dark in the sky
Dark in the sky
Maybe you feel funny, honey
It's dark in the sky

Well, it's rainin' again
It's rainin' again
Roll up your window, baby
It's rainin' again

Said that it's rainin' again
Rainin' again
Roll up your window, baby
It's rainin' again

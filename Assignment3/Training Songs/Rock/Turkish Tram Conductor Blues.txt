Hey Mr. Judge, your trams are coming down the line
the cargo aint too much if you can chase the friends of mine
I heard they smuggle in the goods
along the western union line

Once on a time the...kids...
been so unkind run over the inspector man
discovered they were yellow
finally threw them in the can

CHORUS
Turn over turn over
turn over turn over
turn over turn over
Id hate to throw you back again
oh yes

Turn the volume up until you blow the speaker cone
hey Mr. Judge you have to give your dog a bone
theres a...in the rhino kitchen
send him on a china call

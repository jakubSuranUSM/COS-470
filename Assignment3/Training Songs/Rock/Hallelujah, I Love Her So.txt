Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

If I call her on the telephone
"Say, baby, Eddie's all alone"
By the time you count one-to-four
She'll be on my door, well

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
Says "Eddie baby, everything's all right"
That's how I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

Lemme tell you baby, in the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
Says "Eddie baby, everything's swingin'"
That's how I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hey, darlin', hallelujah
I just love that chick so

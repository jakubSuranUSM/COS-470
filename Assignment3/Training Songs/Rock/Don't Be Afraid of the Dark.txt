When you walk through the dark
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
We used to walk together late at night
We'd stop and hold each other tight
You would tell me that you were afraid
I must protect Thee, here's what I'd say
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
Darling, darling you've nothing to fear
Not as long as I am here
There is nothing I wouldn't do
To have a love of a girl like you
Hold me close and we'll never part
'Cause I would never break your heart
Baby, baby don't be afraid of the dark

Hold me close and we'll never part
'Cause I would never break your heart
Baby, baby don't be afraid of the dark
We'd walk along the world was ours
Promissed you everything, even the stars
You would tell me that you were afraid
I'd hold you close, here's what I'd say
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid, pretty baby
Don't (don't) don't (don't) be afraid of dark

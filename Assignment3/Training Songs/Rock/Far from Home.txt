It's warm by the river, the weir keeps us clean
The woodsmoke and cigarettes are all that we need
Marking the dirt with twigs and simple words spoke
Kicking the dust so we can just

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

It's cool by the sea when the pavement is hot
We take a walk down there to see what we've got
An old man collecting fifty beautiful words
Cleaning the beach so he can teach us to

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

It's cold by the pane glass on the high street we played
But there's always a penny in the music we made
So far from home with no means of return
Burning bridges, so we always

Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play it inspired
You said that you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever

We're so far from home
No need to return
There's so much that we have taught
And so much that we have learned

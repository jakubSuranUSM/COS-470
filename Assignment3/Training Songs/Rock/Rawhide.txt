Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Is gonna satisfy my soul

Let's have a party
Ooh, let's have a party
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room

Let's have a party
Ooh, let's have a party
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at my door
Bring him in and fill him up
And sit him on the floor

Let's have a party
Ooh, let's have a party
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

The meat is on the stove
The bread is gettin' hot
Everybody come and taste
The possum Poppa shot

Let's have a party
Ooh, let's have a party
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

Oh, we're really gonna
Have a party tonight

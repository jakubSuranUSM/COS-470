I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight
I feel so good I'm going to 
Take someone apart tonight

They put me in jail for my deviant ways
Two years seven months and sixteen days
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze

And I feel so good, and I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight

I feel so good I'm going to 
Make somebody's day tonight
I feel so good I'm going to 
Make somebody pay tonight

I'm old enough to sin but I'm too young to vote
Society's been dragging on the tail of my coat
Now I've got a suitcase full of fifty pound notes
And a half-naked woman 
With her tongue down my throat

And I feel so good, and I feel so good
Oh I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight

They made me pay for the things I've done
Now it's my turn to have all the fun
Well I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight

And I feel so good, I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight
Oh Oh Oh

I feel so good I'm going to 
Break somebody's heart tonight
Hmmm break somebody's heart
Break somebody's heart
Hmmm break somebody's heart
Oh break somebody's heart

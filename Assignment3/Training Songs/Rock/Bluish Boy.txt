Hot blue, now I'm left to my resources
Hot blue, now I'm left to my resources
Hot blue, now I'm left to my resources
Across valley of time, one way lose
Hot blue, now I'm left to my resources
Across valley of time, one way lose
Never change never change your attitude
Never break your mother's heart

Yeah!
And I feel
Your big break coming on
Stompin' out
Stompin' out

Hot blue, there's a saying in the bible goes
Never make friends with the next door neighbor
Cause the kids yeah the kids are gonna rock rock rock
Their little faces off next year
Forget the words, cause the words don't make it
Like under the stars 12/7/94
Something more, something more
I can tell you a story about the weekend

Face it
I'm a big man
And I've got so much to lose
Gonna lose
Gonna lose!
Yeah!

I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends

Hot blue, now I'm left to my resources
Across valley of time, one way lose
Never change never change your attitude
Never break your mother's heart

I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends
I'm making lots of friends

This is a right-away letter, I've got to mail it today
Straight to my main inspirer, says urgent from the USA
Its got this heart inside it, the postage is my soul
Contains a message from millions, says Keith don't go

A thousand guitars wailin', but it ain't quite the same
You've got a knack for sailin', 
and it's stamped with your own brand name
We's all sailors, as captain you must know
You bring a message to millions, says Keith don't go

I said Keith don't go,
Don't take my fun
Keith don't go, Keith don't go
We miss our father Jimi, it's hard to breathe with that loss
But I still got you brother, don't nail yourself to a cross
I watch you lead the pack, you put the drive into my soul
You bring a message to millions, says Keith don't go

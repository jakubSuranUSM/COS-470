Despierta, Senador
The time is nearly here
The gold watch strapped around your wrist
Must have stopped some time ago
The day is fading quickly and the hour is nearly here
The whitest chalk upon this land is about to disappear

Holding onto the past won't make it repeat 
It's time to get up
I think you're in my seat
Lay down your pockets
Lay down in your finest sheets
I will roll you gently
And the kiss will be sweet
Your time is over
Your power's peaked
Adios, senador
I have come to get the keys

I waited and I watched and I lived my life in peace
You ruled, you made decisions without thinking of our needs
You and all your friends feasted while we fought to make ends meet
Now the country's changing, see the difference on every street

Holding onto the past won't make it repeat 
It's time to get up
I think you're in my seat
Lay down your pockets
Lay down in your finest sheets
I will roll you gently
And the kiss will be sweet
Your time is over
Your power's peaked
Adios, senador
I have come to get the keys

Holding onto the past won't make it repeat 
It's time to get up
I think you're in my seat
Lay down your pockets
Lay down in your finest sheets
I will roll you gently
And the kiss will be sweet
Your time is over
Your power's peaked
Adios, senador
I have come to get the keys

Lay down your pockets
Lay down in your finest sheets
I will roll you gently
And the kiss will be sweet
Your time is over
Your power's peaked
Adios, senador
'Cause I have come to get the keys

Out of your clothes 
I know it won't be long 
God only knows 
Where this crazy thing comes from 
It's not that I don't love you, I do 
I've read all the definitions 
Think it must be true 
It's like driving at night 
When the illusion 
I'm going somewhere 
Keeps me alive 
Driving at night 
In this confusion 
Better to travel 
Never arrive 
Worried about 
The future all the time 
But there's no room for doubt 
Things'll work out fine 
It's not that I don't want to, I do 
Got to spend this life with someone 
Might as well be you 
It's like driving at night...

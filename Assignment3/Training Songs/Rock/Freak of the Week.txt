I spend a lot on all the clothes that I got
Cause all the geeks that I meet they all look cooler than me. 
What to do when they're all looking at you, 
Cause you're the Freak of the Week, cause you're on the TV

[Chorus:]
Can you make me a promise? 
Stop it before we begin.  
Will you hold onto my head
If I ever lose it again?

I've got a shrink I swear he's Elvis I think, 
He wears the coolest suede shoes when I come in with the blues. 
He thinks it's all about culture and art
But the truth of it is that it rips me apart
                                 
[Chorus]
Can you make me a promise? 
Stop it before we begin.  
Will you hold onto my head
If I ever lose it again?

Tell me I sold out...Tell me I sold out go ahead...

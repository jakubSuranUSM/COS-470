Lucifer's friend

Fear and fright since yesterday night
The little man knocked at my window
The hour he'd want but he had to run
But he'll be back again
Since yesterday night, I lived in fear of fright
I still hear his voice shouting
Through the night

I asked manny, I asked sue don't know
What to do
Every hour I cry I don't want to die
Fear is in my brain
Since yesterday night, I lived in fear of fright
I still hear his voice shouting
Through the night

Come take my hand I'm Lucifer's friend
Tonight is the end of your way

Repeat

Come take my hand I'm Lucifer's friend
Tonight is the end of your way
Take me, take me away, you can have me,
You can take me, you can take me away.

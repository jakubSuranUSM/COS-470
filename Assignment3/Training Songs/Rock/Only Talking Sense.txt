There's a wild thing in the woodshed 
And it's keeping me awake at night 
A devil in the closet 
And a feeling I'd prefer to hide 
He is religion 
He won't hear me when I cry for help 
He has a vision of me 
But I am somebody else 

We talk the pillow 
There are times when I'm tied up to the fence 
Only talking sense 

There's a mirror lake before me 
But I'm frozen when it's time to jump 
It's like maybe I'm afraid of what I'll find 
When independence comes 
You steel my shadow 
You make my blood run dry 

We are true only when we talk the pillow 
There are times when I'm tied up to the fence 
Only talking sense 

Did you suffer like a child 
That's why you want to make me cry 
You are afraid of me 
That's why you're so unkind 

You won't deny it 
When your child is tied up to the fence 
And I'm only talking sense 
Lonely when we talk the pillow 
And your child is messed up in the head 
I'm only talking sense

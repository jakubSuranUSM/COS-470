Perfect peace 
Mountains robed in glory, coming into view 
Father speaks, son becomes the story 
Essence of all true 

I saw what cannot be seen 
She spoke to me 
Take what you've learned, set it free 
See what you'll see 

Ah...

Flowing power, waterfall of wisdom 
Flawless bold commands 
Masterpiece written o'er the vision by the perfect man 
Living martyr, truer than the seasons 
No more place for lies 
Cast a seed, push aside the reason 
Reign of terror dies

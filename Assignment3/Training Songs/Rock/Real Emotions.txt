It doesn't matter how far I go 
It doesn't matter how long I stay 
It doesn't matter if the nights are long 
It doesn't matter the time of day 
All I'm saying that my love is true, I'm always here for you 

[Chorus]
Our love is 
Deeper than any ocean 
My heart is pounding 
with real emotions 
Our love is 
Sweeter than any potion 
My heart is pounding 
with real emotions yeah

It wouldn't matter if there's a hurricane 
It wouldn't matter if there's a tidal wave 
It doesn't matter if your phones go down 
It doesn't matter if I'm away 
All I'm saying that my love is true, I'm always here for you 

[Chorus]
My love is 
Deeper than any ocean 
My heart is pounding 
with real emotions 
Our love is 
Sweeter than any potion 
My heart is pounding 
With real emotions yeah

Everything I have I'll give to you 
I'll make your dreams and wishes all come true 
We'll burn together in the heat of love 
Under the stars above 
My love is 
Deeper than any ocean 
My heart is pounding 
with real emotions 
Our love is 
Sweeter than any potion 
My heart is pounding 
with real emotions

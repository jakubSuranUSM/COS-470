Caught out in the pourin' rain
Wish I could start this day again
Soaked through and through
Darlin' all I want is to get home to you

I could have sworn I saw your face
Smilin' back at me today
Oh, but I, I'm such a love sick fool
Everything I see reminds me of you

I wanna be in your arms tonight
I wanna tell you everything's alright
I wanna feel you close to me
And we don't even have to speak

Lovin' you feels like gold
Sends a rush right through my soul
I never get enough
You're the only thing I can't ?
Ooh yeah

I wanna be in your arms tonight
And I wanna tell you everything's alright
Ooh yeah, I wanna feel you close to me
And we don't even have to speak
Ooh no

Such a love sick fool
All I wanna do is be with you
I wanna be with you

I wanna be in your arms tonight
And I wanna tell you everything's alright
Ooh yeah, I wanna feel you close to me
Oh and we don't even have to speak

I wanna feel
I wanna be

Por cuando te vi enfermo con mentiras
Este ladron cuenta se dio
Trapa mal hecho de trampas te lo juro
Que yo si te mato
Y con cada dia que se pase recuerdate
Quien era el mas poderoso

(For when I saw you sick with lies
This thief, he took notice
Trap poorly made of tricks I swear to you
And with everyday that passes
Remember, Who was the most powerful)

Don't let me
Don't let me go

There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of magnets
They fold the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

In your viscera eyes
Cataracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

Aye, mi hija, no me llores
porque te quito de esta cruz
Y anoche te vi caminado sin la alma de tu cuerpo
En los brazos sin luz

(Oh my daughter, don't cry for me
Because I'll take you off this cross
And last night I saw you walking without the soul of your body 
In your arms without light)

Stains fall into the brickwall severed
Four of them were watching
While the other three did hide
The culprits spat the seed from a premium of glass
Shattering the sigil that you thought was deitized

Don't let me
Don't let me go

There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of maggots
They rot the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

In your viscera eyes
Cataracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

In your viscera eyes
Cataracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort
Come drown by your side

Wait! I've seen the ark shake from your pneumonic tongue
But the braile that you weave of itself it shall read aloud
Yes it will
I said, she's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
She's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial ground
Said, she's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
I said, she's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial, ground

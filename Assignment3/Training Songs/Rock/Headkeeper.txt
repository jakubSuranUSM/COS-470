He seeks and he hides
He lives and he dies
He saw it before we were dreaming
He'll hustle you down
A tin can or a crown
But he'll never play with your feelings

Headkeeper's the name
He's been here since he came
And he's keeping ahead of the meaning

He's weak and he's brave
He'll make you a slave
Or free you to fly in the heaven
With thoughts that are pure
He'll reflect all you saw
And all that is just an illusion

Don't you know the feeling
Don't you know the truth
Don't you know your dreaming
Don't you know, it's you
Don't you know, it's you

Headkeeper's the name
He's been here since he came
And he's keeping ahead of the meaning

They say we sail tonight
And we may have to fight
I want with all my might to stay
But I'll go for God, country, and my baby
You know I have to go
And, dear, I'll miss you so
For God, country, and my baby
Please write me every day, every day that I'm away
And though I'll be alone across the Rhine
I'll dream about you, dear, and know you're mine
[BRIDGE:] 
And if I ever need you, I'll close my eyes and see you
Your lips, your kiss, I'll need them so
I'll go for God, country, and my baby
Sure, as these teardrops burn, I promise to return
And when I'm home, I'll cling to the arms of my baby
And when I'm home, I'll stay in the arms of my baby

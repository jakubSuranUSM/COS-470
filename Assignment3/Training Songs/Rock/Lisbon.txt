The countless eyes dotted in the night sky
I speak the language, several hundred words
Cloudless day, thunderous night
Among companions carry my name

The life we lead came gradually
Who keeps the time?
A bitter lime, do us fine
To kill the taste

Turn deaf ears on all that we don't wanna hear
Cause for travel has come again
At this early hour, I tell your wife a story
She looks outside, doubles over laughing

The souls you love, the place you live
Those country houses
A change of heart tore us apart
Oh, what a ride

Every chance you have
All the love and light
All the joy and grace
Don't be upset, don't you think it out
You know what thinking does
to love's shine and love's light

All together world
I'm hanging on
It feels right, yeah

I saw a strange thing
Reminds me of faces
Upon a stormy sky tonight

All the younger kids, gone away to sleep
In the days to come, I'll do the same
At this early hour, I'll tell your wife a story
She looks outside, doubles over laughing

But the life we lead came gradually
Who keeps the time?
And a bitter lime, will do us fine
To kill the taste

There's a rumor here
And it's going round
Can you hear it on the street
If you realize that the pleasure lies

Between surrender and the heat 
Just take a walk
On the wild side babe
And I'll meet you halfway there

And if you're talking about paradise
There's no need to say a prayer
'Cause baby I'll take you there 
Hey girl

Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world

Heaven is a four letter word 
Lose your innocence 
For experience 
But you've got to take the chance

Can you rock and roll
Can you get down babe
Cause it's tough for you to dance 
Don't need to ride in a limousine

To feel like a millionaire
And if you're talking 'bout fantasy
It could happen anywhere
Baby I'll take you there 

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough

You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word 
It's like love and kiss
And it feels like this

Baby don't wait too long
It's just me and you
We know what to do
And it's a long way til dawn

Yeah 
Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word

One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word 
Hey girl

Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world

Heaven is a four letter word 
(Hey girl)
Oh yeah
(Heaven is a four letter word)

It's a four letter word
(One touch)
Haven't you heard
(Heaven is a four letter word)

Hey
Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word

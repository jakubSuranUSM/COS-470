I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are creepin' about
These people are freakin' me out (these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all want to know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see?

I just want to live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just want to live

I rock a law suit when I'm goin' to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talking on the phone
Got an interview with the Rolling Stone
They're saying, â??Now you're rich, now you're famousâ??
Fake ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
Your first hit aren't you ashamed
Of the life, of the life, of  the life
We're living

I just want to live I just want to live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just want to live

Stop your messing around boy
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans boy
Said everyone of our teachers
Look out, you better play it safe
Never know what hard times will come your way
We say, where we're comin' from
We've already seen the worst that this life can bring
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say
Yeah we already know

I just want to live
I just want to live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me I just want to live

It keeps on Rainin'
Everyday
Just keeps on Rainin'
Won't go away
Same old love story
You've heard before
I tried
She lied
I cried
Inside

It keeps on Rainin'
Oh how much more
Will it keep rainin'
Will it still pour ?
Maybe there's someone
Waitin' around
The bend
A friend
Who'll lend
An end
To all this Rainin'
This awful Rainin'
And bring me some love

It keeps on rainin'
Oh how much more
Will it keep rainin'
Will its still pour ?
Maybe there's someone
Waitin' around
The bend
A friend
Who'll lend
An end
To all this Rainin'
This awful Rainin'
And bring me some love.

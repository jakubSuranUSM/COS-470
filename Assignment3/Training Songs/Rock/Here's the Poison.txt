And we kill with every good intention
You better decide if you want to get circumsized to live
And we kill to get attention
Now go buy yourself a violin

And did you know that it's only an act
Why can't you tell the wealth they do react
Bless your soul if it is still intact
Your body is the gun and your word's are taxed

We can build the prostitute build the abomination
You cannot sell yourself to live
Live with disease drive-in ascension
Win all the things you cannot have

And did you know that it's only an act
Why can't you tell the wealth they do react
Bless your soul if it is still intact
Your body's gone, welcome to the poisoned

What's it to be civilized you seem so sick not civilized
The sick manifestations of raised security
Sit and watch your body twitching
Reject the fallen believers
Injudgement incest ones-heal yourself again

Here's the poison
Welcome to the poisoned
Here's the poison
Welcome to the poisoned

Live here - blameless
Vindiction - copulation - evrydation
Die here - guilt free
Heal together, together
To get your poisoned
Welcome to the poisoned
Here's the poison
Here's the poison

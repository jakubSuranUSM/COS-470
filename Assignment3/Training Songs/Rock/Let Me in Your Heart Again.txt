When people talk of love I'll leave the conversation.
I say I feel just fine happy with my situation.
But when I look away people know my mind is straining
To where I once belong, dreaming about your heart again.

(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again
(Listen to me honey)

We like to face the blues,
I give you satisfaction (it’s your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction (it’s your heart again)

So don’t you walk away,
Remember is my heart you’re breaking
You forget we were in love,
Now my heart is only filled with the pain

(Your heart again, your heart again)
Let me in your heart again

Oh my love, I want you to stay
Don’t leave me now or I just fade away
Oh my love don’t hurt me this way
Oh look me baby, oh

Don’t make me wait too long or I’ll lose my mind
When people talk of love,
I have no hesitation (it’s your heart again)
Tell me what you dream at all
I’ll hold a conversation for you babe (it’s your heart again)

But when I look away
People know my mind is straining
To where I once belong,
Just let me in your heart again

(Your heart again)
Let me in your heart again

Open the doors for me babe.
It’s your heart again. let me in

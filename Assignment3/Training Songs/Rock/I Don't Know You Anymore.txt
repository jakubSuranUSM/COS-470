A thousand pieces of my heart
Swept across a weathered floor
And no idea how to start
Solving puzzles from before
Maybe in time this confusion will fade
But every single error we made
Is right there on display

I don't know you anymore
Name and face have been obscured
Change them if you want but
I don't know you anymore

I play back everything we did
But all the words are out of phase
And so the tape rewinds inside my head
Shedding but it can't be saved
Pushing record when I wanted to play
The message is clear how you pushed me away
It's more than I can take

I don't know you anymore
Name and face have been obscured
Change them if you want but
I don't know you anymore

I had a vision of one last try
What does it mean to me?
All I saw was a tear-stained face
Staring back so silently

I heard a voice travel over the line
Telling me tales filled with riddles and rhymes
That I don't recognize

I don't know you anymore
Name and face have been obscured
Change them if you want but
I don't know you anymore

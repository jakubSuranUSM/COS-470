Just in town
Looking like survivors 
From the lost and found
Brute Force & Ignorance 
Have come to play
A one-night stand at 8 o clock
And then they'll be on their way
Well this whole town's exploding
And the mayor's upight
He'd like to make it to the show
But he knows it's not his night
He's got to be beholding
To his latest spouse
But she's put the thumbscrews on him
And snuck out of the house, there she goes

The picture on the poster 
Raised an eyebrow or two
At fifty-five to seven 
Man you should have seen the queue
City slick and country hick
They came one and all
A traffic light girl and the down-home kids
Assembled at the hall

Brute Force & Ignorance
Ye, that's the name
The young folks're gonna miss 'em
Now they've gone away
Well the show got so crazy
Today they took the billboard down
I'll never forget the scene last night
When the band was escorted out of town
This little town's back in slow motion
I'm sad to say
After the confusion
It'll never bethe same
I took a walk down Main Street
Just to pass the time
And I still could hear that music
Running through my mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Brute Force & Ignorance
Are showing in town
And if you wanna find them buddy
They're down at the lost and fa-fa-fa-fa-found

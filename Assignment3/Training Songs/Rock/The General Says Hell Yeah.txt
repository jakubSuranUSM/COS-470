Well you can live your life on a common ground
Or you can strut your stuff to the idiot sound
Waitin? for a chance now, wantin? to get down

Lacin? up the shoes for a new vendetta
Wantin? to get even, bet you heard what I said
I'm linin? up my troops now, better hang around

you'll be a trouper, you'll be a super too
You'll be a ruler in everything you say and do

Well, headlocked in a solid groove
Dead rocked 'coz it?s time to move
First man in first attack, ain't no turnin? back
So get in line now, get in line alright

I'm warrin? 'coz you're borin? to the bone
I am the G-Man baby and I'm gettin? it done
Got you runnin? with my gunnin? got you cold
I am the general baby callin? it 'rock ?n? roll

Well, you can live your life on a common ground
Or you can strut your stuff to the idiot sound
Waitin' for a chance now, wanna hear a little noise

Well, you can dig yourself in for a heavy barrage
Or you can play a vox in that god damned garage
We?ll do it my way now, 'coz I have my boys

Said, in the wake of the day, I wanna come out and play
Said, that is all that I have to say

Big guns on a big machine, my troops they are lookin? damn mean
Salute the general or you'll have to be shelled to hell
Full force with a rockin? twist, souped up and I'm gettin? pissed
You take your orders, gonna strike it on the biggest bell

Warrin? 'coz you're borin? to the bone
I am the G-Man baby and I'm gettin? it done
Got you runnin? with my gunnin?, got you cold
I am the general baby callin? it rock ?n? roll

I am the general baby
I am the general baby, callin? it rock ?n? roll
I am the general baby, gunnin?, got you cold
I am the general baby, and I'm gettin? it done
Rock ?n? roll baby, hey

Hello, Hello
I like your smile
Hello, Hello
Shall we talk awhile?
Or would you like some of my tangerine?
I know I'd never treat you mean

Never knew how much I need you
Didn't know how to greet you
When I saw you look my way
I knew I had to say

Always longed to say, "I love you"
Always been too high above you
Now I'm not so far away
Now at last I can say

Hello, Hello
You've got pretty hair
Hello, Hello
Can't you tell I care?
Or would you like some of my tangerine?
You know I'd never treat you mean

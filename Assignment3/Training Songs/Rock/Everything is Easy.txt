I drove the coast just to see you
Why'd you take so long?
And I get that you know that I miss you
And I, I know something's wrong

And I'm caught in this state
At least I hope it's a phase
And I go and I just play along
And the voice that she plays
The photos that I've erased
I know something is wrong
I know something is wrong

And then you speak to me
And everything gets easy
Like I get what I wanted
Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything gets easy
'Till she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Come make it easy some more

Go ahead, take my heart up
Roll it up like a joint
Smoke me out 'till the feeling gets cashed
When you look in my face
It's like you forget the point

And then you speak to me
And everything gets easy
Like I get what I wanted
Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything gets easy
Til she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Come make it easy some more

You're gonna be sore
Sore, sore, sore
Sore, sore
You're gonna be sore
Sore, sore, sore
Sore, sore
La la la la, be so lonely now
Da da da da, be so lonely now

If you wanna see me
You know I'm easily found
Just climb the stairs where we used to live
Wrap your fist round my heart
Yeah, you know how it pound, pound, pound

Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything gets easy
'Till she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Sore, sore, sore
Sore, sore
Come make it easy some more
Oh, oh, oh

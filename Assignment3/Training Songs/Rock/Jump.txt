I don't wanna live in heartache
Don't bring me down again
Stop doing my head in
When will it end, when will it end

Get ready it's show time
Got nothing to lose but you
And now I've made up my mind
You know what to do, you know what to do

Jump
Why don't you just jump
Now you're out on your own
Only one way for you to go
So jump
Why don't you just jump
Now you're out of time
And you know what you can do

Sick and tired of you hanging around
Why don't you get it through your head
When I say it's over
It's over and dead, It's over and dead
(gun shot)

You say I'm looking so good
Yeah I'm doing fine without you
Ain't missing nothing
Especially you, yeah you

Jump
Why don't you just jump
Now you're out on your own
Only one way for you to go
So jump
Why don't you just jump
Now you're out of time
And you know what you can do

Ooo ooo you didn't think it possible
I could ever live without your love
But you lost it all
Ha!

You say you need me
(Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
Can't live without me
(Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
And you say you love me
(Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)
Do anything for me
(Whatever, whatever I've heard it all before)

So jump
Why don't you just jump
Now you're out on your own
Only one way for you to go
So jump (jump, jump)
Why (jump) don't you (jump) just jump
(jump, jump, jump, jump)
Now you're out of time
And you know what you can do

Well you can jump!

"This elevator only takes one down", she said,
"this place, this hotel lounge
It's my daily bread...
But I'm underfed"

He asked:
"are you living in the night?
'Cause I can tell you have a lousy imagination
And as a matter of speaking
I hate this situation...
But it happens to be one of my pickin'"

"Cause it's so hard
To keep the dream alive
'Cause if it all comes down to this
How will..."

You move me, you move me
You move me around around, I guess
Take it back your analogue
It's on the other side of this (x2)

'Cause if it all comes down to this
How will...

And then she said:
"and have another cigarette"
I tend to forget (but anyway I don't smoke that shit)
And hoisted the flag
But it keeps hanging down

"You know this place, this hotel lounge
It's my life, it's my choice
And I'm in love
With Ricky Lee Jones' voice"

'Cause it's so hard
To keep the dream alive
And if it all comes down to this
How will...

You move me, you move me
You move me around around, I guess
Take it back your analogue
It's on the other side of this [Repeat: x5]

How will glamour survive? [Repeat: x4]

And if it all comes down to this...

"This elevator only takes one down", she said,
"this place in this same old town"

"Do you see that man
In the left-hand corner
Do you see that woman
Their love-story's famous"

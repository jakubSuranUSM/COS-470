Sister seagull, oh you're flying me to high
Feels so dizzy underneath your open skies
And it's strange the games we play to hide the crime
Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive

I am a prisoner who has thrown away the key
My soul has vanished with the bird who flies so free
And the wings of change have spread themselves o'er me
Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive

I am waiting here for the tide to turn
And the pathways of the air to open
Will you meet me there
By the golden stairways to the clouds?
To the clouds

I am a changeling like the wind across the waves
Though in the end there will be nothing left to save
I will return one day with all the time you gave
Sister seagull you're the reason I survive
I survive, I survive

The world is our carpet now,
The world is our dancefloor now,
Remind me how to dance again,
The world is our carpet now.

The world is just waiting now,
No staring out windows now,
Our train stopped moving hours ago,
We're here, we're here, we're here.

Yes we're here,
Free to run and cry,
Obliged to try
And nothing here's worth winning without a fight.
But I can't move,
Enjoy the still for a while.

Lose myself in waves,
The mountains and the sky,
And back here quick as lightening.
'Cause we're just seconds,
Seconds in a day.

It's a dancefloor now,
No staring out windows now.
Our train stopped moving hours ago,
We're here, we're here we're here.
What do I do?

Free,
Free to run and cry,
Obliged to try
And nothing is worth winning without a try.

Oh yes we're here,
Free to go insane.
Joy and Pain are fighting in the corridors outside.
When I can't move,
I'll savour the pause for a while.

Lose myself in waves,
The mountains and the sky,
And back here quick as lightening.
'Cause we're just seconds,
Seconds in a day.

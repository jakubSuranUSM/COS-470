When you're so far away
At the end of each day
Counting the moments till you fade away
Inside my soul
Under passion's control
Are feelings I can't find the words to explain
Just like the first time I'm helpless again

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone

The nights are so cold
With just your memory to hold
I've tried to be strong
Reaching out holding on
Alone in my bed
I cling to each word you said
Wanting you more every day we're apart
And each precious moment is safe in my heart

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone

Tag mig I din famn
Hall om mig
Do ar den - bara do
Jag vill vara hos dig
Vi hor tillsammans
Vi var sa nara
Natterna ar sa kalla
Jag vill vara hos dig
Saknar dig hur som helst
Jag vill vara hos dig
Hall om mig
Alska mig, alska mig

Just like the first time I'm helpless again

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone

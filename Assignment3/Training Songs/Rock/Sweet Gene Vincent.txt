Blue Gene baby
Skinny white sailor, 
The chances were slender
The beauties were brief
Shall I mourn your decline 
With some Thunderbird wine
And a black handkerchief? 
I miss your sad Virginia whisper
I miss the voice that called my heart

Sweet Gene Vincent
Young and old and gone
Sweet Gene Vincent

Who, who, who slapped John?
White face, black shirt
White socks, black shoes
Black hair, white Strat
Bled white, died black

Sweet Gene Vincent
Let the blue roll tonight
At the sock hop ball in the Union Hall
Where the bop is their delight

Here come duck-tailed Danny 
Dragging Uncanny Annie
She's the one with the flying feet
You can break the peace 
Daddy sickle grease
The beat is reet complete
And you jump back, honey 
In the dungerees
Tight sweater and a pony tail
Will you guess her age 
When she comes back stage?
The hoodlums bite their nails

Black gloves, white frost 
Black crepe, white lead 
White sheet, black knight 
Jet black, dead white 

Sweet Gene Vincent
There's one in every town
And the devil drives 
Till the hearse arrives
And you lay that pistol down

Sweet Gene Vincent
There's nowhere left to hide
With lazy skin and ash tray eyes
A perforated pride

So farewell mademoiselle, 
Knickerbocker Hotel
Farewell to money owed
But when your leg still hurts 
And you need more shirts
You got to get back on the road

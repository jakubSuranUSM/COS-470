Young love waits out the window and I said go home,
'Cause he don’t know it’s not his problem
And he don’t know I’m not at home
Clock strikes three in the morning and I lie sleepless,
'Cause he don’t know I broke my promise
And he don’t know I’ve done this

In the early light I found you with the bottle by your side.
I can see by your eyes you know that I,
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye

What now? That is the question
But it’s not up to you
So I think I will leave you guessing
After all you put me through.

In the early light I found you with the bottle by your side.
I can see by your eyes you know that I,
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye

In the early light I found you with the bottle by your side.
I can see by your eyes you know that I,
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye
I’m kissing you goodbye

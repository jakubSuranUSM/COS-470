Around the bend in the L&N
They loaded it down with a lot of men
The horn too blew and threw the switch
Nobody knew just-a which one switch

Ridin', ridin' on the L&N
Hitchhikin', I've been ridin' on the L&N

A man named Quinn got the L&N
Runnin' around on how she been
The train slowed down and Quinn jumped off
He wasn't dead 'cause I heard him callin'

"Ridin', ridin' on the L&N
Hitchhikin', I've been ridin' on the L&N"

A man named Mose with a great big nose
Sleepin' on that pile of toes
The doctor came and he rang the bell
Well, he hollered, hollered, yeah
"Well, well, well

Ridin', ridin' on the L&N
Hitchhikin', I've been ridin' on the L&N"

I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I've been trying to understand it
And find ways to persuade you

I don't want to simplify it
Eloquence is overrated
A pretty tool to neuter you

But I'm wasting time, 
What good can I do?
I jump in the fire, 
Burn my feet and ask 
If it's theoretically true

The narratives are so familiar
A crush too much for pen and paper
A misquote from a science book
I can't accept your explanation
Blind page, blank cheque obfuscation
Played so dumb I can't bear to look

But I'm wasting time, 
What good can I do?

I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I'm repeating about a new thing
I'm repeating about a new thing
I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I keep thinking 'bout a new thing
I'm repeating about a new thing

Tell your sins to me and I'll do them all over with you I know it's speed so I hope you'll come over going up or down, with you And I don't know if I'm going up or down, with you Don't know if I'm coming But I don't mind Change my thoughts of you when nothing's easy what comes true? Wet turns to blue when my thoughts are all over going up or down, with you And I don't know if I'm going up or down with you Don't know if I'm coming But I don't mind when my fun is all over Say my prayers to you and through when my fun would be over I always knew And I don't know If I'm going up or down, with you going up or down, with you Don't know if I'm coming But I don't mind Don't know if I'm going Don't know if I'm coming up or down, with you going up or down, with you But I don't mind

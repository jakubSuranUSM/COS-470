(Brewster-Spencer-Eccles)
Trick dog, nice trick
Gotta get me off the hook
Fight back, bite back
Gotta get out of that neighbourhood
Don't want no rose
Don't need no shows
No blow by blows
Oh no
Gotta get some love
Get some of that love
Pay out, pay out
Got to give me all you've got
Live nice, no dice
Take my books and burn the lot
Don't want no rose
Don't need no shows
No blow by blows
Oh no
Gotta get some love
Get some of that love
How time flies when you're on my mind
You walked right out the book
Look right back, leave no track in my neighbourhood
Black cat moan, stand alone
If I'm not back by two
Doin' my dash, I should've known
This badge ain't foolin' you
Don't want no rose
Don't need no shows
No blow by blows
Oh no
Gotta get some love
Get some of that love

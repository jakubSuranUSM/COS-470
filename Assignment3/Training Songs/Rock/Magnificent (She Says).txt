This is where
This is where the bottle lands
Where all the biggest questions meet
With little feet stood in the sand

And this is where
The echoes swell to nothing on the tide
And where a tiny pair of hands
Finds a sea-worn piece of glass
And sets it as a sapphire in her mind

And there she stands
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent

This is where it all began
To light your mother's cigarette
And to go to touch her hand
And my heart
There defrosting in a gaze
Wasn't built to be that way
Suddenly I understand

There on the sand
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent
She says
It's all gonna be magnificent
She says, it's all gonna be magnificent

The echoes slow
The bottle lands
The echoes slow
And there she stands

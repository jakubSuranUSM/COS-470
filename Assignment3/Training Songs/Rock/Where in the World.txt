Maybe the sun will go on shining
Maybe the stars fall from the skies
Where there's a river flowing
There is no way of knowing
Where it goes, no one knows

Maybe the rain will go on falling
Maybe the mountains touch the skies
Where there's a cold wind blowing
There is no way of knowing
Where it goes, no one knows

Living alone in the city
All of our dreams left behind
In every life there are seasons
Of laughter and sorrow

Where in the world did our love go?
When did our dreams say goodbye?

Living alone in the city
All of our dreams left behind
In every life there are seasons
Of laughter and sorrow

Where in the world did our love go?
Where did our dreams choose to hide?
Where in the world did our love go?
When did our dreams say goodbye?

Where in the world did our love go?
Where in the world did our love go?
Where in the world, where in the world
Where in the world did our love go?

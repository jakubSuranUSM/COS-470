Its
Raining
In the back seat 
Of my Cadillac 
Dollys
Sitting in
The white wet 
Someone 
Hung a coat 
On a statue 
Of Christ
And I called 
For a drink 
And a vet 
Den haague 
Den haague 
You
Scare me good 
Den haague 
Den haague 
You scare me 
We were taken 
From behind 
By
Some flesh jabs 
Two liters
Really make you 
Move
Look out for 
The muff king 
With a
Big black whopper 
In a
Two way 
Mirror mood 
Den haague 
Den haague 
You
Scare me good 
Den haague 
Den haague 
You scare me 
Some other time 
Some other where 
Baby
You might care 
Some other time 
Some other where 
Baby
You might dare 
Den haague 
Den haague
You
Scare me good 
Den haague 
Den haague 
You scare me

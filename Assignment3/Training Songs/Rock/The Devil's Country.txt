get off your cross, it's hot today
don't you talk your talk, don't you hesitate
and just like the stones on parade
your marchin' time's just a shot away

i've got a feeling
you don't listen to anyone
but yourself and you don't care
what i say or what others say

loud as sirens it's on today
don't you talk their talk, don't you hesitate
and like brass horns and candle flames
they're blowin' smoke in your face again

i've got a feeling
he don't listen to anyone
but himself and he won't care
what i say or what others say

i've got a feeling
you don't listen to anyone
but yourself and you don't care
what i say or what others say

i've got a feeling
he don't listen to anyone
but himself and he won't care
what i say or what others say

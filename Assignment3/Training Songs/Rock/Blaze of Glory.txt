It's funny how they shoot you down
When your hands are held up high
And you open up your heart and soul
But that's not enough for most.

I remember this much
There is nothing
You shouldn't speak of
If you got something to say
And there is no one
To be scared of
Just get them out of the way

Going out in a blaze of glory
My heart is open wide
You can take anything that you want from me
There is nothing left to hide

Going out in a blaze of glory
My hands are held up high
I'm learning how to hit back
I'm learning how to fight

The law of the jungle says
You look after yourself
But I remember this much
I love as I've been loved myself.

Don't forget what I told you now
When the question keeps on coming
And it's "how much more can you take"
When they've ripped your clothes to pieces
"shouldn't you be gone by now"

But you keep on
Going out in a blaze of glory
Setting your sights for the sky.
They can offer you anything at all
But your dreams must not be sold.
Going out in a blaze of glory
No price is high enough
I'm fighting back with feeling
I'm fighting back with love

When the nails are biting into your hands
And the cross is heavy on your heart
Now is the time to really make a stand
My hands are held up high.

(Going out)
In a blaze of glory
(Going out)
In a blaze of glory
(Going out)
In a blaze of glory

Going out in a blaze of glory
My heart is open wide
You can take anything that you want from me
But you cannot take my soul

Going out in a blaze of glory
My hands are held up high
I'm learning how to hit back
Yes I'm learning how to fight

Going out in a blaze of glory
Going out with my heart wide open
Going out with my hands held high

Going out in a blaze of glory
Going out in a blaze of glory

Fighting back with love
Fighting back with love!
No price is high enough
To take my soul, to take my soul
To take my soul

It's funny how they shoot you down
When your hands are held up high

(Keep on going with my hands held high)
(Keep on going with my hands held high)

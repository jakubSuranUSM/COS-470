Well I live here in kill city where the debris meets the sea
I live here in kill city where the debris meets the sea
It's a playground to the rich, but it's a loaded gun to me

Well I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy
But if I have to die here first I'm gonna make some noise

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

Turn that boy loose!

Yeah the scene is fascination man and everything's for free
The scene is fascination man and everything's for free
Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees

Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose
Give it up, turn the boy loose

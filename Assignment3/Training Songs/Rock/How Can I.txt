The local radio says sorry time to go
But I don't sleep too well
Where are those southern belles
Tryin' to get a telephone line through South Carolina
Your call may bring somebody down for miles around
I'm watching her eyes again
I won't use no fountain pen
The lady isn't here. The message wasn't clear
She left an hour ago, screamed from the floor below
Mother nature never gives in, she wants you to sing
But how can I go on just singing this song
My car's out of gas again
Hurry home to see my friend
Money won't help you to win a new look at things
Loving can bring you down so you fall
Then why do you still try to get up at all
Your good and bad side showing through
Problems are a part of you
You must love someone else or face life by yourself
You may expect a call
She's waiting in the hall
See the garden grows and it grows nobody else knows
And you can wear just any old thing
The show can begin
I'm falling asleep to dream
No more hills to climb it seems
Money won't help you to win a new look at things
You never give in
So why don't you sing
But how can I go on just singing this song
My car's out of gas again
I'll be home to see my friend

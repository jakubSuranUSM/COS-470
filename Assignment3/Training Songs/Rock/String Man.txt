I fell in love with the string man
Who played guitar in a rock and roll band.
And every night I'd watch them play
But it happened at the matinee
How I squirmed when he bent those strings,
And I screamed when he started to sing.
The way he moved and looked so groovy, 
Well, ya know, he did something to me. 
String man...string man...string man...string man... 
So I followed the string man
Who played guitar in a string band. 
And every night I'd watch them play,
And they got better everyday. 
Pretty soon, and what do ya think 
(What do you think)
Everybody's saying they're the biggest thing 
(The biggest thing)
Hit records and making the scene 
(The scene)
Sexy pictures in the fan magazines. 
String man...string man...string man...string man... 

I strung along with the string man;
He always called me his biggest fan. 
Though he was kind, I should have known better
Than to think we'd always stay together. 
And then one night the show was wild and loud,
And I saw a pretty girl out in the crowd.
She waved at him and caught his eye
The way he looked at her it made me cry. 
String man
String man...string man...string man...
String man...string man...string man...
String man...string man...string man...

You know what they say,
At the end of the day, 
But days fade away,
And where does time go please,
Is it moments like these,
And I dream of one

Daytime t.v,
Unhappy families,
Say nothing to me,
And so it goes,

I guess I suppose,
For after all agreed,
Can't explain

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here

Driving down showers,
Box got no flowers,
The sun is going down,
And I wish I could go,

To where I don't know,
But I'd like to go,
Can't explain,

Just the same,
Just the same,
Same again

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here,

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here

Can't explain,
Just the same,
Just the same,
Same again

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here,

Waiting for hours,
Hours turn to days,
Days turn to years,
I'm still here

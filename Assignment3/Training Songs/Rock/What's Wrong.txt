What's wrong in our schools?
Politicians are blowing their cools
Over they who refuse to abide by the rules
Though they should be separate dealings

What's wrong at the zoo?
The animals sense all our fears coming through
Our facade yet there's not a thing that they can do
It's hurting their poor, helpless feelings
What's wrong?

What is wrong?
What is wrong?

What's wrong with our folks?
Strong and solid as hundred-year oaks
So firm in their ways that they think we are jokes
They just don't know why

What's wrong in their head?
Won't they just try to see it once our way instead
If they did then there would not be any young dead
No reason to cry
What's wrong?

Won't you tell me
What is wrong in your heart?
Do you feel that soon mankind and reason will part?
As each day it worsens you feel we will start 
On that anxiously dark, endless journey

What's wrong with this top?
As it spins each year gives us a worsening crop
Of hatred that one day will cause it to stop
A lesson we all should be learning
What's wrong?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?

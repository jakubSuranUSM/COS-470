I am a master hunter
I cured my skin, now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries

You want a woman cause you want to be saved
Well I'll tell you that I got a little lot on my plate
Well if you want a woman who can call your name, it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe

I don't stare at water anymore,
Water doesn't do what it did before
It took me in into the edge of insane when I only meant to swim
I nearly put a bullet in my brain when the rhythm took me in

I am a master hunter

You let men into your bed
They don't know you well
They can't get into my head
They don't have a hope in hell

See the thing is we are so alone
There's nothing we can share
You can get me on the telephone but you won't keep me there
No, no, no, you won't keep me there

Take me somewhere I can grow
Give me something let me go
Tell me something I don't know
I, I have some news
I have some news
Is this what you think I do
In life when I'm not being used
You're not sad, you look for the blues
You're not sad, you look for the blues
I have some news
Wrestling the rope from darkness is no fucking life that I would choose

I am a master hunter
I cured my skin, now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries

I am a master, I am a master
I am a master hunter

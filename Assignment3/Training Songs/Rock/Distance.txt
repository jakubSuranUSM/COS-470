If I had known 
That I'd be fine
I would have taken some more time

Just the distance of our lives
Everything I know sometime

I'm so far
But feel so close
Everything we lose becomes the most

But now
I feel like
Oh, no
I tell you all the time

That when I think of you 
It tears my heart
And pushes me
Back to the start

(From? or Far?) tonight
Ah, ah

But now
I feel like
Oh, no
I tell you all the time

That when I think of you
It tears my heart
And pushes me 
Back to the start

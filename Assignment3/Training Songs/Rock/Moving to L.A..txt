Not much glam' about the english weather
There's not much left to bring us together
Sunshine on a rainy day
Makes me want to move away
But I think I've got it sorted
I'm gonna get myself deported

[Chorus]
I'm considering a move to LA
(He's considering a move to LA)

Hang around with axel rose
Buy myself some brand new clothes
Everything will be just fine
Where the murder, rape is in decline
Do me some relaxin'
Maybe grab a piece of action

[Chorus]

And when I get off the plane
The first thing I'm gonna do
Is strip naked to the waist
And ride my harley-davidson
Up and down sunset strip
I might even get a tattoo
My troubles'll never find me
I'm not sending any letters or postcards home
I'll drink tennessee
With morrisey
On a beach
Out of reach
Somewhere very, very far away

[Chorus]

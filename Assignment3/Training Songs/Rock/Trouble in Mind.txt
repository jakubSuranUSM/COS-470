Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
But the sun will shine
In my backdoor some day

Trouble in mind, it's true
I have almost lost my mind
Well, life ain't worth living
Feel like I were dead

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome rail-railroad line
And I'm gonna let the 2:19 train
Ease my trouble in mind

Trouble in mind, yes, I'm blue
My poor heart is beat-beatin' slow
I haven't had so much trouble
In my life before

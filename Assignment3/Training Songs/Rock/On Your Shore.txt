I dig my heels into the dirt
'Cause this one's gonna hurt
Won't let the waves wash me away 
Is what I always pray
In my heart I know you couldn't see 
In the dark or find your way through me
Now I'm alone my hands are numb 
How do I carry on?

And at the turn of the tide 
I feel this part of me die
Am I washed on your shore and barely alive?

Now I'm held hostage in my head 
With every word you said
Got all those lessons in my past 
I spit them out so fast, I
See myself
With you I act so small 
See myself 
With you I always crawl
So someone leave a raft for me 
The water's getting deep

And at the turn of the tide 
I feel this part of me die
Am I washed on your shore and barely alive?

Here I am (in my insecurity)
Here I am (with my damaged dignity)
Here I am (you're pulling me in too deep)
Here I am
Here I am (I'm in the mercy seat)
Here I am (running without my feet)
Here I am (oh, what's come over me)
Here I am

When I was melting in your hand 
You didn't understand
You slip through me like grains of sand
You still don't understand

Overboard I'm thrown out to see what you are and what I mean to me
But I will always have my dream where you can swim to me

At the turn of the tide 
I feel this part of me die
And I've been on your shore before 
And it was no waste of time
Over my head and in my mind
Am I washed on your shore and barely alive?

Am I washed on your shore and barely alive?

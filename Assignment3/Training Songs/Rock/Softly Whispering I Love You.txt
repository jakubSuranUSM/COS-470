Softly whispering I love you
Echoes of your voice are calling
Still through my dreams
Softening the chill of the breeze
Through my window
I can see the moonglow
Painting silver shadows on a rose
Coloured land
A world that we walked hand in hand
In a day of gold coloured by the glow of new love

I can feel your warm face
Ever close to my lips
And the scent of you invades
The cool evening air
I can close my eyes
And you're there in my arms
Still and I know your soft kiss
Turning into music every beat of my heart
When I hold you close to my heart
And I hear your voice whispering
I love you.

I can feel your warm face
Ever close to my lips
And the scent of you invades
The cool evening air
I can close my eyes and you're there in my arms
Still and I know your soft kiss turning into music ev'ry beat
Of my heart
When I hold you close to my heart

And I hear your voice whispering
I love you.

I've been drooling at some mangy scraps of bread
And these hungry voices make a lot of noise inside my head
Show me the way to the rubbish dump or the bins at closing time
I'd walk a mile just to catch a smile from a fish without its brine

Been hanging round the underground
Found a couple of crumbs down there
Was lucky and got some flirts
From a girl with long brown hair
She said her name was Mary May and
She liked the springtime, oh
She said she left the meal
Half ate she said she left the crusts of toast

[Chorus]
Leftovers is what I want
Don't need no fine cuisine
Give me a dime for bacon rind
Or slip me some of that old sardine

She'd been seeing a man named Jim
I said I didn't mind
Said the second place is just my style
I'd glasses for the line
I knew she was keen to come and
I knew I'd met my match
I was sure that I had locked the door
And she had dropped the latch

[Chorus]

I said "bring your dark eyes honey"
She said "you bring yours"
Said I don't take second glance
So she walked out the door
I walked after her it weighed me down
And asked her why she left
She said she only dealt leftovers
And that all else felt like theft

[Chorus: x2]

If you see her, say hello
She'll be out handing scraps
But don't be fooled, her heart is ruled
By forces off the maps
Show me the way to the rubbish dump or the bins at closing time
I'd walk a mile just to catch a smile from a fish without its brine

[Chorus]

Tommy was a preacher's son 
Now he's running through the jungle (Yes sir!) 
Fingers cold and fire 
When you get so tired and we're so tired 

Lazing back in this desert 
Waitin' for that sunny day 

Tommy was a preacher's son 
Now he's running through the streets sellin' up that cocaine 
Those fires will get ya 
When you get too tired and we're so tired 
Eyes blister beaded fortress rolling fevered freight trains in 

Well I met three men with friends in office 
Smooth dark skin and ivory teeth smiles 
Our boots come alive in this mud and this shit 

"Life is hard to fill with teeth that bite and eat up our fears" 
Through August fall of '69 
Jesus had birthed him 
He spoke in guns through crippled sheets 
For Jesus had birthed him 
Sugar cubes fingernails worming snakes that built the fire

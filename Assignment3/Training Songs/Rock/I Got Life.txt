Watching you feeling more
Breaking through an open door
Bring your rage, what to gain
All you ever bought was pain

I got life, I got mine
I've got family, I got time
I've got hands to make it right
And I've got love and I will survive

Well, I've got anger
And it's in my soul
Well, I've got rage
But I've got control

Well, I've got patience
But you're on my toes
You light my fire
Now see me grow

Anger strike, weakened heart
Healing is our only part
Back to one, what you've begun
Love might be our strongest gun

Like the rain our hope is falling
But with the sun comes a brand new day

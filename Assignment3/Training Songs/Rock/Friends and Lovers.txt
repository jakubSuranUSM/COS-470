We grow together morning 'til night
We share a weakness I'm straining to hide
I'm in the picture, I'm on your wall
Sister together, we're ten feet tall

Yes, it's wonderful to be friends and lovers
Yes, it's wonderful to be, yeah, your lover

You listen to me, listen this time
I've faked this sadness, I've faked my whole life
And in the bedroom, well, I cling to your side
Sister whatever, I mirror your life

Yes, it's wonderful to be friends and lovers
Yes, it's wonderful to be yeah, your lover

Of all the lies we shared
This one will find us out in the end
Of all the ways to care
Cherish this, cherish this my friends

Yes, it's wonderful to be friends and lovers
Yes, it's wonderful to be yeah, your lover
Yes, it's wonderful to be friends and lovers
Yes, it's wonderful to be yeah, your lover

Your time will take us there
Your time will take us there

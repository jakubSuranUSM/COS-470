I had a lust. I had a firecracker
I had a love for the sound of this world
I'm still in love its just a stab at laughter
It?s just a mark of the people we are
But don?t be daft no it?s just a monkey business
They?re running signs no remainders of sins
We dealing abstract no pain and no deliverance.
This is a punch I'm not punching up against
Oh, Its all just mirrors laugh and smoke
We are living in some tiny joke
And I'm here to show my love, ambition, dedication out to 

Kick the wall smash the lights, ricochets burning up
Firecracker
Firecracker
I will not complain at all
I will never be tricked by you.
No No No
I will never be tricked by you.

I never thought that I would be this ugly
I never thought I would be biting that hand
Defeats the math, this spits the seeds of money
I'm just a shell, I'm a sensitive man
We make a choice to unfold a tiny secret
Put it in lights for the grunt of this place
Is it the same thing to write it as to think it?
I'm chopping noses just to ruin my face.
Break down on the record company
Did you turn you back on me? Or did I turn myself against myself?

I will kick the walls smash the lights, ricochets burning up
Firecracker
Firecracker
I will not complain at all
I will never be tricked by you.
No No No
I will never be tricked by you.

I'm still in love
I set the love in motion
I stare at love with the future we planned
Tell me you feel, this ain't complete emotion
I'm still in love with you baby I am
Oh, did you turn your back on me? 
Or did I turn myself against myself?

I'll will kick the walls, smash the lights, ricochets burning up
Firecracker
Firecracker
I will not complain at all
I will never be tricked by you.
No No No
I will never be tricked by you

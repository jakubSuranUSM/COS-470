Then when a breeze blows
Goes a guest to my glass
Its the bare dazing dust
Trust in tensile force
The source of resistance has always been given
Certainly take the hardness of a willow tree
It is concealed in the nature of things
Cheerful dancing feet
Meet the surface of earth
With a spring so strong
Long ago the same
The fame of all matter created by God
Why do I have to wonder when a chair replies
It is concealed in the nature of things
Feel the charm of you the chain will be bound
Weakness by sweetness, oh
Where are you tonight, the moon is round
Clear cloudless sky, and then well see
See the sun constantly run
In a circle

Heart over mind, yes I'm
My father's son
I live my life, just like
My father's done
If he'd told me, one day
That somebody'd have my heart in chains
Would I believe it, no way
Made up my mind I'd never fall that way

But tell me why
Every time I try, to tell you it's goodbye
I can't seem to let go
In my heart I know I want to stay
What I'm trying to say

Heart over mind
Yes I'm my father's son
Yes I'm inclined to do
As my fathers done

Here I am with you
And I know that it's true
Despite all the feelings
Your putting me through
I try to walk away, something makes me stay

Heart over mind, yes I'm
My father's son
I live my life, just like
My father's done
But tell me why
Every time I try, to tell you it's goodbye
I can't seem to let go
In my heart, I know I want to stay, never run away

My father's son
I live my life, as my father's done
If he'd told me, one day
That somebody would have my heart in
Chains would I believe it, no way
Made up my mind, I'd never fall that way
But it's heart over mind, yes I'm my father's son

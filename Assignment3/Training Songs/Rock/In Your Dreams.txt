Kiss your face
Turn your cheek
Lay your head down
Lay your head down

Lay your head down
Lay your head down

Don't say nothing, no
I can see when you're lying oh
When you're alone, you're so alone
When you're alone, you're so alone

We all have dreams we forget
We all have dreams we forget
When you're alone, you're so alone
When you're alone, you're so alone

Now you want to go where no one is lonely
And rose water drips from my mouth like honey oh oh oh

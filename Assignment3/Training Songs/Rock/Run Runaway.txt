Hey now

I love black and white dreaming of black and white
You love black and white run runaway

See chameleon lying there in the sun 
All thinks to everyone run runaway, hey

If you're in the swing all here and everything
If you're in the swing run runaway

See chameleon lying there in the sun 
All thinks to everyone run runaway ho

If you've got a crush don't beat about the bush
When I've got a crush run runaway

See chameleon lying there in the sun 
All thinks to everyone run runaway woah

Hey yeah

Woah 

Oh now can't you wait love don't come on a plate
Oh now can't you wait run run away 

See the chameleon lying there in the sun 
All things to everyone run run away woah

(Run run away)

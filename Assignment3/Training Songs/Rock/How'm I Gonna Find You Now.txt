I've got a cup of black coffee so I don't get lazy
I've got a rattle in the dashboard driving me crazy
And if I hit it with my fist it'll quit for a little while
Gonna have to stop and take a piss in another mile
Headed into town gonna meet you at the mercantile
Take it to the Sonic get you grinning like a crocodile

I got a hole in the floorboard sucking in fumes
I'll leave the hitchhiker standing 'cause I haven't got room
Well he looked kinda scary so I didn't like him anyway
Could've been a con from the state prison runaway
Anyway he probably hadn't showered in a couple days
No one but a fool would've given him the time of day, yeah

Just listen close I'll tell you how I feel
You need to know so I'll talk slow
I always keep it real

I see the red light blinking in the middle of town
But I don't see your car parked anywhere around
And I'm smoking into town like a molotov cocktail
Rag in the gas cap flapping loose never fails
Cell phone's down 'cause they didn't get the check I mailed
How'm I gonna find you now
How'm I gonna find you now

I remember when I met you I's in love in one fell swoop
You had a blade in your pocket and a rag in your belt loop
Guys hovering 'round the bar like gulls on the ocean 
At the end of your shift just in case you got the notion
Watch you washin' all the glassware, poetry in motion
I'd a'roped the moon for you
How'm I gonna find you now
How'm I gonna find you now

Just listen close I'll tell you how I feel
You need to know so I'll talk slow
I won't let go of this obsessive zeal 

I've got a mad coming on and it's gonna be dreadful 
Now I'm washing down my blood pressure pill with a Red Bull
I hit the city limit sign and I'm blind and I'm seeing red
Uniroyal tire on the right rear throwing tread
You oughta see the x-rated scene running in my head
Big as a baby's arm
How'm I gonna find you now
How'm I gonna find you now

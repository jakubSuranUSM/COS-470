If you want to die
Go on and commit suicide
You want to live I know
You gotta get em by the throat
If you want to die
Go on, keep committing suicide
You want to live don't you?
Well I do too

But you don't know, don't know she cares
If you say so, but it's not quite fair

So anyway, anyway she'll leave me alone
So anyway, you said so yourself so no

You two decide
Choose when if you want to stay alive
Keep yourself in my eye
Don't say that you cannot see inside

You want to die
Go on commit suicide
You want to live don't you?
Well I do too

But you don't know,and I don't know she cares
And she said so, but she's not quite there

I said anyway, anyway you leave me alone
Anyway you said so yourself so no

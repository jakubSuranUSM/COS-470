She sold herself on the one love
The one that most of us live without
And dressed for the occasion day after day
Forgives herself when it don't come

I have always found it
Easier to dream about it
Careful of the stitches
Insisted there was more than this

But I lost myself I cannot speak
To live by myself I'm far too weak
I have lost myself I cannot sleep
To live by myself I'm far too meek

Went bold as hell for the one love
The one that most of us read about
And caressed all the persuaders day after day
Relieves herself when it don't come

By the things your saying
It's easier to turn the blame in
Careful of the stitches
Insisted there was more than this

But I lost myself I cannot speak
To live by myself I'm far too weak
I have lost myself I cannot sleep
To live by myself I'm far too meek

She's sold again on the one love
The one that all of them scream about
She's broke her wings on the one love
Her heart so warm but it's burn she wants

I have always found it
Easier to skirt around it
Careful of the stitches
Insisted there was more than this

But I lost myself I cannot speak
To live by myself I'm far too weak
I have lost myself I cannot sleep
To live by myself I'm far too meek

You had the model touch
I was your secret fool
Through all the wasted words
I'd see you cutting through
Shades drawn tight against this man
I was lip-syncing rhythm
I'd no master plan

[Chorus:]
There's a light in your heart
There's a shadow in the shade of your eyes
There's a place we can go after dark
In between a truth and a lie
And it's lit by the light in your heart
The light in your heart
You had the coolest hand
I began to shake
In and out of doubt
A better world took shape
But if I fall sometime at your feet
Let me dream in your footsteps
Walk in your sleep

[Chorus:]

There's a light in your heart
There's a shadow in the shade of your eyes
There's a place we can go after dark
In between a truth and a lie
And it's lit by the light in your heart
The light in your heart
I'm no greenlight to something better
Just old news when the dust settles down
I'll be no blues I'll be here for you
Keeping my part together

[Chorus:]

There's a light in your heart
There's a shadow in the shade of your eyes
There's a place we can go after dark
In between a truth and a lie
And it's lit by the light in your heart
The light in your heart

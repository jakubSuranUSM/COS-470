Hello

Come in and get yourself something to drink
And tell me something I don't know about you
I'll tell you something 'bout me

Does it feel right
Like penetrating insight
Or blinded by the cuckoo with the hiccups
It's tricky to decide

I think I'm coming round, I'm seeing through the smoke
I think I'm coming round, I'm feeling signs of hope
Some water, some whiskey, some cigarettes or dope
I think I'm coming round, can you help me up to cope?

(Ooh, yeah yeah)
(Ooh, yeah yeah)
(Ooh, yeah yeah)
(Ooh, yeah yeah)

We're trapped in
Undergoing modernist sins
The probe cannot be driven through the kneecap
The kneecap will prevail here

So keep trying, prevent yourself from crying
You're shaking hyperventilated mish-mash
Made entirely out of bones

I think I'm coming round, I'm seeing through the smoke
I think I'm coming round, I'm feeling signs of hope
Some water, some whiskey, some cigarettes or dope
I think I'm coming round, can you help me up to cope?

I've been thinking one thing but doing something else in a daze, yeah
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight

I've been thinking one thing but doing something else in a daze, yeah
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight

The peace pipe
Is flying round the bat's head
The hippies will be camping out tonight (Kum bye ah, my lord)
Singing Hari Kari (Adikhari)

And right now it's cooking up a storm now
It's intravenous terror en masse
Your spaceship has arrived (please get in)

I've been thinking one thing but doing something else in a daze, yeah
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight

I've been thinking one thing but doing something else in a daze, yeah
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight

I've been thinking one thing but doing something else in a daze, yeah
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight
I'm trying to keep from getting uptight

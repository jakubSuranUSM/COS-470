If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way
If this isn't love well then maybe I'm wrong
But why do I lie away all night and dream all day along?

If I didn't care (honey child If I didn't care) would it be the same (would it be the same)
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare
Darling, would it be true if I didn't care for you?

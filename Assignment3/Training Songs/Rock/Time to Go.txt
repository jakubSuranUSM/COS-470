[Chorus]
Go! Go! Black and gold! 
Old-time hockey, bar the door 
Clear the track it's all-out war 
Light the lamp, throw a hit 
Black and gold never quit 
The barn is full, our team's in town 
So put 'em up boys, knock 'em down 
Drop the puck, it's time to go 

Bust outta work, it's quarter-past five 
Time to round up the gang 
and take the Red to the Orange line 
Head for the street and the Causeway crowd 
You can feel it in the air, when the team's in town 

[Chorus]

Rancourt's ready, it's time to take to the ice 
So tie down the jersey 'cause it could get ugly tonight 
Top corner, five hole, off the post and in 
On a quest for the cup, and we're ready to win 

[Chorus]

Go! Go! Black and gold! 

Drop the puck, it's time to go

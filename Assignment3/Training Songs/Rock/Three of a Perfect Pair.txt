She is susceptible
He is impossible
They have their cross to share
Three of a perfect pair
He has his contradicting views
She has her cyclothymic moods
They make a study in despair
Three of a perfect pair

One, one too many
Schizophrenic tendencies
Keeps it complicated
Keeps it aggravated
And full of this hopelessness
What a perfect mess

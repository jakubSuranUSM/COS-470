I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
Because I never had a love as true 

Your kiss is so sweet 
Honey your love is light 
Your kiss is so sweet 
Honey your love is light 
Come on and love me 
Honey love me tonight 

I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
Because I know 
I know your love is true 

I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
I wanna be loved 
But by only you 
Because I never had a love as true

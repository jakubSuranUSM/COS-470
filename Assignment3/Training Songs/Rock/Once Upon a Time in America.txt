Sometimes its hard to be there,
Sometimes its hard to lie,
'Cause I've seen right through the country,
And through the all-seein' eye,
And through the all-seein' eye. 

Oh there was a man he sang so pretty,
He loved me for two thousand years,
Why'd he come to New York City?
Once upon a time in America,
Once upon a time in America. 

He said, "you all come back again",
He said "Its hard to see",
We belong to all God's countries,
Once upon a time in America,
Once upon a time in America. 

They found a piece of paradise,
And built a city there,
Didn't want to see the future,
Once upon a time in America,
Once upon a time in America. 

He said you'd all come back again,
This is the land of the free!
We longed to walk God's countries,
Once upon a time in America,
Once upon a time in America. 

[Repeat: x3]
Once upon a time in America 

He said you'd all come back again,
This is the land of the free!
We longed to walk God's countries

Once upon a time in America
Once upon a time in America
Once upon a time in America
Once upon a time in America

Believe it or not I feel a bit jaded
See lately I live on the edge
To feel I'm alive yeah

You give me the best
And then you're letting me go
Somewhere in the trenches
There's a pot of gold

Feel like a ship that sailed
Across the ocean
I wanna know
Where in the gray, the good
And bad is the answer after all

I wanna know
And can we mend
The pieces once they've broken
I wanna know
While we use the past the looking back
As a crutch to break the fall
I wanna know

I've played all my aces
But I'm still here waiting oh yeah
My conscious is bruised
From bumps in the ride, yeah

Been given the best
But then they're letting me go
Seems like everybody's
Swaying to and fro

Feel like a ship that sailed
Across the ocean
I wanna know
Where in the gray, the good
And bad is the answer after all

I wanna know
And can we mend
The pieces once they've broken
I wanna know
While we use the past the looking
Back as a crutch to break the fall
I wanna know

Excerpt from 'You'

Little baby you're the only one
That's there to save me when I come undone
Oh I long to hear the words you say
And wait here night and day no matter where you are
Oh my life I know will be complete
As long as there's we and it's because you understand me

Baby you, you were the one they sent for me yeah
(You are the one they sent for me)
You were the one they sent for me yeah
(You are the one who sent for me)

'I Wanna Know' continued

Feel like a ship that sailed
Across the ocean
I wanna know
Where in the gray, the good
And bad is the answer after all

I wanna know
And can we mend
The pieces once they've broken
I wanna know
While we use the past the looking
Back as a crutch to break the fall
I wanna know

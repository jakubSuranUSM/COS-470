Turning star projections, voices from the deep
Throbbing of the engines, you exit from the heat
Paper on the pavement, cars crawling in the road
Emotions of the city, you ease your heavy load

Motorway City, well it ain't the same
Lighting up the night sky, with an orange flame
Motorway City, you exit on the right
Cruising on the highway, driving through the night

Motorway City, well it ain't the same
Lighting up the night sky, with an orange flame

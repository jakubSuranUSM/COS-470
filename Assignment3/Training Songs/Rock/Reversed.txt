I got a one way ticket and I'm planning on comin' back
I got body full of kicks and I'm heading right for the sack
I got some bad-ass speakers playing Miles in a silent way
I gonna say my good byes and I?ll turn right round and stay

I got a one way ticket and I'm planning on comin' back
I got body full of kicks and I'm heading right for the sack

'Cause I'll go where I don't wanna go
(Yeah I?ll go)
And I know when I don't know how
(I know)
I?ll smile with a tear in my eye
(I?ll cry)
And I?ll stay when I say good bye

But you know it?s night when the morning comes to my heart
Then you know it?s over when it?s time for me to start
Yeah, I?ll start the clock when you go across the finishing line
And I?ll turn it left on the right turn, turn off sign

Yes, I?ll go where I don't wanna go
(Yeah I?ll go)
And I know when I don't know how
(I know)
I?ll smile with a tear in my eye
(I?ll cry)
And I?ll stay when I say good bye, good bye

When I say goodbye
When I say goodbye
When I say goodbye

I?ll go where I don't wanna go
(Yeah, I?ll go)
And I know when I don't know how
(I know)
I?ll smile with a tear in my eye
(I?ll cry)
And I?ll stay when I say good bye

I?ll go where I don't wanna go
(Yeah, I?ll go)
And I know when I don't know how
(I know)
I?ll smile with a tear in my eye
(I?ll cry)
And I?ll stay when I say good bye

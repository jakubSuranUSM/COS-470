Swinging 'round in circles, looking for the way
Fleeing from the time when she wanted me to stay
My world's swirling round, this time I know it well
Our love is coming down again

Then I realize inside me, I've had myself all wrong
This time I know for certain, I've never been that strong
The moment you remember, those times you stop to think
Our love will come undone again

But with demons sitting at my side
An angel's come to ask me why
And slowly I give up inside to say
To feel alive, I'd give it all away

Destructive words to make it so
But none of this is you, you know

Another year, another week
Another sets of summer sheets
Another, well we should hang out again soon
Another drink, another kiss

And with demons sitting at my side
Another angel asks me why
And it doesn't takes too much to say
To feel alive, I'd give it all away

Destructive words to make it so
But none of this is you, you know

Again, and again and again

She's sitting at my side
An angel's come to ask me why
And it takes nothing to say
To feel alive, I'll give it all away

I'll give it all away, I'll give it all away

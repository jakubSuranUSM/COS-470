Now thinkin'
Makes your head spin
The nights are long
The days are gone
And you don't know
What place you're in

And it's now
And it's a shame
And your so broke
And incomplete
That you don't know
Night from day

'Cause you've been drinkin'
At the No Hope bar
Your so drunk
It's sad to see
You don't know
Who you are

You don't know your way home
You don't know your way home
You don't know your way home
...

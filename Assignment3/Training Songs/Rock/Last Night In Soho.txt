You came into my life like rain upon a barren desert
One smile and I was born again
I felt sure it wasn't too late
I'd find strength to make me go straight
I had love and threw it away
Why did they lead me astray?
For last night in Soho I let my life go

I never told you of some things I've done I'm so ashamed of
I thought my foolish past was over and done
I felt sure I'd make a new start
I tried with all of my heart
I had dreams and broke them in two
I'm just not worth of you!
For last night in Soho I let my life go

Well, hi there, kid you ain't been around for quite some little while
See you got yourself a real cute doll you're living in style
But boy don't get above your station
If you don't want aggravation
Got a little job for you
This is what you gotta do, boy!

That's how last night in Soho I let my life go

Don't cry my baby as they lead me where no love can help me
Don't stay around to watch me go
Just forget there once was a time
You were proud to call yourself mine
I had love right here in my hand
Why could I not understand?
For last night in Soho I let my life go
For last night in Soho I let my life go

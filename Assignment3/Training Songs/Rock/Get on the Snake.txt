Hey
Uh
Ah ah 
Ah ah
Get on the snake with a swarm of motor fly's
Get on the snake under the cola colored sky

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean

Get on the snake where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake where you never will believe

Hey baby, what's your disease
My hearts bleeding 
I'm dying to leave
Dying to leave
I'm dying to leave
Leave

Get on the snake where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake with a suicide machine

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean

Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean

Well, I'm goin' to a place where the tough guys go
And come out even tougher.
A place where a man don't show his feelings,
A place where a man don't cry.

Well they say I'm being punished
And they say I can be reformed
But some day I'll return.
Did they really think that

This time it would work.
You knew all along it wouldn't

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm prison bound
I did a crime one too many times.
It's on the outskirts of town, by the railroad tracks
Where the country moon shines.
Oh, I'm prison bound
Tell my girl I'll be back one day.
Oh, I'm prison bound
I may never know any other way.

Well, they take away my freedom of expression or action
Johnny says I'll walk the line
With three hots and a cot

And a lot of talk
With lock-up, concrete, and steel.
Well it's cold and it's clammy
Man, it's colder than a pimp's heart

But I've gotta do my time
There's a lesson to be learned here
But what a price to pay.
You know, I may never learn-

[Chorus]

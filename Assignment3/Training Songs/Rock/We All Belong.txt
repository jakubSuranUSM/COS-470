Sitting here
I am very far away
Looking back, on yesterday
And it won't be long before
We all belong
Cause all the time that's left to kill
Is drawing out its' final will

Lady luck
She is always by my side
She woke me up
When I died
Taking me higher and higher
Just above the line of fire
Cause time and time and time again I'm shown
That I have never been alone at all

We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong

My old man
He is always on the run
He is the moon
And I'm the sun
We don't belong to the earth
We both belong to the sky
Mother me told me don't you cry
Stay at home or learn to fly
Oh my

We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong
We all belong

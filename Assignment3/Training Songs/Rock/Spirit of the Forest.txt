He never speaks
But he understands
Thinks higher than a man
He's living in

The northern lights
In winter everlasting
He travels around
Big drum in his hand

And he knows
What you have in your mind
There's always wolf within
That leads him down
And back home

Spirit, spirit of the forest
Hiding in those northern lights
Spirit, spirit of the forest
Hiding in those northern lights

He has long waited
For the right moment
Storm of colors
Rages in the sky

Beware, never whistle
To the northern lights
Or it curses you
To the woods of evernight

There's only one
Who can really sets you free
And it's spirit of the forrest's
Old white wolf

But it hard to track
You'll never found footsteps
It will find you
If you are really blessed

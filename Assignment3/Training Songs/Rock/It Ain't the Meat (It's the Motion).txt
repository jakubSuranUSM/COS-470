It ain't the meat it's the motion
That makes your daddy wanna rock
It ain't the meat it's the motion
It's the movement it isn't the stock 

Well, I got a girl that's so darn thin
there ain't much of her but bones and skin
one thing about her I can understand
she wraps all around me like a rubber band, baby 

It ain't the meat it's the motion
That makes your daddy wanna rock
It ain't the meat it's the motion
It's the movement it isn't the stock 

Well, I want a girl who's built real fat
Kenny don't like to see ‘em like that
But I like to see ‘em big and tall
The bigger the come the harder they fall 

It ain't the meat it's the motion
That makes your daddy wanna rock
It ain't the meat it's the motion
It's the movement it isn't the stock 

Well, I want someone who feels like they got to have love
Love to look at the stars above
My little baby, I want you to know
She'll bring me home all of her dough 

It ain't the meat it's the motion
It ain't the meat, uhm uhm uhm
It ain't the meat, I say the action
That makes your daddy wanna rock 

Bring it down one time
It ain't the meat it's the motion
It ain't the meat, I say the movement, girl
It ain't the meat, it's the action
That makes your daddy wanna rock

Everyone living in ghost town
Everyone buried in waste land
We don't want to
We don't have to be like that
Living in ghost town
All the boys shout it out loud now
All the girls scream it out louder
We don't want to
We don't have to live like that

[Chorus]
Hold me back you know were never gonna back down
Hold me back you know were never gonna back down
Were dead in this ghost town
You better let go so let go of me
Were dead in this ghost town
You better let go so let go let go of me
Let go let go of me
Let go let go of me

Everyone living in ghost town
Everyone buried in waste land
We don't want to
We don't have to be like that
Living in ghost town
All the boys shout it out loud now
All the girls scream it out louder
We don't want to
We don't have to live like that

[Chorus]

It's nearly over, the last train is near
And it's leaving behind those tears
These are the bad lands
The worst place to fear
Making place for the ones we left here
They're calling calling
To say goodbye

[Repeat: x2]
Were dead in this ghost town
You better let go so let go of me
Were dead in this ghost town
You better let go so let go let go of me

Let go let go of me
Let go let go of me

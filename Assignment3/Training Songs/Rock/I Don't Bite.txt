There isn't anything to talk about
You know I don't mean harm
I really don't mean anything at all
If we both understand what's going on
It's pretty clear we'll get along
It's pretty clear we'll get it

I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)
I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)

This isn't quite what I was counting on.
I wish I knew just what you want
I wish I knew anything at all
I taught the point here was to have some fun
I only wanna get it done
I only wanna get it

I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)
I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)

I don't mean anything
I don't mean anything

I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)
I don't bite but you can't believe it
(You can't believe it)

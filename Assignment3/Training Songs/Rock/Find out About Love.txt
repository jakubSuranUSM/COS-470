Turn me loose from all this madness
Cause the situation changes day to day
I been searchin' the world to find the answer
I just got to find some time to slip away

[Chorus]
I feel up, I feel down
I feel there's no use in hangin' around
I just got to get back on my feet
Find out about love
Where has love taken me?
Where will love lead me to?
So many questions, I gotta find out
Here it comes

There are times when friends are strangers
And I've got to find myself a hidin' place
If you think you can help me, here's my number
I'll be hidin' out where no one knows my face

[Chorus]

I feel up, I feel down
I feel there's no use in hangin' around
I just got to get back on my feet
I just got to get back on my feet
I just got to get back on my feet
Find out about love
Where has love taken me?
Where will love lead me to?
So many questions, I gotta find out
Here it comes, I gotta find out, here it comes

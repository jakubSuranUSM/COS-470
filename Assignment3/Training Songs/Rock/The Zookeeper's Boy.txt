Are you my lady, are you?

If I don't make it back from the city
Then it is only because I am drawn away
For you see
Evidently there's a dark storm come
And the chain on my swing is squeeking like a mouse

So are you my lady, are you?
The rain, the rain, the rain is falling down
The cars remain

You're tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

In a submersible I can hardly breathe
As it takes me inside, so the light sings
Answer me truthfully
Do the clouds kiss you
With meringue-coloured hair
I know they cannot

So are you my lady, are you?
The rain, the rain, the rain is falling down
The cars remain

Santa Ana winds bring seasickness
Zookeeper hear me out
How dare you go?
Cold in the rain

Tall just like a giraffe
You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

Are you my lady, are you?
The rain, the rain, the rain is falling down
The cars remain
I could not be seen with you
Working half the time and looking fine
In cars re-made

Of all the airts the wind can blaw 
I dearly like the west 
For there the bonnie Lassie lives 
The Lassie I love best 
There's wild-woods grow, and rivers row 
And many a hill between 
But day and night my fancy's flight 
Is ever way my Jean 

I see her in the Dewy flowers 
I see her sweet and fair 
I hear her in the tuneful birds 
I hear her charm the air 
There's not a bonnie flower, that springs
By a fountain, shaw, or green 
There's not a bonnie bird that sings 
But minds me oâ€š my Jean

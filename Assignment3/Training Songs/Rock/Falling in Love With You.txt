When I'm close to you, I feel my heartbeat
telling me that you're the one for me.
Darling, I don't understand the reasons,
I just know that this was meant to be.
And when I look into your eyes I see it,
everything that I've been searchin' for.
Darlin', I don't understand this feeling,
I just know it's growing more and more.
Because I'm falling in love with you.
It's the easiest thing for me to do.
Yes, I'm falling in love with you, it's true.
I lie awake at night and think about you.
I wake up to another lonely day.
I know you'll never feel this way about me,
no matter what I do or say.
And I'm falling in love with you.
It's the easiest thing for me to do.
Yes, I'm falling in love with you, with you.
You say you're not the one for me,
that I am just a dreamer.
I've tried so hard to make you see
that someone like you
could make my dreams come true.
Because I'm falling in love with you.
It's the easiest thing for me to do.
Yes, I'm falling in love with you.
It's the easiest thing for me to do.
(falling) Yes, I'm falling.
(falling) Mmm yes, I'm falling in love with you.
(falling) Falling, I'm falling, I'm falling.
(falling) Falling in love with you.
(falling) Ooh, I'm falling in love.

ABC - stick to me
Soul to soul, stay on eye to eye
Maybe God will be good to me
I've never sinned
Maybe I should try

Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
Never gonna beg, never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect, my love is real

Go to war - what a drag
A love of hate is really not the way
Light a flame or go to sleep
The time is right to celebrate or die
Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna beg I'm never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect, my love is real

It's because your heart
Will never lie, never cry, never sigh, never die
It's because your heart
Digs deep, holes tight
Oh yeah
I see the lie

ABC - stick to me
Soul to soul, stay on eye to eye
Well maybe God will be good to me
I've never sinned maybe I should try

Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
I'm Never gonna beg
I'm Never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect
My love is real
Your heart is perfect
My love is real

My love is real X 12

I am you
You are ready 
Like my heart
To be true

I will stay 
You have all 
I smith hold you 
In a way 
Is nothing else to do

The frost is slowly falling 
And my heart it's calling you 
Ice is slowly melting away 
Let's forget all the things that we say
I am you
You are ready 
Like my heart 
To be true

All the feathers in your hair 
We are young 
But We are older 
With the light we've became 
In this room

Let's forget all the thinghs that we say
Please 
I am safe, please 
There's nothing I'd rather do
I'm certainly, I'm certainly 
And there's no one else but you

Let's forget all the things that we say
Please 
I am safe, please 
There's nothing I'd rather do
I'm certainly, I'm certainly 
And there's no one else but you

Let's forget all the things that we say

Keep your secrets in the dark
Nothing matters anymore
Body's breaking, drive me crazy
This is not your place
No, this is not your playground it's my heart
We were stupid, we got caught
Nothing matters anymore
So what? Here we are Juggernaut

Courage broken lash the scars
Could this love be what I want?
Body's breaking, driving me crazy
It's too broke

We were stupid we got caught
Nothing matters anymore
So what, here we are Juggernaut

Juggernaut

So let's hang up some anger
We'll bury our burdens in blood
So hang up some anger
We'll bury our burdens in blood
We grow stronger Juggernaut

Answer me
"Did we take this too far?"
You've given all I could need
"Did we take this too far?"
Oh but your kiss won't leave me
"Did we take this too far?"
Cause your teardrops won't stop, chewing out my heart

We were stupid we got caught
Nothing matters anymore
So what? Here we are Juggernaut
Here we are Juggernaut
We are Juggernaut

Why, why, why?

I want you to listen to me baby
I got a lot of things on my mind
Listen to me baby 
I got a lot of things on my mind
Take a short look back 
Just see what the hell we find

Now you can run high and low
Do what the hell you please
Run high, low, 
Do what the hell you please
I got news for you baby, 
Gone like the cool cool breeze

Well, Saddle Up
Turn it loose
Saddle up baby
And won't you turn it loose
I tried my best to stop you
Honey it ain't no use

With a cold wind blowin
In through my back door
Ice cold wind blowin 
In through my back door
You keep telling everybody
You ain't mine no more

Saddle up
Turn it loose
Saddle up baby
And won't you turn it loose
I tried my best to stop you
Honey it ain't no use

Give me a brand new pony
Man you want to see us ride
Give me a brand new pony
Man you want to see us ride
She keep her daddy happy 
But you sure keep us satisfied

Saddle up
Turn it loose
Saddle up baby, baby, baby
I tried my best to stop you
Honey it ain't no use

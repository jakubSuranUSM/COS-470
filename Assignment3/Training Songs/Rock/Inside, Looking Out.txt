Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Servin' my time an' doin' the best I can
A walls and bars they're surroundin' me
But I don't want your sympathy, yeah

Oh baby, oh baby, I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up be my rebirth
Like I was worth on God's green earth
My rebirth, my rebirth
Baby, yeah, I mean it's my rebirth, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, come on 

Ice cold waters runnin' in my brain
Then they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
From livin' daily with those canvas bands

Folks that feed 'em, they're drivin' me wild
And I'll be happy like a newborn child
We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls keep your love from me

Yeah, can't you feel my love, baby - baby
Baby - baby - I need you - baby - squeeze you - baby
I love no - baby - body but - baby - nobody but - baby - you girl baby
I love you - baby - I need you, alright

I said, everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say
Just listen, baby, I tell you
Can't you feel my love and can't you see my sweet love
Can't you hear my love, it's getting louder
It's getting louder, a little closer, yeah

I said baby - baby - I need you - baby - oh - baby
Squeeze - baby - please - baby - love - baby
I love you - baby - I need you - baby - yeah, yeah, right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't have you, baby
But I'll be home soon, I'll be home soon, yeah
Alright, woooh

Oh god how fun to be the one, 
I'm so sad to say 
you're nice and all, 
But you're too tall, 
I have to go now 

It always happens to me, always 
They feel attracted to me, Shorty 
Always, they say 

If you go, I go with you 
If you stay, I'll wait 
If you don't know, 
I consider this a date 

I stayed and she waited for me, 
No chance to get away 
I tried to think, 
Another drink, might help me 

It always happens to me, always 
They feel attracted to me, Shorty 
Always, they say 

If you go, I go with you 
If you stay, I'll wait 
If you don't know, 
I consider this a date

Stuck in the bar, 
I couldn't get far, 
She was still there smiling 
"It's not me being tall, it's you, 
You're small, I like that" 

It always happens to me, always 
They feel attracted to me, Shorty 
Always, they say 

If you go, I go with you 
If you stay, I'll wait 
If you don't know, 
I consider this a date

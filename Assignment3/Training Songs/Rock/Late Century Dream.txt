Well you never did like the way the road stretched out
Never knowing where all these oily black threads are tied
Under the lights of a spaceship landed
On the ice of a curve unsanded

There's a clover leaf
That'll wreck your life
And everybody lives in a knot
Everybody lives in a knot

Everybody's trying to make space around what they think they've got
Everybody lives in a knot
Everybody lives in a knot
Everybody's trying to make space around what they think they've got

It was never better
It was never any better
But a nation is not soothed
When they tell her

And the doctors all look shocked
But everybody grows up weened on some sick late century dream
Or the happy face on a shirt smiling "shop till you drop," yeah
Everybody lives in a knot 

Everybody lives in a knot 
Everybody's trying to make space around what they think they've got
Everybody's trying to hold on to a dream even as they watch it rot
Ta da da da

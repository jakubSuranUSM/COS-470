I can taste the sweet smell of success on your breath
And I know where it came from,
No need for chewing gum,

I saw her today you know, she`s filling up with ammo... 
(la la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

Here we are again 

She was always wide,
Now it`s drinking her out from the inside,

He filled her with champagne, got a tattoo, forgot her name...
(la la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

In the car again.
Now her kisses, full at first,
Ache like blisters waiting to get burst

She is alone, he`s been here but know he`s gone... 
(la la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

She`s alone again

Stunted by our early growth,

We`re stunted you and I, Stunted we are both

Drum / Clap break

La la la la la la la la la la la la etc...

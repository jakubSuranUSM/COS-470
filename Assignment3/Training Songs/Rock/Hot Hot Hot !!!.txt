The first time I saw lightning strike
I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning and I never went back

The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater and I never went back

Hey hey hey
Well I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey
Yes I'm jumping like a jumping jack
I'm dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fever feeling
Hot hot hot

The third time I saw lightning strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around and then left me for dead
For a second that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire and I never went back

Hey hey hey
Well I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey
Yes I'm jumping like a jumping jack
Dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fever feeling
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot, hot hot hot

Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Oh

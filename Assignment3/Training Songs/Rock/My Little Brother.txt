My little Brother just discovered Rock & Roll [Repeat: x 3]
There's a noise in his head and he's out of control.
And yes it frustrates, lets let him make his own mistakes.
See him on the dance floor go now, boy those moves I just don't know how.

My little Brother just discovered Rock & Roll [Repeat: x 3]
He's only 22 and he's out of control.
How's he living? With all of that unforgiving.
See him on the dance floor go now, boy those moves I just don't know how.

My little Brother just discovered Rock and Roll [Repeat: x 3]
He's only 22 and he's out of control.
He no longer likes A-sides, he made me a tape of Bootlegs and b-sides.
And every song on that tape said, every single song said, 

I want our parents to worry about us. All we ever wanted is for our parents to worry about us. 
It's all anybody really wants.

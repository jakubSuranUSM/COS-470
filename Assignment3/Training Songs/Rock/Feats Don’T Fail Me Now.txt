(Yeah, you guys ready to rock? Let's get down!) 
Your daddy says I'm no good 
Your momma says keep away 

I got to tell you truthful girl you can never make me stay 
I got something up and down this coast 
I bet you my last dollar girl I can love your love the most 

Love your love the most 
Don't the sunrise look so pretty 
Never such a sight 
Like a rollin' into New York City 

With the skyline in the morning light 
Roll right through the night 
(Roll) 
Roll right through the night 

(Yeah yeah yeah) 
Semi-smokin mama, you got to give me some 
Heard you got the biggest -- biggest truck in town 
Right on through to Baltimore you got to love me now 

Got to do me gently, well it's feets don't fail me now 
Don't fail me, feets don't fail me now 
Don't the sunrise look so pretty 
Never such a sight 

Like a rollin' into New York City 
With the skyline in the morning light 

Roll right through the night 
Roll right through the night 
Roll right through the night 
Roll right through the night 
You guys really ready to sing - Give It up... 

Roll - Roll

Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll 
Roll - Roll

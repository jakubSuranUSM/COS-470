Everything just right, sugar and old spice
Under the thumb for the last time now
He exits his old cell
There's a priest casting old spells

Then he takes the walk
On his way down, Vinnie turns around
And he says

If you never love then you never live
And that's hell in itself
'Cause we all will be judged
By the love that we give, don't lie to yourself

Those were the old days
Intermittent with old ways
Take the risk with the blame
Even he knew that his old lady's upstate

Does her best just to get straight
Still cries everyday
Now that Vinnie is gone
We carry on and we say

If you never love then you never live
And that's hell in itself
'Cause we all will be judged
By the love that we give, don't lie to yourself

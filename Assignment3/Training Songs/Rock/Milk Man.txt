Milk Man sleeps on the roof in the noon
Bana-na-na stabbed to the arms, weird man
Ooh-la-la

Milk Man sneaks in the house under moon
Miracle words come to a mouth you may hear
Peek-a-boo

Chorus:
Come closer
How beautiful I play sound
Boys and girls
Here I come
I get you to escape night
Boys and girls
Be mine
I'll take you to my dream land
Now you're mine
I'll take you to our dream land

Milk Man smiles to you "Hi" in a nude
"This banana stuck in my arms, oh my love"
Stabbed to the arms, ooh-la-la
Yellow one

Chorus

Boo, boo, the Milk Man
Hi, hi, he's masked man

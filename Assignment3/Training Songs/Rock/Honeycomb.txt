The old churchyard is where I faded
She watched me while I fell unaided
And in my time when god's army came and got me

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

Cherry brown lips of maple
Olive creams her eyes and face were
And in that town as I walk as a deserter

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

Dance for God, dance for mating
The ritual of her figure eighting
And in my mind as I fly above the churchyard

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

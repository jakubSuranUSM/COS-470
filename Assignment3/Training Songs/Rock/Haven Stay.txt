Accepting

The dark evolving me as well
It lingers on from where I can tell
I am yours and yours to blame now

Hell's protecting I want to burn
You and me will never learn
Take a step away from me now, moving closer

Won't you leave it alone darling
Wait for me, wait for me tonight, moving closer

If I'll fall on the way
If I should fall from you
Keep it real haven stay

Stand in line for what it's worth
It's not better so much worse
They can't help me, helpless blue eyes

Heartbeats pushing me aside
Closing in for one last try
The last breath forcing me to tell lies, moving closer

Won't you leave it alone darling
Wait for me, wait for me tonight, moving closer

If I'll fall on the way
If I should fall from you
Keep it real haven stay

Will you beg me to face
If I am able and true
Keep it still haven raze

If I'll fall on the way
If I should fall from you
Keep it real haven stay

Will you beg me to face
If I am able and true
Keep it still haven raze
Moving closer

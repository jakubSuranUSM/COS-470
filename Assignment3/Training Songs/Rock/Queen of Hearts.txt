Have I ever told you 
how good it feels to hold you 
it isn't easy to explain 

and though I'm merely trying 
I think I may start crying 
My heart can't wait another day 
when you touch me I just got to say 

Baby I Love you 
Baby I Love you 
Baby I Love you 
Come on baby Na Na Na Na Na 
Come on baby Na Na Na Na Na 

I can't live without you 
I love everything about you 
I can't help it if I feel this way 

and I'm so glad I found you 
I want my arms around you 
I want to hear you call my name 
tell me baby that you feel the same. 

My heart can't wait another day 
when you touch me I just got to say

And you will heal yourself 
When the rain begins to fall
Feel the fire
Burning inside us all
Remove me
For going in unchained
Blow away for yourself and gather again
And, listen to the conversations of the sea
Inside us all
There's a quiet beach
If we fall into ourselves we will become free
I myself could use a little clarity

'Cause I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way

I am so full of you
I am so full of me
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing

I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way

Then I opened up my mouth
I'm a cloud.
And these words they seldom come out
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
She'd want a cloud that's floating around

But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear
And feel the fury of these tears
As they run down my face
I can feel her so far away

'Cause I am a cloud
And I am so afraid

So don't you come and gather at me in this haze
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze
As she gently melts a little everyday
I blow away remaining unphased

When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise

These motherfuckers stepped on me,
And tried to f*ck me from behind

'Cause I am a cloud
And I am so afraid

I, I am
So full of love

I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way

I am so full of you
I am so full of me
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing

I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way

I am so full of love
Love!

I am so full of love
I am so full of hate
I am so full of love
I am so full of

Take one last look before you leave
'Cause oh, somehow it means so much to me
And if you ever need me, you know just where I'll be
So please call home, if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

I guess I saw it comin', day by day
But oh, I could not stand the failure
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say
Please call home, if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

And I know, that you're used to runnin'
Oh you're lost baby, and I ain't funnin'
But oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come runnin'
Safe to your side, again I'll confide in you

So go ahead on, I won't say no more
My heart ain't in it but I'll hold the door
But just remember what I said before
Please call home, if you change your mind

Please call home, if you change your mind
Please call home, if you change your mind

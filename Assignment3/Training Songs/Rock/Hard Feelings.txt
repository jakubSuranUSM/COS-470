We live in a lie 
The constant lie 
Family of eyes 
Talking about common sense
Coming through the bedroom window
Shine across the ceiling
Can't sleep in the nation of imagination
You can tell by the way I talk

I got hard feelings

Two mirrors in the middle of the world
Passersby thinking modern love
Some sensations are better than others
Some people's love isn't strong enough

We got hard feelings

We want the common desire
The fantasy is a weird dealing
We've been told pleasure kills
But don't get nervous
You can tell
You can tell by the way we walk

We got hard feelings

You can tell by the way I talk
You can tell by the way we walk

We got hard feelings

(Some people's love is strong enough)
We got hard feelings

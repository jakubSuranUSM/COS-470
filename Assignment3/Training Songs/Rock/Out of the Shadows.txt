Out of the shadows
And into the light
Out of the background
And into the fight
Out of the jungles
And back on the streets
Out of the blizzard
And into the heat

Out of the rat race
Into the lagoon
Out of the Stone Age
And onto the moon
Out of the nameless
Onto the front page
Out of the basement
Onto the stage

Out of the rainbow
Into the black
Out of the fox hole
And into the flak
Out of the shelters
Under the bomb, bomb, bomb

Born into simplicity
Such an average Child, you wouldn't think
That His life would bring the greatest change
And by His name, every life would be saved

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

How would you describe a king?
Would he wear a crown and royal things?
Or would he rule the world with a strong hand?
Or give his life for all of man?

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

Wise men came from far away
Following a star to find the way
To the place where Baby Jesus lay
Just to bring Him gifts and give Him praise

Only one could be Savior
Only one could be King

Call Him Emmanuel, they call Him Messiah
The Savior, the Son, He's the King
Born of a Virgin, so pure and so perfect
Forever He's worthy, He's the King
There's nobody greater than my precious Savior
Hosanna, forever to the King

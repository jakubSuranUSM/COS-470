The reason why oh, I can't say I have to let you go, baby and right away
After what you did I can't stay now
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

Baby for a long time (baby for a long time) you had me believe (you had me believe)
That your love was all mine (that your love was all mine) and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know (but I didn't know) that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone, when you're gone

Now I gotta say (I gotta say) that it's not like before (that it's not like before)
And I'm not gonna play your games any more (and I'm not gonna play)
After what you did (after what you did)I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone, oh when you gone,oh when you gone

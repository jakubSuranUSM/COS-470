I found you
By the heel of my shoe
You were hiding
Underneath my sole
You’re my perfect, my perfect little penny
And I will keep you
Till I get old
You’re my perfect, my perfect, my perfect
My perfect little penny
You’re my perfect, my perfect, my perfect
My perfect little penny
So please shine on
I wonder
Will you stay in my pocket?
When I need you
Will you come out for me?
Hope I don’t lose you
Being careless with my spending
I’ve been known to
But that’s gonna change
You’re my perfect, my perfect, my perfect
My perfect little penny
You’re my perfect, my perfect, my perfect
My perfect little penny
So please shine on
Promise I’ll never lose you
Promise I’ll never let you go
You’re my perfect, my perfect, my perfect
My perfect little penny
So please shine on (x6)

Well, tell me woman who you're with tonight
If you're on your own then that's alright
But if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive

In this big city I'm high and dry
I just can't make out though I try
So if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive

Do you have a place where we could go?
Or does your mother want you home?
Don't waste my time I ain't got long
'Cause it's hard to find a woman
When you know, you'll soon be gone

So break the rules and tell me yes
I'll prove to you that love is best
But if you don't want me with you
Don't waste my time with your jive

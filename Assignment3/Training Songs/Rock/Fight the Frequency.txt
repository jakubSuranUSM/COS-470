I remember how you radiate
Chemicals react on acetate
The camera never lies and stole my fate
Now I can't find my way

A lullaby
Race the tide killed his history
We deconstruct the simple lies
And don't know what it means
Signals crossed, meanings lost
Imaginations run
It's black on white, or white on black
We get the damage done

I remember how you radiate
Chemicals react on acetate
The camera never lies and stole my fate
Now I can't find my way
Now I can't find my way

Paper cuts
And darling birds
Debutants debut
We cannot clean, the soft machine
I always thought you knew
If you believe, the worst of me
I'll do the same for you
I'll crush your dreams, if you crush my dreams
It's the least I can do

I remember how you radiate
Chemicals react on acetate
The camera never lies and stole my fate
Now I can't find my way
Now I can't find my way

I won't surrender, but I'll keep on falling
Star crossed we got your alibis
Lay your weapons down and keep on dreaming
Sure shots come with fireflies

I remember how you radiate
Chemicals react on acetate
The camera never lies and stole my fate
I remember how you radiate
Chemicals react on acetate
The camera never lies and stole my fate
Now I can't find my way
Now I can't find my way
Now I can't find my way
Now I can't find my way

Words and music by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen

I spent my life twenty years in the basin
My only friend was a man of much more
He lied with power in his weary eyes 'till day came
And all at once I knew his name

Giles of the riverâ?¦comin' in to make my precious day
Giles of the riverâ?¦comin' in to tell one tale and take
My breath awayâ?¦and he's on his way

He took me down through good times late departed
And through the world as it was and will be
By bad self I watched you as you hung your head out my door
But you won't grieve me no more

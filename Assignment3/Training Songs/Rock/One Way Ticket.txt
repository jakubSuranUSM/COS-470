Call the village band out, bid me good bye
Everybody stand outside and cry
Never thought so many, thought me so dear
I'd be happy any place but here

One way ticket, take me anywhere
North bound, south bound, I don't even care
I know the grass is greener there

People in the city leave you alone
Everyday is pretty much your own
One among the many, year after year
I'd be happy any place but here

One way ticket, take me any where
North bound, south bound, I don't even care
I know the grass is greener there

Look over the passing train and there I am
No matter where I am, I'm passing through

One way ticket, take me anywhere
North bound, south bound, I don't even care
I know the grass is greener there

One way ticket, take me any where
One way ticket, take me any where

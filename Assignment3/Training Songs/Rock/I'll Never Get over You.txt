I'll never get over you
No, I'll never get over you
I just can't keep it a secret anymore
Oh, no, no

It wasn't so long ago
That you told me you loved me so
Then you went and said goodbye
And found another guy, ay, yi, yi, yi

I know, somewhere, someday, I'll find
One love to take your place
One girl with an angel ace
But in the meantime

I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't keep it a secret anymore
Oh, no, no

I know, somewhere, someday, I'll find
One love to take your place
One girl with an angel face
But in the meantime

I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't keep it a secret anymore
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

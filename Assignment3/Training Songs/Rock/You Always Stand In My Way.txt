Hey you
You always stand in my way
You
will you hear to what I say?
I want you to go away

You
You should find another man

I say you
make my face become one
I want you to cut it down

You, you, you
get away 
I can't stand you, 
you, you
I am mad when I see you
you, you you
better hide or clutch your face

You
you come on and change your mind

Say you
You're the one I must cement
and what if I don't want you

You
You always stand in my way

And I said you
Will you hear to what I say
And I want you to go away

You you, you
get away 
I can't stand you, 
you you
 I am mad when I see you
You, you better pack up all your things
and I, I, I feel like chewing so I'm getting mad,
baby
And I said you
you, you always stand in my way
(better not)

You
will you hear to what I say
I want you to go away

You
you should find another man
I said you
make my face become one
I want you to cut it down

you, you, you
got a way I can't stand
you you, you, you
get away 
I can't stand

you
You you you better hide and clutch your face
And I, I, I feel it
You better say
you, you, you

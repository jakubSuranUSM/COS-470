If you listen close you might hear the sound
I would never let you down
I thought you were a man of action
Come on baby, come on give me a little reaction

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

You keep telling me it won’t be long
Well, that’s not right and that’s not wrong
Come on, talk to me baby and don’t be so cold
Your kingdom comes from actions and not from being bold

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

My perception is growing dim
There’s no way to lose and no way to win
I’m not gonna stay down, goodbye to dark days that surround

I don’t wanna lose your love
It’s in my hand, it’s just a question of
If you’re gonna stop messing around
You better hurry up, don’t let me down

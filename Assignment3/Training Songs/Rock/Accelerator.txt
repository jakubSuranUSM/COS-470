You son-of-a-bitch: you'v got no friends,
you'v got no steady job, you'v got no girlfriend
You say I'm cheap.. you're just like me
The answer to the question put to you by me

I'm the driver: I'm in control

I've got no motivation, I don't need friends
All my destinations are leased for my own ends
I only answer to my own mind
This speed is what I need to help me kill some time

I'm the driver: I'm in control

Need to drive, I feel good...
Need to drive, I'm alive...
Accelerate X 4
Need to drive, feel so alive...
Need to drive, keep you alive...

I'm the driver: I've lost control

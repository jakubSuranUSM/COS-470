There you go again
Pretending that the world is blue
And you see red when I explain
That I don't share your point of view
Well I say open up your eyes
For the world is like a rainbow
And maybe blue is just the colour
Of the world inside of you
But that kind of blue world
That's not my world
I don't want to paint your picture
I ain't here to sing your sorrows
Ain't got time to be your hero
I don't want to be your poet

Chorus

Everybody feel the same pain
Everybody doing time
I can't be the one you're needing
I can just be who I am

Who I am
We all want a world
With a perfect constitution
Believe me, we all want it now
Don't want to wait another day
And maybe if this world's to change
It's going to take a revolution
But in the meantime, be my friend
And don't turn your head away
For your kind of blue world
That's not my world
I don't want to paint your picture
I don't want to write your dreams
I ain't here to sing your sorrows
Your blue world is not my scene
Ain't got time to be your hero
You can tell me that's a crime
I don't want to be your poet
Crying out your ancient rhyme

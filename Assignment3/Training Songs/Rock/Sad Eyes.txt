In the morning light I once told you
That I will love you all of my life
Then I noticed that you were asleep
But I told you anyway

You were lying warm and tender
Looking lovely in the light
Then I started to think of what
You mean to me and I held you

You can really open sad eyes
Just like they say you can
You have really open my mind
To see the better man I am

No more looking through sad eyes

And when the morning came
You looked up to me, you took away
My pain when you told me what
Could be, so goodbye sad eyes

You can really open sad eyes
Just like they say you can
You have really opened my mind
To see the better man I am

No more looking through sad eyes
And no mourning 'cause you
Always treated me right, no more
Bringing myself way down

No more looking through sad eyes
Sad eyes, sad eyes, sad eyes, sad eyes

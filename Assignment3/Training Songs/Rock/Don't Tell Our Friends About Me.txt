The older I am, the wiser I'm not
And I felt ashamed of how angry I got
I know I was not getting my message across
I know you can't stand it when that's how I talk
When I summon a duel or when I brandish a thought
I was wrong to turn honesty against you
And sure, some of them could use a good talk

But babe, don't tell all our friends about me
Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

I could sleep on the couch if you want me to
Or I can be a good dog and just sit with you
Do whatever it is that you ask me to do
'Til you forgive me and I forgive you
Yeah, I know you got the beating but I caught a feeling
Frankly, I don't know what else I can confess to you
Lovers may quarrel and spar sometimes, 

But babe, don't tell all our friends about me
Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
But please, baby, don't tell all our friends about me

You said you just needed some time to adjust
It's been 48 hours and 3 weeks and 2 months
Hummingbirds hum and workerbees buzz
You put too much confidence in the people you trust
All the enemies and friends, they'll all tend to judge 
And I'll write songs that'll help me deal with issues, 
And sure, some people may hear too much 

But babe, they don't tell all our friends about us
You know it makes them talk too much
So please, baby, don't tell our friends about me
(All your friends aren't my friends anymore)
Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

Yes, I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
But please, baby, don't tell all our friends about me

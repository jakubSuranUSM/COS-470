This life's not like you wanted it
His eyes I can see again, I need you here
In your mind, nobody's listening
It's alright not to feel again, just breathe again

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
And time after time, I'm going in blind
I don't know which way I need to go

Feels like your world is caving in
And I cry, failing to understand, I wish I can
It's alright if your missing him
In His eyes you can live again, free within

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
And time after time, I'm going in blind
I don't know which way I need to go

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
But time after time, I can't see the signs
I don't know which way I need to go

Do all these roads lead me back to you?
(Count on nothing)
I don't know which way I need to go
(Count on nothing)
Do all these roads lead me back to you?
(Count on nothing)
I don't know which way I need to go
One day, some day

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
And time after time, I'm going in blind
I don't know which way I need to go

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
And time after time, I can't see the signs
Do all these roads lead me back to you?
And time after time
Do all these roads lead me back to you?
One day

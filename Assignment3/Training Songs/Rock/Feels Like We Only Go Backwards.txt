It feels like I only go backwards baby,
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again.
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

I know that you think you've set sail when you call my name
But I get it inside my head all day
When I realize I'm just hopin' onto the hope that
Maybe, your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go,
When trying  so hard to get to something real, it feels

It feels like I only go backwards, darlin',
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

It feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

It feels like I only go backwards, baby,
Every part of me says go ahead,
I've got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
It feels like we only go backwards, darlin'

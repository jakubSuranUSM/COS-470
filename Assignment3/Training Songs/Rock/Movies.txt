Do you go to the movies
Find a friend in a film
Holding hands with the heroes
Fall in love with the heroine?

When you were young and easy
Did you like to take the day off?
Run in the sun and the breeze
And nothing to think of

Do you run to the silence?
Do you hide in the dark?
Do you like to go walking
Alone in the city?

Do the soft things hurt you?
Have you got something to lose?
Because it's only water
Got to let it flow through
Get on up, get into the groove, eh

Do you go to the movies
Find a friend in a film
Holding hands with the heroes
Fall in love with the heroine?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it's true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I think it's you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah can you feel the soul?
Got to be the closest thing to the rock and roll, who!

When you take to thinking heavy
Say you need some medicine, yeah
So it leads to drinking heavy
Do you really need medicine, really need medicine?

Do you go?
Do you go to the movies
Do you find a friend?
Find a friend in a film
Hold hands
Holding hands with the heroes
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love with the heroine?

Do you live?
Do you live by the movies
Find a friend in a film
Do you hold hands?
Holding hands with the heroes
Do you fall in love?
Fall in love with the heroine?

Find a friend
Hold hands
Fall in love
Fall in love, fall in love

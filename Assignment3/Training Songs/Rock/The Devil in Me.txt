I shot John F. Kennedy in Dallas in '63
They blamed it on Oswald carelessly
But it was the devil in me
Put Jesus on the cross, I put a gag on the boss
I kissed him on the cheek so he couldn't speak
But that was the devil in me
It was the devil in me
It's the devil in me that's unleveling me
Put it down to the devil in me

I made you breakfast, put poisoned sheets on the bed
I made you cry, coulda made you laugh instead
But that was the devil in me
So I killed you off, I tore your famous brown fur coat
I laughed at your cough, ignored your suicide note
But that was the devil in me

I blew up the bus, I started world war iii
Hijacked the plane with Qaddafi, blew the hostages free
That was the devil in me
I'm sponsored by a company that I don't believe in
I advertise their things for cash, that ain't deceiving
No, that's just the devil in me
It was the devil in me

I gave you acid rain
I polluted the sea
I covered your thoughts up
With graffiti
You can call me by my real name
Or you can call me humanity
Because it all seems just like human behavior
It all seems like human behavior to me
Put it down to the devil in me

It was the devil in me
It was the devil in me
Well it's the devil in me makes me do these things
Devil in me that makes me sing
Devil in me gave you a wedding ring
Put it down to the devil in me

Waterloo, Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has its day, everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

Now, old Adam was the first in history
With an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where old Adam met his Waterloo

Waterloo, Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has its day, everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

Little General Napoleon of France
Tried to conquer the world, but lost his pants
Met defeat known as Bonaparte's retreat
And that's when Napoleon met his Waterloo

Waterloo, Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has its day, everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

Now, a feller whose darling proved untrue
Took her life, but he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo

Waterloo, Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has its day, everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

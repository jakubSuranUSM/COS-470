Mercy don't think she's pretty no more,
Starin' at the stars through a backscreen door,
She tries and tries to make it all work out,
No matter what she does,
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
You can count on me,

Sometimes she cries,
When shes alone at night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
It just tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries,
Ooh, I wonder why,

Mercy don't have a lover no more,
Plays with her pillow,
Stares at the bedroom floor,
Used to have a million,
They've come and gone,
No matter what she does,
She can't figure out what she's doin' wrong,
In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,

Sometimes she cries,
In the middle of the night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Some times she cries,
Ooh, yeah,

Livin', lovin', given everything you've got,
After all the heartache,
Maybe give it all just one more shot yeah,

In a lonely night,
And in the pourin' rain,
The only thing I really wanna know is why,
Sometimes she cries,
In the middle of the night,
Sometimes she weeps,
When she's feelin' cold and weak,
Sometimes the pain,
Oh, it tears her up inside,
Sometimes she cries

Ladies and gentlemen (Lloyd)
You know I, I love the people
Cause the people love me (ha ha)
That's right, this Young Lloyd
And Uh, this goes out to that special girl
You know who you are (love the people)
Sing to 'em pimpin'
Double L-O-Y-D

I ain't gotta think I know they like me
And I ain't even gotta rock a white T
In them gattas is where you'll find me
Rolled down windows clouds around me
I'm the type that don't even need no ID
Walk up in the club and change VIP
Drinks is on me

Best believe so are you when you leave
Girl I ain't really trying to game ya
But I swear that look familiar
You can find out with these shots of this silver
You saying that you already met me
Your not a groupie so you don't wanna sweat me
I remember your the from Miami (allow me to reintroduce my self)

I be that young, fly, flashy
If they in the slow lane I'm passing
Girl anything that you want just ask me
Call me Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd

I be that young, fly, flashy
With that old school swagga with me
Girl I need you to get real nasty with me
Call me Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd

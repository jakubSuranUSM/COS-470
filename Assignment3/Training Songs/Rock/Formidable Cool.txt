He got's you on your knees with that formidable cool 
Infected you like a disease with her formidable cool 
I know it's all an act, I could practically hear the pen planning
The moment that you meet him, your name shoots up up on the list of the death pool
You'll find it in the seedy setup at a community dance hall
Pink lights flicker, his hands in somebody's knickers 
He only has to look at you twice to claim you his love fool

And I knew it was all an act
I could practically hear the pen planning
Yeah, I knew it was all an act
God never needed another stand-in

Believe in the chorus
Believe in love
Believe in the chorus
Believe in love
Believe in the chorus
Relieve in my touch
I believe in the cause
Believe in love

You listen to his lectures on life
Without one of your own
When he tells you "death is pure"
It reverberates right into your bones
So you ask him for information
On why he once wanted to die
And he gives you satisfaction
In whatever form he loves
To heal the wounds you have
And not to open any more
But thatâ€™s all he fucking did
When he fucked you on the floor

And you knew it was all an act
Then what are you crying for?
Yeah, if you knew it was all an act
Then what are you crying?

What did you think when you saw us?
"Oh, it might be fun"
I believed what he taught us
I believed in love

Believed in the chorus
Relieved in his touch
I hate when he chorused
Believe in us

I can go where I want to 
Be who I want to be now 
I can sleep under water 
Never worried what I'm gonna dream now 

Yeah, the time's come and gone 
And I know where I'm from 
And can be so
It's hasta ma√±ana 
You're on your own banana skin feet now 

Yeah, I've been hung in a bad place 
Had no sun over my face 
I've been hung in a bad place 
For too long 
 
I can say what I want to 
Feel how I want to feel now 
I can squeeze all the hours 
I choose to devour with ease now 

I can sing to the trees 
Tarzan on harmonies for free, yeah 
You've been blocked, and you're stalling 
Nature is calling for me 
You got me!

Yeah, I've been hung in a bad place 
Had no sun over my face 
I've been hung in a bad place 
For too long 

Yeah, I've been hung in a bad place 
Had no sun over my face 
I've been hung in a bad place 
For too long, for too long, for too long
For too long, for too long, for too long
For too long, for too long, for too long

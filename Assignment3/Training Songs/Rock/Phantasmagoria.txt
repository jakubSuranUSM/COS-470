I bet you sometimes wonder
What is standing right behind you
Keep looking over your shoulder to see if it's there
For some the church bell pealing
For some the risk of feeling and stealing
Quietly alone through the night looking under the bed

Don't ring for a taxi
Don't call a policeman
Don't send for a doctor he'll just give you pills
Don't hide in the cellar
Don't ever believe it
It's probably friendly, just alone like you

You run upstairs to lie there
Waiting for the floor to creak and
And something goes bumpity bumpity bump up the stairs
The time has come to wonder
Who the people all look up at
Home ??? but exploring the end of the bed

Don't ring for a taxi
Don't call a policeman
Don't send for a doctor he'll just give you pills
Don't hide in the cellar
You may not believe it
It's probably friendly, just alone like you

So if you get lonely
Just think of the summer
And swimming in sky blue, drift your mind away

So when next time comes
You feel you're being followed by a
Fool with a highly intelligent bear for a pet
Just turn and lead it by the hand
And lead it home and tell it
"Take it from me that you need all the friends you can get"

Don't ring for a taxi
Don't call a policeman
Don't send for a doctor he'll just give you pills
Don't hide in the cellar
You may not believe it
It's probably friendly, just alone like you

So if you get lonely
Just think of the summer
And swimming in sky blue, drift your mind away

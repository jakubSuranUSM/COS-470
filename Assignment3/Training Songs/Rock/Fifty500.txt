These things,
These things,
These things

These things,
These things,
These things, 
We believe in aren't what they seem
Will we wake from this dream?

And I'll sympathize, with open eyes
I'll bless the skies, you come home
Is there any wonder or point to what I do?
I'm skin and bone forever
And you've beaten me black and blue

These strings,
These strings,
These strings,
They relieve me so I can sing
And I play for nothing

And I'll sympathize, with open eyes
I'll bless the sky, you come home
Is there any wonder? a point to what I do?
I whisper as loud as London
And it's beatin' me black and blue

And I'll sympathize, with open eyes
I'll bless the skies, you come home
Is there any wonder, or point to what I do?
I'm skin and bone forever
And it's beatin' me black and blue
Is there any wonder?
Girl, you've beaten me black and blue

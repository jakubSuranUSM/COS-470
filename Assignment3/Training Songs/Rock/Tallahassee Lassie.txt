Well she come from Tallahassee
She's got a high flyin' chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy
But to me she's real classy
Yeah my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F.L.A
Well she's rockin' to the rag
Such a rockin' mob
Stompin' to the shake
Rocks the bony hop
Well she dances to the bop
She dances to the stroll
She dances to the wop, whoah
She can rock'n'roll
She's my Tallahassee Lassie
She's my Tallahassee Lassie
She's my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F.L.A

Vers 3
Guitar solo
Come on baby , come on sugar
Come on honey , come on rolling
Yeah my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F.L.A

He keeps his healing hands
Where the close-up camera pans
He keeps his love high above
A Holy love
He says
My heart cries out for you
'Cause sweet redemption makes you new
Oh Hallelujah
Oh Hozanna

Hallelujah
He takes his saviour home
Inside a mobile phone
To be sold calling cold
Saving souls
And he
Believes there is a light
Though he gets lonelier each night
Lord it cuts right through ya

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
So he just drinks down his despair
By the light of his bedside angels glare
She was made in Havana
Inscribed Hozanna
Oh Hozanna
He keeps his healing hands
Where the close-up camera pans

He keeps his love high above
A Holy love
But still those broken bodies come
Though pilgrim hearts just leave him numb
He's a TV messiah
His ratings got higher but he gets tired
And so his heart breaks into two
No sweet redemption makes him new
No Halllelujah
No Hozanna

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

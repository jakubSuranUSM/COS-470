Was meint ihr, will aus dieses Kindlein werden, Gutes oder BÃ¶ses?

Today's just an endless wait
Skull monkeys running through my head
Skylight, police car on fire
Someone get me to the end I'm dyin'

Justice is just a easy word
Our elders only time our pop-idol
I'm only human, just an upright dog
Nothing special and no loss

A handful of sour glory or a cup of poisoned joy
We're the devils playthings, Satan's little helpers
A handful of sour glory and a cup of poisoned joy
God's mistakes
Hate, kill and destroy

All this panic just to keep us down
Get me up before the air runs out
I'm only human, just an upright dog
Nothing special and no loss

A handful of sour glory, a cupful of poisoned joy
We're the devils playthings, Satan's little helpers
All God's mistakes
A handful of sour glory a little cup of poisoned joy
We're the devils playthings baby
Hate, kill and destroy

Handful of sour glory and a cup of poisoned joy
We're the devils playthings, we're Satan's little helpers
A handful of sour glory a little cup of poisoned joy
We're the devils playthings
Hate, kill and destroy

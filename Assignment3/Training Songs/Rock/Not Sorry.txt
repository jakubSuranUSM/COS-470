I saw her just the other day
See what you mean, yeah, she's okay
Seems like a sweet enough girl but she's not me
You take the lead, I'll take your hand
I'll follow you, just like we planned
Up to your room and lock the door

Not sorry

'Cause I can see it's true that you adore me
Let's not leave this room till tomorrow morning

'Cause I don't care about your plans
Don't care if you're somebody's man
I look into your eyes, I know you want me
So tell her anyway you can, just let her go
She'll understand and if she doesn't that's too bad

Not sorry

I'm not normally quite this bold
I've been a good girl so I'm told
Not usually the type to take what's not mine
But I look at you and I can see
That you're the only one for me

Let's not pretend it's something else
I'd rather, we not fool ourselves
And if she's sad I've got some words of comfort
She's better off without some one who doesn't want her

'Cause I don't care about your plans
Don't care if you're somebody's man
I look into your eyes, I know you want me
So tell her anyway you can, just let her go
She'll understand and if she doesn't that's too bad

Not sorry

And I believe in circumstances
Trust in fate and take your chances
And I know that love is all we need
And you'll find that love with me
And you'll find that love with me

'Cause I don't care about your plans
Don't care if you're somebody's man
I look into your eyes, I know you want me
So tell her anyway you can, just let her go
She'll understand and if she doesn't that's too bad

Not sorry

'Cause I don't care about your plans
Don't care if you're somebody's man
I look into your eyes, I know you want me
So tell her anyway you can, just let her go
She'll understand and if she doesn't that's too bad

Not sorry

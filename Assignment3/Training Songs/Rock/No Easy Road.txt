Rock 'n roll keeps dragging me
Where I don't know and you can't see
Cities keep rolling by and by
Twist my arm and sting my eye

Watch me join the circus
Watch me steal the show
There ain't no easy money
There ain't no easy road

Buy me, pay me, wonder why we
Stumble across the land
Don't fail for me, I can't fail for you
We start to understand

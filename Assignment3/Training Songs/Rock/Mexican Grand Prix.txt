Fast love
Heart breaker
I'll take you
In a tail race

Is this wonder land
My fire,
My passion
And mistake

(Run and see)
(Keep runnin' now)
(Keep runnin' now)
(I run and see)
I run and see
(Keep runnin' now)
Keep runnin' now
(Run and see)

I run and see
(Run and see)
Keep runnin' now
(Runnin' now)

All because I wouldn't save your mind
All because I wouldn't save
All because I let you lose your life
When you lose your own way

(I run and see)
It's so sad
(Keep runnin' now)
I will take her
(Run and see)
'Cause you're lost in
(Keep runnin' now)
Keep runnin' now
(I run and see)

I can't blame you
(Keep runnin' now)
For getting me here
Can't get you
(Run and see)
Out my head, yeah
(Runnin' now)

Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now

Come close
Open the door
Draw the curtains
On the stairs

Half dreamer
Cream in the eye
Say goodbye
To the child there

(I run and see)
(Keep runnin' now)
(I run and see)
(Keep runnin' now)
(I run and see)
(Keep runnin' now)
(Run and see)
(Runnin' now)
(Run and see)
(Runnin' now)

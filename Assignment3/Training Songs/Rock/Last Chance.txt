You know I can't believe, you're just going to stand and watch them bleed
Plummeting to the depths of your foolish bold concept
I've seen you before with good ideas but this one had its moments
The color crimson surrounds your ears, I think this time you've blown it
I think this time you've blown it, it's much too late to change
I think this time you know you coudn't rearrange
I think this time you've blown it, it's much too late to change
That was your last chance
You know I can't believe you're just going to stand and watch them bleed
Plummeting to the depths of your foolish bold concept

That was your last chance
You know I can't believe you're just going to stand and watch them bleed
You're just going to stand and watch them bleed
You're just going to stand and watch them bleed
You're just going to stand and watch them bleed

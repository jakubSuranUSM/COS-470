From a distance I can see, the picture looks so clear to me 
It's a vantage point so few can hope to find 
And patience held the key, our love our only guarantee 
Our destiny to make it through the night 
Through the tears and through the pain 
This house was built to stand the strain 
Through harder times I surely can't recall 
And crazy as it seems, through all we had were crazy dreams 
Those hungry years I'll miss the most of all 
Now at last, we fall together 
We've been through it all together 
Ooh, I never stopped lovin' you 
When the money was short 
And dreams were shattered 
Faith in love was all 
That pulled us through 
I never stopped lovin' you 
We stumbled on the way, so many nights love went astray 
At different times we each played separate fools 
But love became our pride, when once we'd seen the other side 
Every highway led me back to you 
Through the wind and through the rain 
This house was built to stand the strain 
Though harder times I surely can't recall 
Now at last, we fall together 
We've been through it all together 
Ooh, I never stopped lovin' you 
When the money was short 
And dreams were shattered 
Faith in love was all 
That pulled us through 
I never stopped lovin' you 
From a distance I can see, The picture looks so clear to me, 
A vantage point that only love can find

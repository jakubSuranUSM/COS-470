I’ll be the first, I’ll be number two, 
I’ll be the third and the fourth lover to you 
'Cause Jordan sent me here to find you 

I’ll be the first, I’ll be number two, 
I’ll be the third and the fourth lover to you 
'Cause Jordan sent me here to find you 

Now I’ve got enough loving for you 
I begged you from Pilate, in the dark we grew 
You’re breath is sweet now babe and heavy on me 
And you move like water surrounding me 
'Cause Jordan sent me here to find you I found you 
My blood will shiver but stir like cream 
As we dance a slow murder in the sweetest of dreams 

I’ll be the first, I’ll be number two, 
I’ll be the third and the fourth lover to you 
'Cause Jordan sent me here to find you 

'Cause Jordan sent me here to find you 

I found you

And that’s a love you can’t undo 
And that’s a love you can’t undo When you got someone
You got someone good 
Now that’s a love you can’t undo

And that’s a love you can’t undo 
And that’s a love you can’t undo 
When you got someone, when you got someone
You got someone good 
Now that’s a love you can’t undo

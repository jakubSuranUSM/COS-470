Things could be lazy
If they weren't so crazy
I wasn't following you
Running in circles won't find me no purpose
It's right here with you and what I do

Changes of season, are nearly as pleasin'
As watchin' the changes in you
Time for a new day, in search of a new way
But are you sure that it will do

World in changes still going through
I've got a lot to learn about you
World in changes still going through
You've got a lot to learn about me too
You've got a lot to learn about me too

I said well, let's see
What you really mean to me
I'll tell the truth 'cause I can't pretend
Find yourself a real friend
Then you nearly reached the end
Of all of this runnin' 'round we do

World in changes still going through
I've got a lot to learn about you
World in changes still going through
You've got a lot to learn about me too
You've got a lot to learn about me too

World in changes, world in changes

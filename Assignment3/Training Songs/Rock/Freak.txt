They poison our sweet mother earth
Destroy our sacred bodies
To fill our mouths with junk and
They call this knowledge
But knowing nothing
Means knowing far, far too much
They let our children
Starve in the name of peace
They march to the beat of
A killing machine

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Scars and bars and 51 stars
In faith and milk and...
I'm drinking filth and disease
Oh pretty please, I'm begging freedom
There's lives to be blinded,
Serviced and kinded
Before we've paid
And then we'll pay some more
Do you know the score?
Cause I'm so fucking bored!

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted

Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul
Oh
They'll pour the salt from your soul

They'll sell your wounds as evidence of your hope

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream 
When you can't wake up from the dream you wanted
Life is not a dream
Life is not a,
Life is not a dream
Life is not a dream

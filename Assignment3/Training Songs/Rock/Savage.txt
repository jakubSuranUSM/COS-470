Let's be savage, gonna sing our song
Let's be savage, till the feeling's gone
My heart is racing, my heart is racing
My heart is racing to wake me up
My heart is racing, finally racing
My heart is racing to warm me up
I don't fall for it's always much to do
This window, I look through, wanna tear down the clear blue
I wanna get back, I wanna get back
I wanna get back, please help me get back

Let's be savage, gonna sing our song
Let's be savage, till the feeling's gone
My heart is racing, my heart is racing
My heart is racing to wake me up
My heart is racing, finally racing
My heart is racing to warm me up

How she passing meet me, 
With a perfume charm
Finally woke up as 
I wanna get back, I wanna get back
I wanna get back, please help me get back

Let's be savage, gonna sing our song
Let's be savage, till the feeling's gone
Let's be savage, gonna sing our song
Let's be savage, till the feeling's gone
Let's be savage, gonna sing our song
Let's be savage, till the feeling's gone.

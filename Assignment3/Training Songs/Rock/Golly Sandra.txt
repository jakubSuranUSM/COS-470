Golly Sandra
You've grown up really crazy
Have I been denying of you

Golly Sandra
You've grown up so crazy
Have I been too untrusting

Take me down to the bridge
Where you know that I've always loved you
And we'll go without stopping

Oh, you are my scar
And that's not really far
Hey hey

Golly Sandra
You've grown up really crazy
Have I been denying of you

Take me down to the bridge
Where you know that I've always loved you
And we'll go without stopping

Oh, you are my scar
And that's not really far
Hey

I guess I should have been around to sing you to sleep
You look so beautiful it hurts me slightly

Oh you are my scar
And that's not really far
Hey

Oh you know that I have tried so hard
For you, for you

Well you always were a problem 
Always running wild 
Trouble is your middle name 
You know you're the wayward child 
You always get your feet wet 
You always play with knives 
Watch that you don't cut yourself 
You know you're the wayward child 
They call you the wayward child 
Well you've always gone your own way 
Sometimes you play with fire 
Well can you run forever 
Before you run right out of time 
Will you run right out of time 
Nothing's gonna change you 
It ain't no use 
Well who is gonna tame you 
Tie you in a noose 
Well no one's gonna change ya 
Ain't no use 
And no one's gonna tame you 
Tie you in a noose 
Well you always were a problem 
Never meek and mild 
Life is just a street fight 
Well you know you're the wayward child 
You always get your feet wet 
You always play with knives 
Watch that you don't cut yourself

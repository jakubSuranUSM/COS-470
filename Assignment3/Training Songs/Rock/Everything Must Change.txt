I was never one to back out of an argument
And say I was wrong.
Even when I'd seen the other side

I'd hide my foolishness and carry on.
But still I'd embarrassed

'Cause they'd seen what happened and they playin' along.
Until I backed myself into a corner

I will only realize when they had gone.

And like a dream alive
A reason everything must change.
Every
Everything
Everything must change
And like a world this earth and seasons
Everything must change.
Every
Everything
Everything must change

In the same way when we disagree

I wouldn't be the one to back down.
Still I'd know that you had faith in me

Tell me something am I letting you down?
'Cause when I woke up and I saw the note

You pressed into the mirror frame

But it was easy to be angry at you

But deep inside I know
We share the blame.
And now
Like a dream alive
A reason
Everything must change

I'm going back to the top to start myself off

But first of all something's I need to know:
When I'm scared of being wrong again

Won't you be the one I turn to
To let me know
Oh let me know.
Oh
Please
Let me be right for once

'Cause right now all I feel
I do is wrong.
And it's never too late to learn about love

And this victim needs your hand to hold on.

And like a dream alive
A reason everything must change
And like a dream alive
A reason everything must change.
And like a world this earth and seasons
Everything must change
And like a dream alive
A reason everything must change

(ian hunter)

There goes happiness
Down that street
Pick me up, put me down again
Just when I was on my feet

I get stoned every day
My best friend he gone and went away
It's her debt
And I've got to face it alone

Been a long long time now
Been a long time high
Making up promises that went wrong
I'm in the sky

In a ..(? )..not a trace
I see her all over my place
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

And endlessly my trouble mine
Won't let go leave the past behind
It's a drag, so it seems
I must live my life in dreams
I must laugh while the other man wins

Guess it's the season
Brings a man down
All my fingers are stuck on my toes
And my feet are off the ground
Yesterday the world went away
I can't seem to find the strength to pray
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

And endlessly my trouble mine
Won't let go leave the past behind
It's a drag, so it seems
I must live my life in dreams
I must laugh while the other man wins

Guess it's the season
Brings a man down
All my fingers are stuck on my toes
And my feet are off the ground
Yesterday the world went away
I can't seem to find the strength to pray
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone
It's her debt
I've got to face it alone

We are going, heaven knows where we are going,
We'll know we're there. 
We will get there, heaven knows how we will get there,
We know we will. 

It will be hard we know
And the road will be muddy and rough,
But we'll get there, heaven knows how we will get there,
We know we will.

We are going, heaven knows where we are going,
We'll know we're there.

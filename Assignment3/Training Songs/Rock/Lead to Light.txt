Questions in your heart
The answers in your wisdom
And you toss

It's worthy of the silence
To pray upon your bed
And you rest

I will drop anything
I will drop anything 
for you

Questions in your head
The answers in your silence 
And you feel
It's worthy of the moment
To kneel upon your bed
and you knowing

I will drop anything
I will drop anything 
for you

I will drop anything
I will drop anything 
for you

Do yourself a favor
Trust you have the answers
And you know it'll lead to light
And you know it'll lead to light

Do yourself a favor
Trust you got the answers
And you know it'll lead to light
And you know it'll lead to light

You know you are a teacher
But you don't know

But you don't know

You know you are a teacher
But you don't know
I could be a teacher too

Oh my love
You know you are a teacher
But you don't know
I could be a teacher too

Oh my love
You know you are a teacher
But you don't know
I could be a teacher too

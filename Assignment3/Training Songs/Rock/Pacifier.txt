There's always something to hide
There's always someone to lead on with you
Obligated Rewind
Evidently proves that I don't need you
She said 'Oh please, you're obsessed!'
I said she looked over-dressed
She deffo didn't like that no

She said 'I'm feeling like it's brewing up
When you say that you don't need me
And you are nothing without me'

But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will

There's always some kid to snide
They took my mother at 13
And patched her fickly eyes
Evidently proved that i don't need you or noone
She said 'It's you i detest!'
I said she looked underslept
She deffo didn't like that no

She said 'I'm feeling like it's brewing up
When you say that you don't need me
And you are nothing without me'

But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will
But Babe
You know I've tried and failed
But you
Just don't know how it feels
To lose
Something you never had and never will

I'm a pacifier, I'm a pacifier

Into temptation, over in doubt
Black night, neonlight into my house
talking talking talking about
Out of frustration, over in doubt

Hold me now, I'm hoping that you can explain
Little Arithmetics
Got me down, they're fooling me again and again
Little Arithmetics
Got me down

Sometimes I feel like going down south Sometimes I'm feeling alright
Sometimes I feel like I'm over and out Sometimes I'm losing my mind
Talking talking talking about Sometimes the day is the night
Into temptation, over in doubt Sometimes I don't want to fight

Hold me now,
I'm hoping that you can explain
Little Arithmetics
Got me down, they're fooling me again and again
Little Arithmetics
Got me down

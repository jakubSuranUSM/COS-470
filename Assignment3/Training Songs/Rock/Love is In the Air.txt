Love is in the air everywhere I look around love is in the air
Every sight and every sound and I don't know if I'm being
Foolish don't know if I'm being wise but it's something that I
Must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes.
Love is in the air, in the whisper of the tree, love is in the
Air in the thunder of the sea, and I don't know if I'm just
Dreaming, don't know if I feel safe, but it's something that I
Must believe in and it's there when you call out my name.
Love is in the air, love is in the air, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh.
Love is in the air, in the rising of the sun, love is in the
Air, when the day is nearly done, and I don't know if you are
Illusion, don't know if I see truth, but you are something
That I must believe in, and you are there when I reach out for
You.
Love is in the air everywhere I look around love is in the air
Every sight and every sound and I don't know if I'm being
Foolish don't know if I'm being wise but it's something that I
Must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes.
Love is in the air, love is in the air, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh

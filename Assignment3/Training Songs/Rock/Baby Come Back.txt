I?m starin? at the four walls
Sittin? here, waitin? by the telephone
Your words are runnin? through my mind child
Cut me like a knife, you don?t want to see me any more
Well I know you?re nothin? special
So how come you can be so impressional
I tried to figure it out, got a black out
I guess I call you inessential
Baby come back, baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, baby come back I?m in the danger zone
My heart ain?t made of plastic
I?m tellin? ya, I?m gonna do somethin? drastic, (drastic)
I?m trying to bide my time
Takin? my time_________________________
Well I know I?m not original
But listen here, I should be more than your provisional
You keep runnin? around, all around town
Actin? like a cool individual
Baby come back, 
baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, 
baby come back I?m in the danger zone
I said, baby come back, 
baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, 
baby come back I?m in the danger zone
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back I?m in the danger zone
I said, baby come back, 
baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, (ooh baby come back)
baby come back I?m in the danger zone
I said, baby come back, 
baby come back
Baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, (ooh baby come back)
baby come back I?m in the danger zone
I said baby come back, 
baby come back, 
baby come back ?cuz I?m all alone
Baby come back, oh baby, 
baby come back I?m in the danger zone

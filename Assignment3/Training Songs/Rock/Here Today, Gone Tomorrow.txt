I used to hide my Camels in a paper bag
I only took them out when it was safe to drag
My first sixteen years in a Catholic-boy suit
One father with a sixer and a steel-toe boot
He said son we're all...

Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow

One night in the mirror I saw a movie star
So I flew to Hollywood in a neighbor's car
A pack of No-Doz I'm a bundle of nerves
Laughing out loud as the highway curves
'Cause you see we're all just...

Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow

Twenty-two miles out of Pasadena
I picked up a hiker named Tina
Now we've only been here a couple of weeks
Soakin' up the sun, the drugs and the freaks
We hit it off, so we moved in together
Got a cat named Ringo and it purred like leather
We robbed a bank in Santa Monica
Bought a Caddy and a gold harmonica
We'd ride by day, we'd play by night
We're makin' love every night

Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow

So we went up to Hef's to meet some bunnies
I saw Hugh, he was actin' funny
He handed me some grass and a vodka & gin
That was about the time that Jack Webb walked in
He said, "Son I'm gonna tell you something
And it ain't pretty
There's a thousand ways to die in this naked city!"

Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
You know we're
Here today and gone tomorrow

Don't worry about it, pop

Boy, I got your number
That doesn't mean I have to call you
Get yourself together
'Cause I don't need you like you want me to

Gotta loosen up
Drain the cup
It's time to tear it up

Well, I got one shot and the night is young
So don't wait up for me
I need another hit before I'm done
So don't wait up for me

Boy, don't try to slow me down
You're not the only one that's on my mind
Got enough to go around
If you can't take it, you'll be left behind

Gotta loosen up
Drain the cup
It's time to tear it up

Well, I got one shot and the night is young
So don't wait up for me
I need another hit before I'm done
So don't wait up for me

There's no telling where I'm gonna show up
Nobody knows how the night will end
There's no telling when I'm gonna wake up
Well, when I do, I'll do it all again, yeah

Gotta loosen up
(Loosen up)
Drain the cup
(Drain the cup)
It's time to tear it up
Now let me tell you what I got

Well, I got one shot and the night is young
So don't wait up for me
I need another hit before I'm done
So don't wait up for me

Well, I got one shot and the night is young
So don't wait up for me
I need another hit before I'm done
So don't wait up for me

One shot, the night is young
So don't wait up for me
I need another hit before I'm done
So don't wait up for me

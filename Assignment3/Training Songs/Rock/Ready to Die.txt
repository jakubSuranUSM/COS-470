Got a depression and it won’t let go
Got a depression and I hate it so.

[Chorus]
I’m shooting for the sky
Because I’m ready to die,
Die, die

It’s an lonesome town and it’s got me down
What a luxury to wear this frown

[Chorus]

Now this lonely skin is wearing thin
How I hate in judge of the world I’m in

[Chorus: x2]

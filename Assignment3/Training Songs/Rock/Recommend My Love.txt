If there is any other way I will find it
I will not be losing you
If I can help it
I won't take this lying down

I'm gonna fight for you
I'm in the middle
Not easy for me baby
Not easy for me 

This may sound emotional
I have a deep sense of holding on
I'm gonna wrap you in my love
I'm gonna wrap you in my love

And I can recommend my love
I can recommend my love
I can't fake it
You are a big part of my life

And I won't make it
If I give up if I give in
This may sound emotional
I have a deep sense of holding on

I'm gonna hold on to you
No time for crying
I've got work to do
I've got to wrap you in my love

I've got to wrap you in my love
And I can recommend my love
I can recommend my love
I've got no time

To place the blame
You wanted to taste
Forbidden fruit
I could run you off in haste

But I'd repent of my leisure
For you
Ooh Ooh
I've got to wrap you in my love 

I want it the way it was
All points to lead back home
You know I caught you
Fair and square

But I want you right back here
Where I can
Wrap you in my love
Love you darling

Ooh Ooh
Wrap you in my love
I've got to recommend my love

Like so with gasoline
On more we ever been
Went back another day
Off the road, we never made
Mola sinning until before
Between the lines, reading more
Across the field with little known
It's what they said get in it and go!

Accelerate, to the floor
Observe the light, observe the 4
1000 feet had passed us by
Make up the time, we have to try
Motionless, and revived
Up above, a blinding light
Once again, a different route
Give us the time, we'll find it out

[Chorus]

It's been hidden away, for 50 years
So says the four, so says the four (so says the ball.. is what i thought)
At first they were cleared, until the 4
Had gained control, had gained control

(Bob balch rocks some ass)
A certain sign just like we found
It's what we see, it's what went down
Urethane has given way
Breakin' down, just like they say
Light seems to pass on through
A cover up, is what we knew
No time to check the facts
Never told, we'd make it back!

[Chorus]

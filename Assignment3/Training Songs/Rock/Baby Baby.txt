I am feeling oh so sad.
You are the best thing that I've ever had.
I can't stop thinking about you.
All the fun and the times we've had.

I can't stop thinking about you, oh no.
Baby, Baby I love you so,
And I don't want to let you go-oh-woh.
Baby, Baby I feel alright,

When I hold onto you tonight....
I've been feeling oh so blue.
I'm Lost in love I just don't know what to do.
I can't stop dreaming about you,

I've been dreaming every day.
I can't stop dreaming about you, oh no.
Baby, Baby I love you so,
And I don't want to let you go-oh-woh.

Baby, Baby I feel alright,
When I hold onto you tonight.
I've been feeling so afraid.
I've never felt so lonely, as I'm feeling today.

I can't help thinking about you,
I've been thinking every day.
I can't stop dreaming about you, oh no.
Baby, Baby I love you so,

And I don't want to let you go-oh-woh.
Baby, Baby I feel alright,

[Repeat: x3]
When I hold onto you tonight...

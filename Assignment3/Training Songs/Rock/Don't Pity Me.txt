(Pity, pity, pity, ah, ah, ooh)

Pity my arms for losing you
Pity my dreams that won't come true
But don't (don't) don't pity me

Pity my heart that's gonna break (dow, dow, dow)
Pity my kiss that you won't take
But don't (don't) don't pity me

Pity from others I have plenty of
But darlin', from you I want love

Pity the love I'll throw away (dow, dow, dow)
Till you return to me some day
But don't (don't) don't pity me

Pity from others I have plenty of
But darlin', from you I want love

Pity the love I'll throw away (dow, dow, dow)
Till you return to me some day
But don't (don't) don't pity me

(Don't, don't) pity me
(Don't, don't) don't pity me

To pick up the tip
Doesn't mean a lot,
Fiddle inside your drawers

If we own the night
Then spread it out
Or pack up
Without a clue

Well
Caused by their own
When by default
Time to v√°monos

Like your face
Getting forced
To the floor

Then I got a taste
Of the benefits
Five foot
And change

There's no better way
To hash it out
So let's set up
Your time to fail

Well
Course now the cracks
Should we intervene
I hold this albatross

Like your face
Getting forced
To the floor
And either way
You're way too close
To it all

Pay up, never
Wait 'em out
Clever, Madoff
Take it all
Take it all

(Your, mouth, blessed)

Take 'em all the way
Right back down

(Clue, less, mess)

Pay up, never
Take it all
Take it all

Like your face
Getting forced
To the floor (In a league of your own)
And either way
You're way too close
To it all  (You cannot veto the world)

Like your face (like your face)
Getting forced (getting forced)
To the floor (In a league of your own)
And either way (and either way)
You're way too close
To it all

Too close to it all

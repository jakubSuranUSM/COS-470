There's a nature we innately understand that we rarely listen to 
How strong am I, 
I know the legacies I live within, 
How strong am I 
To use what I've learned with discipline 
How strong am I 
To take this resistance and make it free 
How strong are we 
Can you still hear me thro' all these distractions 
And can you still see me tho all this smoke, 
And do you have purpose or you just paying off mortgage 
And do you take rich drugs or poor drugs 
To hide your ache for something more 
How strong are we, 
We know the legacies we live within, 
How strong are we 
To meet each other thro' this division. 
How strong are we 
To rise beyond these blinded leaders 
How strong are we 
Who spent the money, and who pays the price 
To not be responsible must be so nice. 
Did you hear about karma, and how it comes back, 
Too late to wear glasses when your sky turns black. 
How strong are we we know the legacies we live within, 
How strong are we 
To meet each other thro' this division 
How strong are we to take this resistance and make it free 
How strong are we 
There's a nature we innately understand that we rarely listen to

The sounds are ringing through the night, like a symphony
We can hear it come, yeah, here it comes
From all but one direction, like bugs to the fire
You can hear them come, yeah, here they come

Here come the pigs, and they're coming in fast
Here come the pigs, let the first be the last

Here come the pigs, here come the pigs

I said you better duck down 'coz they're coming in, in force
Coming in on foot and on horse, coming in through the broken doors
Gotta get out 'coz tonight won't be a ball
It will be the end of us all, it will be a revolution when you hear their call

'Coz they''ll come in a rush, the blood will gush
My god they are just too big

Here come the pigs, here come the pigs

And the day will be night and there never be light
It's the end of the peace and the start of the fight, yeah

Here come the pigs, here come the pigs
Here come the pigs, here come the pigs, and here they come

At the bottom of a pile at the bottom
Gonna be a little while but they got 'em, yeah
Well, you can blow the horn you can kill that goat
Make a crown of thorns or put your world on that boat
But it ain't no use, it ain't no use

We all know they are close, very close
We got the smell of the pig coming up our nose
It is time to get on to the other side to cut loose
Run away, to duck down and to hide, yeah

Here come the pigs, here come the pigs
Here come the pigs, here come the pigs
And I will sing it now, yeah, I will sing it now
Here come the piggy piggy, oh, here come the pigs

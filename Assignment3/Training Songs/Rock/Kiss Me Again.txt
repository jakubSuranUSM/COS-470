You got me where you want me
But, I ain't all there.
My head is gone, my brain is fried,
'nd I'm standing right here.

You can touch me if you want to, oh
I don't really care
But I knew everything that I ever loved.

I guess we have to play
The cards we've been dealt.
And I guess I got nothing,
But whatever happens happens...
'Cause my life is falling apart,
[Or with the kid], I don't know.

Well you can kiss me again if you want,
I don't mind.
Well you can kiss me again if you want,
Oh that'd be fine.

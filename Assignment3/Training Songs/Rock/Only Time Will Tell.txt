Hello my friend sure has been awhile
I don't know where the time has gone 
But I really missed your smile it's been too long
I got so much to say that I don't know where to start
Ever since we went our seperate ways 
Been a big hole in my heart.
As I recall it was you that said goodbye
Now you're asking me to give it one more try.
 
Only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
And so my friend I hope you understand 
It's hard to put my trust in you 
'Cause i'm afraid you'll leave me again
I want to believe thatcha fin'ly seen the light 
That you miss my love and you want to make it right
 
But only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
Got no way of knowin' what the future's gonna bring
So I'll just listen to my heart 
Because it's never lied to me and what I left to be
Only time will tell if you're gonna stand beside me 
Through both heaven and hell I want to know if you're behind me 
Only time will tell 
What we have together gonna last forever
Hoo time will tell do you believe in me?
Only time will tell if we're gonna be together woa'
I wanna love that last forever

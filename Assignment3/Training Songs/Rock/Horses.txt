I woke up this morning 
With a bump on my head 
An empty corral 
And a stone cold bed 
Well all of my livestock 
Was nowhere in sight 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night 
She cut me off at the roots 
When she took my best boots 
I'm hung-over and barefoot and long 
You know I can't blame her 
Try as I might 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night 
She rode off by moonlight and cut through the fences 
Looks like somebody's done come to her senses 
You know I can't blame her 
Try as I might 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night 
She rode off by moonlight and cut through the fences 
Looks like somebody's done come to her senses 
You know I can't blame her 
Try as I might 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night 
To much time on the range 
And to much the bar 
She warned me and warned me but I took it to far 
The whiskey was wrong 
And the woman 
Yeah, the woman might have been right 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night 
She took all of my horses when she left me last night

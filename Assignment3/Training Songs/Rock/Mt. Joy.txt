Berry stains on a dirt road
And sunlight on our clean clothes
Stare forever for all the pinches together
Mountains fall into the sea
If I built the frame and gave you my name
Would you wander forever with me?

And drive way up over Mt. Joy
Where everyone's free now to move how they feel now

She blames Brooklyn for hand me downs
She wakes up in her parents' house
And I got the curse of quivering youth
Tell the truth
All we really need's the love in this room
And I open my lips to tell her she's the anchor, I'm a sailor
We're lost in the height of the wave
Every wave remind me why I feel this way

And drive way up over Mt. Joy
Where everyone's free now to move how they feel

Feel your feet on the festival grounds
They can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust
'Cause they can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust

And I dreamed you felt it too
And I dreamed it all came true
And I dreamed you felt it too
And I dreamed it all came true
And I dreamed you felt it too
And I dreamed it all came true

They can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust

Hey now you never want to be alone you never want to be apart
From me on your own
Hey now if we runaway and hide and you tell me there's
A hurt if you confide

You've been lost for so long dear all your worries
They all come clear
Your little jealousy, your little jealousy, your little jealousy over me
Hey now throw your arms around me and you tell me

There's no reason to believe
Hey now, now if I reassure you I can tell you in one little word
Love is a falling star shining on you
Love could cure a heart

You've been lost for so long dear, all your heartaches, they disappear
Your little jealousy, your little jealousy, your little jealousy over me
There is a falling star shining on you
Love could cure a heart

You've been lost for so long dear and every time your heart
Pulls at my strings
Your little jealousy, jealousy over me
Your jealousy, your jealousy, your jealousy over me

Your jealousy, your jealousy, your jealousy over me

(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) must the show go on?
(Ooh, pa) take me home, take me home, take me home
(Ooh, ma) let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old, is it too late?

(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) will I remember the songs?
(Ooh, ah)
The show must go on

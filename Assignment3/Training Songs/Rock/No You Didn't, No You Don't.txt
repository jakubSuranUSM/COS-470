So just because I use salty phrases and I go through stages
Where I neglect endeavor does it mean I'm not clever?
No I don't think so

Just because my newspaper pages
Haven't been the times in ages
Does this meen that I don't no as much as you?
Jelousy will destroy us or so she used to say
You'd kill for half the things we do including yesterday

But I suppose you know because your went to school with me
You sit in ya garage and you'd see
All the things we do don't you! no you didn't and no you don't
No you didn't and no you don't. no you don't! 

Do you remember us lot doing keys
In the back of the garage at 243?
That was us and no one else
Lend luke a jumper off the shelf
Do you remember us lot doing keys
In the back of the garage where no one sees
That was us, no one else another jager off the shelf

So I suppose you know because your went to school with me
Sit in ya garage and you'd see
All the things we do don't you! no you didn't and no you don't
No you didn't and no you don't. no you don't! 

Always be people lookin down there noses
I don't care I'm comin up smelling of roses

But I suppose you know because your went to school with me
Sit in ya garage and you'd see
All the things we do don't you! no you didn't and no you don't
No you didn't and no you don't. no you don't! no ya don't

Another night of falling rain
Your memory flickers like a flame
It echoes like a distant tune
Dances on the four walls of my room

With hair as black as a book of prayer
Your laughter filled the morning air
Now it doesn't seem so long ago
But how we ever parted, I don't know

Where are you now? So far away
If only some how the night would disappear
And I could have you here
There's a breeze on the water

Blowing time back to me
I can still see your face
Kissing Rain
We wandered through a hundred days

And watched the stars on Half-Moon Bay
Then like a season you were gone
You left me on a frozen April dawn
You were the storm-in my sky

If only once more I could be so free
Feel you washing over me
There's a breeze on the water
Blowing time back to me

I can still see your face
Kissing Rain
There's a long cool river
Running wild to the sea

And I am calling your name
Kissing Rain
I'm a prisoner of time
And I'm chained to memories

How can you be so free
There's a breeze
There is a long cool river
Running wild to the sea

And I am calling your name
Kissing Rain
There's a breeze on the water
(Daughter of the thunder)

Blowing time back to me
(Your face turned towards the sky)
I can still see your face
(Standing high on a hillside babe)

Kissing Rain
There's a long cool river
(I'm a prisoner of time)
Running wild to the sea

(I am chained to memories)
And I am calling your name
(Calling your name calling your name)

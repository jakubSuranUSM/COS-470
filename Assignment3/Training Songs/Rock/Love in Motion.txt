Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Makin' love, and the world stops turning.
Your body's so warm and your lips are like honey.
Into the night, well I'm driftin' and driftin',
I'm caught in a dream, I'm lost but not lonely.

The world stops turnin' and time stands still,
Feels like the night will last forever,
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)

Deep inside, I can feel it comin',
A river of love, rollin' over my body.
Driftin' with the tide,
I don't care where it takes me,
Carry me on, roll me over and over.

The world stops turnin' and time stands still,
Feels like the night will last forever,
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)

No time to worry, no time to lose,
I can't see clearly but I can't be confused.
No love can be as strong as this,
I can't take it but I just can't resist.
Oh no, oh no.

{Dave - Solo}

Slow and easy, night is young,
Need someone to love you? Let me be the one.
Lay back baby, let the good feeling flow,
Love is coming and I'm losing control.

The world stops turnin' and time stands still,
Feels like the night will last forever,
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)
I can feel it now (love in motion)
I can feel it comin', yeah (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)
Oh oh yeah (love in motion)
Whoa ah (love in motion)
(love in motion)
(love in motion)......

It's very hard to define it
Just why I feel this way
There must be all kinds of reasons
So many things I could say
And I know I'm not mistaken
This is love and that's for sure

You, you're the only one
You're the only one
You, you're the only one
 
There are times I remember
It wasn't so long ago
I was lonely, sad and confused
I didn't know where to go
But baby I want to tell you
Just how good you make me feel

You, you're the only one
You're the only one
You, you're the only one

I'd be a fool to deny it
I want everyone to know

You, you're the only one
You're the only one
You, you're the only one

Baby, baby

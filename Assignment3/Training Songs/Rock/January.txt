January
sick and tired you've been hanging on me

You make me sad with your eyes
you're telling me lies
Don't go
don't go
January
don't be cold

Don't be angry to me. You make me sad
come and see.
Oh
January
don't go
don't go.
Life gets me higher
I can show
I can go
I can wake up the world.
Little world gotta know you
gotta show you.

Sun
like a fire
Carry on
don't be gone

Bring me out of my home
sweet home
Gotta know me
gotta show me
You've been facing the world
You've been chasing the world.

January
sick and tired you've been hanging on me . . .

Time
it's a flyer
Sunny days
fly away
English summers are gone.
So long
gotta go up
gotta grow up.

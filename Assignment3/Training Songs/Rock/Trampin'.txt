I'm trampin', trampin' Try'n-a make heaven my home
I'm trampin trampin Try'n-a make heaven my home...

I've never been to heaven But I've been told
Try'n-a make heaven my home That the streets up there
Are paved with gold Try'n-a make heaven my home

I'm trampin trampin Try'n-a make heaven my home
I'm trampin trampin Try'n-a make heaven my home...

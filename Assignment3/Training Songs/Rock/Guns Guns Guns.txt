American hunter, bring Ã¢??em up the north side
Guns, guns, guns
Run, take the money, hereÃ¢??s a bullet for your boyfriend
Guns, guns, guns

Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Guns, guns, guns
You be the red king, IÃ¢??ll be the yellow pawn
God speed Mother Nature

Never really wanted to say good-bye
Shoot a few, knock Ã¢??em down, cost you half a buck now
Guns, guns, guns
Babe give you kisses if you hit a rubber duck now

Guns, guns, guns
You be the red king, IÃ¢??ll be the yellow pawn
Guns, guns, guns
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou

God speed Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say good-bye

No blind spots in the leopard's eyes
Could ever hope to jeopardize
The lives of lambs
The shepherd cries

An afterlife for a silverfish
Eternal dust, less ticklish
Than a clean room
A houseguest's wish

[Chorus:]
He lies on his side
Is he trying to hide
In fact it's the earth 
Which he's known since birth

Face worker, a serpentine miner
A roof falls, an under liner
Of leaf structure
The egg timer

[Chorus]

Ngikhanyisele wedlozi lami
Two humans on the run
(repeat)
The autumn leaves have trooped their colours
Rumours of the battle to come
Intelligence says you have departed
But my heart cannot give up it's love
I'm living through a war in peace time
Dying to get through to you
Baba noma...
Living through a war in peace time
To get through to you
On your face, love, days and sorrow
So long we struggled on
Baba noma...
The heart is a shattered province
Pockets of love still hold out in the ruins
Old memories sent me reinforcements
But they were ambushed on high ground
I'm living through a war in peace time
Dying to get through to you
Baba noma...
Living through a war in peace time
To get through to you
Why do you fight like this with me now
You fill the days with such sad sounds
Baba noma...
Ngikhanyisele wedlozi lami
Two humans on the run
(repeat)
I'm living through a war in peace time

Hope was propping me up when I met her,
As soon as I saw her I wanted to taste her lips,
So I did,
I was ecstatic for at least six weeks, oh,
Hope was placed in her hands when she caught me she asked me if it hurt,
I told her 'Christ it did.'
And it did,
When she left me every morning, oh,

I feel beautiful when she says I am beautiful,
But she is more beautiful.

I feel heavenly when she says I am heavenly,
But she is more heavenly.

Can't feel disappointed when her hips are that wide but I still feel lonely and screwed up inside,
And the taste of her tongue, it makes me wish I'd given up smoking,
She was a big, big girl she had big ideas,
Like how my heart should be free but I don't want it to be,
I want her, here beside me.

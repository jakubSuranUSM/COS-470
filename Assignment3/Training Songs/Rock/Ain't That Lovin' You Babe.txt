Listen to me baby,
I'll tell ya how I love you
Well you could throw me in the ocean
I'd swim to the bank
And crawl right home to you (yeah!)

Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
But you don't even know my name

Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
But you don't even know my name

They may kill me baby,
??? ??? ??? they do.
You can bury my body way down deep
But my spirit will rise to you (yeah)

Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
Ain't that lovin' ya baby
But you don't even know my name

but you don't even know my name
But you don't even know my name

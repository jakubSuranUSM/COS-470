When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back in my arms to stay

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But someday they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back in my arms to stay

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But someday they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back in my arms to stay

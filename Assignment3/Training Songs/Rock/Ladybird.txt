Hey, Ladybird, ain’t it just the way,
 the way that love grows cold and then fades away?
 Now when he touches you, make no mistake, 
The fire’s long gone out and the ash has blown away.
You don’t know how to leave and you don’t know where to fly.
 You don’t know what you feel but you know it’s not satisfied today.
So many little ones, so many mouths, 
You’ve got a lot to feed and you know you don’t know how.
 Making the best of it, somehow you’re making do,
 making the best of the days that you stay
 and you wait in this cage they made for you.
You don’t know how to leave and you don’t know where to fly.
 You’ve got a lot of things to lose,  
So you’ve got a lot of things to hide. 
You know you don’t believe but you know you’ve got to try today.
You know the sweetest wine, it’s a witches’ brew,
 pours like honey down and then burns a hole in you. 
Yeah, you may think you’re done but you’re never through spitting out
The bitterness to get the little sweetness you do.
You don’t know how to leave and you don’t know where to fly. 
You’ve got a lot of things to lose,  
So you’ve got a lot of things to hide. 
You don’t know what you feel but you know it’s not satisfied. 
You know you don’t believe but you know you’ve got to try today.
Feel the winter bitterness;  it’s heavy on the wind, coming back again.  
Maybe it’s time to fly, time to fly away!
 When you gonna spread your wings and fly?
When you gonna fly away?
When you gonna fly away?

On your own, come back
Give a call, contact
So alive, sidetracked
So alone, come back
Decide

I don't know
What to do, to show you
It's something so old
And its cold, like a stone

All that's said
All that's said
Could you just shake in a lie?
With a knife in your side

When you come back to me
You will be on your knees
With wounded hands

What a beautiful day (hey hey)
I'm the king of all time
And nothing is impossible
In my all powerful mind
It was the fifth of November, when time it went back
Some say that's impossible, but you and I never looked back
And wasn't it incredible, so beautiful and above all
Just to see the fuse get lit this time
To light the real bonfire, for all time
chorus, followed by instrumental
I was drinking in the night club
It felt good to be back
When Hepburn said I love you
And Flyn said, make mine a double jack
Then we planned the revolution
To make things better for all time
And when the barman said that was crazy
And ordered up a bottle of wine
Chorus, repeats twice, followed by break down
In there on the big screen, every night I've seen
The way all things could be
For me, for me, etc........
The news broke after midnight,
That we pulled the temple down without a sound
But the generals they were hiding out
And the ministers, Well! They'd all gone to ground
Wealth re-distribution, became the new solution
So I got a paper bag, but you got the one with all the holes
Chorus, times two
That's because nothing is impossible
In my own powerful mind

You don't see me, my eyes are closing
I swear you can't see me, I want you close
But my arms are holding me back
I'm waiting for you, but hold my eyes shut
You don't see me but come here close
Tear my hands down, pull off the blinds
Look me in the eyes

I know you're somethin', ooh
I know you're somethin' real
Lately I'm haunted, ooh
These shadows hold me here

Screaming under water, SOS
Can you hear me calling, SOS
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

My hands are shaking, nobody's been here before
Oh will you see me, is it enough?
Will you wake up, pull back the blinds
Look me in the eyes

I know you're somethin', ooh
I know you're somethin' real
Lately I'm haunted, ooh
These shadows hold me here

Screaming under water, SOS
Can you hear me calling, SOS
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I'm finally ready, help me up out of here

Screaming under water, SOS
Can you hear me calling, SOS
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

Screaming under water, SOS
Can you hear me calling, SOS
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

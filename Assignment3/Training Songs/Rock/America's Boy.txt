Quaker toil & Texan oil 
Rockets on we're arm in arm 
N.A.S.A nude you're manly you 

Oh American soldier 
America's boy 

Gun me down with Yankee power 
Cock pit tom with army charm 
The eagle lands army commands 

Oh American soldier 
America's boy 

Cowboy corn & bugle horn 
{on son don't post me on?} 
You are dean and me the queen 

Oh American soldier 
America's boy

If you lose your money, great God, don't lose your mind.
And if you lose your woman, please don't fool with mine.

Well, you can't watch your wife and your outside women, too.
You know you can't watch your wife and your outside women's, too.

Cooking your food, doing a dirt, buddy what you trying to do?

I was scared to death 
Afraid to close my eyes 
and find that I was gone 
Like every other one who left before the dawn 
I vanished in the air 
Am I still there? 

[chorus]
Wake me gently, if you can 
Wake me gently, just touch my hand 
Wake me gently, pull my sleeve 
'cause where I'm at is where I want to leave. 

And in my sleep, I look so lifeless on this bed 
Laid out on satin sheets 
This dream's a novel that I don't dare complete 
No happy endings read 
I think the hero's dead 

[Chorus] 

Me to my slumber 
And I'll never come home 
Please help me I'm frightened 
Of what's going on (what's going on?) 

And if I can't wake up 
Will I be all alone? 
A stranded orphan here? 
Or will I bump into some other wandering souls? 
And will they talk to me? 
Somebody, somebody please rescue me 

[Chorus] 

I want to leave 
I want to leave 
I just want to wake up  
I want to leave I don't want to stay

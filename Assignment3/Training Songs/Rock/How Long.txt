It took so long to find you, now you say that you need some more time
Somehow I'm getting used to, hangin' 'round 'til you've made up your mind
Everytime you need me, you just call knowing that I will be right there
A fool for your love, but I don't care
Chorus:
How long, how long will you keep me hangin' on
How long, how long, don't know if I can hold on
I never realized love is more than a game to play
Used to spend my time, breaking hearts now I find that I'm paying my debt
Now it's my heart that breaks and it hurts so bad
(chorus)
So many things to do, so many things to say
(What you wanted to say, we shouldn't wait too long)
We shouldn't wait too long, it seems like such a waste
(Solo)
So many things to do, so many things to say, oh
We shouldn't wait too long, it seems like such a waste (how long)
How long?
(chorus)

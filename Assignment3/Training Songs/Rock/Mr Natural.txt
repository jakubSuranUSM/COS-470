I don't drink
I don't smoke
I don't sniff no coke
New age
That's me
And that's what you should be
I am Mr Natural
You can call me Mr Natural
I don't drive no car
I live by the stars
I don't eat no meat
I am Mr Complete
I am Mr Natural
You can call me Mr Natural
I am Mr Natural
I don't wear no skin
I don't care who wins
When I know that I'm right
I don't get uptight
I am Mr Natural
You can call me Mr Natural
I am Mr Natural
You can call me Mr Natural
Mr Natural
Mr Natural
Mr Natural

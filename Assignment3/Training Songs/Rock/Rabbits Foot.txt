I had bad luck, from the day of birth
Oh my, my, what a curse, I tried to shake it out my shoes
But I just seem to lose
Everything I ever touch
Well it just turns to dust
I need a little, a little good luck

I need some kinda voodoo
I need some kinda luck
I need some kinda voodoo
I need some kinda

Luck in a rabbit's foot
Black cat bone, and the moon
The shape shifting witch's brew
Is what I'll drink with you
Luck from a rabbit's foot
Killed by a cross-eyed look
I found a little, a little good luck

I need some kinda voodoo
I need some kinda luck
I need some kinda voodoo
Some kinda luck

Yeah, I'm a lucky man
And I do the best I can
To hold this old devil's hand
I'll make you understand
My love isn't deep enough
And if you don't hurry up
You'll need a little, a little good luck

Yeah! A little good luck
A little good luck
A little good luck
I need a little good luck, Marie Laveau
I need a little good
Luck!

I, I, I need some kinda voodoo
I need some kinda luck
I need some kinda voodoo
I need some kinda luck

Some kinda voodoo
Some kinda luck
Some kinda voodoo
Some kinda luck, luck
Some kinda voodoo
Some kinda luck
Some kinda voodoo
Some kinda luck, luck, luck

Dogs are everywhere
Almost everywhere
That I go
They have too much and then 

They have too much again
And then more
They leave their 
Scent behind them

Everywhere they go
Oh dogs are everywhere
That I go
Oh dogs are everywhere

Almost everywhere 
That I go
They have too much and then
They have too much again

And then more
They leave their scent behind them
Everywhere they go
Oh dogs are everywhere

Yes dogs are everywhere
Yes dogs are everywhere 
That I go
They always wag their tails

At all the pretty girls
And older women
They find their own way in 
And they rip up everything

That I believe in
Sometimes
I have to wonder
About the dog in me 

Oh dogs are everywhere
Yes dogs are everywhere
Yes dogs are everywhere
That I go 

They get down on all fours 
When you walk through the door
They whine and beg around your feet
Like a dog for something sweet

They sink their teeth in you
They're tearing you in two
Remains are buried out of doors
Oh I want some more

I want some more
Sometimes
I have to wonder 
About the dog in me 

Oh dogs are everywhere
Yes dogs are everywhere
Oh dogs are everywhere
That I go

Sometimes
I have to wonder
About the dog in me
Oh dogs are everywhere

Yes dogs are everywhere 
Yes dogs are everywhere
That I go
That I go

That I go
That I go
Everywhere 
Everywhere 

Everywhere
Everywhere
Dogs are everywhere.

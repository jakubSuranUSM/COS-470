Oh, Maybelline, why can't you be true? Oh, Maybelline, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do,

As I was motivatin' over the hill, I saw Maybelline in a Coup de Ville,
Cadillac rollin' on the open road, nothin' outrun my V8 Ford,
Cadillac doin' 'bout 95, bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side,

Maybelline, why can't you be true? Whoa Maybelline, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do,

Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford, Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more,
Done got cloudy and it started to rain, I tooted my horn til I passed the lane,
Rain water blowin' all under my hood, I knew that I was doin' my motor good,

Maybelline, why can't you be true? Whoa Maybelline, why can't you be true?
You done started back doin' the things you used to do,

{Dave - Solo - 3 verses}

The motor cooled down, the heat went down,
And that's when I heard the highway sound,
Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead, 110 a half a mile ahead,
Cadillac lookin like it's sittin' in steel, and I called Maybelline at the top of the hill,

Maybelline, why can't you be true? Whoa Maybelline, why can't you be true?
You done start back doing the things you used to do.

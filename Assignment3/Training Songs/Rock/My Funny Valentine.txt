Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photographable

Yet you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day.

Sometimes I think about old folks back home
That 12 mile road that I used to roam.
Sometimes I think about that girl named Willie Jean
Wondering if she made it down to New Orleans.

Whenever I think about the folks back there
You know I wonder if they still have that old county fair.
Sometimes I think about that girl named Willie Jean
Wondering if she made it down to New Orleans.

We used to watch riverboats from a grassy bank
Drinking hot water from a railroad filling tank.
Sometimes I think about that girl named Willie Jean 
Wondering if she made it down to New Orleans.

The folk back there say why you come to harm
Now here I am sitting here on this county farm.
Sometimes I think about that girl named Willie Jean
Wondering if she made it down to New Orleans. 

Oh, Willie Jean, Willie Jean would you come back to me
Here I am sitting here on this county farm.
Oh, Willie Jean, Willie Jean would you come back
Come on help me now.

Hey everybody yeah, don't you feel that there's something?
Feel it, feel it?
Hey everybody yeah, don't you feel that there's something?

People on their own are getting nowhere,
I am on the road to see,
If anything is anywhere and waiting, just for me.

Every night I walk around the city.
Seems like I'll never know,
That feeling of being together when I go.

And it's a long way there, it's a long way to where I'm going,
And it's a long way there, it's a long way to where I'm going.

Hey everybody, don't you feel that there's something, but you know
in a moment it is gone.
I live for the day when I can hear people saying that they know and
they care for everyone
But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life, never knowing
home.

It's a long way.
It's a long, long, long way there,
I'm gonna keep on tryin',
I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah,
I'm gonna keep on tryin',
I'm gonna keep on tryin', ah!

Been away from home for such a long time,
And got to know this town,
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone, who's around
Is there anybody around?

Every night I walk around the city,
Seems like I'll never know,
The feeling of being together when I go.

And it's a long way there, it's a long way to where I'm going,
And it's a long way there, it's a long way to where I'm going.

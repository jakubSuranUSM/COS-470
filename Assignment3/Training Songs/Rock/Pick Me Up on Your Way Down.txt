You were mine for just a while 
Now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back 
At your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town 
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground 
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down 
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you 
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy 
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown 
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude 
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame 
Underneath you're still the same
When you've learned these things are true 
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground 
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down 
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to bore you 
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy 
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown 
Pick me up on your way down

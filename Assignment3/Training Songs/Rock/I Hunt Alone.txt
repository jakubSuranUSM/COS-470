When you see me
You've been trying to hide
I could eat you
And it feels just allright
Any cold winter night
You will all die

When my prey is wounded
That's my only holy moment
You might move in herds
I hunt alone

When I see you, I donç£? hate you, I cry
When you've seen me, you've been all paralized
I'm the beast that you fear, in the shadows of night

When my prey is wounded
That's my only holy moment
You might move in herds
I hunt alone

Any cold winter night, you will all die
I'm the beast that you fear, in the shadows of night
When I see you, all I need is to smile

When my prey is wounded
That's my only holy moment
You might move in herds
I hunt alone

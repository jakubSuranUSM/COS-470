I long for you
As a flower for the morning dew
I long for you
As a hind longs for the running streams

Frown on me no more
And let me smile again
Before I go away
And cease to be

While I refused to speak
My agony was quickened
My heart burned within me
As the fever rose
My eyes are open
But I can not see

Yesterday, when I drove by your house
The sign out front said that you're moving out
I know why you'd wanna leave this town
But if you wanna talk
I'm better now

I'm ready to fall in love again
I'm ready to call you up again
I'm ready to talk and be your friend
I'm ready to fall in love

I still got your number memorized
I feel your body when I close my eyes
Do you still listen to Nirvana?
I used to play that record all the time

I'm ready to fall in love again
I'm ready to call you up again
I'm ready to talk and be your friend
I'm ready to fall in love
I'm ready to fall
Again
I'm ready to call
Again
I'm ready to talk
Again
I'm ready to fall

I fucked up and now I see it
I get if you don't believe it
I'm sorry, this time I mean it
I'm sorry, this time I mean it
I fucked up and now I see it
I get if you don't believe it
I'm sorry, this time I mean it

I'm ready to fall in love again
I'm ready to call you up again
I'm ready to talk and be your friend
I'm ready to fall in love again
I'm ready to fall
Again
I'm ready to call
Again
I'm ready to talk
Again
I'm ready to fall

The road that I travel is foggy and wide,
I lost my direction, I'm wanderin' from side to side

Heart beatin' fast, feet movin' slow,
No time to lose, but I sure got a long way to go, long way to go

Rough is the road, dark is the night,
I ain't gonna rest 'til I see the big city lights

Temperature's high, spirit is low,
No time to lose, but I sure got a long way to go, long way to go,
No time to lose, but I sure got a long way to go

I feel so tired, I feel so sad,
I need a rest, but that's too bad, I gotta keep movin'

I feel so tired, I feel so sad,
I need a rest, but that's too bad

Pain in my heart, dust in my shoes,
Ache in my body, I got the travelin' blues

How many miles, nobody knows,
No time to lose, but I sure got a long way to go, long way to go,
No time to lose, but I sure got a long, long, long way to go

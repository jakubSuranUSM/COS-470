Say it's a good clip is a real good way to go real fast say it 
I'm on track and I'm built for speed
Pull up the back on your mark ready set go
Teaser with pretty lines with shiny glass and perfect time ease up against my spine 

Because there's still a million miles to climb on your mark go!
Would I do what it takes if it would shut you off?
Now don't be so sure but don't make me have to find out 
I feel lucky you look nice I'm not gonna say it twice 

You're in my car now say it a good clip is a real good way to go real fast 
Could I do what it takes if it would shut you off? 
Now don't be so sure but don't make me have to find out 
I feel lucky you look nice and I'm gonna say it twice
You're in my car now

Verse
A amaj7 d a
I knew virginia once she was a pretty girl
D a d e
She walked in the wild fields and swam the wild streams
A amaj7 d a
I took her out one day to the civil war battlefield
D a d e
Way down in manassas where I told her my dreams

Chorus
A amaj7 d a
But now it's disney's america a long way from anywhere
D a d e
With a brand new coat to wear with a brand name on the seams
A amaj7 d a
Just disney's america virginia she chose to stay
D a e a
And we drifted apart like runoff into the chesapeake bay

Verse
Then I had a family virginia, I guess she forgot about me
She lives near the concrete sea or so people say
I don't remember much about her gentle touch
My skin just turned so hard and my feet turned to clay

Chorus
It was in disney's america a long long way from anywhere
You get what you pay for there man you get it in spades
Just disney's america virginia she chose to stay
And we drifted apart like runoff into the chesapeake bay

Bridge
D f#m a e
You can't get too excited you can't get too enthused
D f#m a e
From dismal land to the tragic mountain we are not amused

Yeah I knew virginia once she, she was a pretty thing
She walked in the wild fields and swam in the wild streams

Chorus
But now it's disney's america that's where we collect our pay
Where we drifted apart like runoff into the chesapeake bay
A
Yeah we drifted apart like runoff into the chesapeake bay

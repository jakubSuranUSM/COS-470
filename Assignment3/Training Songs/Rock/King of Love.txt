Let's go, king of love
Ooh, it's ugly, falling into lovely
Everyone does it, everyone knows it

Ay-ay-ay-o (ay-ay-ay-o)
Sound off (sound off)
The king of love is but a fool
The power overcomes his rule
Within himself there is a duel
Ay-ay-ay-o (ay-ay-ay-o)
Sound off (enough, sound off)
All through the big city
Ex-marines are looking gritty
Looking for a little pretty
Ay-ay-ay-o (ay-ay-ay-o)
Sound off (enough, sound off)

I think I hear the king falling down-down-down
I think I hear the king falling down-down-down
The king of love (sound off)

High school cherry top
Working in a soda shop
That's not good enough
She wants to meet the king of love
Ay-ay-ay-o (ay-ay-ay-o)
Sound off (sound off)
Ay-ay-ay-o (ay-ay-ay-o)
Sound off (sound off)
I think I hear the king falling down-down-down
I think I hear the king falling down-down-down
The king of love (sound off)

Schools out 2:45
Five tricks before six
Dope comes real soon
King of love is on the moon

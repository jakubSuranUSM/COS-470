The man at the back has a question
His tongue's involved with solutions
But the monkey on my back
Won't stop laughing

Over the wall
Hand in hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

There's something to be said for you
And your hopes of higher ruling
But the slug on my neck
Won't stop chewing

Over the wall
Hand in hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

I'm walking in the rain
To end this misery
I'm walking in the rain
To celebrate this misery

What's that you say?
Speak up I can't hear
What did you say?
I couldn't hear

Over the wall
Hand In hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

Pounding the road
Coast to coast
Pounding the road
Coast to coast
Come over the wall

I can't sleep at night
How I wish you'd hold me tight
I can't sleep at night
Come on and hold me tight

Hold me tight
To the logical limit

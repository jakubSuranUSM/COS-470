I know something about love
You gotta want it bad
If that guy's got into your blood
Go out and get him

If you want him to be
The very part of you
Makes you want to breathe
Here's the thing to do

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him tell him tell him tell him right now

I know something about love
You gotta show him
And make him see the moon up above
Go out and get him

If you want him to be
Always by your side
If you want him to
Only think of you

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him tell him tell him tell him right now

Ever since the world began
It's been that way for men
And women were created
To make love their destiny

They why should true love be
So complicated oh 
I know something about love
You've gotta take him

And show him what the world is made of
One kiss could prove it
If you want him to be
Always by your side

Take his hand tonight
Swallow your foolish pride

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him tell him tell him tell him right now

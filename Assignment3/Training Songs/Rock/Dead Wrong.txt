Lived in the city on a street on a street with no name
It felt good to be out in the rain
In the city I can't remember my name
In this city I can't remember my name

Do you pretend to be asleep?
When she's awake
Do you remember how we laughed?
Do you remember anything?

Now everybody doing everybody wrong
And everybody singing everybody elses song
And everybody thinks that there in love

They're dead wrong
They're dead wrong
When I was young I caught a glimpse

A shadow in the dark
Started a war with a kiss
Stared a forest fire with a spark

Now everybody's ding everybody wrong
And everybody singing everybody else's song
And everybody thinks that there in love
But they're dead wrong

They're dead wrong
They're dead wrong
They're dead wrong
They're dead wrong
They're dead wrong

They're dead wrong on
They're dead wrong on
Dead dead wrong on
Dead dead wrong on

There dead wrong aong
There dead wrong ong
They're dead wrong

Ba ba ba da da da badada da
Ba ha ba la la
Do do do doot doot
Do do doolot do do do
Doot do do do

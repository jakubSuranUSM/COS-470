Like a spotlight that breaks into the darkness
Like an arrow that's racing to its target
I got you in my sight 
I am fixed on you
And I can feel you calling lookin' for me too

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you and made brand new
Collide

In the aftermath of your hurricane
It won't be what I lost but I stand to gain
So bring your storm to me cause I know when it's through

The clouds will roll away
As sky will turn to blue

Nothing's gonna stop me I know what I'm doin'
Make somethin' beautiful from out of the ruins

Collide, crash unto me
Collide, I want to be broken by you and made brand new

Rearrange me
Only you can save me

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you and made brand new
Collide

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you and made brand new
Collide.

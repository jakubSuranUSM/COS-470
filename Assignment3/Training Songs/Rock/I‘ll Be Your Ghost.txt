Lay me on your bed of nails
Tie me to your whipping-post
I'll let you kill me
And I'll be your ghost

I'd walk over broken glass for you
I'd crawl over burning coals for you
I'd do all the things you'd have me do
And I would gladly give my life for you

I'd hang myself in iron chains for you
I'd whip myself with razor wire for you
If you'd only promise to kiss my wounds
I would gladly give my life to you

Oh, enough of this torment
I am praying on broken knees
Let this cup pass my lips, oh lord
I wish only to be with thee

It's not what I can see
It's not what I can hear
It doesn't trouble me
But still it's around

You know what I'm thinking
And when I'm celebrating
I feel your eyes on me
But I can't see you

You understand I'm not afraid
Of your complete devotion now
But if it ever gets out of hand
I'll bring you down

Everywhere I go you're there
Everywhere I go you're there
Everywhere I go you're there
Can't you see you're driving me insane?

I'm not advertising
Or am I criticizing
But if I had a choice
You'd leave me alone

It's not that I've done wrong
I never think I'm wrong
But when you're watching me
I feel so guilty

It's not the way I thought it'd be
The lack of all my privacy
And if it ever gets out of hand
I'll bring you down

(Repeat Chorus)

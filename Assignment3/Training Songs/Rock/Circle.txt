There are two of us talking in circles 
And one of us who wants to leave 
In a world created for only us 
An empty cage that has no key 
Don't you know we're working with flesh and blood 
Carving out of jealousy 
Crawling into each other it's smothering 
Every little part of me 
What kind of love is this that keeps me 
Hanging on 
Despite everything it's doing to me 
What is this love that keeps me coming 
Back for more 
When it will only end in misery 
I know too many people unhappy 
In a life from which they'd love to flee 
Watching others get everything offered 
They're wanton for discovery 
Oh my brother my sister my mother 
You're loosing your identity 
Can't you see that it's you in the window 
Shining with intensity 
What kind of love is this that keeps me 
Hanging on 
Despite everything it's doing to me 
What is this love that keeps me coming 
Back for more 
When it will only end in misery

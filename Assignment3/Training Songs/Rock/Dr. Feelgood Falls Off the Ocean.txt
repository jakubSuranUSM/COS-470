Mechanical brains are invading my head power
Shadows that pass breathing life in the night
I never can be what you want me to be now
The house plant is dying
I think it needs water

And if you could be anywhere in the world now
And if you could have any object desired
You'd be wired
And where were you going when you had it in my face
Forcing a door key that just won't fit in
And fixing the lock even though it's not broken
Knocking down the scenery
And planning an eatery

And if you could be anywhere in the world now
And if you could have any object desired
You'd grow tired

Please come to Boston in the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends, and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston

I said, 'No, would you come home to me?'
And I said, 'Hey, ramblin' boy, now won't cha settle down?
Boston ain't your kinda town

There ain't no gold, and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee'
Please come to Denver with the snowfall

We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw 'I love you' echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night till they come back around
Please come to Denver

I said, 'No, boy, would you come home to me?'
And I said, 'Hey ramblin' boy why don't cha settle down?
Denver ain't your kinda town

There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
'Cause I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee'
Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found

And all that I ain't got
I still need to cling to
Somebody I can sing to
Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky

Livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA
But I just said, 'No, boy, won't you come home to me?'
And I said, 'Hey, ramblin' boy, why don't cha settle down?
LA can't be your kinda town

There ain't no gold, and there ain't nobody like me
No, no, I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee'
'I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee'

If I had a girl like you
I wouldn't treat her so cruel
I'd hold her in my arms each night
And this is what I'd do

I'd give her, lots and lots of lovin'
Lots of kissing too
I'd do anything she'd ask me to
But I don't have a girl like you

We've been friends I know so long
But this you've gotta know
If I ever get the chance
This is what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna
Give her lots of lovin'
Lots of kissing too
I'd do anything she'd ask me to
But I don't have a girl like you
Oh no
I don't have a girl like you

You treat her mean and you make her cry
You say she could never be mine
But you better change your foolish ways
'Cause you're running out of time

'Cause someday she'll realise
That you're gonna let her down
And when she falls I'm gonna catch her
And this is what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna, give her lots of lovin'
Lots of kissing too
I'd do anything she'd ask me to
But I don't have a girl like you
Not yet
I don't have a girl like you
Maybe soon
I'll have a girl like you
Won't be long now
I'll have a girl like you
Woah yeah
I'll have a girl like you

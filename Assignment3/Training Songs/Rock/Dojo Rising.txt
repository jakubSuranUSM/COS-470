I could beat my-self down
You don't need to bother
If I didn't mind the distance
It would probably make me stronger

Give it to me easy
Give it to me hard
Just wanna get get get lit, yeah
Then I’m gonna break your heart
Should have probably told you from the start
But I’m lazy
And I don't want anything, yeah
And I don't want anything, yeah
Alright

I could talk to your boss
Meet him in the car park
Let’s talk about logistics
That will make me feel so, good

Give it to me easy
Give it to me hard
Just wanna get, get, get lit, yeah
Then I’m gonna break your heart
Should have probably told you from the start
But I’m lazy
And I don't want anything, yeah (and I don't want anything)
And I don't want anything, yeah (and I don't want anything)
And I don't want anything, yeah (and I don't want anything)
And I don't want anything, yeah (and I don't want anything)

Give it to me easy,
Give it to me hard
Get lit
Give it to me easy,
Give it to me hard (trillo on hard)

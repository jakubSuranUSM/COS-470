She'll be the bride
Of the darkness, open wide
She'll feel the bite
Of the night before the pride

And he feels alright
When the shadow comes alive
Feeding on the night
She's gone to the other side

Dead, Dead
So dearly departed
Dead, Dead
So lost and brokenhearted

Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead 
All they want to do is rock

When the moon is high
Still air and the candles die
Here comes the bride
Raven hairs get milky white
She's hot as ice
You can't keep her off your eyes
Don't you even try 
She's gone to the other side

Dead, Dead
So dearly departed
Dead, Dead
So goddamn brokenhearted

Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead 
All they want to do is rock

Dead, Dead
So dearly departed
Dead, Dead
So goddamn brokenhearted

Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead, Dead
Dead girls are easy
Dead 
All I ever wanted to do is rock

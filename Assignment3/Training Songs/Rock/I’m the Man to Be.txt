I'm a hanging happy sock tonight
My hotel's on the Katong line
Can't focus an in vitro mind
If only I could think
But the belt's too tight

Can't reach a cotton ball to dry
The little teardrop underneath my right eye
I can use my Louis Vuitton tie
If only I could think but the belt's too tight

I'm peaceful cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites
Cause I'm the man to be

I couldn't get ahold of my big sister
When I tried to call her just to tell her that I missed her
I called and cried to room service instead
I'm drinkin' Malin and Goetz under the bed

I can't move
I can't talk
I can't sleep
I can't walk

I can't move
I can't talk
I can't sleep
I can't walk

Can't leave me up a crick all night
Erin Brockovich is not my wife
I'm such a baby I could totally cry
My hands are so sticky and the belt's too tight

I'm peaceful cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites
'Cause I'm the man to be

I'm peaceful cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites
'Cause I'm the man to be

I'll be the one in the lobby in the collared f*ck me shirt
The green one
I'll be the one in the lobby in the green collared f*ck me shirt
The green one

(Hello?)
Hello, come on in
(Um)
Sorry, I'm just-hello?
(Yes!)
K, come on in
(Okay, thanks)
Sorry, yeah
(It's okay, how's everything?)
It's great

Take just a little sample of a sample
Of wet sage and rusting honey suckle for example
I'm not afraid to die a little tiny bit
I just don't want it to hurt coming out of it

Can't move
I can't talk
I can't sleep
I can't walk

Can't move
I can't talk
I can't sleep
I can't walk

Mama's on the spectrum
Daddy's on the borderline
I'm from fucking Delhi
Not fucking Over the Rhine

I'm peaceful cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites
'Cause I'm the man to be

I'm peaceful cause my dick's in sunlight
Held up by kites
'Cause I'm the man to be

I'll be the one in the lobby in the collared f*ck me shirt
The green one
I'll be the one in the lobby in the green collared f*ck me shirt
The green one

I can't even look at reviews anymore
I score an 8.6 on a fucking par 4
Hanging like a ragdoll from the door
'Cause I'm the man to be

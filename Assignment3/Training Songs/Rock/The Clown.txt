I'm just a clown 
With a broken heart
A lonely boy
Playing a part
Others may love
And be loved in return
But a clown's love
Is never returned

Tears in my eyes
When no one can see
A smile on my lips
When you are near me
No one will know
It's only a part
I keep on playing
With a broken heart

CHORUS:
I thought that you could love me
That I had found the one
But who can love a fool
Yeah, who...who can love a clown

Tears in my eyes
When no one can see
A smile on my lips
When you are near me
No one will know
It's only a part
I keep on playing
With a broken heart
I keep on playing
With a broken heart..I keep on playing...(FADE)

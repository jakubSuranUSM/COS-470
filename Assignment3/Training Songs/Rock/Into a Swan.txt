What in the world is happening?
What in the world could this be?
I'm on the verge of an awakening
A new kind of strength for me

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out, I'm transformed

Rising up, shaking it up, a yesterday dreary
Graceful and strong, no more for long
Today's a jubilee
Don't be surprised this change is my design

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out, I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I can't hold it down I've just got to soar
And laugh in the face that is vulture law
I burst out, I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I don't want to fight it anymore
Feelings so strong can't be ignored
I burst out, I'm transformed

I feel a force I've never felt before
I can't hold it down I've just got to soar
And laugh in the face that is vulture law
I burst out, I'm transformed
I burst right out into a swan

I burst out into a swan

I feel a force
I don't want to fight it
I feel a force
I just want, I just want

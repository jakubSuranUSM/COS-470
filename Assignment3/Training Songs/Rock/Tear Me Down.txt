Don't you know me Kansas City?
I'm the new Berlin wall 
Try and tear me down!

I was born on the other side
Of a town ripped in two
I made it over the great divide
And now I'm coming for you

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose from off of the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
Now everyone wants to take a stab, and decorate me
Blood, graffiti and spit

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down

On August 13th, 1961
A wall was erected down the middle of the city of Berlin
The world was divided by a Cold War
And the Berlin wall was the most hated symbol of that divide
Reviled, graffitied, spit upon
We though the wall would stand forever
And now that it's gone
We don't know who we are anymore
Ladies and gentleman Hedwig is like that wall!
Standing before you in the divide
Between east and west
Slavery and freedom
Man and woman
Top and bottom
And you can try to tear her down
But before you do, you must remember one thing!

There ain't much of a difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle, babe
You would be nothing at all

Enemies and adversaries
They try and tear me down
You want me baby, I dare you
Try and tear me down

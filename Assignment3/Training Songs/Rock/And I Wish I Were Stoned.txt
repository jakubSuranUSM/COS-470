Once I had a dream, nothing else to do
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
Got down in the road
Crossed my heart and cried
When you told me how you`d love
To live and not to die

Why why why?
I wish I were stoned on my mind
Why why why, oh why?

Dreamed I saw a man walked upon the sea
Dreamed it once again and saw that he was me
Looking close at me I looked a lot like you
Knowing where to go but not quite what to do

Why why why?
I wish I were stoned on my mind
Why why why, oh why?

Give me all your love in a smile
And I`ll tell you what I`m thinking
Let me see the world through your eyes
And I`ll show you where I`m sitting

Once I had a dream, nothing else to do
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
Got down in the road
Crossed my heart and cried
When you told me how you`d love
To kill and not to die

Why why why?
I wish I were stoned on my mind
Why why why, oh why?

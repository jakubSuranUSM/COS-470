I saw the ages brought down by fear 
Watch them run off and return for years and years 
Sought out the lights making all lost clear 
As we dried out our blank-stares from ear to ear 

Here we are 
Suit up we're ready to fight the war 
Watch the birds carry on while we settle for more 
Crawled out our house to mend the scars 
As we weld together they fall so far 

Soon all the pieces of broken time 
Held together for seconds what's left to find 
Throw out your backs and hold up your arms 
As we march out the temples return to the stars 

Here we are 
Complicated matters in my frame 
As we make our way out to the sun 
Journey through it all we'll try to tame 
And we're doing it before it's done 

Make our marking out through all the woods 
As we fling our bodies in the sun 
It was coming up becoming way to clear 
It's a feeling I can never sell

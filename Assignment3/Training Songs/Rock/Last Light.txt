Night comes in and takes our light
As we turn once again in the sun
We don't have to drift out of sight
But shadows will fall and run

Yeah, they'll run, they will run, they will run
As the day in time will be done
In the end there will be perfect endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Green turns gold and the gold turns green
As we turn one more time past the sun
Light like no one else has seen
As the shadows will shift to none

Yeah, they'll run, they will run, they will run
As the day's last light soon is done
In the end there will be only endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Your boat tipped straight upright
You thought that sleep was dyin'
You thought it was your time
To give into the endless night

No, you were not right
And I said, "No it's not, there really is enough
It might just be too much in a couple of weeks
Twenty hours or in ten minutes"

Sky hangs heavy in the lowest light
As the day slips down past the sun
Black and blue in the forest green
Shadows are gone, they have run

They've run, they have run, they have run
As the days last light now is done
In the end we can see perfect endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Your boat tipped straight upright
You thought that sleep was dyin'
You thought it was your time
To give into the endless night

No, you were not right
And I said, "No it's not, there really is enough
It might just be too much in a couple of weeks
Twenty hours or in ten minutes"

I can feel your hand let go of mine
Drift you to where there isn't any light
And I can never sleep enough, that's right
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night

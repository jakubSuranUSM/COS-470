Hey come on little sister
Let's go up to the moon
She said "honey I don't care
And I want no lies".
Don't need no gales

No poems
No story from outside
No shelter inside

So listen pretty babe
Why don't we jump in any train ?
To draw nearer to the storm
She said "I don't like rain"
Don't need no gales

No poems
No story from outside
No shelter inside
All right ?!

There's nothing I can do
A part trainer sur les g'noux
Please don't carry on
I'm a frail boy
Do you want to shoot me down ?
But you know sweety girl
I'd like to talk with you again
I'm like a dog give me some bone
She said "hey you're not gone ?!"
Don't need no gales

No poems
No story from outside
No shelter inside
All right ?!

There's nothing I can do
A part trainer sur les g'noux
Please don't carry on
I'm a frail boy
Do you want to shoot me down ?
Don't need

Needin' you, wonderin' what to do
Baby, I've been away
And even so, maybe I should go
Is there nothin' that you wanna say
Just keep it nice, baby what's your price
Cause it looks as though I have to pay
For something clean, only some machine
But she never lets it in her way, no

Gimme love, I need lovin'
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love, oh yeah
Gimme love

I'm feelin' used, and baby I'm amused
Cause there's something that I shoulda done
Like take my time, or used another line
But I had to get on the run
Can't you see, I don't wanna disagree
There's a chance that we could lose the feel
Let's keep it light, to get us through the night
Do you say you wanna make a deal

Gimme love, gimme lovin'
I need love, yes I do
Gimme love, gimme love, oh yeah
Gimme love

Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love
I need love, gimme love

Gimme love, gimme love, some good lovin'
Gimme love, gimme love, I need love (oh yeah)
Gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love, oh yeah
Gimme love, gimme love, I need love
Gimme love, gimme love, oh yeah
Gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme love

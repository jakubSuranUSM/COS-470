Hold still the sight
When it falls down
Came back to life I see
No one around

Like I said [Repeats]
Look 'em in the eye
For a minute or two
Of course that was all they saw
Nothin' left for you

Like I said [Repeats]
Most of them knew
What they had read
Objects from underneath

Was like I said [Repeats]

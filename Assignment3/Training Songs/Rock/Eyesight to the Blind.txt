You don't know me
And you never hold me
Like your little piece on the side
My mother told me
That you're never lonely
When you're laughing, all the time
Inside-out and outside-in
You bring eyesight to the blind
Crying, is a crime
Slowing down the metronome
Slowing down
Slowing down the metronome
Slowing down
You don't know me
And you never hold me
Like your little boy in blue
My father told me
That you're always lonely
When they're all laughing at you
Inside-out and outside-in
You bring jesus to the jew
Slowing down the metronome
Slowing down
Slowing down the metronome
Slowing down
You don't love me
And you never hold me
Like your little piece on the side
Inside-out and outside-in
You bring eyesight to the blind

I got a problem burning through my veins,
I got a tattoo on my arm with your name.
A Ragin' virus burnin' through my skin,
Can you tell me why this has to end?

I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I didn't mean to shed no, shed no blood yeah.
Maybe I was trippin' baby, you know what I mean,
Maybe that someday you'll believe in me yeah.
Maybe you'll believe in me

I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I need you.
I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I but I need you.

I've been seein' demons and I've been seein' saints,
I've tried pretendin' that I'm somebody that I ain't.
I could be the beggar down upon his knees,
But I've seen the truth 
It's gonna set me free yeah.
Baby you will set me free

I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I need you.
I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I but I need you.

I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I need you.
I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I don't want to but I but I need you.
I miss you, I hate you, 'cause I feel you,
I miss you, I miss you baby.

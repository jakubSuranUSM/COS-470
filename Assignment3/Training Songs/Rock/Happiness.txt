Happiness yeah
Happiness is like tv
On or off
It's up to me
Happiness yeah
Relationships
Are like a cow
Growing strong
Just for now
Poor little cow
Mom and dad
Are like my head
I won't listen to them
Until they're dead
Or I'm dead

Sad but true
Sad but true
Self indulgence
Inconsiderate bitch
Inconsiderate bitch
You're nothing more than this girl
c'mon everybody, sing
Pain and sadness
Are real to me
They stick around
And let me be
Give it up
Try again
Give it up
Try again
Ain't life fun?
Happiness
Sad but true
Sad but true

Self indulgence
Inconsiderate bitch
Inconsiderate bitch
Ain't nothing more than this
Inconsiderate
Bitch
Yeah
Give it up
Try again
Give it up
Try again
Ain't life fun
Happiness?
Sad but true
Sad but true

Self indulgence
Inconsiderate bitch
Inconsiderate bitch
Ain't nothing more than this
You're inconsiderate

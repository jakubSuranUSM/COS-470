Well it's a low down kinda condition
Been running round my brain
Says it may drive me insane

And every organism
That I can hear and see
Seems to have the blues with me

So I went to the doctor
Sat down on her bed
Looked up right at her
This is what she said

You're in a human condition
That's what's got you down
Human condition
Your face is full of frowns
You've got to stand your ground

Well, you're sad, weak and weary
She went on to say
Nothing seems to go your way

And though you've tried and tried
You can't be satisfied
No-one seems to treat you right

But there's one thing for certain
That you ought to know
There's been lots of people
In that scene before

You're in a human condition
That's what's got you down
Human condition
Your face is full of frowns
You've got to stand your ground

Well I stood up and I left her
And slowly walked away
Looking for a brighter day

And as I thought about it
A new thought came to me
Maybe we cannot be free

Well a whole lot of bad things
The world might throw at you
Stand up straight and strong
It's the only thing to do

You're in a human condition
That's what's got you down
Human condition
Your face is full of frowns
You've got to stand your ground

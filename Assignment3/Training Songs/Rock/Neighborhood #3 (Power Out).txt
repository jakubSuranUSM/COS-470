I woke up with the power out,
Not really something to shout about.
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are swingin' from the power lines,
Nobody's home, so nobody minds.

I woke up on the darkest night,
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light.
(We found the light)
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small.

I went out into the night.
I went out to pick a fight with anyone.
Light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans.
Growin' up in some strange storm,
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm.

I went out into the night,
I went out to find some light.
Kids are dyin' out in the snow,
Look at them go, look at them go!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.

What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide.
Just light a candle for the kids,
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid!

Cause nothin's hid, from us kids!
You ain't foolin' nobody with the lights out!

And the power's out in the heart of man,
Take it from your heart put in your hand.
And there's something wrong in the heart of man,
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!

Where'd you go?

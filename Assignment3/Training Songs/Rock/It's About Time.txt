Bite my tongue
And I won't say a word against anyone
But I don't wanna get my fingers wet
Unless it's an accident

Fell out on the street
Now I'm watching my shoes and I grit my teeth
But I don't have to look that way
If I had half a say

It's about time
It's about time
Lick my lips
And I won't hear the end of this

On your knees a reassurance
Buy some time and come back for it

Before long
Before it's gone

Patience is like bread I say
I ran out of that yesterday

It's about time
It's about time

Enough about us
Let's talk about me
If not about you
It's not about sunshine

It's about time
It's about time
Touch my leg
It's smooth but there stubble there

I'll fall back and let them go
Only when I know you know

I don't know
Make me sure

Have your people contact mine
And keep your lawyer on the line

It's about time

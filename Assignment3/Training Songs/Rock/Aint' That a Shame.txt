You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart when you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

Farewell, goodbye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

Instrumental interlude
You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

Farewell, goodbye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame
You're the one to blame

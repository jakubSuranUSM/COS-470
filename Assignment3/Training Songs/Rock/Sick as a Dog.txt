Please, I just got to talk to you
Please, well keep your head out of the loo
Please, we're a long, long way from home
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, you're really ain't that young

Please, you were much to my surprise
Please, you're a lady in disguise
Please, you're the only friend I got
Please, you'll be the last to see me rot

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, 'cause you really ain't that young

Please, it's a shame you're so refined
Please, she was the last thing on my mind
Please, don't be late to take it light
Please, you're gonna bay into the night

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, 'cause you really ain't so young

Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Save the night
Take it light

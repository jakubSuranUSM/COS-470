She's got a fine lookin' figure
When she's walkin' down the street
She gives a quick 'See you later'
To all the guys she meets

I want to hear her moan when I get her alone
When the action starts she says 'I got to go home'
She's a wind up, wind up
She's a wind up, wind up

She's a wind up, wind up
For I'd say okay but they don't mean what they say
She wears the low-cut dresses
And a high-heeled shoes

She was born to make it
I was born to lose
She makes the blackout sounds till the light goes down
And when I make a move she ain't nowhere around

She's a wind up, wind up
She's a wind up, wind up
She's a wind up, wind up
For I'd say okay but they don't mean what they say

Fine lookin' figure
Oh when she's walkin' down the street
She gives a quick 'See you later'
To all the guys she meets

I want to hear her moan when I get her alone
When the action starts she says 'I got to go home'
She's a wind up, wind up
She's a wind up, wind up

She's a wind up, wind up
For I'd say okay but they don't mean what they say
She's a wind up, wind up
She's a wind up, wind up

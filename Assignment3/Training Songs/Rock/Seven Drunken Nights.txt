As I went home on Monday night, 
As drunk as drunk could be.  
I saw a horse outside the door, 
Where my old horse should be.  
I called my wife and I said to her: 
Will you kindly tell to me,  
Who owns that horse outside the door,  
Where my old horse should be? 

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool,  
Still you cannot see.  
That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me.  
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,  
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before. 

As I went home on Tuesday  night, 
As drunk as drunk could be.  
I saw a coat behind the door, 
Where my old coat should be.  
I called my wife and  I said to her: 
Will you kindly tell to me,  
Who owns that coat behind the door,  
Where my old coat should be? 

Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk 
You silly old fool,  
Still you cannot see.  
That's a woolen blanket that my mother sent to me.  
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,  
But buttons on a blanket, sure, I never saw before. 

As I went home on Wednesday night,  
As drunk as drunk could be.  
I saw a pipe upon the chair, 
Where my old pipe should be.  
I called my wife and I said to her: 
Will you kindly tell to me,  
Who owns that pipe upon the chair 
Where my old pipe should be. 

Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk 
You silly old fool, 
 still you cannot see.  
That's a lovely tin-whistle, that my mother sent to me.  
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,  
But tobacco in a tin-whistle, sure, I never saw before. 

As I came home on Thursday nigh, 
As drunk as drunk could be.  
I saw two boots beside the bed, 
Where my old boots should be.  
I called my wife and I said to her: 
Will you kindly tell to me,  
Who owns them boots beside the bed 
Where my old boots should be.  

Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk 
You silly old fool,  
Still you cannot see.  
They're two lovely flower pots my mother sent to me.  
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,  
But laces in flower pots I never saw before. 

As I came home on Friday night, 
As drunk as drunk could be.  
I saw a head upon the bed, 
Where my old head should be.  
I called my wife and I said to her: 
Will you kindly tell to me,  
Who owns that head upon the bed, 
Where my old head  should be.  

Oh, you're drunk, you're drunk 
You silly old fool,  
Still you cannot see.  
That's a  baby boy, that my mother sent to me.  
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more,  
But a baby boy with his whiskers on, sure, I never saw before.

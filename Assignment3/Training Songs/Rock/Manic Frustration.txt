Child`s first trip away from home
Instant communication shown - no one knows
Ringing in my ear must be the phone
Pick my brain down to the bone - no one home
 
[Chorus]
Body touches are so cold
Someone saved her sweet soul
Tell me which way the river flows
Will you still love me when I`m old
 
Lifeline says I`m already dead
Open the window above my bed
I've been mislead
Dark crystals turn a shade of blood-red
From my feet to my head 
I`m already dead
 
[Chorus]

He said he loved me
He said he needs me
He said to Keeley he thinks I'm special
He didn't love me
He didn't need me
Got off with Keeley, she thinks she's special

(Reverend)
She used to go out
She used to get dressed up
An all the while
She's getting more messed up
And she looks out
Through the window pane
As all her friends
Are going out again

She used to smile
She used to go to bars
Now its just rattles
And baby food in jars
Know how she's feeling
Because there ain't no texts
I know she's reeling
They're at the multiplex

Mams and prams
Twelve week scans
Wish you weren't a story of the also-rans

(Reverend)
The family helps her
She takes him to his Nans
Gives her some time off
Go to the caravan
And she's a mother
Although it breaks her heart
Her friends don't know her
They've grown so far apart

Mams and prams
An twelve week scans
Wish you weren't a story of the also-rans

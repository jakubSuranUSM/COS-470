Lost in the battlefield of opposite extremes. I ponder on the embankment that stands in between the
monochrome and color entirety I see the beauty and chaos of fate and destiny. Stand in the balance
of forest equilibrium. Absorb every aspect of forest equilibrium. The fatality of optimism shall we not
embrace but evolve into the actual with grace. Outweigh the balance through excessive choice I
return to the wisdom of this equalateral place. Rebuild thy strength here in forest equilibrium.
Through irreligious choice in forest equilibrium. Through irreligious choice in forest equilibrium. Come
walk with me through violet smokescreens where both feet tread upon joys and agonies calm in all
we see, masters of destiny.

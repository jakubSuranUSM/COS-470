I've got my eyes on you
And I like what I see
And it won't be long
'Till you belong to me

I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna do my part
To make you fall in love
I'm gonna win your heart

There's no use for you to try to resist
My minds made up and you know you're gonna be kissed

I've got my eyes on you
And your lovin' charms
I won't be satisfied
'Till you're in my arms
There's no use for you to try to resist
My minds made up and you know you're gonna be kissed

I've got my eyes on you
And your lovin' charms
I won't be satisfied
'Till you're in my arms

I've got my eyes on you
And your lovin' charms
I won't be satisfied
'Till you're in my arms
I won't be satisfied
'Till you're in my arms

Woman
My love is never ending
Like a sea without a shore
Woman
I'm a fool guilty of old crimes
But you are the one I adore
Woman
When the world has emptied
And the planet is covered in dust
I will stand beneath the silver moon rising
Waiting to resurrect our love

Woman
My love is never ending
Like a sea without a shore
Woman
I'm a fool guilty of old crimes
But you are the one I adore
Woman
When the world has emptied
And the planet is covered in dust
I will stand
Stand beneath the silver moon rising
Waiting to resurrect our love

Woman
My love is never ending
Like a sea without a shore
Woman
I'm a fool guilty of old crimes
You are the one I adore
Woman
When the world has emptied
And the planet is covered in dust
I will stand
Stand beneath the silver moon rising
Waiting to resurrect our love

Love
Love
Love
Love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

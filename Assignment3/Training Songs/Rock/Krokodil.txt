I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil

Never had guts for much
Never had fun
Never was much for lives
But you're mine, by the sharp
Of my fucking teeth!

I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil
I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil

Shut up so I can think
Damn nerves, damn everything
Never was much for love
But you're mine, by the shine
Of my bloody teeth!

I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil
I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil

And when it starts to sting
Don't worry, gotta be clean
Never was much for sing
But you're mine, by the sharp
Of my fucking teeth!

I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil
I need to bite
Sweet krokodil, dil, dil, dil

Oh

Well God damn this plan has gone awry
(Like to see you try, like to see you try)
So now it's time to squash that fly
(Know the reason why, know the reason why)
All this, high kicks, take steps alone
(Beats good action, beats good action)
3D beats me I didn't know
(Going it alone, going it alone)

Don't you know?
My hands
Are the sands
That has blown
Don't you know?
My hands
Are the sands

Goodness you wish clean line get home
(Million miles alone, million miles alone)
Never see these things so stick with me
Til the anti-freeze, til the anti-freeze

Hot smouldering roads they never show
(Where you wanna be, Where you wanna be)
3D beats me I didn't know
(Going it alone, going it alone)

Don't you know?
My hands
Are the sands
That has blown
Don't you know?
My hands
Are the sands

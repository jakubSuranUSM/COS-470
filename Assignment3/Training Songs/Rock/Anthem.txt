I want something to think about
Nothing fancy, just new
I want something I can explore
Give me a bit of you
I want something to fill my time
I don't have much to do
I want something that I can hold
Give me a bit of you

Something about the way you are
Is different to anyone else
You make me forget myself
I'm doing things I've never done before
Things I couldn't tell my friends
And here I go again

I want something larger than life
Too big, too good to be true
I want something no-one else has
Give me a bit of you

Here you go

If you fear the angels above while you sleep
Then I'll be the blood, you paint on your door
Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep
But time is a story and there will be more

Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep
But time is a story and there will be more

And death in disgrace can seduce anyone
That needs to believe there’s judgment at hand
Or God may be kind and see you like a son
But time is a lion when you are a lamb

Or God may be kind and see you like a son
But time is a lion when you are a lamb

The years see the best of intentions and greed
They come without shame, they'll leave you with some
Men become old when their hurt becomes need
But time is a lover and your time is young

Men become old when their hurt becomes need
But time is a lover and your time is young

The sun is a soldier, out crawling the hills
Setting fire to every house that’s in view
Lighting the ruin of my hope and my will
Till I’m like a shadow and I’m falling on you
Crawling on you, oh, you know how I do

So sleep here with me and I’ll keep you close
For now while I try to live up to you
You can’t see the challenge of this I suppose
But time is a dare and I’m trying to

You can’t see the challenge of this I suppose
But time is a dare and I’m trying to

Time is a dare and I’m trying to
Time is a dare and I’m trying to
Time is a dare and I’m trying to

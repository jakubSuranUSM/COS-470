Listen, I got the shivers and the chills
Got an awful pile of bills to pay
That's the prize for all the thrills
Breakdown, I got the medals and the scars
Had the brains to get this far

Somehow I'll get by
Cause somewhere over there
Somewhere on the other side
All this pain we bear
Is all over
It's over

Thank you, for all the worst and all the best
All the time it takes to figure out
That is all some kind of test
And all I know is that

Somehow I'll get by
Cause somewhere over there
Somewhere on the other side
All this pain we bear
Is all over
It's over

Somewhere, somewhere over there
Somewhere on the other side
All this pain we bear
Is all over
It's over

Baby please don't go 
Baby please don't go 
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans 
You know I love you so 
Baby please don't go 
When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
When the man done gone down the county farm 
He got the shackles on 
Baby please don't go 
Don't leave me 
I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog kiss ya way down here 
When you walk along 
Baby please don't go

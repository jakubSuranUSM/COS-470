Oh no,
I can't believe,
Oh no I can't believe
How much I love you,
How much I love you
Cos' I can't messure it,
I can't only
Treasure it
How much I love you,
How much I love you
Life's a mystery,
It could be most
Anything
It could make you
Feel real smart
Oh darling, not all
When you stand by me
And hold me tenderly
That's when I
Start to grow
Oh Darling,
Don't you know
I feel regret,
And cloudy skies
You stand right there,
Before my eyes
And everything gets
Easier for me
Oh no,
I can't believe,
Oh no I can't believe
How much I love you,
How much I love you
Cos' I can't messure it,
I can't only
Treasure it
How much I love you,
How much I love you

Listen to me
I feel regret,
And cloudy skies
You stand right there,
Before my eyes
And everything gets
Easier for me...
Oh no,
I can't believe,
Oh no I can't believe
How much I love you,
How much I love you
Cos' I can't messure it,
I can't only
Treasure it
How much I love you,
How much I love you
You know that
I can't believe,
Oh you know that
I can't believe
How much I love you,
How much I love you

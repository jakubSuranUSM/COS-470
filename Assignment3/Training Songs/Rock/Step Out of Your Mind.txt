You gotta get out of your head
You gotta step out of your mind

You gotta be able to bend your brain
If you want to get on in this world
And you've got to be just a little insane
If you want to get on in this world

Do your living in a comic book
Be a Superman or a Captain Hook
ah-ah-ah, yeah!
ah-ah-ah, yeah!

You gotta get out of your head
You gotta step out of your mind

You gotta be able to blow your cool
If you want to get on in this world
You can't be afraid to be some kind of fool
If you want to get on in this world

Do your living in a crazy dream
Be a hero on a movie screen
ah-ah-ah, yeah!
ah-ah-ah, yeah!

You gotta get out of your head
You gotta step out of your mind

Jump jump, out of your head
Step step, out of your mind
Jump jump, out of your head
Step step, out of your mind
Jump jump, out of your head
Step step, out of your mind
Jump jump, out of your head
Step step, out of your mind

Without a trace you disappear
You must have felt me secret fear
Try to save face not seem to care
Try to be brave I was scared.

Now I'm running crazy in the dark
No idea where you are.
And I cant hear nothing but a sound, 
'Cause you don't ever want to be found

I'll search for years until the end,
Or till I find a better friend

Then I'll look back on my despair
And realize nothing fair

Now I'm running crazy in the dark
No idea where you are.
And I cant hear nothing but a sound, 
'Cause you don't ever want to be found

Now I'm running crazy in the dark
No idea where you are.
And I cant hear nothing but a sound, 
'Cause you don't ever want to be found

You get up every morning at the sound of the bell
You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell
'Till you're out on a midnight run
Losing your heart to a beautiful one
And it feels right as you lock up the house, turn out the lights
And step out into the night

And the world is busting at its seams
And you're just a prisoner of your dreams
Holding on for your life, 'cause you work all day
To blow 'em away in the night

The rat traps filled with soul crusaders
The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders
And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars
As you jockey your way through the cars
And sit at the light, as it changes to green, with your faith in your machine
Off you scream into the night

And you're in love with all the wonder it brings
And every muscle in your body sings
As the highway ignites, you work nine to five
And somehow you survive 'till the night
Hell, all day they're busting you up on the outside
But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside
And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight

And you know she will be waiting there
And you'll find her somehow, you swear
Somewhere tonight you run sad and free
Until all you can see is the night

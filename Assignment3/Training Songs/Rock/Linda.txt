I know a girl called Linda she's my hearts desire
This little girl called Linda sets my heart afire, 
Sets my heart afire

Uh-oh, can't you see you've got me in a whirl
It's as plain as it can be that you're my only girl

Please stay with me Linda don't ever leave me alone
'Cause I don't want to loose you I want you for my own, 
I want you for my own

Uh-oh, can't you see, you've got me in a whirl
It's as plain as it can be that you're my only girl

Please stay with me Linda don't ever leave me alone
'Cause I don't want to loose you I want you for my own, 
I want you for my own

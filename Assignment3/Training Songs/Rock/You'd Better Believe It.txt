I wandered far in lands unknown
'Til I came to my earthly home
Far away I found life's dreams
Drifting on a silver beam

You'd better believe it
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say

Traveling, twice the speed of light
Orion's stars are high tonight
Gentle madness touched my hand
Now, I'm just a cosmic man

You'd better believe it
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say

Traveling, twice the speed of light
Orion's stars are high tonight
Gentle madness touched my hand
Now, I'm just a cosmic man

You'd better believe it
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say
It's so easy to say

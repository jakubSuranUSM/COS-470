Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time

Reach for the sun, catch hold of the moon
They're both too heavy but what can you do?
Reach for the stars, smack into the sky
You don't want to live but you're chicken to die
Oh, you're chicken to die

Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time

Run for the money, caught short on the rent
Big ideas but the cash's all spent
The trouble with love is its other face
You just want the club but you don't want the race
No, you don't want the race

Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time

Run for the rose, get caught on the briar
You're warming to love, next thing, there's a fire
You got the do re, I got the mi
And I got the notion, we're all at sea
Yes, we're all at sea

Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time

Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time

Run, run, run for the roses
Quicker it opens, the sooner it closes
Man, oh, man, oh, friend of mine
All good things in all good time
All good things in all good time

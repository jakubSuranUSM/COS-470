I fell in love with a runaway, a little runaway girl 
Each night she's all that I dream about, my little runaway girl 
She used to make me glad 
Now I'm sad & I feel so bad 
Oh why must I always be waiting for little runaway girl? 

My friends all told me I'm wastin' time with my runaway girl 
How did I know it was just a line from my runaway girl 
She broke my heart in 2 
Now I'm blue; you'd be too 
If you were in love with a runaway, a little runaway girl 

Although she may not feel this love the way that I do 
Each night & day I'll pray that someday maybe she'll come through & then... 

I know I won't be a lonely boy with my runaway girl 
'Cause now I'll be more than just a toy for my runaway girl 
If she comes back to me 
I'll be free, then you'll see 
Oh, my heart will sing & be glad again with my runaway girl

So you're alive, I thought you was done
I'm gonna bring you down with my needle gun
Feel my pin prick tattoo your spine
Give it a minute, your life's entwined

With mine
Hear my laughter
In your head
It's a pity it's a shame

Nothing's been said
It's a vaccination joy
With the ultimate death toy
It's gonna make you run

Needle, needle gun

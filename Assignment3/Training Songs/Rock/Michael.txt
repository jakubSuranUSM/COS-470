This is where I'll be
So heavenly
So come and dance with me Michael

So sexy, I'm sexy
Come and dance with me Michael

I'm all that you see, you want to see
Come and dance with me Michael

So close now so close now
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Michael you're the boy with all the leather hips
Sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael you're the only one I'd ever want
Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance-floor
Michael you're dancing like a beautiful dance-whore
Michael waiting on a silver platter now
And nothing matters now

This is what I am, I am a man
Come and dance with me Michael

So strong now, it's strong now
Come and dance with me Michael

I'm all that you'll be, you'll ever see
So come and dance with me, Michael

So close now.
You're close now.
Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me. [Repeat: x2]

Michael you're the boy with all the leather hips
Sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael you're the only one I'd ever want
Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance-floor
Michael you're dancing like a beautiful dance-whore
Michael waiting on a silver platter now
And nothing matters now

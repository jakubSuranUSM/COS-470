If I love you
Will you understand?
When I follow you
Will you go?
Will you leave me
When I let you down?
Tell me, darlin'
Let me know
Love will bring you joy
Love will ease your pain
It's so helpful
And it's so kind
But when it's gone
I feel like dyin'
Tell me, darlin'
What's on your mind?
If I lose you
I will understand
But my heart - it'll never heal
Because I love you
And I need to know
Tell me, darlin'
What you feel?
If I love you
Will you understand
When I follow you
Will you go?

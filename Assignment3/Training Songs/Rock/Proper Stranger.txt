Dark day, windy city
Raincoat
On my shoulder
So take my hand and show me where to go
'Cause don't you know I'm the proper stranger, uh

Traffic lights, dusty sidewalks
Freeway people
On the move
Ah na na na na
So take my hand and show me where to go
'Cause don't you know I'm the proper stranger

I'm the proper stranger
Nobody knows my face or
Knows my name, no no, no no, no no, no no
Nobody knows where I'm goin' or
How I came, uh

Lost and found
No one claimed me
All alone
With a million others, auw
So take my hand and show me where to go
'Cause don't you know I'm the proper stranger, uh

Broke my mind
Had no spare
Nothing left
And no tomorrow
Ah na na na na
So take my hand and show me where to go
'Cause don't you know I'm the proper stranger, hah

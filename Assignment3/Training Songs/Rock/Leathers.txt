This is
Your chance revolt, resist!
Open your chest, look down, reach in.

Shedding your skin,
Showing your texture.
Time to let everything inside show.
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever, time to let
Everything outside you

This is
Your test come forth, confess!
Extend your tongue, speak out, go on

Shedding your skin,
Showing your texture.
Time to let everything inside show.
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever, time to let
Everything outside you
Shed your casing, show your lines
And shapes

Wear your insides, on the outside,
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside

?
Now and forever
Time to die

Shedding your skin,
Showing your texture.
Time to let everything inside show.
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever, time to let
Everything outside you
Shed your casing, show your lines
And shapes

Wear your insides, on the outside,
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside

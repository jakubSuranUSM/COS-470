You got me walkin' the floor
Like I never walked before
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
You know that's not fair
You got me pullin' out my hair
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
Because a good man is hard to find
I said a good man is hard to find
You hurt me so
I just had to let you know
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
Because a good man is hard to find
I said a good man is hard to find
You hurt me so
I just had to let you know
You should be ashamed
To hurt a good hearted man
To hurt a good hearted man
To hurt a good hearted man

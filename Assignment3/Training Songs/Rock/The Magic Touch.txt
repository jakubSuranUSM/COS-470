The magic touch

(The magic touch) There's something about your smile
I swear that it makes me weak
(The magic touch) And when I'm close to you
I find that it's hard to speak

(The magic touch) I act like a child of six
And I guess that it shows too well that 

You got the magic touch
And I'm caught in your spell

I said yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
It seems like magic, baby

You never convinced me that 
I'd be great but of petite size
(The magic touch) But something happens when 
I look into your eyes
(The magic touch) I try to defend myself 
But too late that I finally see that

You've got the magic touch
And you cast your spell on me

I said yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
They call it magic baby
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah) 
It's more like tragic baby

You got the magic touch
And you cast your spell on me

I said yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
It's more like tragic baby

That look that you wear so well
Is enough to make me melt
(The magic touch) I suddenly find myself 
In things I've never felt
(The magic touch) No use to deny it when 
A child can clearly tell that

You got the magic touch
And I'm caught in your spell

I said yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
It seems like magic baby
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah) 
It's more like tragic baby

You got the magic touch
You cast your spell
Oh yeah

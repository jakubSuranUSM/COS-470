Silent Whispers
Loud awakening
Lost myself in pointless missions 
Hope to live
Hope to learn
Hope to love
Hope to be forgiven
Leftover dreams forgotten
Misplaced thoughts, and empty spaces 
Waiting 
Waiting to be filled and found 
Spilt milk tears for other fears
Beat myself up through the years 
For my distant knowledge and neglect
For the ones I love
We left behind 
No crumbs to find our way home 
Love me now one, two, one spirit
I cannot hide in silence 
Take me, or leave me naked my cloth is surface anyway 
Leftover dreams forgotten
Misplaced thoughts, and empty spaces 
Waiting 
Waiting to be filled and found 
Spilt milk tears for other fears
Beat myself up through the years 
For my distant knowledge and neglect
Love me now one, two, one spirit
I cannot hide in silence 
Take me, or leave me naked my cloth is surface anyway 
Silent Whispers
Loud awakening
Silent Whispers
Loud awakening

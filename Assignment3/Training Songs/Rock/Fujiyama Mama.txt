Hey little baby you're the one I love so much
You're an angel you thrill me with your magic touch
Ooh when you kiss me and hold me tightly in your arms
I wanna tell you that you're the one for me
When I'm sleeping you're all I ever dream about
And in the daytime you're all I ever think about
When I am near you you set my heart and soul on fire
I wanna tell you that you're the one for me
You're the only one I'll ever long for you're very special set me all aglow
Won't you place the ring upon my finger cause darling I love you so
Hey little darling I want you for my dearly one
Please say you love me I'll be the queen upon you throne
We'll be so happy I know we'll ever never part
I wanna tell you that you're the one for me

You're the only one I'll ever long for

I ain't as beautiful as you
I ain't as beautiful as you
But in spite of the fact 
That I ain't noticed in a crowd
I know it ain't all bad

In the castle where I am the King
I will build up my arms
Until I cross my borders to conquer the world
On my one way crusade

I ain't as clever as I seem
In spite of the fact
That I am learning every day
I know it ain't all bad
I know that ain't all bad
If I look in the right direction

In my mind
In the castle where I am the King
I will build up my arms
Until I cross my borders to conquer the world
On my one way crusade

I say, I ain't as beautiful as you
I ain't as beautiful as you
But I may return though
To see the beauty of it all
I know that ain't all bad
I know it ain't all bad
If I look in the right direction

In my mind
In the castle where I am the King
I will build up my arms
Until I cross my borders to conquer the world
On my one way crusade
I say

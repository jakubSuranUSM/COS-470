I've been a drinking, biding my time,
I've loaded and wasted, by my design
I've been using myself, like I only I can,
But I understand that you understand.

'Cause just for a moment, I found my peace,
Just for a moment, I came across me,
Everything is, and there's nothing a-missing,
Well just for a moment, I found my bliss.

Just for a moment I found my peace,
Well just for a moment, I came across me,
Everything is, and there's nothing a-missing,
Just for a moment, I was complete.

Man Ray went cray cray over you
Capturing but never captured
You're my DC oh Lee, oh

Swim low
In the back dry in the night
Sample
Put it there, get the money
Keepa, keepa, keepa, keep me damn down
Let it low
Let me know where you go
Papa, papa, papa
Get me down
Deep, deep down
Pablo, let me know

One man's waste is another man's soap
Nice way of saying you're washed up
And I'm getting fed up like Oprah and her jet
Same mental state as a Vietnam vet
It's a war outside, ain't no one safe
Wave my Rollie like I'm Puffy and Mase
Still trying to escape, getting caught up in the web
Snakes in the grass and they snapping at your legs
You can burn down the village if you overcook the bread
A little game, maybe something you can borrow

If you don't have the ace of hearts
My dear, you're a lost man
Falcon for you, Anna, from the left arm of the falconer
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna L'Arl√©sienne

A little game, maybe something you can borrow
You get it then you get it, I just lead the horse to water
But I can't make 'em drink it
This weed got me thinking how
We ain't low tide but the ship still sinking
Don't wanna be alone when your skin start wrinkling
Uh, you gotta plan for the future
Live a little different than the average nigga used to
Everyday for me first a month for a dope fiend
Difference is I ain't runnin' 'round stealing flat screens
(Flat screens, flat screens, flat screens, flat screens)

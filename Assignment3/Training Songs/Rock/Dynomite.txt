Here's a story for the kids

This old man
He come a lot
It's in your hair 
And I don't care 
I'm not all right

No, I want to wait for someone like you 

This old girl 
She plays tricks 
It takes my sex 
To get a fix 
She's not all right 
She's not all right 
She's not all mine 

No, I want to wait for someone like you 
No, I want to wait for someone like you 
To make my life so dynamite 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah 
Turn this dark life into light 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah 
Make my world so shiny bright 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah 

You got me burnin' both ways 
I'mma explode 

This old man 
He just died 
He blew his head with dynamite 
He's not all right

To make my life so dynamite

To make my life so dynamite

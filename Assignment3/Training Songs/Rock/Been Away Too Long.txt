You can’t go home, no I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got no where to go and it seems I came back
Just filling in the lines for the holes, and the cracks

Hey, no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
I’ve been away for too long

This place has a sṗecial kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is

Hey, no one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long

I’ve been away for too long
I’ve been away for too long
Keyholes, trough keyholes
Where those
I am still hiding
Everyone inside
Tank girls and fly guns and silver boots on my way home

Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I’ve been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I’ve been away for too long

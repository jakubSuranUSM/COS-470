Reaching out in dead of night 
Emptiness by candlelight
Memory, a haunted sea
Souring in sudden rage

The damage plagued upon my love
Driven by this selfish urge
To separate yourself from me
But not the way you planned

The gambit flow of shifting thought
She'll write a kiss upon my cross
And with each moment of despair
Lay to heart a lovely tear

Within each bone the salty sea
Swims; an ocean silently 
Swims; the forest of my dreams
Swims; the essence I call me

Come bringing back now can't explain
The measures swept away in pain 
Hatred, will I escape your grasp?
Buried feelings let me pass

I cannot kill this final flame
The fire that once consumed my heart
But Hope must have some kind of fuel
And Chance must keep this fire

The gambit flow of shifting thought
She'll write a kiss upon my cross
And with each moment of despair
Lay to heart a lovely tear

Within each bone the salty sea
Swims; an ocean silently 
Swims; the forest of my dreams
Swims; the essence I call me

(sampled interlude)

The gambit thought...
The gambit flow...
The gambit...

The gambit flow of shifting thought
She'll write a kiss upon my cross
And with each moment of despair
Lay to heart a lovely tear

Within each bone the salty sea
Swims; an ocean silently 
Swims; the forest of my dreams
Swims; the essence of my being

The gambit flow of shifting thought
(Swimming out the tears in my eyes)
She'll write a kiss upon my cross
(Looking for the shore)
And with each moment of despair
(I hope that this is the last time)
Lay to heart a lovely tear
(I hope that this is the last time)

Within each bone the salty sea
(Swimming out the tears in my eyes)
Swims; an ocean silently 
(Looking for the shore)
Swims; the forest of my dreams
(I hope that this is the last time)
Swims; the essence of my being
(I hope that this is the last time)

The gambit flow of shifting thought
(Swimming out the tears in my eyes)
She'll write a kiss upon my cross
(Looking for the shore)
And with each moment of despair
(I hope that this is the last time)
Lay to heart a lovely tear
(I hope that this is the last time)

Within each bone the salty sea
(Swimming out the tears in my eyes)
Swims; an ocean silently 
(Looking for the shore)
Swims; the forest of my dreams
(I hope that this is the last time)
Swims; the essence of my being
(I hope that this is the last time)

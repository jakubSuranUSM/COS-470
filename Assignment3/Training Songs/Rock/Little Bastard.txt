Little Bastard
All fish belly white
Wears gym trunks
And a tank top shirt
When his Grandma
Sees him playing with a knife
She says, "Put that down,
You're gonna get hurt."
And she calls him Little Bastard
And she says it to his face
And he says, "Don't call me Little Bastard,
Call me Snake."
Little Bastard 
Has a re-occurring dream
That he's a pirate 
On a sea of snakes
And when the waves come
You can listen to him scream
As the tide runs
Down his leg

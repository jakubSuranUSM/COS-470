You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're tryin' hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin',
Now its gone, gone, gone whoaohoh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
Girl you're starting to criticize the things that I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby 
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dyin'

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Ohh that lovin'feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now its gone, gone , gone, whoaohoh

Baby baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me, like you used to do yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day,
So don't, don't, don't, don't, let it slip away
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I beg you please, please, please
I need your love, I need your love, I need your love, I need your love, I need your love
Oh bring it on back, oh bring it on back, bring it on back, oh bring it on back

Bring back that lovin' feelin', o-o-oh that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause its gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on whoa whoa

Bring back that lovin' feelin', o-o-oh that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause its gone, gone, gone

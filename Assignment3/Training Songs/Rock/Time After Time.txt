Time after time I tell myself that I;m
So lucky to be loved by you,
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through.

I only know what I know.
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young - so new.
And time after time you'll hear me say
That, "I'm so lucky to be loved by you."

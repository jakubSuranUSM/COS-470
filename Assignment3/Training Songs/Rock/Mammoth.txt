Yes, I feel like a mammoth today
Like I'm going to die
Yes, it seems I am lost anyway
And I'm finding out why

Maybe tomorrow
Stone age arrival
Maybe tomorrow
I'll be alright

Have you been like a mammoth sometimes?
Do you know what you felt?
Dare you speak about the social crimes?
You can feel the ice melt

Maybe tomorrow
Stone age arrival
Maybe tomorrow
I'll be alright

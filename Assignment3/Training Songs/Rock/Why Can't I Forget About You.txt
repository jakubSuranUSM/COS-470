The way I see it its no sin
The way I held you in the dark
Was the right way to begin
Why can't I forget about you

Stayed out drinking with my friends
Dancing with a girl or two
You know the story but the tale never ends
Why can't I forget about you 

Tell me why can't I forget you
Why can't I forget about you
Why can't I forget about you
Why can't I forget about you 

Leaving town just to forget 
Many miles away from you
Nothing to go back to
Tell me why can't I forget about you

Mosquitoes circling the pale porch light
They don't know it ain't no use
Thoughts come running in the middle of the night
Can't  believe I'm losing you 

Tell me why can't I forget you
Why can't I forget about you
Why can't I forget about you
Why can't I forget about you

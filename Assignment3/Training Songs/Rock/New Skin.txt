Ludicrous times
Heat waves sweet summer heat waves
Comatose in bed
Rag-doll existence
Wrapped up limbs confining me

Beautiful dreams
Bliss around the corner
Won’t allow ourselves
Not for us heaven is waiting
Sunsets and infinite love

Taunting us not for us
Wrap me up make me warm again
Imprison me with your love
Make me warm again
Please become me I’m lonely in my skin
Please become me I’m lonely in my skin
New skin

Ludicrous times heat waves sweet summer heat waves
Comatose in bed rag-doll existence
Wrapped up limbs confining me
Beautiful dreams
Bliss around the corner won’t allow ourselves

Not for us heaven is waiting
Sunsets and infinite love
Taunting us not for us
I’m in the driving seat not knowing where I’m going
And you are in the driving seat not knowing where you’re going
I’m in the driving seat not knowing that I’m going
Not knowing I’m going- New Skin
Ludicrous times

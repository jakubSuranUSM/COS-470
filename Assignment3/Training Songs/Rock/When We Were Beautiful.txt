The world is cracked
The sky is torn
I'm hanging in
You're holding on

I can't pretend
That nothing's changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made

Back, when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back, when we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let's go back and find it

Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la

Some dreams live
Some will die
But the you and me
Is still alive

Now am I blessed?
Or am I cursed?
'Cause the way we are
Ain't the way we were

Back, when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back, when we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let's go back and find it

The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Meant so much more

Back, when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back, when we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let's go back and find it

Back, when we were beautiful
Back, when we were beautiful
Back, when we were beautiful
Back, when we were beautiful

Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la

Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la, hey, sha la la

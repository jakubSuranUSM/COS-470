When your working is done
And you have nothing left to lose
Why don't you just roll away
That stone that's locked you up?

When your pattern is full
And it feels like there's no place to land
When will you all run out of gas?
Yeah, it happened so fast
Leaving town for sell to pal

I recall only nights that we built
With our hands and feet, making peace
With the voice in our head
That ghost just stop
Won't lie dead, it just bleeds

Let the prophet rebound
Let his riddle rub on to my pride
I'm just too hollow inside
Let it echo in time just to get it
Through my head and mouth

Through the gorgeous light of the sun
And which I could never outrun
Even if my perdition were just in front

The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light

The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light

Live without your light
Live without your light
Live without your light

When your working is done
And you've got nothing left to lose
Why don't you just roll away
That stone that's locked you up in your blues?

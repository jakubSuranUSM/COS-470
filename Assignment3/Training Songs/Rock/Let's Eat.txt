I'm vitamin-enriched
What's more, I'm absolutely wholesome!
No artificial processing or anything so loathsome!
You'll fancy me at lunch, not to mention tea
I'm easily digested naturally!

You'll want to slip me in your kitchen
How'd you like to mother me?
And I'll be tasty, Mr. Pastry, wouldn't that be lovely?
My mother once told me, "eat what you are given"
Don't worry mum, I've realised what fun that could be
It makes a real man of me now, I think you'll agree
I've got more calories than brown bread in me now
No-one can tell !!!

I'm vitamin-enriched

No artificial processing or anything so loathsome!
You'll fancy me at lunch, not to mention tea
I'm easily digested naturally!

So don't be scared by the thought
Of putting on three extra stone
Disregard all dieting information
It's best to leave well alone
You're better off fully grown!

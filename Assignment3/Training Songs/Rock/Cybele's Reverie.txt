But silence-trera means nothing, or it's just for the rhyme. Cybele's Reverie

Childhood is very nice
Childhood brings magic

What to do when one has done everything?
Read everything, drunk everything, eaten everything?
Given everthing in truth and in detail,
When one has cried on all the rooftops,
Wept and laughed in the towns and in the country?

Childhood is the most real
The garden of new visions

The house, the house, of other times
The house, the house that we have left

And the silence
That penetrates me

We three we're all alone living in a memory my echo my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd we're not even company my echo my shadow and me
What good is the moonlight the silvery moonlight that shines above
I walk with my shadow I talk with my echo but where is the one I love
We three we'll wait for you even till eternity my echo my shadow and me

We three we're all alone living in a memory my echo my shadow and me
What good is the moonlight

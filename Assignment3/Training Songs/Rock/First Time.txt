I had never thought
We were hanging on
But the fall looks very far
Staring at the ground

What flesh will do to you
Will do to me too
Be free and on your own
It's not that simple

It's never that simple
It feels like the first time
That we'd fallen behind
And we faltered too far down

No one could save us
It feels like the first time
And we're standing above them
And no one can touch us

The worst is over
I could say to you
A bitter word or two
There's no stopping now

Just get it out in the air
Heard it through the fog
And hurt by it all
I'd take it back today

But it's out of my hands
Lost in the film again
All the signs were showing
Watching a single frame

When the wind begins
You're never anywhere
'Cause you're caught in my 
Weather every time

Feels like the first time
We'd fallen behind
No use is the other one to wait
But I can hold on

As sure as I'm strong 
Get over the faithful yesterdays

Don't you know he's lonely
Don't you know he's blue
Can't you see he's crying
Every night for you

Why don't you tell him
Tell him that its over
Tell him that you no longer care
For love you thought was there
Why don't you tell him

If you really love me
Like I love you
You run right up to him
And tell him that you're through

Why don't you tell him
Tell him that its over
Tell him you found somebody new
It's the only thing to do
Why don't you tell him

Is it cause you're lonely
Is it cause you're blue
Is cause you still love him
Could all this be true

Why don't you tell me
Tell me that it's over
Tell me that you no longer care
The love you thought was there
Why don't you tell me
Get it over baby

Tell me it's goodbye
Stop calling me
Bye

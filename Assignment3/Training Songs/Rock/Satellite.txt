She's as free as a blue horizon
I'm a slave to this gravity
And every night I hope and pray that she'll come back down to me

I keep my eyes on the stars 
I track the heavens above my lonely world
I'm tracking her to ?
Shes my baby, shes my little satellite

We met at the lunar Hilton
On a sea of tranquility
And maybe I was dreamin'
But we was sacked up at the honey moon sweet

She was a wonderful girl
It was a heavenly night
But the stars were wrong
I woke up she was gone
Like a memory just out of site 
Shes my little satellite

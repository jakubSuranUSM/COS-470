Make whispers of these words.
If they've moved you, I can prove that they're empty.
I've been sailing paper ships under burning bridges since the beginning.
But I wouldn't change a thing if the days were there for changing.
I've learned enough from living.
I'm the one who reached for love and missed.
Can you come down to me?
I'll be waiting with that same look on my face.
I'm still stuck inside of sorrow though the days outside are flame.
And, I still comb the night for stars behind a wind-kissed windowpane.
I'm the one who reached for love and missed.
Can you come down to me?
Now the seasons stretch out like the landscape of this town.
When the seasons change, I'll be waiting with that same look on my face.
We all dance when the seasons change.

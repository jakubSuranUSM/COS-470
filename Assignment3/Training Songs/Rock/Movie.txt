I knew a boy, with twenty four carrat gold cheeks 
He lived in a hut, with four thousand three hundred other freaks

One day he found a friend
His friend had an oversized head
They walked down the cobbled streets
The sun blinking off his face, chase

The movie they played was different from yesterday
The movie they played was different from yesterday
Don't look so sad, it's time for your intermission
Don't look so sad, it's time for your intermission

While they were playing cards
The Government came crashing in
They told the boy he wasn't real
A scientific, experiment infusion
The movie they played was different from yesterday
The movie they played was different from yesterday
Don't look so sad, it's time for your intermission
Don't look so sad, it's time for your intermission

Don't look so sad
Don't look so sad

They lived for each other's love 
Don't look so sad
Things will never change
They lived for each other's love
Don't look so sad

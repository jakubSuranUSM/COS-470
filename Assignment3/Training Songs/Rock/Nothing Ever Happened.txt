Only when I dream but there's no way out
You learn to talk, you learn to shout
Focus on depth that was never there
Eliminate what you can't repair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passing, flash right through me

See through the wind to awakened stream
Adjust your eyes to the state of things
Focus on depths that was never there
Nothing's easy nothing's fair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passing, flash right through me

I never, saw it coming
Waiting for something, for nothing
I never, saw it coming
Waiting for something, for nothing

Well I could feel the sections of my brain detaching
I could feel the fluid in my head go bad
I could see my future in his leather jacket
Shining in the darkness of my schoolboy past

I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
Box of girl scout thin mints
And a pack of Winstons
I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
In a single incident I was changed

Now I'm a little creature
In the lazy evening
I'm a little creature
And they can't catch me
Lying semi-naked on his rooftop dreaming
Dreaming of the creature
That I used to be

I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
Box of girl scout thin mints
And a pack of Winstons
I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
And a new existence soon found me

It took a real long time
To find the border of a kingdom of love
Outside the reigning order
And I found my angel on a motorcycle
I'm a queer for life
Outlaw, outsider and uh

I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
In a single instance
I joined the true resistence
I lost my innocence 
To a boy named Vincent
In a single instant I set free

He comes to me
He comes to me and I'm already gone
He doesn't see
He doesn't see that we're hanging on

Blocking out the pieces of today
Trying to get back to yesterday

We're falling away
And there's nothing left but rain
No, there's nothing left here
All I hear is silence as I say
We're falling away
We're falling away
Falling Away

I go to him (I go to him)
I go to him and he's not really there
We can't begin (can't begin)
We can't begin to go anywhere

All is done, there's nothing left to say
Memories of his smile fade to grey

We're falling away
And there's nothing left but rain
No, there's nothing left here
All I hear is silence as I say
We're falling away

How can we care
When it's so clear
That we're not ending up
Where we're supposed to be

Just forget now
Let's forget somehow
Let's not regret all the things that we used to be

My eyes still blur
My eyes still blur from refusing to see
I'm just not sure (just not sure)
I'm just not sure we're meant to be

We're falling away
And there's nothing left but rain
No, there's nothing left here
All I hear is silence as I say
We're falling away
We're falling away

All I hear is silence as I say
We're falling away
Falling Away
Falling Away
Falling Away
Falling Away

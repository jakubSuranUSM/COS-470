Now we're one and I love you so 
Hold me, tight never let me go 
Make the feeling run up my spine 
You know I'm yours and you are mine 
Now that we are married baby, we don't have to worry

Now we're one
Now we're one and a-you're my bride
We don't have to run and hide
Every time I want to hold your hand
I'm afraid someone won't understand
Now that we are married baby, we don't have to worry

Now we're one
Well, I want to jump to the moon and yell out loud
I feel like I'm walking on an eighteenth cloud
We'll put all our fears and cares behind
Ever since we heard the wedding bells chime

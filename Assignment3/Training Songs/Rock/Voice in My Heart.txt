Something in your eyes, is telling me goodbye
I don't wanna see you walk away
Cause I've been waiting here so long
This feeling can't be wrong
I don't wanna see you walk away
Like a teardrop from the sky (fallin' just like tears)
Do you wanna see me cry

There's a voice in my heart, calling out your name
I don't wanna wait forever
And there's a fire in my eyes, burning deep inside
Please don't make me wait forever

As I watch you walk away, there's nothin' left to say
Friendships end sometimes
But somethin' in me cries, asking you why
Before you walk away

There's a voice in my heart, calling out your name
I don't wanna wait forever
And there's a fire in my eyes, burning deep inside
Please don't make me wait forever
Do you know what it is to cry, did you ever try

There's a voice in my heart, calling out your name
I don't wanna wait forever
There's a fire in my eyes, burning deep inside
Please don't make me wait forever
There's a voice in my heart, calling out your name
I don't wanna wait forever
And there's a fire in my eyes, burning deep inside
Please don't make me wait forever
There's a voice in my heart, calling out your name
I don't wanna wait forever
There's a fire in my eyes, burning deep inside
Please don't make me wait forever

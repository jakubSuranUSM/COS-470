Can you hear the war-cry?

The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
Welcome to the skirmish (I can’t feel my legs)
Give me morphine, give me morphine, give me more!

No doubt
This is a tragedy for all
(But it ain't over yet)
Head's up and thank f*ck you're still alive!

Still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
(We’re part of the last garrison)
Still alive
Still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
(We’re part of the last garrison)

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
“this could be the end” he said, “the end my child”
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Can you hear the war-cry?

The epinephrine plows through the barriers
Welcome to the skirmish (I can’t feel my arms!)
Give me opium, give me opium, give me help!

No doubt
This is a tragedy for all
(But it ain't over yet)
Head's up and thank f*ck you're still alive!

Still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
(We’re part of the last garrison)
Still alive
Still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
(We’re part of the last garrison)

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
“this could be the end” he said, “the end my child”
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Let’s toast to the fact we got this far

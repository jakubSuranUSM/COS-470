Wake up alone
Though you do what you're told it keeps coming
Coming

Matter of fact I liked you like that but I'm done in
Done in

Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
Sea
Sea

Observe exhibit A who never learned to stay
There's nothing in you for the light to hit
Grind it into the dirt to try and make it work
You won't be happy 'til we've drowned in it
We're never gonna fit

Considered the trade but promises made are worth nothing
Nothing

Whatever you say but walking away is still running
Running
(Darling)

Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
Sea
Sea

Observe exhibit A who never learned to stay
There's nothing in you for the light to hit
Grind it into the dirt to try and make it work
You won't be happy 'til we've drowned in it
We're never gonna fit

Waited too long
Did everything wrong
Said, don't worry
That's not me

You got what you want
And you're not gonna start saying, Sorry
"Sorry"

Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
(Sea)
Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
(Sea)
Sea
(Sea)

Followed your breadcrumbs
They led to the sea
(Sea)

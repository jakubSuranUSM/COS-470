Is there another being before this?
Is there another life?
Is there another sad to full? Are you willing to die?

'Cause I'm about to submerge the ocean
And resurrect the sky
And I'm about to recognize all of your body

But all you say to me is what you wanna see
You're not the man I need, that's what you said to me
You're not the man I need, you're not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be

Was there another being before this?
Was there another life?
Life, we would go by, you're Mr. Blindfold

'Cause I'm about to submerge the ocean
And resurrect the sky
And I'm about to recognize all of your body

But all you say to me is what you wanna see
You're not the man I need, that's what you said to me
You're not the man I need, you're not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be

Understand your options, baby
I can't believe
Taking it all the love to keep
I can't believe
You cannot take a promise, baby
Throw it in the sea
'Cause all the waves that come this way
Wash you path to me

But all you say to me is what you wanna see
You're not the man I need, that's what you said to me
You're not the man I need, you're not the man I need
Well, let me show you baby just all the man I can be

I believe
I believe
I believe

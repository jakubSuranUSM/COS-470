If God persists, persists in saying yes
I guess we'll have, we'll have to test ourselves
Maybe the Summer, will come and clear our minds
And find the impulse, to love the sunshine

I guess we'll have to test 
Until there's nothing left
We said the truth was fixed 
It's lost without a trace

This crime is eternity
When time lost its certainty
The Indian Summer

Maybe this time
We'll kiss and we'll not shake hands
Indian Summer, still hurt and broken
And leave all this material belief
Remember the reasons
The reasons that made us be

I guess we'll have to test 
What's darker than ourselves
We said the truth was fixed 
It's lost without a trace

This crime is eternity
When time lost its certainty

The Indian Summer (x4)

I guess we'll have to test 
until there's nothing left
We said the truth was fixed 
It's lost without a trace

This crime is eternity
When time lost its certainty
The Indian Summer

The Indian Summer [x3]

Did you know that there are people in the world
Annoyed with all the other people in the world
And of all these angry people in the world
I am the angriest boy

when I was sat into the earth in a stream of guts
By mother nature that green eyed slut 
I wasent the first to get forced from a cut
One to whom I still shall stay stuck
Staring from the cradle my eyes take in
The baby speak of my brain dead kin
To goo goo googles reflecting the grin 
Of a chubbed faced alien 
Well if you think I'm being harsh
Well baby keep on counting stars

cause I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
Upon this cursed earth

then I grew a few hairs where the sun don?t shine
Pack me in a classroom to count the time
Studying the history of mens minds
Chasing tail and committing hate crimes
Rich hippy girl with the gas guzzler 
Forced myself to fall in love with her
She was so strung out she swear it never occurred
The honkey king went back on his word
The next one did the same
The blind leading the lame 

all together now
I hate everyone
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone
Upon this cursed earth

how does it make you feel to be wanted (whoa)
How does it make you feel to be one of many
How does it make you feel to be blunted
How does it make you feel (2x)

(i hate) actors who seem genuine 
(i hate) my x girlfriend though she?s feminine 
(i hate) the singer with the denim shit

I hate everyone

(i hate) that hospital in texas
(i hate) the rapper in the lexus
(i hate) the pills I ate for breakfast

hate everyone
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone 
I hate everyone
Cause admired in hypocrisy
Yeah I'm still down with jc 
I guess that everyone includes me
And that's why I'm a humanist 
YEAH

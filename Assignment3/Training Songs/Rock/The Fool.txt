And you hear it in the morning... Says the Golden Sun, 
Life's song is moving ever onward, from and to the sound of One, 
Turning in, turning out, spirals high, never down. 
Wonder, wonder wanders loving, loving lovers. 
Freefall, tumblin' walls... 
One world... 
One... one truth, Heaven's above, Life is Love. 
Life is love. Love is life. 
It's love... Love.

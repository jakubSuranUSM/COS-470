In the time of my ruin
At the museum I met a curator
Oh, she was so nice, I thought I would date her
I was a hawk and I just flew in

In the time of my ruin
I did not know you would be created, no
Now everyday I am elated
'cause you never know what is brewing

Some pain is good
Sometimes it's good to be blind
Some pain feels good
That's the pain that's that's just the right kind

You didn't know I was a shoe-in
And you didn't know it was my hour
And you didn't know that I had the power

In the time of my ruin
In the time of my ruin
In the time of my ruin
In the time of my ruin

Some pain is good
Sometimes it's good to be blind
Some pain feels good
That's the pain that's that's just right kind

They're caving in the roof
It is falling all around
The floor is going, too
Soon I will be falling on down

They're caving in the roof
It is falling all around
And the floor is going, too
Soon I will be falling on down, falling on down

They're caving in the roof
It is falling all around, now, all around, now
The floor is going, too
Soon I will be falling on down

They're caving in the roof
It is falling all around

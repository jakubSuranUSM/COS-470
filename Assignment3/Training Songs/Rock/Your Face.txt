You know I really had to use my sense now I
I slam the door right in your face
How's it feel, how's it taste?

And look how, you won't dance with me
Well, has this symbol made you so mean
That you're looking so far past me

When you say what you say but don't walk away
My tongue so tired from putting out the fire
That I, I started in the first place

So pretend you're in my shoes, you got nothing to lose
And if I'm acting slutty then it's probably from the booze
The booze

What's wrong with your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, you never close your eyes
When I kiss your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, ohh

And sometimes I sit and wonder
Why I bother when I know that all this anger's for your father
Can you hear me, she's gonna kill me

When she finds out your magazines that are dirty
I feel so dirty, but nothing can hurt me
Except the way you shake your head

When you you say what you say but don't walk away
My tongue so tired from putting out the fire that I
I started in the first place

So pretend your in my shoes, you got nothing to lose
And if I'm acting slutty then it's probably from the booze
The booze

What's wrong with your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, you never close your eyes
When I kiss your face, you never smile anymore
What's wrong with your face, ohh

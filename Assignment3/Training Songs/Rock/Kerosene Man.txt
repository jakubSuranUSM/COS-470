Once I was down in the promised land
In a borrowed tent with a caravan
The leader of the pack stuck out his hand
He said, "Pleased to meet you
I'm the Kerosene Man"

And I jump and run and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Three day bender with Ray Milland
Scotch and soda and candied yams
Things they were getting out of hand
Ray was dancing with the Kerosene Man

And I jump and run and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Me and Mickey Mantle and Stan the Man
Were talking about a kid we couldn't understand
He batted .360 in Birmingham
Got fooled by a curve ball by the Kerosene Man

And I jump and run and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Chinese food in Alabama
I was looking at the menu, according to plan
Ate too much moo goo gai pan
Had one more dream about the Kerosene Man

And I run and jump and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man
Look out baby, it's the kerosene Man

Look out baby it's the Kerosene Man

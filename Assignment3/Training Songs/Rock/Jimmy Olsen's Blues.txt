Well, I don't think I can handle this
A cloudy day in Metropolis
I think I'll talk to my analyst
I got it so bad for this little journalist
It drives me up the wall and through the roof
Lois and Clark in a telephone booth
I think I'm going out of my brain
I got it so bad for little Miss Lois Lane

[CHORUS]
Lois Lane please put me in your plan
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no Superman
Come on downtown and stay with me tonight
I got a pocket full of kryptonite
He's leaping buildings in a single bound
I'm reading Shakespeare in my place downtown
Come on downtown and make love to me
I'm Jimmy Olsen not a titan, you see
He's faster than a bullet, stronger than a train
He's the one who got lucky, got his cape
Around Miss Lois Lane
I can't believe my dilemma is real
I'm competing with the man of steel

[CHORUS]

Ask me any kind of question, 
Anything you want to know
Tell you all about my lovers, 
Heartaches and laughter
From a long time ago

Ask me if I'm finally happy, 
I've never really been before
Ever since you happened to me, 
I've told all my secrets
I don't have any more

Ask me now and I won't tell a lie
Ask me how I've been feeling inside
But when somebody loves you 
And you know that it's true
Don't ask why

Ask me if I really mean it 
When I tell you I love you
Ask me will I please repeat it
I'll tell you forever if you want me to

Ask me now and I won't tell a lie
Ask me how I've been feeling inside
But when somebody loves you
And you know that it's true, 
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Don't ask why

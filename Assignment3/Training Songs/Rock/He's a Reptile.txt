Here he comes and there he goes
Got a brand new suit of clothes
Looks around and sniffs the air (What you find)
Well he'll have her on a fork and spoon (What you find)
And he'll toss her right back over the moon (What you find)
Watch out there in the yard (What you find)
Rule number one: don't try too hard

I believed he was my friend
Right up till he stopped pretending
He makes amends though it's ended long ago
Ah, he's moving in now just some piece
Everybody looks like the police
Feet of gold and on his skin of fleece
Sock and shepherd (??) bring out niece

He's a reptile and it shows
Got a web between his toes (?)
He's a reptile back in town
He's a reptile hanging 'round tonight
He's a reptile, never cries
He's a reptile, never dies

Here he comes and there he goes
And where he's been it hardly shows
He covers up so very well
But I can tell see your baby she's been on the sand
How the hell did that guy get on dry land
Better bolt up both your baby's doors
She'll be dancing with him on all fours

He's a reptile back in town
He's a reptile hangin' 'round tonight, oh
He's a reptile whoa whoa whoa
He's a reptile watch him go, tonight

He's a reptile never dries
He's a reptile never cries
He's a reptile of this town
He's a reptile hangin' round tonight

He's a reptile on his own
With a bone tonight, ooh
He's a reptile never cries
He's a reptile never dies
He's a reptile doesn't care
He's a reptile he's never there, tonight

He's a reptile just for you
He's a reptile and it's true, tonight

He's a reptile watch him go
He's a reptile, how you stand it never show
He's a reptile whoa
He's a reptile whoa

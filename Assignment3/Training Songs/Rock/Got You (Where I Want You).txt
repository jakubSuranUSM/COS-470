Hey, what's the point of this
Oh, hey, what's your favorite song
Maybe we could hum along

Well, I think you're smart
You sweet thing
Tell me your name
I'm dying here

Ah-ooh, got you where I want you, oh yeah
Ah-ooh, got you where I want you, oh, yeah

Hey, maybe just a smile
Oh, hey, did you know that I can dance
Could we talk for a while

Well, I think you're smart
You sweet thing
Tell me your sign
I'm dying here 

Ah-ooh, got you where I want you, yeah
Ah-ooh, got you where I want you
Where I want you, I want you, yeah

Suffer, suffer
Me don't get no rougher
Rub it up, baby girl, torture me like no other 
Suffer, suffer
Me don't get no rougher
When me rock me, baby, put me pain on me, lover

Suffer, suffer
Me don't get no rougher
Rub it up, baby girl, torture me like no other 
Suffer, suffer
Me don't get no rougher
When me rock me, baby, put me pain on me, lover

I think you're smart
You sweet thing
Tell me your name
I'm dying here

Ah-ooh (suffer, suffer, me don't get no rougher)
(Rub it up, baby girl, torture me like no other)
Got you where I want you (suffer, suffer, me don't get no rougher)
Yeah, I've got you where I want you (suffer, suffer, me don't get no rougher)
Yeah, I've got you where I want you, want you, want you

Got you where I want you
I've got you where I want you
Got you where I want you

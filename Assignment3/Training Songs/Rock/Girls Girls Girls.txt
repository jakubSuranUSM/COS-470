A new bad girl, who get on my block
I gave her my keys, said don't bother to knock
I said c'mon, ya got what I need
I said come on, don't make my heart bleed
(I'm beggin')

Whoa bad girl, what ya trying to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl what are you trying to do
Cause I'm early in the morning, not too late at night
And you're trying to tell me everything's alright
Then you're gonna ask am I gonna take it slow
I said don't you worry there's no place to go
(My bad girl)

I'm walking to the corner, to go in the cafe
That's when I seen her, a'walkin my way
She's all dolled up, in her waitress' skirt
I said c'mon, don't make my heart hurt
(I'm beggin')

Whoa bad girl, what ya trying to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl what are you trying to do
With my twenty dollar bills, and you can keep the change
All you gotta do is get down in my range
If you're gonna ask me am I gonna take it slow
I said don't you worry there's no place I gotta go
(You're bad, bad, so bad)
(I'm beggin')

Whoa bad girl, what ya trying to do

Gotta get some loving before the planet is gone
If you're gonna ask me, am I gonna take ya home
I says don't ya worry, there's no place I gotta go
(My bad girl)

A nuclear bomb, come an' blow us all away

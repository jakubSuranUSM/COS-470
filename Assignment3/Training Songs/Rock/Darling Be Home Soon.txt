COME AND TALK OF ALL THE THINGS WE DID TODAY.
HEAR AND LAUGH ABOUT OUR FUNNY LITTLE WAYS 
WHILE WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO BREATHE,
AND I KNOW THAT IT`S TIME YOU MUST LEAVE.
BUT,

[Chorus]:
DARLING BE HOME SOON, 
I COULDN`T BEAR TO WAIT 
AN EXTRA MINUTE IF YOU DAWDLED.
MY DARLING BE HOME SOON, 
IT`S NOT JUST THESE FEW HOURS 
BUT I`VE BEEN WAITING SINCE I TODDLED
FOR THE GREAT RELIEF OF HAVING YOU TO TALK TO.

[verse 2]:
AND NOW A QUARTER OF MY LIFE IS PAST.
I THINK I COME TO SEE MYSELF AT LAST, 
AND I SEE THAT THE TIME SPENT CONFUSED
WAS THE TIME THAT I SPENT WITHOUT YOU,
AND I FEEL MYSELF IN BLOOM.
SO,

[Chorus]

[verse 3]:
GO AND BEAT YOUR CRAZY HEAD AGAINST THE SKY.
TRY AND SEE BEYOND THE HOUSES AND YOUR EYES,
IT`S OKAY TO SHOOT THE MOON.
SO,

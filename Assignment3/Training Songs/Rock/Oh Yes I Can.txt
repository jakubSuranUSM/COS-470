[Intro. (Piano)]
I'm sitting here at my piano
I'm wondering how this battle can be won
The woman I was sure I was in love with
Seems to feel that the deal is done
But I don't, no I don't
And I want you to understand
Oh yes I can
Still be the man you fell in love with
Oh yes I can
Fire and ice, fire and ice ... water
Well, I'm sittin' here in my kitchen
But food is not on my mind
I love you so much I don't want to see you go and I think
This must be what it feels like to be going blind
And I need you know I need
I need you to understand
Oh yes I can
Still be the man you fell in love with
Oh yes I can
Fire and ice, fire and ice ... water
And I'm sittin' here in the sand dunes
Asking the ocean what to do
I found my life again and it's you I want to share it with
But I'm so afraid of losing you
And I know you know I know
And I want you to understand
Oh yes I can
Still be the man you fell in love with
Oh yes I can
You see I'm talking about
Fire and ice, fire and ice ... makes water

Confutatis maledictis
Confutatis maledictis
Tragedy storms him when demons spare her life
And all discover she has a demonheart
Demonheart!

Feeling trapped in with the slimy creatures, now close to being killed
She soon revealed her forgotten sad past, first to herself
They smelled her flesh, ready to be devoured, but something happened
They moved away, seeming to be frightened, sparing her life
Shocked again, she opened the gates of her tragic past, and bloody images came back to her mind

She remembered the old mission, the dark comet's goal beyond the suns
The flight through that black hole

Confutatis maledictis
Confutatis maledictis
Tragedy storms him when demons spare her life
And all discover she has a demonheart
Demonheart!

She lived again in some frames of sorrow, that evil journey
Planned by the Arias' exploring section to find new worlds
But all that they found beyond their system was the black portal
Depths of oblivion came back to their world, once opened it
Arkan and the other warriors who observed the
scene could not feel the same way now about that girl

He moved to her, taking her hand, running away fast from his old friends
All for her, he loved her

Confutatis maledictis
Confutatis maledictis
Tragedy storms him when demons spare her life
And all discover she has a demonheart
Demonheart!

Confutatis maledictis
Confutatis maledictis
Tragedy storms him when demons spare her life
And all discover she has a demonheart
Tragedy storms him when demons spare her life
And all discover she has a demonheart
Demonheart!

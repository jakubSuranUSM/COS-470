There is no pain
My body's drained
I never should have had that fourth slice straight
We gathered round
The lost and found
But my jerks of attention let me down

I took the first one
And I pulled it back
And what was once green
Had all turned black
Had all turned black
And there was nothing left to say

I'm ten foot tall the worlds so small
I know it all when I'm wasted
And what you see inside of me
Has been set free when I'm wasted
Wasted

I'm getting there
My constant stare
And I don't think I'll move from this chair
We've got them both 
Archers of Loaf
And the Stone Roses in the stereo

I took the first one
And I pulled it back
And what was once green
Had all turned black
Had all turned black
And there was nothing left to say

I'm ten foot tall the worlds so small
I know it all when I'm wasted
And what you see inside of me
Has been set free when I'm wasted
Wasted

I'm ten foot tall the worlds so small
I know it all when I'm wasted
And what you see inside of me
Has been set free when I'm wasted
Wasted

Wasted, wasted
Wasted, wasted

And I don't want to be straight
Don't want to be straight
And I don't want to be wasted, wasted, wasted
Down!

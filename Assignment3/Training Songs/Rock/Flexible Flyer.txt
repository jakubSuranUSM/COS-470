Down on a flexible flyer
To the bottom how fast I would go
Just waiting for me under the tree
And out in the snow

A cowboy, a nurse or a fireman
There's so many things that you can be
You can set bigger goals, but set your soul
Set your soul free

Times, places and situations
Leads to an early grave
When we get there we see
What did we save?

If your heart is a flame burning brightly
You'll have light and you'll never be cold
And soon you will know that you just grow
You're not growing old

Times, places and situations
Leads to an early grave
When we get there we see
Just what did we save?

Times, places and situations
Leads to an early grave
When we get there we see
Just what did we save?

If the wheels of your wagon are rusty
You can paint them until they are new
You can roll down a hill, but if you can't
Then I pity you

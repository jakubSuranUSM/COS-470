ALL IS NUMB
C?mon drift away through fundamental boundaries
To find ourselves surrounding
The ones who?ve already gone and come back stronger

All is numb
I?ve been lost too long
My fate?s been mistakenly chosen
All is numb
Yeah I?ve done you wrong
My fate?s been mistakenly chosen

Here you?ll stay
Where lies are spread wide open
And ties are not so strong
That place you?ll never find me
I?ve already gone

{chorus}

I guess my thinking too much is what?s been fuckin? me up
It?s my own worst enemy, but
It will never own me?
Who am I kidding anyway?

{chorus}

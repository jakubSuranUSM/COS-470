In my dream the world was silver
Underneath a magic moon
In my dream I lay there waiting
You came naked to my room

In my dream I lay there waiting
You came naked to my room
Woke up sweating, arms all empty
Three o'clock in the afternoon

Every day the world goes faster
Turning faster than it seems
Let's not talk about tomorrow
Leave me here on the street of dreams
Leave me here on the street of dreams

Walk right by me in the gutter
Lying here outside your door
I look up and see your beauty
Burning up and wanting more

Luck is far away as moonshine
Every deal a shaky hand
Fame is just an empty bottle
Fortune's just a one-night stand

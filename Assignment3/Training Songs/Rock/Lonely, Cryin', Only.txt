Leave a message or leave me alone

What if the sky falls and shoves me into the ground?
Would you pray for me or would you pull me out?
Yeah, I know you're no angel, but I'm stuck right now
Don't walk away, pretending you don't know how

Like a fat kid suicide, believing they're wrong
And you were giving up early and going alone
Yeah, I know you're no angel, but I'm stuck for friends
And once I'm out, I won't be back there again

And if you're lonely
(You're lonely)
And you're cryin' all the time
(You're cryin')
Heaven help me
(Heaven help me)
'Cause your heart's as dead as mine

We all go slowly
(Go slowly)
And time is catching up
(Time is catching up)
If you would only
(Only)
Give me two more minutes of your twisted love

Every day it gets much better
Everyone's on your side
Skies colliding in your name
Strike it up and lights and step outside
'Cause you know what's going on

But if you're lonely
(You're lonely)
And you're cryin' all the time
(You're cryin')
Heaven help me
(Heaven help me)
'Cause your heart's as dead as mine

We all go slowly
(Go slowly)
And time is catching up
(Time is catching up)
If you would only
(Only)
Give me two more minutes of your twisted love

(Your twisted)
Your twisted love
(Your twisted)
Your twisted love
(Your twisted)
Your twisted love

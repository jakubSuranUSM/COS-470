I can't believe you wanna leave
When you know it'll hurt me so
I'm down on bended knee
Begging please not to go

Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me mad

My life, my heart, my love
Is in your hands
And now you're gonna leave me
You're gonna leave me for another man

Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me mad

Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know it'll drive me mad

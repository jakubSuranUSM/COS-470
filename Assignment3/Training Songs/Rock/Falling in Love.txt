I slipped and I fell 
You can never tell 
She may be waiting around the next corner. 
And you may be in you 
To fancy perfumes 
But when you catch her eyes from the next room. 
Falling, falling, falling 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling, 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling... 
The light in your eyes 
Tells me I'm right 
The magic in you is touching me. 
So hold me tonight 
You make everything right 
And I won't be ashamed when morning shines light on our faces. 
Falling, falling, falling 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling, 
Falling in love 
Falling, falling, falling... 
Falling in love 
Falling in love 
I'm falling in love 
Falling in love... 
Can't stop thinking about you 
I can' t live without you 
Tell me anything, babe, but, don't tell me I'm wrong. 
A fool and his predictions 
A wise man's superstitions 
Caught into my intuition, I'm falling in love. 
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling. 
I slipped and I fell 
You can never tell 
She may be waiting around the next corner 
And you may be in you 
To fancy perfumes 
But, when you catch that smile from the next room. 
Falling, falling, falling 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling, 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling 
Falling in love, oh, baby. 
Falling, falling, falling, 
Falling in love with you. 
Falling, falling, falling... 
Falling in love with you, oh baby. 
Falling, falling, falling, 
Falling in love with you.

I spend my days thinking of you

I spend my days thinking of you
And all we've done
Praying you'll never think of me

When you left my side I took the freedom as a sign
And left the past in flames behind me,
'cause I'd much sooner owe you for all you've done
Than ever bow down for you

Find the will to hit and
That's when you'll get your stick
You keep your clinging fingers off me.

Everybody gets to breath
Every Adam every Eve,
But the way that we lost out now
Is to do it differently,
I want her and you want free,
That's the way that we lost out.

You do do do 

If you can't bring it in then don't you call,
No your not gonna find it here.
And the awful weight
Spread across me when I wake
Is your loving arm around me

Everybody gets to breath
Every Adam every Eve,
But the way that we lost out now
Is to do it differently,
I want her and you want free,
That's the way that we lost out.

You do do do

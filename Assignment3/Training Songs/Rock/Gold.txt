Am I defined? oh
By the way they look at me
Will I be tried? oh
Will they take what I believe?

I shiver on the one I breathe for two
I give you what you want
I bend the truth
And everything's aflame, it's all aglow
I know that I can play that game, I fool them all

Oh, like gold, let it lead me astray
Oh ike gold, let it take me away
And if I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, 'cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold

Do I belong? 
Oh I see it start to fade
Teach them a song
Oh now I feel I've been betrayed

I shiver on the one I breathe for two
I give you what you want I bend the truth
And everything's aflame, it's all aglow
I know that I can play that game, I fool them all

Oh, like gold, let it lead me astray
Oh like gold, let it take me away
And if I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, 'cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold

Everything is brighter now
It shimmers like a stone
And everything surrounds you now
It's you and you alone

Oh, like gold, oh, like gold
And If I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, 'cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold

I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight 
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight 
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight 
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight

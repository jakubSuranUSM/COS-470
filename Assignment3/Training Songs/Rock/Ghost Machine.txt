We are all living in the physical world
Loving people let it show
Body, mind, ghostmachine
Heart of the fire, gonna make it glow

Breath of your body in the beat of the night
Calling on your lover's name
Image game, body, mind
Get it all down, gonna make it shine

The rush as it take miraculous flight
Through a pure action dream
Body, mind, ghostmachine
Takes us away in a clear white flame

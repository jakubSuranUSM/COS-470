Enter the world you've left behind
These games you've played, inside my mind
Forget the past, it seems so far away
Never had the choice, there was too much to say
Take a risk with you, we'll make these dreams come true
There's nothing left to say, if you leave me
Alone

Break me again
You had your chance come and take me as I am
Broken again
I cared too much come protect me from myself

This outcome disconnects me, from the silence you create
I felt so insecure, you never took the time to tell me it's over
My heart still bleeds for you, there's nothing left to do
I know that you're not good for me
Right now

Break me again
You had your chance come and take me as I am
Broken again
I cared too much, come protect me from myself

I gave myself a place to hide
I wish that you would come inside but I've given up on you
I think about another place, where only I can see your face
But there's nothing left for me
Because I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken, you're broken

Break me again
It was just too much to save me from myself

Break me again
You had your chance come and take me as I am
Broken again
I cared too much, come protect me from myself

Come protect me from myself
Come protect me from myself

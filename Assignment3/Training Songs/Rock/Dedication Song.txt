The Dedication" (performed by Freddy "Boom Boom" Cannon in 1965, but we
completely changed most of the lyrics without Boom Boom's permission)

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

This song goes out to Bobby, dedicated from Sue,
She just wants him to know, her love for him is true.
And this song goes out to Soraya, dedicated from Nick,
He would like another tour of the pyramids!

Don't touch that dial,
Leave it on the station,
I'm going to make, another Dedication

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

This song goes out to Mary, dedicated from Bryce
He's so sorry they had a fight and he promises he'll be nice.
And this song goes out to Neko, dedicated from Dave,
He just wants her to know that after Bronson she's the fave!

Don't touch that dial,
Leave it on the station,
I'm going to make, another Dedication

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

This goes out to all the kids who've come out to see one of our crummy show!
I'm talkin' about that guy I grabbed by the hair in San Francisco,
And that guy I put in a headlock in Moncton New Brunswick
And that chick I kicked in the ass, in f*ck, was it Kamloops?

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

This song goes out to CC, dedicated from Beez, (BEEZ: "That's ME!")
He just belched and he's so sorry that he's such a sleaze.
And this song goes out to Jenni, WHERE ARE YOU?, dedicated from Grant,
It'd be nice, if you would come, and pick up your pants!

Don't touch that dial,
Leave it on the station,
I'm going to make, another Dedication

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

And this one goes out to the kid I beat with a mic stand in Atlanta (sorry)
And to my aunt and uncle in Albany I'm sorry I clogged up that toilet
And to that stupid skinhead in Lafayette!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

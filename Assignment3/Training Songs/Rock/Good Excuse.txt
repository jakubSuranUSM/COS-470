All around I see raining
Things don?t seem to go my way
Got a dark cloud that's hanging
And it seems to follow me

Boy, won?t you just wake up 
And feel the humming
This good world is given you
Better start running
Catch up with your life
Catch on up
Before the whole thing is through

Have you once, have you twice
Have you even concieved
Go out and take another better look around
You are just another white boy Thinking your so hard
Go take a step out side 
See what?s shaking in the real world

Go take a step out side and see what?s shaking in the real world 
Go take a step out side and see what?s shaking in the real world

But you don?t know how my heart laments 
I've really got a good excuse to complain
My parents got divorced can?t heal the pain
Now there is only cheap regrets
I guess that?s just the way it be
Is it world, how I see me

Boy now you are really bugging
Really bugging 
Yes you are bugging me
Can?t you just shut right up
Your cup is overflowing
Overflowing
And you think it is empty
You don?t even know what side
You are fighting for
Boy would you turn your Game Boy off
Stop pretending it?s you against the world
I am sick and I am tired 
Of hearing you always say
"I really got a good excuse to complain
My parents got divorced can?t heal the pain"

Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
(solo)

Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world

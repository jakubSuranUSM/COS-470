This ole house once knew his children 
This ole house once new his wife 
This ole house was home and comfort 
As they fought the storms of life 
This ole house once rang with laughter 
This ole house heard many shouts 
Now he trembles in the darkness 
When the lightning walks about. 

(Ain't a gonna need this house no longer 
Ain't a gonna need this house no more)

Ain't got time to fix the shingles 
Ain't got time to fix the floor 
Ain't got time to oil the hinges 
Nor to mend no window panes 
Ain't gonna need this house no longer 
He's getting ready to meet his fate 

This ole house is getting shaky 
This ole house is getting old 
This ole house lets in the rain 
This ole house lets in the cold 
Oh his knees are a getting chilly 
But he feels no fear nor pain 
Cause he seeks a new tomorrow 
Through a golden window pain 

(Ain't a gonna need this house no longer 
Ain't a gonna need this house no more)

Ain't got time to fix the shingles 
Ain't got time to fix the floor 
Ain't got time to oil the hinges 
Nor to mend no window panes 
Ain't gonna need this house no longer 
He's getting ready to meet his fate 

This ole house is afraid of thunder 
This ole house is afraid of storms 
This ole house just groans and trembles 
When the night wind flings it arms 
This ole house is getting feeble 
This ole house is a needing paint 
Just like him it's tuckered out 
He's a getting ready to meet his fate 

(Ain't a gonna need this house no longer 
Ain't a gonna need this house no more)

Ain't got time to fix the shingles 
Ain't got time to fix the floor 
Ain't got time to oil the hinges 
Nor to mend no window panes 
Ain't gonna need this house no longer 
He's getting ready to meet his fate 

(Ain't a gonna need this house no longer 
Ain't a gonna need this house no more)

Ain't got time to fix the shingles 
Ain't got time to fix the floor 
Ain't got time to oil the hinges 
Nor to mend no window panes 
Ain't gonna need this house no longer 
He's getting ready to meet his fate 

(Ain't a gonna need this house no longer 
Ain't a gonna need this house no more)

Ain't got time to fix the shingles

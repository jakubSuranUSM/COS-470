Yeah, yeah, ahh, ahh, ahh
It's four a.m. and-a-you're still moving
The clock don't bother you
In your micro mini, you think you're groovin'

You're acting so demure
I'm gonna take my love and go
I've already seen your show
You come on strong but it's just a stall
You don't know which way to fall

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you think of love at all?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think of love at all?)

Love is much too tasty to refuse it
So stoner drop in and live
In a sense it's nice if you don't abuse it
But you gotta know when to give

I'm gonna take my love and go
(Take my love and go)
I've already seen your show
(Already seen your show)

You come on strong but it's just a stall
You don't know which way to fall

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you think of love at all?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think of love at all?)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ahh, ahh, ahh

The sun is coming up, babe
We'll be soon be out of town
I know you're old enough babe
So make up your mind

It's four a.m. and a you're still moving
The clock don't bother you
In your micro mini, you think you're groovin'
You're acting so demure

I'm gonna take my love and go
(Take my love and go)
I've already seen your show
(Already seen your show)

You come on strong but it's just a stall
You don't know which way to fall

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you think of love at all?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think of love at all?)

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you think of love at all?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think of love at all?)

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you think of love at all?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you think of love at all?)

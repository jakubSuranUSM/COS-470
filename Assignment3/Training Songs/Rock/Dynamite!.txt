Miss clean
She's so together and nice, yeah
Miss clean
I got to see her twice
Miss clean
I like the way she moves, uh-huh

When I was through
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite

Miss clean
Give that girl a hand, yeah
Miss clean
She's got a beautiful tan
Miss clean
Straight to my head, uh-huh 
Miss clean
I remember what she said, listen
Miss clean
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, I want you
Miss clean
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, me and you
Miss clean
You got me, girl you got me
When I was down,
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
Dynamite

Dance to the music

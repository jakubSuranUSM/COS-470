You hold your head up to the sky
You say what kind of blue
Are you? Are you?
Then you ride your pony round and round
It's digging a hole, right through, right through

You stumble down a yellow brick road,
Spinning your shoes in the air, the air.

Then you, hold your breath, and count to nine,
Hoping that soon somebody will find you, find you,

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching,
Just say, just say, just say, what you're feeling,
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way,
It's okay, it's okay

You're 15 miles over the speed,
You're going fast as you can, off to your daydream
Oh

On your mark, get set, hurry away
And have a serious talk with your, champagne.

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching,
Just say, just say, just say, what you're feeling,
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way,
It's okay, it's okay

It's time for you to prove,
Within your ruby shoes,
You deserve a smile with no regret,
Look at you
Kicking off your shoes,
Dancing for the world to see,
You got the power to believe,
Now open up and see,
And go be free and fly away,

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching,
Just say, just say, just say, what you're feeling,
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way,
It's okay, it's okay

It's okay, it's okay

I see the fear 
In the things we don't understand 
I see the fear 
In another blind man 
I can't hold  
Back this fight that stills inside 
I can't hold back
Who I am 

I know you're strong 
I know you belong 
I know you are strong 
My beautiful one 

I know you're strong 
I know you belong 
I know you are strong 
My beautiful one 

I can't turn 
Away from what I believe 
I can't destroy 
Or deceive 
Oh no oh no 
I know a beauty 
In all that I can see 
I can't hold on 
But you can't release 

I know you're strong 
I know you belong 
I know you are strong 
My beautiful one 

I know you're strong 
I know you belong 
I know you are strong 
My beautiful one 

Cause they can't hold you 
And they can't hold me 
And they can't hold on 
To what they can't believe 

Cause they can't hold you 
And they can't hold me 
And they can't hold on 
To what they can't believe 

I know you're strong 
My beautiful one 
I know you're strong 
I know you belong 

I know you're strong 
My beautiful one 
I know you're strong 
I know you belong 

I know you're strong 
My beautiful one

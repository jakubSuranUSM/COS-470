She's a Wicked Girl
Worst in all the world
A mystery lies in her

She spends her days
In a violent rage
Try as I might
I love her

Everytime the tears run dry
The story goes
What's left behind
Shivers like a leaf
Taciturn and gentle
It's not hard to believe

The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind

She likes to fight
The whole world bang to rights
Yours truly, I'd die for her

The growing pains
Dissolve in lemonade
The sweetness flies to her

Every time her temper flares
A storm will blow
What's left's so rare

A fragment of the girl
Soft and sentimental
The side she tries not to share

The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my head
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind

When your song is sung
Don't let me colour your opinion
That girl's my life, I tell ya

Every time my tears run dry
And the moment's flown
And re-designed

My feelings for the girl
How could I be with out her?
I would surely still find

The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind

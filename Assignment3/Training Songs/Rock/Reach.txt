Beyond the new horizon
Destiny lost and found
You're gonna have it all somehow
Waiting for your arrival
Only a moment now
In the blink of an eye it all comes down
And nothing is easy
And nothing is free
You got to take one step at a time

Reach...out to reach your dream
Never stop believing
Nothing can hold you down
Yeah, reach...out with all your heart
Shout out through the dark
And soon it will come around

Out of the ashes falling
Into the open sky
Like the tide it's rising you and I
And like an eagle soaring
Flying so wild and free
There are no chains around you and me
Nothing is easy
And nothing is free
Follow the vision only you can see

Reach...out to reach your dream
Never stop believing
Nothing can hold you down
Yeah, reach...out with all your heart
Shout out through the dark
And soon it will come around

There is no limit to the sky
Don't let one minute pass you by
With all that you've been giving
Give it up while you're still living
Yeah, yeah

Reach...out to reach your dream
Never stop believing
Nothing can hold you down
Reach...out with all your heart
Shout out through the dark
And soon it will come around

Oh, reach...out to reach your dream
Never stop believing
Nothing can hold you down
Reach...out with all your heart
Shout out through the dark
And soon it will come around

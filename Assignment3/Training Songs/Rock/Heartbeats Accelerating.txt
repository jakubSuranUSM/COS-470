Love, love, where can you be?
Are you out there looking for me?
Love, love, where can you be?
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

Will you come when all is still
From the river or the hill
Love, love, where can you be
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

Will you come on a Saturday night
Maybe then the time will be right
Love, love, where can you be
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

When you steal into my room
What earthly body will you assume
Love, love, where can you be
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

Will you come on a Saturday night
Maybe then the time will be right
Love, love, where can you be
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

Love, love, where can you be?
Are you out there looking for me
Love, love, where can you be
Are you out there looking for me
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating
Love, I am waiting
Heartbeats accelerating

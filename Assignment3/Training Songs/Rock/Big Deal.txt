I'm just trying to do the best I can.
If you don't approve that's just too bad.
I'll get by somehow,
While you watch from your ivory tower.
See, how you feel is no big deal to me.

Do you think that I will just stand by
While you pontificate from up on high?
Your words fall on deaf ears-
No-one's heard of you down here
So turn cartwheels, its no big deal to me.

Though you pour your scorn on all below
No-one cares so there´s nowhere to go. Let go.

One day soon you´ll have to understand
You cannot dictate the way I am.
I could talk to you
But I've got better things to do
And how you feel is no big deal to me.

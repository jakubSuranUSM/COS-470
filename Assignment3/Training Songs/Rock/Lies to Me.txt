She lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

What is wrong with me? 
I'm not supposed to be 
Happy all the time 
But I'm willing to bet 
It doesn't matter yet 
As long as she doesn't mind 

Telling lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

Maybe it's not fair to her 
To believe in what she says 
That's the way it goes, sometimes 
And it can also go the other way 

I wasn't wide awake 
When she said to me 
"Buddy, you're alright" 
But I think she knows 
And I know it shows 
That I'm confused all the time 

She lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

Lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

Maybe it's not fair to her 
To believe in what she says 
That's the way it goes, sometimes 
And it can also go the other way 

I wasn't wide awake 
When she said to me 
"Buddy, you're alright" 
But I think she knows 
And I know it shows 
That I'm confused all the time 

She lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

She lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees 

Lies to me 
Lies to me 
I don't want to know 
What she really sees

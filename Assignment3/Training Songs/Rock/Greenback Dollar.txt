Some people say I'm a no 'count. Others say I'm no good.
But I'm just a nat'ral-born travelin' man, doin' what I think I should, O, yeah. Doin' what I think I should.

[Chorus:]
And I don't care about a greenback dollar, spend it as fast as I can.
For a wailin' song and a good guitar, the only things that I understand, poor boy, the only things that I understand.

When I was a little baby, my momma said, "Hey, son. Travel where you will and grow to be a man
And sing what must be sung, poor boy. Sing what must be sung."

[Chorus]

Now that I'm a grown man, I've traveled here and there. I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song,
The only ones who ever care, poor boy, the only ones who ever care

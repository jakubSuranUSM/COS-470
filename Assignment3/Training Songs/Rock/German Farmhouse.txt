I lived in seclusion for a couple of years

In a german farmhouse just drinking beer

And every morning I'd wake up with a smile from ear to ear


I had one contact to the outside world

A phone in london and a seasick girl.

I knew what was happening but only in my part of the world


I knew what was happening

I knew that this was my world

I knew what was happening in my part of the world


There was an abandoned castle with empty chairs

There was a rumour pavarotti would sing there

To raise funds for a music school but then the

Whole thing vanished into thin air


It was a crazy idea

And it vanished into the air

It was a falling down castle with falling down stairs


I could walk the streets unrecognized

Nobody stopped me I was never surprised

By anybody's actions or by an ex-lover's eyes


And this felt good

And this felt so right

To be unloaded as I walked through the night


This felt good

This felt so right


To be unloaded as I walked through the night, this felt right

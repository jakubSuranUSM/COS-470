Everyday is a long disguise
Everyday is a compromise
I can tell a blatant lie
While looking you deep in your eye

Everyday I look for a sign
What triggers your death
Triggers mine
We will ride together in the end

[Chorus]
Assassin, assassin
Show me paradise
Life is not the same
Assassin, assassin
Show me paradise
I'll never be the same

Twenty years, a loyal friend
But now the knife is in my hand
I can't begin to understand
How I've been deceived

Show me visions out of time
Greater than my stinking life
If I serve you to the end
I will find some peace

[Chorus]

Baksheesh, Baksheesh
I'd sell my sainted mother
For another glimpse of paradise
Baksheesh, baksheesh 
Twenty years, deep cover
For another glimpse of your paradise

[Chorus]

I'll never be the same

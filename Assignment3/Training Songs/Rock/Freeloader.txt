I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm a freeloader, I'm a freeloader
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm a freeloader, I'm a freeloader
I'm hungry enough
To follow you around

I don't hear, I don't hear
I don't hear, I don't hear
I'm a free thinker, I'm a free thinker
I'm empty enough
To see you as I want to

I'm headed for the trees over there
If that's not a destination
I don't care

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care. I don't care
I'm a broken kid, I'm a broken kid
I'm lonely enough
To make the air around you sweet

I'm an open book, I'm an open book
I'm lady enough
To meet you secretly

I'm headed for the trees over there
If that's not a destination
I don't care

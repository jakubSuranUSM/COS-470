Here we go again, another night of being bumped
I can tell myself, avoid the sun
And cancel plans with everyone
I know, 'cause its just how it always ends
Our bond will break 'cause you can't relate
To anyone, to anything at all

You brought your worst and I'm right here
No one's seen it all, it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all to late to set things right 
'Cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

You still know me
Still not cut out for this sort of thing
Never want to be, caught in between
I need constant reminders of everything
So what
It's who I am, I played it off so well
I was holding in, no matter how I've been, so nobody
Nobody can tell

You brought your worst and I'm right here
No one's seen it all, it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all to late to set things right 
'Cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen, 
Follow your friends like you ever had them

I won't sleep till the break of dawn (Break of dawn)
Can't let our problems find me here
So everybody come on

You brought your worst and I'm right here
No ones seen it all, its never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all to late to set things right 
'Cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

You're not the person that I knew back then
It's all to late to set things right 
'Cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Lets try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them

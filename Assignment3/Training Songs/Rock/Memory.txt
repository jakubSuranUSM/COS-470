Lilacs fade away, I did wait to see, 
Past will find a way, 
You are a me hey hey hey hey memory , 
Footsteps disappear, 
I did wait to see, 
They will not reappear, 
You are a memory, 
I did wait to see, 
But nothing came, 
Except songs and lanes ill mannered ways, 

Night and days, 
Summer and rain, 
Talking about your sovereignty, 
Talking about the queen and me, 

Lilacs fade away, 
I don't wanna leave, 
Lord shine your rays, 
Down on our bloody shaky knees, 

Songs and lanes ill mannered ways, 
Oh songs and lanes ill mannered ways, 

Oh why did why did you rescue me, 
Me naughty me naughty me naughty naughty boy, 
Oh why did why did you rescue me, 
Me Mandy me Mandy me Mandy Mandy girl.

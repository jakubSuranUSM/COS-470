Sickness spilling through your eyes,
Craving everything that you thought was alive
Stab me in my heart again
Drag me through you wasted life
Are you forever dead?

Do like I told you, stay away from me
Never misunderstand me, keep away from me

Twistin' everything around that you say
Smack me in my mouth 200 times every other day
Rag me, I don't hear you anymore,
Not yet, find out what it means to me
I don't know who you are

Do like I told you, stay away from me
Never misunderstand me, keep away from me
Do like I told you, stay away from me
Never misunderstand me

Dragging on so lonely, aren't you tired baby
Breathing life into your lungs,
Are you immune to me

Do like I told you, stay away from me
Never misunderstand me, keep away from me
Do like I told you, stay away from me
Never misunderstand me
Keep away from me
Never misunderstand me
Never misunderstand me
Never misunderstand me

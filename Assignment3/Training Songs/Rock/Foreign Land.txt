Steady my shaky hands
Shut off the world's demands
Just get the facts down
Do you understand?

This is a foreign land
So try to understand me
Do you understand?
So you understand?

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home

Take a little look around
Melting as it hits the ground
I touch my hand
Up to the air

Dying in the foreign land
So do you understand me
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home
I smell the blood of an Australian
Try to understand me if you can
If you can
If you can

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home
I smell the blood of an Australian

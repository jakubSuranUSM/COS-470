It's gettin' late I don't know 'bout three a.m.
And I'm drivin' in my '57 dream
It's gettin' late Don't know just where I've been
And I'm comin' to you from all points in between

A little lovin' on my mind
A little lovin'

[Chorus]
She's my machine

She gets along Let alone She's premium
And I love to feel her Each and every night
Damn straight She's wild In overdrive
Feels like something's getting right

A little lovin' on my mind
A little lovin'

[Chorus]

It's gettin' late I don't know
'Bout three a.m.
And I'm drivin' in my '57 dream
She's red She's wild In overdrive
And I'm coming to from all points in between

A little lovin' on my mind
A little lovin'

[Chorus]

Look out 
Kick it

Machine machine
She's my machine
Machine

Calling me her rock of love and I just fell for her
Yielded to that game of hearts she promised me the
World
Handling the ribbons with all that we did
She's one in a million I've got to admit
Ooh see her grace
She's got winning ways

Stuck on her I often think but never even try
To thank her for the good times then shake hands and
Say goodbye
I'm playing a part in a fool's masquerade
Hiding inside of the world she creates

Her winning ways
Stir my heart and fool the rest of me
Hard to see
That she's got me running around
Clinging to the tempting love that I've found

Endlessly
Longing for magical moments to be

Gambling high
Her image is fading, I'll constantly try
To reach for the sky

All I felt was carefree love, a dream beyond compare
Times have really changed my dear, but you won't be
Aware
That deep in my heart I wish you would be
Only a shade for a sweet memory

'cause your winning ways
Made me living in your world a trickery
Now I see
That you've got me running around
Imprisoned by the love I thought I had found

Aimlessly
Yearning for someone that she'll never be
Wondering why
I'm bound for her love, forever I'll try
To reach for the sky

Why don't we take a little piece of summer sky, 
Hang it on a tree.
For that's the way to start to make a pretty world, 
For you and for me.

And for the sun we'll take a lemon bright balloon, 
You can hold the string.
Oh, can't you see that little world of ours will be, 
The prettiest thing.

We can gather rain enough for the stream, 
To hold our happy faces.
When you want a breeze, 
I'll blow you a kiss or two.

Take me in your arms and our little world, 
Will be the place of places.
Nothing must be made but breakfast and love.

We'll hang a little sign that just says, "Paradise, 
Population two."
I know together, 
We can make a pretty world, 
For me and for you -- for you, 
It's what I'm longing to do -- to do, 
To make a world with you.

Take me in your arms, 
And our little world
Will be the place of places.
Nothing must be made but breakfast and love.

We'll hang a little sign that just says, "Paradise, 
Population two."

I know together, 
We can make a pretty world, 
For me and for you -- for you, 
It's what I'm longing to do -- to do, 
To make a world... 

With you

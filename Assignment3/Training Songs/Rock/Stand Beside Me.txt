I can feel someone here
In the air tonight
Waiting alone inside for survival
Cruising this place
Like flesh on a neon sign
Brighten up my life tonight
Before the candle flickers

Stand beside me
I will never let you fall
Stand beside me
I'll come whenever you call
I will take it to the wall
I had a life out here
Like a rumble fish
Waiting to drown like all of my rivals
Hiding in rooms so hot
To the human touch

Choose your poison if you can
Take this heart of mine and

Stand beside me
I will never let you fall
Stand beside me
I'll come whenever you call
I will take it to the wall

It's a moody Manitoba mornin'
Nothing's really happening, it never does
Just got up and waited for the mailman
To bring me a letter that never was

I'm not sad or happy
Just living day by day
It's a moody Manitoba mornin'
And I like it that way

It's a long and kind of gentle, 
Lazy prairie town afternoon, The sky is high
I can fell the grass a-growin' from yesterday's rain
The sun's a-glowin' and so am I

Read the afternoon paper
To see what the world was at
It's a long and kind of gentle lazy day

And I like it like that way

It's a quiet, welcome, lively
Sort of leisurely past the evening, It's after nine
Go slowly walkin' up and down
The main street with your special girl, Things are fine

Now it's time to go home
Tomorrow's another day
Another moody Manitoba mornin'
And I like it that way

Another moody Manitoba mornin'
Moody Manitoba mornin'
Another moody Manitoba mornin'
Another moody Manitoba mornin'

Another moody Manitoba mornin'
Another moody Manitoba mornin'

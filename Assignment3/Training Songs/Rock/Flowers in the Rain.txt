Flowers in the rain of the yesterday

I believe a new salvation is coming, you better get running
Some say heavens here on earth, but it's nowhere to be found now

What you see it can be found, watch another day pass you by
What else do you see flowers in the rain of the yesterday?
Flowers in the rain of the yesterday

Have you seen your eyes of a child that makes you wanna cry, cry, oh why
And they get older when night seems to get colder
Then that seems to survive somehow someway, oh yeah

What you see it can be found, watch another day pass you by
What else do you see flowers in the rain of the yesterday?
Flowers in the rain of the yesterday
Flowers in the rain of the yesterday, flowers in the rain of the yesterday

Everyday people trying to find some peace of mind I pray, hey, hey

Flowers in the rain of the yesterday, flowers in the rain

I believe in the new salvation, do you believe in the revolution?
What so ever you believe a paradise to achieve
Brother to brother, man to man, eye to eye in the Promised Land
Flowers in the rain of the yesterday, flowers in the rain

(Back to me) I say flowers in the rain of the yesterday, yeah yeah

What you see it can be found (New salvation)
Watch another day pass you by (Revolution)
What else do you see flowers in the rain?
What you see it can be found (New salvation)
Watch another day pass you by (Revolution)
What else do you see flowers in the rain? What you see it can be found
Watch another day pass you by, what else do you see?

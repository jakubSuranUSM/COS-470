Hey little Momo
Light as a rainbow
Heavy as an asteroid
Crashed in the bathtub

Yeah, sitting in the bathtub
Hair full of her fingers
Hair full of her fingers

Yeah, sitting in the bathtub
Says, "I'm scared and lonely"
Never seen no-one, says
"I'm scared and lonely"

Here come the wolfman
Hey little Momo
Saying, "Hey little Momo"
Saying, "Hey little Momo"
Sitting in the bathtub

My heathen child
She's a heathen child
Yeah, she's a heathen child
Yeah, she's a real wild child

She got a little powder
She got a little gun
She got a little poison
Got a little gun
Sitting in the bathtub
Sucking her thumb

Says, "I don't care about Buddha
Care about Krishna
Don't care about Allah
Don't care about anything"
Just sitting in the bathtub
Sucking her thumb

'Cause, she's a heathen child
Yeah, she's a heathen child
Now, she's a heathen child
Yeah, she's a real wild child

(Yeah yeah, come on baby)

Oh, poor little momo
Yeah, paddled and rowed
She's got a little powder
Got a little gun
Sitting in the bathtub
Having some fun

She was raised by beasts
And grabbed by vultures
Oh, here come the wolfman
The Abominable Snowman
Got a little poison
Got a little gun
Sitting in her bathtub
Waiting for the wolfman to come

You think your great big husband will protect you, you are wrong
You think your little wife will protect you, you are wrong
You think your children will protect you, you are wrong
You think your government will protect you, you are wrong

She don't care about Allah
She is the Allah
Don't care about Buddha
She is the Buddha

Woo
Yeah

'Cause, she's a heathen child
Yeah, she's a heathen child
She's a heathen child
She's a heathen child

She's a real wild child
A real wild child
A real wild child
Yeah a real wild child

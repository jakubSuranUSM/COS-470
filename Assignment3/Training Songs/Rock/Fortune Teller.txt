Reaching back, I'm a fortune teller
I'll tell her I'm the way
There will be those days
Can't make them go away

There are always ways of telling
They are crazy about me
Grass is what I'm after
Tracks got off the train

What is it that you're after?
I can't make the train go any faster

There are times when the days go by
And I'm a total stranger
Plaster souvenirs
Them shouting in my ear

I can't make fat a skinny cat
Baby, substitutes
I'm a fortune teller
I'll tell her I'm the way

What is it that you're after?
I can't make the train go any faster

I'm a fortune teller
I'm a fortune teller

I'm a fortune
I'm a fortune teller
I'm a fortune
I'm a fortune teller, yeah

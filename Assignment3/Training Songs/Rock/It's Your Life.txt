We had this dream,
Locked behind these wicked thoughts.
You and I,
We felt pain.
Passed from him, to me, to you.
Reaching out,
Into the empty space,
We lost our place.
[Chorus]
It's your life.
It's your soul.
It's everything
You give to him.
It's my heart.
In your hands.
Keep it, or just let it fall.
Another stone,
Placed in my wall.
I brush away
The flaming hair across your cheek,
To see these eyes
That lit my life.
Now they're cold, and dark, and gone.
With your smile,
I'll cross this hopeless line,
But don't waste time.
[Chorus]
It's your life.
It's your mind.
Choices that you make, my love.
It's my heart in your hands.
Keep it, or just let it fall.
Another stone, placed in my wall.
Can't we see above
This wall?

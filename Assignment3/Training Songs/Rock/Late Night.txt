Oh, I hope that you, somebody
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt

Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
I'm calling out your name
Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name

I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown

They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found

And I know the place another way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name

Stay with me
Stay with me

Did you throw your heart away?
Oh I know just what I say
Did your phone cut in the way?
Being still downtown I say

And I know you ran away
Oh I know but I'm feeling okay
And I found love and fear wont go
And I found love and feeling wont go
See you walk away
Feeling okay now
Happy now?

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

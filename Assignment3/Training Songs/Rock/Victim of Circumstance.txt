The police were waitin' when the sun came up 
You better move your ass 
Or we'll really get rough 
I never wanted trouble 
But I sure got enough 
I'm bad at bein' subtle 
But I ain't that tough, no 

Just a victim of circumstance 
Didn't you know 
Just a victim of circumstance 
Doesn't it show 
I'm just a victim of circumstance 
Wherever I go 
Just a victim of bad reputation 
I go no chance of shakin' 

Really gets you down when you don't belong 
An' everyone around says you growed up wrong 
But why do they resent it, I ain't doin' anything 
They say that I'm demented an' I never could sing 
Then everywhere I went I caused them such alarm 
You know I never meant to cause anybody harm, no 

Just a victim of circumstance 
Didn't you know 
Just a victim of circumstance 
Doesn't it show 
I'm just a victim of circumstance 
Wherever I go 
Just a victim of bad reputation 
I go no chance of shakin' 

I've been laughed at, I've been shut out 
But let there be no doubt 
Never been afraid of chances I been takin' 

The police are waitin' when the sun came up 
You better move your ass 
Or we'll really get rough 
I never wanted trouble 
But I sure get enough 
I'm bad at bein' subtle 
But I ain't that tough, no 

Just a victim of circumstance 
Didn't you know 
Just a victim of circumstance 
Doesn't it show 
I'm just a victim of circumstance 
Wherever I go 
Just a victim of bad reputation 
I go no chance of shakin'

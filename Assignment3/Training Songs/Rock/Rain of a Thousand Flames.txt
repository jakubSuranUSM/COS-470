Dies irae
Regna nell' oscurita'

Guardians of the moonlight bring the spell alive
Through the sphere of sorrow lead my holy ride
Titans of the desert face the warlord's pride
Fighters from the near lakes join the tragic night

War of the ghostland take your souls
But give us freedom once and for all
Firestorm!

Under the rain of a thousand flames
We face the real pain, falling in vain
While the dark angel screams for vengeance
In the dead shadow of falling stars

Silent cries of virgins touch the heart of night
Raped by the demons under painful sights
Sperm and blood and terror, chaos in my head
Is the law of evil, triumph for the damned

War of the ghostland take your souls
But give us freedom once and for all
Firestorm!

Under the rain of a thousand flames
We face the real pain, falling in vain
While the dark angel screams for vengeance
In the dead shadow of falling stars

Moonlight is the witness of the most tragic day for our lands
Nothing seems possible to change the destiny of war
Lament of heroes reach the deep skies
Fill the wide cosmos and free my pain, my pain!

Under the rain of a thousand flames
We face the real pain, falling in vain
While the dark angel screams for vengeance
In the dead shadow of falling stars

Dies irae
Regna nell' oscurita'

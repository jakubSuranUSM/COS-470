Keeping quiet and meaningless
In the cage that you gave me
I am euthanizing the gloom
In whose image you made me

In this valley of dying stars
You can make it feel crazy
You can black out most of the view
'Til you make it amazing

Can you hear the sound of hours blowing away?
If you care about it, anyway
How can I take you out of the way?
Bullets break you a lobotomy, bullets break you a lobotomy, hey

Keeping still in the emptiness
Where you break and betray me
I am euthanizing the gloom
In whose image you made me

In this valley of dying stars
You can make it feel crazy
I am black and beholden to you
'Til you make it amazing

Can you hear the sound of hours blowing away?
If you care about it, anyway
How can I take you out of the way?
Bullets break you a lobotomy, bullets break you a lobotomy, hey

Can you hear the sound of hours blowing away?
If you care about it, anyway
How can I take you out of the way?
Bullets break you a lobotomy, bullets break you a lobotomy, hey

Hey, hey

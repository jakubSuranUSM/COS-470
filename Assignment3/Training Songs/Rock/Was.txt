It was a moonless night
It was an empty sky
It was a bad excuse
I was the only fool in sight
It was a crazy thought
A madman's walk
It was
It was a moonless night
It was an empty sky
It was a bad excuse
I was the only fool in sight
It was a crazy thought
A madman's walk
It was
I had a wandering eye
She had a better time
It was a twisted thought
A black cat came to mind
She was a crazy thought
A madman's walk
She was
She was a long way home
Walking broken bones
It was wrong or right
How deep that knife could go
It was a crazy thought
A madman's walk it was
It was a crazy thought
A madman's walk it was
She was the hangman's noose
I was the fool, I was
Oh, I was
Yeah baby, I was

I wear the same shoes as anyone
I get the same blues as everyone
So try and call me, I'm immobile man, yes i am

Got a haircut, got a silver tooth, gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW, tryin' to get themselves arrested

I suck the same lines as anyone
I do the same time as anyone
Don't try and call me, I'm immobile man, yes i am

Got a haircut, got a silver tooth, gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW, tryin' to get themselves arrested

He only grows for guys he knows and me
He only grows for guys he knows and me

Well alright

Don't try and call me I'm immobile man
Don't try and call me I'm immobile man, yes i am

Got a haircut, got a silver tooth, gonna get myself arrested
Got some friends in my BMW, tryin' to get themselves arrested

Got no time for the selfish me and you's, tryin' to get myself arrested

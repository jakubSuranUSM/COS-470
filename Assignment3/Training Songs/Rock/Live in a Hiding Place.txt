There are times that I should try, 
To be so much more alive 
But if time was right then I would be with you again 
Or do you worry that I try to avoid the point 
And then deny 
The time I spent deciding it was you again 

It's when I live in a hiding place 
It's the only way I feel safe 
When I'm safe in a hiding place 
(That's not hidden now) 
I'm safe in a hiding place 
It's the only way I feel safe 
When I'm safe in a hiding place 

And you're full of facts 
But not things that could add up to words 
Think about meaning more as an after word 
As in afterward 

I return but don't remain, 
I'm impatient for a reason 
To complain about winter, 
Making me see through again 
Or is it your damaged reply, 
That makes me realize that 
The more I try 
The less that plans will help me comprehend again 

So I live in a hiding place 
It's the only way I feel safe 
When I'm safe in a hiding place 
(That's not hidden now) 
I'm safe in a hiding place 
It's the only way I feel safe 
When I live in a hiding place 

And you're full of facts 
But not things that could add up to words 
You think about meaning more as an after word 
And you're full of facts 
But not things that could add up to words 
You think about meaning more as an after word 
As in afterward

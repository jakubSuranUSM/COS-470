Captain Collier came home, he's been fighting the war
And I guess he thought he'd be hailed as a hero and more
And he walked down the streets of the old home town
And he saw how it is around here now

Now Captain Collier had to call
far too many girls for a date that night
All the girls had gone out
with their long haired boys.  Captain Collier, he cried
"What the hell have I been fighting for?"
Oh, Captain it's for you
We wanna bring you home
We wanna hold you in our arms
Come back and keep us warm.

P.F.C. Mannie Stein,
Had been drafted and gone
He'd been told that only cowards say no.
He came home and called some old friends,
They'd resisted the draft
And they both were in prison
And their wives and their kids
Were all skinny and having a bad time
And P.F.C Stein
He remembered the men
Called political prisoners you know where and when.

And he learned that the lines are tapped all the time now
And he's wondering if maybe his courage is needed at home now
Yes soldier we're afraid
We're not just bein' fools
We're gassed and beaten here at home
We've got to change the rules

Corp'ral Thomas McCann 
Is a three year marine.
Someone told him he'd better join up,
It would would make him a man.
He came home and to the park he went
And he sat down on a bench

And a dungaree girl told him he'd been a man all along
And he looked at the sign that she carried in her hand.
It said "F*ck the war and bring our brothers home"
And corp'ral McCann he looks into her eyes
And I believe that he's begun to understand

Oh soldier, It's for you
We formed our little bands
The politicians and the magazines
They just don't understand.
Yes, soldier it's for you
We're riskin' all we have
We're nailed and jailed the same as you
Our lives are up for grabs
Yes soldier it's for you 
We want to bring you home
We wanna hold you in our arms
Come back and keep us warm.
Her bring our brother home, (repeat)

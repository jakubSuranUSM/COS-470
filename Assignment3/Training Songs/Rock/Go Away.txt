Your daddy don't mind at all if I come around
As long as I don't stay all night
Your mother Mary is giving me the eye ball
She doesn't know if you'd be alright
Said they were taking a trip, going south for a bit
Gonna see whatever sights they can see
So good-bye now, have a real good holiday
Kiss them once and pocket the keys

{chorus}
Said go on, go on, Go Away
Have a good time but won't you Go Away

When it's late at night you signal with the porch light
That's a green light to me
Then we head up to your lovely little bedroom
Anticipating what there will be
There's parasols and your baby dolls
Undo me honey babe I can't wait
But there's a car coming this way it's pulling in the driveway
Your folks are home hope I can escape
Screaming get off, get out, Go Away
Call me tomorrow but won't you go on, go on
Go Away

Go on, go on, go away
Go on, go on, go away
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go away

All I have is all I need enough for love but not for greed yeah. 
I was younger once this guy came to me told me about all the honey out there. 
He said "Honey gold jewels money women wine cars that shine." 
I don't know what he was talking about but I think I had an idea. 

He said "Smell the rose, sweet sweet rose, catch the sun find where it grows. 
Smell the rose, the sweet sweet rose that grows on castle walls in heaven. In heaven yeah."

Well if it feels like summer you're catching the sun, and I'm catching the moment you fall, 
If it tastes like honey don't swallow it all, don't wait for the moment to come- and catch the sun.

Hey dude don't lean on me man, Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude well I do what I can But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man. 

I was crossing the city one day, everybody was flashing by me Like images of tombstones, images of tombstones, On a Friday night I've seen everybody looking for their little bit of honey 
To alleviate the pain, to alleviate the pain.

Well if it feels like summer don't burn in the sun, don't wait for the evening to fall, If it tastes like honey don't swallow it all, don't wait for the moment to come- and catch the sun. 
No, no, n no, n no, no, etc. 
When I feel like a man! Hey dude, etc...

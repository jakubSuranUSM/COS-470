There's a little tree in my yard.
It was a very, very hot summer.
A great big green caterpillar
Was eating the leaves of the tree

Oh, my dear, the little tree.
I want to help the little tree.
Oh, my poor little tree.
If I don't help, it will be bare. 

My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree. 

There are many trees in the forest.
It was a very, very hot summer.
A big bulldozing caterpillar
Was pushing down all the trees.

Oh, my dear, the little trees.
We've gotta help the little trees.

If we don't help, the earth will be bare .

A few months have passed.
It was a refreshing autumn.
I came down to my yard.
The tree was flowering. 

Oh, my sweet little tree.
Beautiful white flowers.
Oh, my sweet little tree.
Someday you'll be a big tree. 

My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree.
My, my, my little tree.

Working all day, I'm digging up the roads, just working all day
Dig for my pay and spend it where I like. I've nothing to say
Drown in my sweat but money buys escape. I've got no regrets
Working all day
Working all day
When I was young I used to have illusions - Dreams ain't enough.
Papa was rough. He didn't care for learning. Hell life is tough.
Easy to say that everybody's equal then look around and
see it ain't true.
Working all day
I eat the dust. The boss gets all the money. Life ain't just.
I'm still the same as all the other people - who can I trust
Working all day and never getting nowhere, what can I
say working all day
Working all day.

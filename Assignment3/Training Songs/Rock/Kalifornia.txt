Kalifornia, have you gone wild?
I'm sifting through your dark miles
Reaching out for you
In the headlights glare
But you're way too devious
To be aware

Restless, restless
Windswept road
Take me someplace
Unfold

Kalifornia, in a bleak road song
Old nick warned me
Against the storm
But I'm your slipstream
You're my trail
Drive wild with me
Full sails

Restless, restless
Windswept road
Take me someplace
Unfold

Sometime
Get there sometime

When I'm on my own
And I need my home
You can hold every atom
And every limb I own
When I need a friend
Can you be that friend
Will you share every sorrow
For tomorrow is mine?
I can't help myself
The things you did for me
From now on I will have plenty
I can't help myself
I'm in love again
Now the time has come
My work is done
For every warm touch of kindness
I'm the blindest man here

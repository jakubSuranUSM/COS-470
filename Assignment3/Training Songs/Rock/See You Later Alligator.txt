Well, I saw my baby walkin' 
With another man today
Yeah, I saw my baby walkin' 
With another man today
And when I asked her what's the matter
This is what I heard her say

See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
Don't you know you're in my way now (Don't you know you're in my way now)
Can't you see you cramp my style (Can't you see you cramp my style)

When I though of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
When I though of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
Well, when she asked me what's the matter
Reminded her of what she said

See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
Don't you know you're in my way now (Don't you know you're in my way now)
Can't you see you cramp my style (Can't you see you cramp my style)

Said wait a minute 'gator
I know you meant it just for play
I said wait a minute 'gator
I know you meant it just for play
But don't you know you really hurt me 
And this is all I have to say

See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
See you later alligator (See you later alligator)
After 'while crocodile (After 'while crocodile)
Don't you know you're in my way now (Don't you know you're in my way now)
Can't you see you cramp my style (Oh)

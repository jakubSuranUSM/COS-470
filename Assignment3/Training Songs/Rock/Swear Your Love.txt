I'm holding on
It's all that I can do
I can't imagine
Me without you
All alone
I close my eyes
And wake up screaming in the middle of the night
This heart
Don't need it anymore

[Chorus]
Swear your love
Say that you remember
Share your love
Hear me calling out your name
I swear my love
Wait a little longer
How will it feel to be left
Standin' there all alone

You're on your own
If you walk through that door
I'm just a man
I can't give anymore
Somewhere deep inside
There's a memory that keeps you run and hide
You gotta know
You got a place to go

[Chorus]

Somewhere deep inside
There's a memory that keeps you run and hide
You gotta know
You got a place to go

[Chorus: x2]

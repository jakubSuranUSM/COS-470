I hope you're doing fine out there without me
Cause I'm not doing so good without you
The things I thought you'd never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood
So how could I have been so blind for all these years
This I only see the truth through all this fear living without you

And anything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me

I can't take another day without you
'Cause, baby, I could never make it on my own
I've been waiting so long just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong
I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
Everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

And anything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me

As the days roll on I see
Some is standing still for me
And you're not here
I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
Everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

And anything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me

And anything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me

Laughing all the way to the cell
And I've been paid off
Stood out into the sun cause I'm not done

I'm gonna find myself a lady friend
And stick by her until the end
La la la la la Layla 
I found love

I'm gonna find myself a lady friend
And stick by her until the end
La la la la la Layla
I found love
Oh no

You are my serpentine
But I'll never look you in the eyes again
You are my one divine
But I'll never look you in the eyes again

I can't tell what is right, what is wrong
What is far, what is near
Can't distinguish between truth, lies I fear

I am fading
Fading away

I can't find my strength
I really don't cherish the search anymore
I'm left without breath from making points I won't make anymore

I am fading
Fading away

I feel no need to borrow the crutches I borrowed before
Or to make another speech whose theme justifies what I am

I am fading
Fading away

I can't take the guilt - I feel like a thief when compared to my father
He fed me then, he feeds me still
What have I ever done

I am fading
Fading away

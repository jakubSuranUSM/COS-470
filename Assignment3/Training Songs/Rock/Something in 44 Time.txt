Sooner or later it`s a matter of money
And then it`s just a matter of time
You can say you don`t care and you think it`s funny
But baby it`s your life on the line

You`re selling yourself and it`s a matter of fact
Your love is your life and your life is your act

So ya gotta have something in 2/4 time
Ya gotta have something that always rhymes
Ya gotta have something in 4/4 time
Ya gotta have something
Gotta have something that rhymes

Continue to dream after you`re robbed of sleep
Even though the images fade
So grab what you can and all you can keep
Do you really think you`ll come out unhurt?

You`re selling yourself and it`s a matter of fact
Your love is your life and your life is your act

So ya gotta have something in 2/4 time
Ya gotta have something that always rhymes
Ya gotta have something in 4/4 time
Ya gotta have something
Gotta have something that rhymes

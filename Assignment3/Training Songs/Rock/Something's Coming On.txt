Something coming on, don't know what it is but it's getting stronger
Feeling in my bones, hope you let it last a little bit longer
Breaking out my head, doing things I never even dreamed of
Rolling down my spine, turning on the things that'd never been turned on
Suddenly she came in
Looked like she'd been gaming
Doing things with everybody else
When I yelled out loudly
She answered kind of proudly
That she spent her life upon the shelf

Something coming on, Now I understand Its getting better
I've got a feeling in my bones
what ever happens now it just donâ€™t matter Breaking out my head
I've been doing things I never even dreamed of
rolling down my spine, turning on my things that'd never been turned on

Suddenly she came in
Looked like she'd been gaming
Doing things with everybody else
When I yelled out loudly 
She answered kind of proudly
That she spent her life upon the shelf 

Talk about the woman

Something coming on, don't know what it is but it's getting stronger
Feeling in my bones, hope you let it last a little bit longer
Breaking out my head, doing things I never even dreamed of
Rolling down my spine, turning on the things that'd never been turned on
Suddenly she came in
Looked like she'd been gaming
Doing things with everybody else
When I yelled out loudly
She answered kind of proudly
That she spent her life upon the shelf

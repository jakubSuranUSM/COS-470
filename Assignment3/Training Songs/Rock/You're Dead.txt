"Ladies & Gentlemen,
Just so we understand each other:
In my right hand I have a gun,
So let's not have any problems, eh?"

You don't know where you're going,
You don't know where you've been
You don't know why
But your life is a lie,
It goes by like a dream
You're stuck in this rat race,
Your job drives you insane
You live for the bribe
Of the next pay-rise
And a cut-prize holiday

You know you're getting older,
It's not gonna stop
You're locked inside a prison
Where they bleed you drop by drop
You wake up and you wonder
Why bother getting out of bed
You sold your soul to the corporate goal
And you want a new life instead

Bang, bang you're dead
There's a gun at your head!
But it's only a game, if they shoot you down,
You can get up and start again

Bang, bang you're dead
But your blood's still running red
If you look at your life with different eyes,
You'll know how to start again

You can't break out of the circle,
Your life's not going anywhere
Nobody's going to help you,
'Cause none of them really care
You could lose your life
On a crowded street,
They wouldn't even turn their heads
It's all gone wrong,
The pressure's too strong,
Better get a new life instead

You don't know where you're going,
You don't know where you've been
You can open your eyes and the innocence dies
And your past life is a dream
Dead but your blood keeps pumping,
Dead but your heart still beats
You know why you're here, you know who you are
And you know who you wanna be

Bang, bang you're dead
There's a gun at your head!
But it's only a game, if they shoot you down,
You can get up and start again

Bang, bang you're dead
There's a gun at your head!
But it's only a game, if they shoot you down,
You can get up and start again

Bang, bang you're dead!
Bang, bang you're dead!
So down on luck, it feels like nothing's enough,
You should get a new live instead

Bang, bang you're dead
But your blood's still running red
If you look at your life but with different eyes,
You'll know how to start again

Feel the force
Of the blow
That's the price
For getting down
Maybe I understand
Just because I'm doing fine

On my own
I'm better off, on my own

Feel the cold, of my hands
That's the price for moving on
Taste the shame, on my lips
I know I know I'll do this

On my own,
I'm satisfied, on my own

[Chorus]
Step aside, let the heart's decide
The final kiss goodnight, my love
Tears will fall, years will grow, they say
The final kiss goodbye, my love

Wipe the sleep, from your eyes
And last night lullabies
Its a smack in the face
I know, I know you'll do this
In your own way

Keep the wolf from the door
Spend some time getting well
On your own
We're better off, on our own

[Chorus: x2]

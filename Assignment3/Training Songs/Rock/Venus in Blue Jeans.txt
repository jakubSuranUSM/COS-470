She's Venus in blue jeans
Mona Lisa with a ponytail
She's walkin' talkin' work of art
She's the girl who stole my heart

My Venus in blue jeans
Is the Cinderella I adore
She's my very special angel, too
A fairy tale come true

They say there's seven wonders in the world
But what they say is out of date
There's more than seven wonders in the world
I just met number eight

My Venus in blue jeans
Is ev'rything I hoped she'd be
A teenage goddess from above
And she belongs to me

My Venus in blue jeans
Is ev'rything I hoped she'd be
A teenage goddess from above
And she belongs to me

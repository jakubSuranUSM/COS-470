You’re the right stuff
I’ve got my head straight
Goin’ up town
I want to tell you
Hesitating
Standing back in (line)
Overriding
Body shaking
Coming straight down
Never knowing
Are you going?
Is there a next time?
Is there a next time?!

(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)

Lost and Found
Straight back down
What's that sound?
Its pulling me straight back in
Head down again

No denying
Still deciding
For a week now
No mistaking
What you’re saying
Standing back in (line)
Revelation
Invitation
Its gonna take time
Never knowing
Are you going? 
Is there a next time?
Is there a next time?!

(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)

Lost and Found
Straight back down
What's that sound?
Its pulling me straight back in
Head down again

You’re the right stuff
I’ve got my head straight
Going up town
I want to tell you
Hesitating
How you doing? (fine)
Overriding
Body shaking
Coming straight back
Never knowing
Where you’re going
Is there a next time?
Is there a next time?

(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)

Lost and Found
Straight back down
What's that sound?
Its pulling me straight back in
Head down again

Lost and Found
Straight back down
Its pulling me straight back in
Head down again

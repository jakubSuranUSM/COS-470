Minutes turn to days
Years just melt away
In the park at dawn
Just a flower on

I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue
I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue

We discovered love
In the basements of
Some of my best friends
I've never seen again

I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue
I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue

Oh so young and oh so tender
Almost hurts too much to remember
As if the weight of your head on my shoulder
By itself would make us older
If i could time it right
I'd be with you tonight
Out among the stars
Is that where you are?

I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue
I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue

I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue
I keep callin' to you
My baby blue, my baby blue

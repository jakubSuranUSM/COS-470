In a remote confined space
Took a life of a man with the same name
Slashed his side on the blade
On the handle his blood mourned his fate

And there's a demon in their veins
And their blood is sinned
And yet they know in their brains
But he still gets sinned

There's nothing more I hate
Than hearts that strain
Hearts that strain

Cellophane riddled walls
Closing in on the man whose nerves
Burned his side on the flames
On the fire his flesh mourned their fate

And there's a demon in their veins
And their blood is sinned
And yet they know in their brains
But he still gets in

There's nothing more I hate
Than hearts that strain
Hearts that strain

And there's a demon in their veins
And their blood is sinned
And yet they know in their brains
But he still gets in

There's nothing more I hate
Than hearts that strain
Hearts that strain

Sometimes I feel so inadequate
I start to question, am I ready for these things you ask?
My words are not so eloquent
But if I speak the truth in love even simple words are equal to the task

Oh Lord, let your spirit rise within me
Until the world cannot deny that you exist
This is my only passion
The very reason why I live

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

May my life be an offering
So completely given 'til there's nothing left but you alone
This is my prayer, my destiny
That my life reveals your glory so that you remain long after I am gone

Oh Lord, you have made me for this purpose
And all I have is just one life to give my all

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

Make it clear to see who you are revealed in me
A sacrifice
The beauty of the life you gave, unending love, amazing grace
My one desire, my one desire

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

I want to make the invisible God visible
(I want to make you visible)

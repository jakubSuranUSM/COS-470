It hurts me to lean on you what can I say 
Nothing I know suits me so fine I take the blame 
All I can see right now is that its dark 
And I've lost your heart 

Were still waiting for the one 
Were still falling for a superhuman 
Keeps our hearts from moving on 
Were still dreaming of a superhuman now 

Shallow beliefs I know tell me I'm wrong 
Are you happy now as I know that you are strong 
I'm sorry bout something but I don't seem to know 
How to let you go 

Were still waiting for the one 
Were still falling for a superhuman 
Keeps our hearts from moving on 
Were still dreaming of a superhuman now 

You better believe in something before you go

One, two
One, two, three, four

Well, I've been out of the woods for six days and nights now
And I'm a little hot wired but I'm feeling all right now
I got some money in my pocket

And I won't need a ride, yeah
I got a big Jag car and a baby by my side, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a little hot wired but I'm feeling OK
And I got a little lost down along the way
Well, I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah
I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah

Driving 500 miles, got 500 to go, yeah
I've got a rock'n roll music on my radio
I've got a brother on the rig just off the gulf coast
He says the girls down there are really the most, yeah

Well I'm a little tired out but I'm feeling OK
And I got a little lost along the way
But I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah
I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah

Well, I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo
Well, don't ask me what I'm doing, cause I don't know, yeah
Only hear you wasn't joking when you wrote me that letter

Things can't get worse so they gotta get better

[Chorus]

I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah
I'm just around the corner till the light of day, yeah
Oh yeah [Repeat: x4]

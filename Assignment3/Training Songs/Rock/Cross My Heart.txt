I don't know

But it seems that every single dream's
Bm
Painted pretty pictures in the air
        D            E
And it tumbles in despair
       F#m
And it starts to bend
        G              A
Until by the end its a nightmare

Bm           E     A           F#m
I'm gonna give all I've got to give
A            F#m  C     G          A
Cross my heart,   and I hope to live

I don't know
But it's true, so many things you do
Please you so they leave feeling warm
It's the calm before the storm
For the habit grows and before you know it you're deformed

I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But I see that every thing is free
When you're young and treasures you can take
But the bridge is gonna break
You reach the end screaming
"It's all been a mistake"

I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But it seems that every single dream's
painted pretty pictures in the air
Then it tumbles in despair
And it starts to bend
Until by the end its a nightmare

I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But I feel the safety isn't real, with everybody acting all the same
Or the rules will ruin the game
So I'll go my way, laughing while they say that I'm insane.  Yes-

I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But I find the speedy hands of time waving out a warning on the wall
But nobody heeds the call
And the soldier obeys while the parson prays for his downfall.  But-

I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

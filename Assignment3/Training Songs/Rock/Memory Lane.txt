This is the place you end up 
When you lose the chase
Where you're dragged against your will
From a basement on the hill

And all anybody knows
Is you're not like them
And they kick you in the head
And send you back to bed

Isolation pulled you past a tunnel to a bright 
World where you can make a place to stay

But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane

The mayor's name is fear
His voice patrols the pier
From a mountain of cliche
That advances every day

The doctor spoke a cloud
He rained out loud
You'll keep your doors and windows shut
And swear you'll never show a soul again

But isolation pushes you 'til every muscle aches
Down the only road it ever takes

But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane

If it's your decision to be open about yourself
Be careful or else
Be careful or else

I'm comfortable apart
It's all written on my chart
That I take what's given me
Most cooperatively

I do what people say
And lie in bed all day
Absolutely horrified
I hope you're satisfied

Isolation pushes past self-hatred, guilt and shame
To a place where suffering's just a game

But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane

Your little house on memory lane

Don't bug me baby, with your no-no-no
Don't drive me crazy, with your go-go-go
Well, I said don't bug me baby
I love you, goodness knows
Well, don't bug me baby, don't treat me like clay
Don't make me love you, then turn me away
Don't bug me baby, with your yakety-yak
Don't waste the evening, just doin' the fad

Well, don't you, baby don't treat me mean
Mm-mm, I don't want a bug in my lovin' machine
When I want romancin', don't look at me bleak
When I wanna kiss, don't turn me your cheek
When I wanna cuddle, don't tell me maybe
Well, I want lovin' and I want you baby
Baby don't, baby don't treat me mean
Well, don't want a bug in my lovin' machine

Well, don't bug me baby, you know it ain't right
You squirm like a lizard when I hold you tight
Don't keep me jumpin' like a frog in a bag
Don't start ziggin' when I wanna zag
Well, don't, baby don't treat me mean
Mm-mm, don't want a bug in my lovin' machine

Well, don't bug me baby, 'cause you know it ain't right
You squirm like a lizard when I hold you tight
Don't keep me jumpin' like a frog in a bag
Don't start ziggin' when I wanna zag
Baby don't, baby don't treat me mean
Well, don't want a bug in my lovin' machine

When I want romancin', don't look at me bleak
When I wanna kiss, don't turn me your cheek
When I wanna cuddle, don't tell me maybe
Well, I want lovin' and I want you baby
Baby don't, baby don't treat me mean
Well, don't want a bug in my lovin' machine

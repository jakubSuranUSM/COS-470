I thought that we could just lie here,
but yes I know how you love dancing in that dress
And yes, I love to watch
You soothe away my troubles
But now slide those freshly shaven legs into
The clean cold sheets I've put on just for you
With every single touch
My love for you just doubles

But of course none of this has happened at all, yet
We've not even spoken, but I'll bet
Once you're through my door
You'll want to stay for ever more
Because I will hold you so tight, I'll make you see how
You are the right woman for me now
Just give me a glance
To show me that I've got a chance

All this cavorting is designed to tease
And girl your dancing drives me wild so please
Do it one more time
But make it last forever

Oh how come none of this has happened at all, yet
We've not even spoken, but I'll bet
Once you're through my door
You'll want to stay for ever more
Because I will hold you so tight, I'll make you see how
You are the right woman for me now
Just give me a glance
To show me that I've got a chance

Oh dance, girl, dance

None of this has happened at all, yet
We've not even spoken, but I'll bet
Once you through my door
You'll want to stay for ever more
Because I will hold you so tight, I'll make you see how
You are the right woman for me now
Just give me a glance
To show me that I've got a chance

Here come the jesters, 1, 2, 3
It's all part of my fantasy
I love the music and I love to see the crowd
Dancing in the aisles and singin' out loud, yeah, yeah

Here come the dancers one by one
Your momma's callin' but you're having fun
You find you're dancin' on the number 9 cloud
Put your hands together now and sing it out loud

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy, yeah
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, yeah

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, yeah

Put out the spotlights, one and all
Then let the feelin' get down to your soul
The music's so loud, you can hear the sound
Reaching for the sky, churnin' up the ground

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, oh, yeah

It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy
It's all part of my rock and roll dream, yeah

Fantasy, yeah
Fantasy, yeah

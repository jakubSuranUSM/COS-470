Going to the station, ticket in my hand
Gonna see my lady, think she'll understand, my lord
 
Walkin to the river, take my rocking chair
Let that feeling overtake me, drift away from here, my lord
 
I think I'm coming home to you, my lord
I think I'm coming home, my lord
 
Got a situation, blowin' in my head
Got a short time to stay here, long time to stay dead, my lord
 
Goin' to the station, it's time for me to go
Don't think that I will miss you, when that whistle blows, my lord
 
I think I'm coming home to you, my lord
I think I'm coming home, my lord
I think I'm coming home, my lord
 
Don't know if it's the force, or the situation
But something just bother's me
Don't know if I can make it
Somewhere else
 
Goin' to the river, take my old chair
Let that feeling overtake me, drift away from here, my lord
Drift away from here, my lord
Drift away from here, my lord
Drift away from here, my lord.

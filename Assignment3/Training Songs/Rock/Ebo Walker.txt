Now Ebo Walker was born in Kentucky, and raised by his daddy on a hillside farm,
He took up fiddle playing just for fun, that's the last work Ebo Walker done. 

Well Ebo Walker left Kentucky 
cause Ebo's daddy said durn your hide,
You won't plant corn, and you won't make hay, 
you sit on the porch and play that thing all day. 

Well Ebo Walker, he walked and he fiddled and he walked and he fiddled and he drank till he died,

But I've heard tell when the winds are down and the moon shines bright, and the leaves are brown,
You can hear old Ebo Walker all around.

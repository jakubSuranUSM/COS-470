Are there oceans full of things you never see?
Are there skylines of the cities you don't see?
Is there music muted playing underneath?
Is mathematics keeping you from thinking free?

Do you see lights?
Turn your shadows white
White white white white
White white white white

Don't let rain clouds
Cloud all of your parades
Let the other side of darkness kiss your face
Into the sea, into the sea

Do you see lights?
Turn your shadows white
Do you feel bright?
Turn your shadows white

All the things I want to say
All the shadows in the way

Do you see lights?
Turn your shadows white
Do you feel bright?
Turn your shadows white

Wings cut until perfection, her shadow turns darker than night
As light is cursed from her bleeding womb
And her sanity banned
Shimmering blisters, lost Eden burned to ice
All fiends and beasts adored
Pointed daggers shaped her withered flesh
And betrays once more... 

A father who ravaged, with the son of a whore, mating with a spurious ghost... 
Cherished, nursed and defiled, faded forms feathers fell 
Stalking the nightshade earth as undead
Fate was stronger than her dreams of death
Pinned to the ebony surface, impaled through her wrists
Luring through utter darkness, wearing thorns in bloodied crowns

From divine to deviant, she split her pleasures into trinity
A father who ravaged, with the son of a whore, mating with a spurious ghost... 

"Alone she will break and alone she will bend
When all light has fled, when all hope and love is dead
An outcast from heavens grace, banished and exiled
Oh, benignant Divine - plagued be thy angel..." 

As darkness embraced her, and gained her delights
Bestowing sacred gifts
As bitter bounds of flesh arose, extending her sacrifice
Oh ,let pain be thy pleasure, and pleasure be thy pain
Never to abide, nor serve the divine
A form shunned for eternity 

A father who ravaged, with the son of a whore, mating with a spurious ghost... 
"Alone she will break and alone she will bend
When all light has fled, when all hope and love is dead
An outcast from heavens grace, banished and exiled
Oh, benignant Divine - plagued be thy angel..."

...A creature dismayed, black bloodied and plagued
From oblivious nightmares she crawled towards the dawn...

Cherished, nursed and defiled, faded forms feathers fell 
Stalking the nightshade earth as undead
Fate was stronger than her dreams of death
Pinned to the ebony surface, impaled through her wrists
Luring through utter darkness, wearing thorns in bloodied crowns

From divine to deviant, she split her pleasures into trinity
A father who ravaged, with the son of a whore, mating with a spurious ghost 

"Alone she will break and alone she will bend
When all light has fled, when all hope and love is dead
An outcast from heavens grace, banished and exiled
Oh, benignant Divine - plagued be thy angel..."

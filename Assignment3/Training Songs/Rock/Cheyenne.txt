Cheyenne - The face of pride never died
Cheyenne - The true blue water
Cheyenne - I celebrate for you and I
Sifting through the pieces of the broken prize

Cheyenne - I'm sending out satellites
Cheyenne - I'm hovering quite largely
Cheyenne - In paradox in suicide
Cheyenne in white

And if an innocent minute lives for the light
The time is right
Define a line
To hold back the night - inside
A single glimpse of purity
In a flickering light
Cheyenne sees right

Cheyenne - A drama not acted out
Cheyenne - In destiny stay gazing
Cheyenne - In witnessing if I'm to miss
Cheyenne in white

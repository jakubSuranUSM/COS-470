Walking, talking, breathing, trying to smile yourself to death
With your finger on the pulse of time there ain't no time to rest
It's a simple proposal to keep you walking the line
Just trying to get back for what you borrowed in time
The moral of the story's for a limited crew
But we're gonna be there in the chosen few

But meanwhile tomorrow, I'll try to find me a scene
There's got to be an easy way to turn my money green
With such a promising future there ain't no way to go wrong
But the line that I walk just keeps taking too long
There'll be a rainbow on morning of the following day
But how we're gonna find it I just can't say at all

If I live tomorrow like I'm living today
There ain't no way to borrow, look for me to stay

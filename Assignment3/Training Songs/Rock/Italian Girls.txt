I see, I see, I see all the monumental ruinization
I see, I see, I see the greatest works of art in western civilization
Ooh but where are
Tell me where are
Ooh but where are the Italian girls?

I drink, I drink, I drink too much Vino Rosso no more Amarone
I eat, I eat, I eat so much pasta basta, I'm so full and yet so lonely
Ooh but where are
Tell me where are
Ooh but where are the Italian girls?

I see Sophia on the silver screena
There must be more like her in Roma

I believe, I believe, I believe in La Donna Italiana Belissima
I need, I need, I need some little dream come true please tell me where
They're keeping ya
Faccia bella cara mia
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls

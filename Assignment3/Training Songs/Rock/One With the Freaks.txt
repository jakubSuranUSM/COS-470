You'll no longer be kissed 
And kind, as you long for
Intuition, as you have to
Learn the lesson twice
You'll no longer be kissed
And kind, as you long for
Intuition, as you have to
Say the password twice

Have you ever, have you ever 
Been all messed up,
Have you ever?
Have you ever, have you ever
Been all messed up,
Have you ever?

You're the pin card, you're
The lifeguard, you're the
Information guy, but things
Look much bigger on the
Knees, on your knees.
Miss the signal, miss the
Signpost, lose the access to
It all. and all of a sudden
You are one with the freaks.

Have you ever, have you ever
Been all messed up,
Have you ever?
Have you ever, have you ever
Been all messed up,
Have you ever?

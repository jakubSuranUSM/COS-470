Go easy, go easy, go easy 
Go easy on your promises 
And charity shown to clowns
Chansons d'amour are rising
On the other side of town

Listen to the music fade away	]
Blessed by a broken wand 	]
Today has passed forever	]
Tomorrow will be too long	] (Chorus)

Go easy, go easy, go easy
Somewhere a tide of harder eyes
Brings guns to bridal suites
The interrupted lovers 
Stand and shiver in floodlit streets

(Chorus)
Go easy, go easy, go easy
The tears of the devil have
Burned the seeds of pity
Radiation leads them 
To the heart of a dying city

(Chorus)

I wanna be
I know it's not hard, I just swear it's not easy.
To wanna be,
To wanna be so

Don't pity me,
Don't pity me even though I'm so pitiful.
It hurts to be, 
It hurts to be

So it seems to me, you get what you deserve.
So it seems to be, we live and we learn.

I wanna breathe, 
I wanna live my life like a musical.
I wanna see
A beginning and an end to all of this.
I wanna believe,
I wanna see something ugly turn into something beautiful.
It has to be,
It has to be

So it seems to me, you get what you deserve.
So it seems to be, we live and we learn.

Yeah, we learn.
Yeah, we learn.

When you are sad and lonely
And have no place to go
Come to see me baby
And bring along some dough
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin' honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

When you and your baby
Have a fallin' out
Call me up sweet mama
And we'll go steppin' out
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin' honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

We're goin' to the city
To the city fair
If you go to the city, baby
You will find me there
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin' honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

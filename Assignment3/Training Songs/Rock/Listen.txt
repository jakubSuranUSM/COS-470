Listen and I'll tell you how
Much I'd love to hold you now
If you listen you'll hear my heart pound
Whenever you're around me
Listen to that robin sing

At our window welcoming
The promise of an early spring
And a season made for loving
Miracles all around

You've only to follow the sound
Vibrating all around
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?

When I listen to that inner voice
It's telling me I have a choice
To condemn life or rejoice
I think I'll choose rejoicing
Listen
Listen

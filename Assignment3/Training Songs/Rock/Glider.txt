Into the sun in my glider 
There`s ah shadow beside her 
Up `n down through the blues 
Clouds give me my silent cues 
I`m up in my glider 
With ah shadow beside her 
It begins t` rain on her window pane 
Up in my glider 
There`s no shadow beside her 
Thunderin` `n lightnin` 
Gettin` pretty frightenin` 
I feel like an outsider 
Then the sun shows through `n right on cue 
There`s ah shadow beside her 
Up `n down through the blues 
I`m up in my glider 
`N I`m tellin` you boys there ain`t no noise 
`N me `n my baby ain`t never gonna bring my glider down

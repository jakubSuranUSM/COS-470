Mother, don't you recognize your son?
Coming home, yeah, yeah
Take me home
'Cause I failed you, mother
I'll be there in the morning
If you'll have me back
The rent up here is much too high for a room without a tap
A room without a tap, whoo
I'll be early in the morning
And I'll find my way back home
Back home, bad 'n' ruin with my tail between my legs
Tail between my legs
And I'll be so tired
I'll be so tired, now, listen

I'll be early tomorrow morning
And I'll fall down off my plane
Don't be embarrassed, mother, by your ugly worn-out son
Your ugly worn-out son

So just let me warn you
Mother, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now

And I'll be down on Cannon street
Passport in my hand
Should you not recognize me, I've heavily made-up my eyes
Mama, you won't recognize me now
Brother, you won't recognize me now, oh lordy
Sister, you won't recognize me now
Mother, you won't recognize me now

So, mother, when you've seen me, don't forget I'm your boy too
I know my brother has done you proud, he's one foot in the grave
Mother, don't you recognize me now?

I'm a burglar in the first degree
But it don't seem to worry me
I'll be so tired, so tired
I'll be so tired
So tired
So tired

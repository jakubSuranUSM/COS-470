Born into a war and peace
Forced to choose between right and wrong
Each man kills the thing he loves
For better or for worse
Face to face with a ragged truth
Mixed up and torn in two
Turned you back on the only thing
That could save you from yourself
Where were you hiding
When the storm broke
When the rain began to fall

When the thunder and the lightning struck
And the rain and the four winds did howl
After all time building up
Comes inevitable knocking down one by one
Comes receivers liars gamblers
Pick pocket entourage two by two
Selling out is a cardinal sin
Sinning with a safety net
They say all things come in threes three by three
Here comes the third degree

Where were you hiding
When the storm broke
When the rain began to fall
When the thunder and the lightning struck
And the rain and the four winds did howl
All cards are marked
All fates will collide
The truth is the truth
Or the truth is surely a lie
Get back in your shelter
If you can't come down off the fence
And one more question
Where were you?
Where were you hiding
When the storm broke
When the rain began to fall
When the thunder and the lightning struck
And the rain and the four winds did howl

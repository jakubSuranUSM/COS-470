(Sandy Denny)
I travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon
There's a heart in every place, there's a tear for each farewell
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
I'll lure you as the lace that the wayward gypsies sell
With the sinking of the sun, rising of the moon
Chorus:
Rising for the moon, the sun has set and it is dark
But the star of the enchanted tune is bright as any spark
The chorus of the dusk regail the evening lark
Whose every day does start rising for the moon
We travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is our fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon
Chorus (x2)

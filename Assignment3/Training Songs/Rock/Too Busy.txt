Busy busy
You keep me busy
Never call me all you do is call me

Too busy for ma lovin''
A too busy for ma pettin
That is all I've been a gettin' from you

Once more and I'm not lying 
I've noticed you've been trying 
Hard to shake me and it's makin' me blue

I can't understand your action
But I'll get my satisfaction
Don't you worry just you wait and see dear

Where do you want me honey
And then it won't be so funny 
When I say I'm too busy for you

Your too busy for my lovin'
A too busy for ma pettin' 
That is all and I've been a gettin' from you

Once more and I'm not a lying 
I've noticed lately you've been trying
Hard to shake me and it's makin' me blue

I can't understand your action
But I'll get my satisfaction
Don't you worry just you wait and see dear

Where did you want me honey
Then you won't think that it's so funny 
Let me say it's aggravatin'
Hear me say I'm not awaitin' from now on
Gonna busy too you

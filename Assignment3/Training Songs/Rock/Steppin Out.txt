Well, I had to leave town because of Uncle Sam's deal, ha ha ha yeah 
Well, I guess my good lovin' done lost its appeal 
Because when I called back I heard a-bad bad news 
They say our big romance has been gettin' abuse 
Now tell the truth, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
I've got ways of findin' out if you've been steppin' out on me 
It's my turn, let me give you a piece of my mind 

I told you once, I told you twice 
You're kind of rowdy after walkin' on ice 
Turn your loop in, do what I want you to do 
Stop your messin' now or I'm gonna step out on you 
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey hey! 

If I can't be your one & only man 
I'm gonna call your daddy to give him back your hand 
I'm gonna call the preacher, tell the choir stay home 
I guess you're the kind of woman that's just 'bout to roam 
Now tell me true, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
Tell the truth, child; you've been steppin' out on me 
I gotta know in my heart if you've been steppin' out on me 
I'll be checkin' with all your friends if you've been steppin' out on me 
Better tell me the truth honey; have you been steppin' out on me? 
Yeah I'm gonna check; no more stuff or I'll be steppin' out on you 
(more talk, fading out)

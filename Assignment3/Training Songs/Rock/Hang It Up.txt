My friends they get me higher and higer
They're killing me with friendly fire
We meet beneath the
They're walking us by, just stay for me

My friends they got a worry mort
They meet outside the corner store
And walk the pavement, miss the cracks
I join them mid but can't relax

Live up tricks when you don't have a thing
Live like a hippy if you wanna be king
People say is not worth the wait
Everybody loves somebody to hate

I'm not gonna go and mosh this room of vein
While looking at this again
Hard working in division
Send all the weak, can't get to prison
I wanna write about setting something free
All the changes drives us back to see
And this is all about starting out again
Same, or same, or never same

So friends won't buy, won't get a job
Me boys and girls
Slow parties, we sit on the ground
I rather be, just let me down
People say is not worth the wait

Everybody loves somebody to hate

And you can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up

Could've been a lawyer, take while you can
Never been happy since time began
It's getting kinda heavy, I'm a body full of bagbones
Spread it in the fire, driven me in brackstones
You got the time, they all can wait
You wanna start talking, cause it's not too late
Aquarium, staring em
Everybody loves somebody to hate

Break it, make it, you can make the break
Back and for fucksake just make it great
Intake, don't fake, gonna let go
Make all the changes that you need to make
Stand back, give it up, ain't life a bitch
No-one makin' you just you for this
Insane else is failure maintain
Time for you to re-arrange

And you can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up
You can hang it up, And you can hang it up
This time baby you can hang it up

Now shut up and play that guitar. 
Just shut up and play that guitar. 
We ain't nobody's darlings, 
We never should've made it this far. 
We ain't nobody's darlings, 
So shut up and play that guitar. 

I settle for watching her dance. 
I'm just watching her dance. 
We ain't nobody's darlings, 
We never stood a chance. 
We ain't nobody's darlings, 
So I settle for watching her dance. 

Now we got to the game 
Just a little too late.
Spent our early days, 
We spent our early days 
Just fucking up. 

We ain't nobody's darlings, 
We ain't nobody's boys.

Nice man Jack,
You should see him when the children play!
Nice man Jack,
He's the one to take their tears away.
Nice man Jack, so very warm and kind.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.

Nice man Jack,
And he's always there to lend a hand.
Nice man Jack,
Such a well-respected gentleman.
Nice man Jack, so charming in his way.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.

Midnight stranger takes a ride.
Nice man Jack got lots to hide,
More than just a man misunderstood,
More than just a man who's got the taste for blood.

Street girls feel the ripper's knife.
Surgeon skill taking life.
More than just a man, the woman cried.
More than just a man stood laughing as she died.

Nice man Jack is home again to see the morning come.
Smiling at the passers-by, he takes the midday sun.
And sometimes he would talk awhile to hear what people say.
But they all say the same thing as he turns to walk away.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.
It's a pity there aren't more like him.

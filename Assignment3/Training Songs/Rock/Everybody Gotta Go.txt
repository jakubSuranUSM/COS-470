Everybody's gotta go sometime, but I'm so far from ready

Ain't gonna let it, mess my mind,
I'm gonna keep on rockin' steady

Don't you know, everybody's gotta go sometime

You can drink, you can smoke,
You can do your dope, take a pill to ease your tension
You can dose, and dose, until you overdose,
It's called suicide prevention
But, don't you know, everybody's gotta go

Everybody's gotta go sometime, but I'm so far from ready
Ain't gonna let it, mess my mind,
I'm gonna keep on rockin' steady

Don't you know, Lord, don't you know

Don't you know, we all gotta go sometime

Take monkeys, and rabbits,
And little white rats, shoot 'em full of this and that
There's cancer in your food,
Cancer in the air, cancer in your cigarettes
Take vitamin C, B-12 and E, for your eyes, teeth, skin and bones
But, when the good Lord calls,
You can forget it all, don't you know you're good as gone

Don't you know, Lord, don't you know
Don't you know, we all gotta go sometime

You can drink, you can smoke,
You can do your dope, take a pill to ease your tension
You can dose, and dose, until you overdose,
It's called suicide prevention
But, don't you know, everybody's gotta go

Everybody's gotta go sometime, but I'm so far from ready
Ain't gonna let it, mess my mind,
I'm gonna keep on rockin' steady

Everybody know, everybody gotta go sometime
That's means me and you baby,
As long as we're goin' to heaven, I don't mind

Everybody know, everybody gotta go sometime
That's means me and you baby,
As long as we're goin' to heaven, I don't mind

Everybody know, everybody gotta go sometime
That's means me and you baby,
As long as we're goin' to heaven, I don't mind

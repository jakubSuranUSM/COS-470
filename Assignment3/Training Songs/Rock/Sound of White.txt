Like a freeze-dried rose, you will never be, 
What you were, what you were to me in memory. 
But if I listen to the dark, 
You'll embrace me like a star, 
Envelope me, envelope me
If things get real for me down here, 
Promise to take me to before you went away 
If only for a day. 
If things get real for me down here, 
Promise to take me back to the tune 
We played before you went away. 

And if I listen to, the sound of white, 
Sometimes I hear your smile, and breath your light. 
Yeah if I listen to, the sound of white 
You're my mystery. One mystery. My mystery. One mystery. 

My silence solidifies, 
Until that hollow void erases you, 
Erases you so I can't feel at all. 
But if I never fell again, at least that nothingness 
Will end the painful dream, of you and me 
If things get real for me down here, promise to take me to 
Before you went away, if only for a day. 
If things get real for me down here, promise to take me back to 
The tune we played before you went away. 

And if I listen to, the sound of white 
Sometimes I hear your smile, and breath your light. 
Yeah if I listen to, the sound of white 
Sometimes I hear your smile, and breath your light. 
And if I listen to, the sound of white. 

I knelt before some strangers face, 
I'd never have the courage or belief to trust this place, 
But I dropped my head, 'cause it felt like lead, 
And I'm sure I felt your fingers through my hair

And if I listen to, the sound of white sometimes 
I hear your smile, and breathe your light. 
Yeah if I listen to, the sound of white. 
The sound of white, 
The sound of white, 
The sound of white.

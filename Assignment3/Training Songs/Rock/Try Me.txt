Face to face but you're talking long distance
Can't stand up but you still try to dance
Qualude shuffle, up to my table
Two steps back, one step advance.

I can tell by the smile you're trapped in
You've been smoking your breakfast again
Real life specimen, Space Captain
Know where to stop but you don't know when.

Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to teach you to fly
Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to teach you to fly.

Life begins at midnight if you're feeling down
The white man's talking powder turns you round
Powder y'nose don't mean what you suppose
In this town it's inside not out.

I can tell by the smile you're trapped in
You've been smoking your breakfast again
Real life specimen Space Captain
Know where to stop but you don't know when.

Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to touch the sky
Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to teach you to fly
Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to teach you to fly
Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, become addicted to me
I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to touch the sky
Try me, I could be all that you need to get high
Try me, I don't promise to teach you to fly.

Don't need nobody just me and you. 
Like the way you walk 
Like the things you do 
Got no confusion with you by my side 
And when It's time to go I'm satisfied. 

[Chorus]
Oh one and one is one 
Oh one and one is one. 

So let it ride yea let it be 
In this old world just you and me 
We'll go flying each and every night 
Carry your picture on every flight.
 
[Chorus] 

And when I call you an that telephone 
My heart skips a beat if you're not at home 
Yea when I call you on that blue telephone 
I can hear your voice calling me back home. 

[Chorus]

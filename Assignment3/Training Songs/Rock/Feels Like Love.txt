I'm red-hot, higher than high
Gettin' some action on a midnight ride
Feelin' alright this Saturday night
Your touch ignites the fire
Drivin' my heel to the edge of desire
Feelin' so right, it's Saturday night

No more lonely nights searchin' for this feelin'
Lovelight's shinin' in your eyes

Girl, it sure feels like love
I need it every day
Yeah, it sure feels like love
I wanna tell you
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
Feels like love

I once thought love was for fools
For broken hearts and broken rules
I was so wrong for so long
We're pulling over to the side of the road
Decide if it's love or just an overload
Girl I, I need to know, ooh, I gotta know

No more lonely nights searchin' for this feelin'
Lovelight's burnin' in your eyes

Girl, it sure feels like love
I need it every day
Yeah, it sure feels like love
I wanna tell you
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
Feels like love

Girl, it sure feels like love
I need it every day
Yeah, it sure feels like love
I wanna tell you
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
Feels like love, come on

It feels like love, come on
Feels like love, I need it every day
Feels like love, every day
Feels like love, every day
Feels like love

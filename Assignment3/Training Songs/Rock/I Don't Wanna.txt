I ain't here to hold you when you cry
I ain't here to hold your shaky hand
I ain't here to look you in the eye
Or beg for you to understand

I ain't gonna walk you through your dreams
Walk you through this life that we all know
I ain't here to listen while you speak
I ain't here to heal your broken soul

I'd like a one-way ticket home, ticket home
Where I can watch television, talk on the telephone
But every town I wander there's a billboard on a throne
Ticket home
I want a ticket home
Does anybody know my name, or recognize my face
I must have come from somewhere, but I can't recall the place
they dropped me at the matinee, they left without a trace
Ticket home
I want a ticket home
Elvis Presley is the king, I was at his crowning
My life just flashed before my eyes, I must be drowning

Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane
Raping distance in the skies, while diving in champagne
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same
Ticket home
I want a ticket home

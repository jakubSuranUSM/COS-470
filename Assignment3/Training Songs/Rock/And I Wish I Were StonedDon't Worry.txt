Don't worry ''cause I always be there for you
I just needed you to comfort me
And I have tried to make it right
And I don't know that I feel so sure
But I think that we must stand
So I've sung this song for you
And I just want you to say to me

Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you (always be there)

And all I wanted was to stand alone
So is there a place that we could meet (that we could meet)
And you see this face within, your face and I
Stayed away but I am back to hear you say

Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you (always be there)
(And the heavens above)

Can you hear me (can you hear me)
Through the spaces (through the spaces)
Wondering in this wonderland
And if I try to understand it
Broken Man (broken man)

Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
And the heavens above (broken man)
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you (always be there broken man)
Yeah hey yeah [Repeats]

Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday? 
Another Friday night waiting for a revelation 
I can see a million faces in the condensation 

In a moment you'd changed 
Things weren't the same 
You were talking at me not with me 
And your tongue was burning up in flames 
Are you coming back? Are you coming back? 
When Monday comes you'll be alone with 
The whole world staring at you 

Hey my friend are we gonna make it 'til Monday? 
Hey my friend friend you better leave now I'm gonna go my own way 
You said I suffer from inner frustration 

In a moment you changed 
Things weren't the same 
You were talking at me not with me 
And your tongue was burning up in flames 
And when you turn him off 
Where does he go? 
Where've the years gone? 
I don't no 
Hey my friend are we gonna make it 'til Monday? 
Hey my friend are we gonna make it 'til Monday?

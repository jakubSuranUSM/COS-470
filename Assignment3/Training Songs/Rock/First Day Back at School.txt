Our first day back at school
I saw you standing there
I saw your big brown eyes
And loved your raven hair

You didn't know it but I saw you too
In your letter sweater of gold and blue
Your big broad shoulders and your flashing eyes
I picked you out from all the other guys

If you'll wear this ring for me
Then we'll go steadily
As the year draws to an end

I'll be wearing your fraternity pin
Then one day when we're out of school
And our campus days are through
We'll be making all our future plans
To be wearing matching wedding bands
I'm glad that I saw you our first day back at school

If you'll wear this ring for me
Then we'll go steadily
As the year draws to an end
I'll be wearing your fraternity pin
Then one day when we're out of school
And our campus days are through
We'll be making all our future plans
To be wearing matching wedding bands
I'm glad that I saw you our first day back at school
I'm glad I saw you too our first day back at school
I'm glad that I saw you our first day back at school

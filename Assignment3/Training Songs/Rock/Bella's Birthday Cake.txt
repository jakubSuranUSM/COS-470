Bella played the Bridge every second lonliest night of the year
And took a set and lock into a fellow man, Bella
She said I brought her back to some old better man, Bella

See, Bella's she was born today, feeling kinda spry

Bella's birthday cake was burning yeah, like lightening, or like fire
Oh, Bella's birthday cake was burning

Bella made her bed and read every loneliest night of the year
And talkin' to the Wretches of her rocking chair
Bella
And flipped her quiet through her everywhere's
I tell ya

Bella, she was born today, feeling kinda spry
Bella's birthday cake was burning yeah like lightening, or like fire, oh
Bella's birthday cake was burning, yeah
My yard and forest fire

Woo-ooh, oh

Cold wind over the lawn she left her friend
Spirits and bats was what she said
And over her mountain tops she drowned me off where, I can't remember, no

Bella played the bridge on the second loneliest night of the year
Bella she was born today

Bella (Bella, Bella, Bella)
Bella (Bella, Bella, Bella)
Bella (Bella, Bella, Bella)
Bella (Bella, Bella, Bella)

Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella's birthday cake was burning
(And the heat is gone)
Bella's birthday cake was burning
(And the heat is gone)
Fifty years woo-hoo-hoo
(And the heat is gone)
Bella's birthday cake was burnin' burnin' burnin'
(And the heat is gone)
Bella
Bella
Whoo

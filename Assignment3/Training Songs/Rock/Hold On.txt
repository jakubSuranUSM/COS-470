These days I don't see you walk so proud
These days I don't hear you talk so loud
Thought you'd soaked up all of the blows
I realized you are not even close

It feels like it's tearing you up
It feels like it's tearing you down

You'll get through this if you hang on
'Cause the truth is you're not alone
You'll get through this if you hang on
Cause the truth is you're not alone
You're not on your own

I see your face on every corner, on every street
You spend your days just waiting for your next defeat
Well, I can only tell you what I know
And all I know is that I just don't know

And it feels like it's tearing me up
Yeah, It feels like it's tearing me down

I'll get through this if I hold on
'Cause the truth is I'm not alone
You'll get through this if you hang on
And the truth is I'm not alone
I'm not on my own

You are not alone
It's just hard sometimes to carry on
I'm not on my own
And you are not alone
It's just hard sometimes, it's so hard sometimes
We've got to hold on
We've got to hold on, hold on

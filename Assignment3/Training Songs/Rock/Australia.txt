In the early 80's when I washed up on the shore
I could breathe a little more than I would realize
You can call me crazy, you can call me what you will
You could take the bitter pill, if it helps you sleep at night

It's a long long way my crooked friend
Such a long long way back
Home
So close, yet we've come so far
So close, still we've got so far

I can safely say we feel as safe as we like
Lest we forget those who die, I never will
Such a perfect Island, tucked away in the sea
The real land of the free, do you here me

It's a long way home my crooked friend
But I do appreciate the time we spent
Its a long long way back home
Such a long long way back 
Home

So close, yet we've come so far
So close, still we've got so far
So close, yet we've come so far
So close, still we've got so far
So close, yet we've come so far
So close, still we've got so far

A long way home

Jealous cowards try to control
They distort what we say
Try to stop what we do
When they can't do it themselves

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, but it's no use

Society's arms think they're smart
I find satisfaction in what they're lacking 'cause
We are born with a chance
And I'm gonna have my chance

Rise above

If I had my way. We would stay golden
Frozen in frame. Never get older
Days pass and time just slips away

The summers that came. Lasted for ages
Drinking coke in the shame. Sunburnt faces
I grew up and I.. went away
But I always said that I’d come back someday
To be laid down

Take me back to forever
That’s where I was born to be
How’d I end up in this land of never
Only memories

It used to go slow,
But now it’s so fast
It melts like the snow,
Christmas midwest
Time lapses years just drift away
But I always said that I’d come back someday
to be laid down
Take me back to forever
That’s where I was born to be
How’d I end up in this land of never
Only memories
In this spot.
This exact spot
Is where I’d hide until I got caught
And this place, this is my place
And homes all I got so

Take me back to forever
That’s where I just long to be
How’d I end up in this land of never
Only memories
Oh my memories,
they come back to me.
Oh my memories.

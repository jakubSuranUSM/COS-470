Every day I recognise
What's deceased and what's alive
Don't repeat what I just said
Until gold has turned to lead

And all the tales will be told
Whilst you and I are in the cold
But don't think this is the end
'Cause it's just begun my friend

When it's done
And all this is gone
Just find the feeling
Pass it on

For every tear cried in shame
There'll be someone else to blame
And every crime that I commit
There'll be a punishment to fit

And I'd accept what's coming round
If I could only lose this sound
That's been ringing in my ears
And tormenting me for years

When it's done
And all this is gone
Just find the feeling
Pass it on

When it's done
And all this is gone
Just find the feeling
Pass it on

Just find the feeling
Pass it on
Just find the feeling
Pass it on

Just find the feeling
Pass it on

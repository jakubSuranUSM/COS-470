I know somebody and they cry for you
They lie awake at night and dream of you
I bet you never even know they do but somebody's crying

I know somebody and they called your name
A million times and still you never came
They go on loving you just the same I know that somebody's trying

So please return the love you took from me
Or please let me know if it can't be me I know when
Somebody's lying, I know when somebody's lying

I know that somebody's lying, I know that somebody's lying

Give me a sign and let me know we're through
If you don't love me like I love you
But if you cry at night the way I do I'll know that somebody's lying

So please, return the love you took from me
Or please, let me know if it can't be me
I know when somebody's lying, I know when somebody's lying

Oh I
Oh I

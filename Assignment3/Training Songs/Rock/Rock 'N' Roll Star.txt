The higher you fly, the harder you fall
The way that it goes, so they say
No mountain's too high, no valley too low
No river too wide on the way
So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long

The harder you try, the lower you fall
The way that it seems, so they say
The mountain is high, the valley so low
You're losing your dreams on the way

So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long

Looking behind you
All the bad times that you've had
Looking before you
Only good times?

So you're gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna make it on your own
Write a song that everyone can sing along
So you want to take a trip to the stars
Can you find your way back home?
You'll get your break, but don't you wait too long
Now don't you wait too long

I will wait like nothing; I have ever waited for 
I will catch your tears from falling; until from my hands they poor 

You can leave me abandoned, I'll be here if you walk back in 
Like the rest I have been branded far beneath the skin 
So far beneath the skin 

You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven 
You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven 

Here I have been standing but the time has come and gone 
I tried singing to you, but you turned my words to stone 

Here I have been waiting, it seems for quite a while 
Changed all my reflections 
But inside still just a child 
But inside still just a child 

You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven 
You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven 

These eyes weren't made for crying; This love wasn't made to waste 
These arms weren't made for battle, but to share in your embrace 

You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven 
You shall be, you shall be, you shall be Forgiven

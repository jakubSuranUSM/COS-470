Don't cross the street
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle of the block.
Don't cross the street
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle of the block.

Use your eyes to look up.
Use your ears to hear.
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear
And wait and wait, until you see the light turn green

Don't cross the street
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle of the block.

Don't cross the street
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle of the block.

Don't cross the street
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle of the block.

Use your eyes to look up.
Use your ears to hear.
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear.
And wait and wait, 
Until you see the light turn green.

Don't cross the street
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle of the block.

Don't cross the street
In the middle 
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle
In the middle of the block!

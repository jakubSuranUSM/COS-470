I know, you know
We don't see
We sow our truth, wait patiently

I walk the streets with a song in my head
We ebb and we flow so
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
My heart always seems to know
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale

I used to
Hover outside my truth
Always worry of what I'd lose
Take away my record deal
Go on, I don't need it
Spent the last 2 years getting to what's real
And now I can see so clear
I hope you feel just like I feel
I found some kind of fairytale

Want a garden by the ocean tide
Because I lose my way searching for stage lights
Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so
'Cause it's your seeds I sow
And now I know

Nolita flat on rent control
That's the life I choose
And you drag me to the fashion show
The poses that I see through
The movies in the afternoon

'Cause I found some kind of fairy tale
hey
Nolita Fairytale (Ba da da da da da, Ba da da da da da)

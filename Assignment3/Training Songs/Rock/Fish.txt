I
Have a fish nailed
To a cross
On my apartment wall
It sings to me with glassy eyes
And quotes from Kafka
I sings to me
An eel is squirming on my couch
He's talking up a storm
I'm laughing at his face
He slithers down across the floor
I'm laughing
I
Have a man
It follows my hips with his hands
Don't worry (I'm laughing)
Dance in the road (I have a man)
And it explodes
(It follows my lips with his melting eyes)
Don't worry
Dance in the road
Fellow turns a fishy eye from the counter
I feel at his hand
Stalking in the grey
The girl behind the counter
Sees a fin (school)
An eel slithers to the chalkboard
It writes 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5
plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6
Don't worry
Dance in the road
And it explodes
Don't worry
Dance in the road
The house is reeling
I'm kneeling by the tub
Lonely is as lonely does
Lonely is an eyesore
The feeling describes itself
I
Have a man
It follows my hips with his hands
I'm laughing
At a man
It follows my lips with his melting eyes
Don't worry
Dance in the road
And it explodes
Don't worry
Dance in the road
Eye...
I'm painting his eye in the middle of the floor
Fish is frozen in my living room
Stares out of a block of ice
With one melting eye... eye... eye...
(Whoo!) Aced it
Sick

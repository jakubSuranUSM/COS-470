Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
I make this claim, now let me explain
Since she lost you
Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
Free in the truth of make-believe
Since she lost you

She is determined to prove
How she can build up the pain
Of every lost and lonely day

Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
She'll make you believe what you'll never believe
Since she lost you
Jacky's only Jacky when she's up on the stage
Living bodies that actually move
Since she lost you

She is determined to prove
How she can fill up the page
Of every lost and lonely day

Cue lights! I am singing to my lover at night
Scene Two: Everyone who comes must go
Scene Four: Blacker than ever before
Scene Six: This country is making me sick

Jacky cracks when she isn't on stage
See the effects of sexual neglect
No script, no crew, no auto-cue
No audience telling her what to do
Exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit, exit, exit
Exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit

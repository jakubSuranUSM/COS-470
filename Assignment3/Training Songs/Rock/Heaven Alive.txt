I patiently wait for my turn
While you fill the gaps with a bold empathic love.
Hey... is it coming over you?
Hey there... we should come together, wait on something new.

And christ alive! Am I dilating
My inhibitions soon dissipating
Can we afford to stay this way forever and forever.. amen.

This release inside of me
Is like my heaven calling
Endless possibilities
Are my defences falling down.

And all the while the strobing flicker
Of fireworks I'm peaking quicker
Than I ever have or ever will again.

Cut to pieces
Your friend in jesus
Pledge allegiance
And all's forgiven.

Oh depression
Is got you guessing
About the thing that you do

Don't you let it
'Cause you can bet it
She'll make a fool outta you

When confusion
Keeps ya loosin'
And you're searchin' for a find, hey, hey

Turn this madness
Into gladness
Keep these words in your mind

Everything
That you do, baby
Will come back to you
Don't you know it will

Everything
That ya do
Will come back to you

Eyes wide open
See the motion
Of the problems that go down, go down

You can't stop 'em
Better drop 'em
Don't let 'em turn you around

Hold on when you hear
That voice inside
Why don't you let it be your guide, hey , hey

Don't you know
You just can't go, oh no
Wrapped up in your foolish pride

Everything
That you do
Will come back to you
Listen to me baby

Everything
That ya do
Will come back to you, hey, hey, hey, hey yeah

Everything
That ya do, yeah
Will come back to you
Can you hear me people

Everything
That ya do, yeah
Will come back to you
Lord, Lord

Everything
(Everything)
That ya do
(That ya do)
Is gonna come back to you
(Is gonna come back to you)
Is gonna come back to you
(Come back to you)

Everything
That ya do, yeah
Is gonna come back to you, hey babe
Is gonna come back to you

Is gonna come back to you
(Ooh yeah)
Is gonna come back to you
Is gonna come back to you
(Listen babe)

Well, better watch what you say
Watch what you do
It's gonna come right back, right back on to you

You, you, you
Everything

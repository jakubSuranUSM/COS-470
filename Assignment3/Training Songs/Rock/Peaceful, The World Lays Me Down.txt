Oh, well it's hard to look deep into your soul.
Not everything you'll find will be perfect gold.
There are ghosts and demons that hide in the dark.
Oh, they wait till you find them and then they laugh.
Oh, they know that my body is no way good enough.
Know that my heart is no way strong enough for the missiles that love brings.
When I recoil in fear, oh, the demons shake.

But it's a hollow love for a heart with no blood
In its veins.

Oh, there is no endless devotion,
That is free from the force of erosion.
Oh, if you don't believin' God,
How can you believe in life?
When we're all just matter that will one day scatter,
When peaceful the world lays us down.
Oh and finding love is a matter of luck,
And unsettled lovers move from fuc to f*ck.
Oh, and compare their achievements like discussing 
And compare their aberrations with romantic quotations,
Oh, as peaceful, the world watches down.

You were blown out of the water.
Oh, and we walk o the feet we have grown.
And we were given a heart, of which love is a part.
Oh, and we cornered the thing from which all life will spring.
And it gave value to the world.
I surrender

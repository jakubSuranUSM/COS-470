I need a break and I need one clean
Things are never what they seem
What seems close is so far away
And you keep runnin' out of words to say
But I keep on singing anyway

'Cause I'm never goin' back there
No I'm never goin' back there
Folks don't really talk much about it anymore

'Cause it's a place with no way in it
It's a road to no way out
I'm asleep when I'm awake
I can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again

'Cause it's a place with no way in it
It's a road to no way out
Everything ends in a heart ache
I can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you

No one calls much anymore
That's okay 'cause I don't use the phone
It feels better on your own
But don't get wasted every day alone

And I'm never goin' back there
I don't care
I don't want to talk much anymore

'Cause it's a place with no way in it It's a road to no way out
Everything ends in a heartache I can't get a break
And I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you
Yes I'm falling out
I'm falling down again
And I'm calling out
I'm calling out to you

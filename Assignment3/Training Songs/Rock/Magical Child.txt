As I lie beside you, feeling the life that we made with our souls
Nothing like this ever happened to me
I seem to react to a vague memory
This is the way that she said it could be
Having a magical child
As I stand before you, watching the love turn around in my eye
I've waited for so long for someone to care
I've waited for so long for someone aware
I've waited for so long for someone to share
Having a magical child
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to
Bring another life to this place
Then I finally realized I was watching myself grow up
Can you not see it in his face, your face
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to
Bring another life to this place
Then I finally realized I was watching myself grow up
Can you not see it in his face, my face
As I lie beside you, feeling the life that we made with our souls
Nothing like this ever happened to me
I seem to be reacting to a vague memory
This is the way that she said it could be
Having a magical child, child, child

For every child that has been born there is a chance to shine,
And everyone can have a dream until the end of time,
So live for every moment as the world keeps turning round,
And lift your hands up to the sky and say it loud and proud,
"I have been here, read my name, read my name!"

For every child that has been born there is a chance in life,
To try it all and be someone with what we have inside,
So don't give up and don't give in, just give it all instead,
And raise your voice above the crowd and let them know
You've said "I have been here, read my name, read my name,
With all I've got I've taken part, I've made a difference
To the world, I have been here, just read my name!"

Endlessly amazing and inventive that we are, we dive the
Deepest oceans and we reach out for the stars,
And one day there will be a man across the universe,
Who'll say "I come from Planet Earth" and these will
Be his words "I have been here, read my name, read my name,
With all I've got I've taken part, I've made a
Difference to the world, I have been here, just read my name!"

And when the darkness has to fall and comes the end of days,
Then lift your hands up to the sky and say it
Once again, "I have been here and I have taken part,
I've made a difference to the world, I have been here,
Just read my name!"

"I have been here, just read my name,
I've taken part, reach for the stars,
Across the universe, we come from Planet Earth."

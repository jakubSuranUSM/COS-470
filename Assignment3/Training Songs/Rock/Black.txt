Would you tell me that you love me
If you never really cared
Would tell me that you leave me
If no tears were never shared

Don’t you try to tell me
It’s all over again
Don’t try to show me
Loneliness my old friend

Every night I want you back again
Every night I’m in the black
Every night I need your love again
I wanna see you dressed in black
I want you back
In black
I wanna see you dressed in black

Should I stay forever lonely
Like I never really cared
Should I answer when you call me
Like those years were never there

Don’t you try to tell me
It’s all over again
Don’t try to show me
Loneliness my old friend

Every night I want you back again
Every night I’m in the black
Every night I need your love again
I wanna see you dressed in black
I want you back
In black
I wanna see you dressed in black

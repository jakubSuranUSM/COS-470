Don't you get tired
Of listening to the cover up
Sounds like a broken old record
When the needle gets stuck

You got your media honeys
Using their T.V. voice
Tellin' you what you done decided
As if you had any choice

[Chorus]
And didn't they cry and worry
'bout people of color
And didn't they mostly turn away
Keep us afraid of each other
And you know it's a lie,
it ain't about people of color
The American Dream betrayed
And all of us feel the same rage
And it won't go away

Isn't it strange,
Ain' t it a mystery
How did he get it in his head
Somehow he could speak for me

Hey! If what he's been a' saying
Is actually what he believes
Then one of us surely is a fool
And you know that he thinks that it's me

[Chorus]

Somebody wants us divided
Someone of evil intent
Trying to confuse and control
The minds of the innocent

And isn't it time
Good people have got to speak up
And you'll know exactly what to say
When you've finally had enough

Don't you go try
And blame it on people of color
And don't you dare turn away,
Keep us afraid of each other
Cause you know it's a lie
It ain't about people of color
The American Dream betrayed
And all of us feel the same rage,
And it won't go away

Won't go away
Won't go away
Won't go away

Around unbroken circle, listening to oracle
Campfire is glowing true blood red
Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day

Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world

You're in your ivory tower, I'm in the final hour
To find the answers up ahead
Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day

Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world

Loved ones and family far away
We're getting closer every day

Our New Discovery will change the future of the world
Our New Discovery will change the future of the world

You crazy baby bathsheba, I wancha
You're suffocating you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, shebe, so gimme
Dead
Dead

We're apin' rapin' tapin' catharsis
You get torn down and get erected
My blood is working but my, my heart is
Dead
Dead
Dead

Hey
Whaddyah know?
You're lovely
Tanned belly
Is starting to grow

Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

Tape magnetique
Wild flutters flock ?
Press pause record play
All at once

Mixtape cassette
Ego in love
Makes that a fuss
Fuzz fuzz lay down

One more track
Listen to this 'til I come back
Side B remember me
I missed you

Noisy motor sounds
God is in the good old deck
Wake up posie round ? 
I kiss up her neck

Promise endless
Write and protect
Coach punched through
Continuous glue

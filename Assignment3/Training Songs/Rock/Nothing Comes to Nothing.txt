Won't you come, come back to earth
Cause they're all concerned
You know how they're worried for you.
And all their words, they jar my nerves I know
Each curse by each new kiss is run through

Nothing comes to nothing without my baby,
Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby

At an Amwellian Do a tongue soaked in booze says
"He's filthy and much older than you"
Oh the sick sick muse, the sickly muse
Pulls out her sickle so shiny, cuts the tongue in two
While the music sways and forays and searches and says:
"Give me the young man in blue"
While the music sways and forays and searches and says:
"Break your heart in two"

Nothing comes to nothing without my baby,
Nothing ever comes to nothing with my baby,
All I ever do

Where's the happy prince? Where? There's his smiling bride.
He's right beside you Flo...

Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby,
Nothing's ever good for nothing with that lady

Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby,
Nothing ever comes to nothing without my baby

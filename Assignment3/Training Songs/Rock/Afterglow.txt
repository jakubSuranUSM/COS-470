There's a sacred place
It's where I go
As I lay my head
On my pillow
In this world I roam
The glory shines

Hard to breathe
My soul I leave
Now I can see

By the lake
The road you take
The lone mistake
I try to break

So let me go
I wanna know
So let me go
In the afterglow

In this wonderland
I lose myself
You will find no trace
To find yourself

Hard to breathe
My soul I leave
Now I can see

By the lake
The road you take
The lone mistake
I try to break

So let me go
I wanna know
So let me go
In the afterglow

In the wild wood rests
The autumn rose
With your shield and crest
This life you chose
I will cross the stream
That waits for me

Hard to breathe
My soul I leave
Now I can see

By the lake
The road you take
The lone mistake
I try to break

Let me go
I wanna go
So let me go
Oh, let me go
I wanna go
Let me go
In the afterglow

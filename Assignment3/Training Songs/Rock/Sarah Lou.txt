Come on Sarah
For you you said
Leave me alone
So what did I have
I died for
Try to understand
I did it all I wanted you
Sarah Lou
But you can't deny
That every time was just for you
Sarah Lou
No more no end
To beg for you
But just don't trust
It's over
To finish it
What have you done for me
I will do something for you
After all that shit
You will spit your blood
Breathe your last breath for me
Leave me

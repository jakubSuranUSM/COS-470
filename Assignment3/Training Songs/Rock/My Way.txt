Well listen pretty baby
Let's go out tonight
Tell your mama not to worry
Everything's gonna be alright

Don't let me hear you talking
Just be there when I call
'Cause I do I do my way
Or it won't be done at all

Little girl
Better hear what I say
I'm an easygoing guy
But I always gotta have my way

I was born a tiger, I've always had my way
Nothing's gonna change me on this or any day
Don't let me hear you argue when I say walk or jump
A woman ain't been born yet that can play me for a chump

Little girl
Better hear what I say
I'm an easygoing guy
But I always gotta have my way

Don't ask me for a reason
Don't even wonder why
I'll walk away and leave you
I don't want to see you cry

I've done a lot of planning
I've got lotta things to do
So don't give me no trouble
Or me and you are through

Little girl
Better hear what I say
I'm an easygoing guy
But I always gotta have my way

I'm an easygoing guy
But I always gotta have my way
But I always gotta have my way

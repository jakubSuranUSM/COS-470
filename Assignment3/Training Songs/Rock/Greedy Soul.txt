I'm going toe-to-toe
With a greedy soul
Heâ€™s going down tonight
Gonna be out a while
She's got a six six six
I've got my crucifix
She got a spinning head
Like seeing Grateful Dead

You're getting told
You greedy soul
You've been telling lies
The slippery kind

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way 'round
And now it's all too much
I got the Midas touch

They're taking me for gold
Well if the truth be told
He got you kiss and tell
I hope you go to hell
I'm going ropey dope
You think I'm giving up
I gotta run or hide
I don't give a f*ck, alright?

You're getting told
You greedy soul
You've been telling lies
The slippery kind

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way 'round
And now it's all too much
I got the Midas touch

And it's a long way down
I'm at the lost and found
And now it's all too much
I got the Midas touch

And it's a long way down
When you're the wrong way 'round
And now it's all too much
I got the Midas touch

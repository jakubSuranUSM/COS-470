They say, "Once you've found love and it's rarer than gold. 
You stake your claim- it's so hard to hold."
I say, "We've struck a vein and it's wide as a road!"

Have we got love enough to go around?
Why don't you get a piece and pass it down?
Even a hundred million years from now
The love we make will still be putting out

We filled up our pockets till they would explode
And called the whole world here so they could behold
The light of our love beats the dark and the cold

Have we got love enough to go around?
Why don't you get a piece and pass it down?
Even a hundred million years from now
The love we make will still be putting out

I get the best of you, you get the best of me.
You know I come to you across the broadest sea.
For just a speck of you I'd trade the whole of me.
I wish each peck from you would last eternity.

Where the skin's thin and where the skin gathers.
When you're moving in and see it's all that matters.
Records left skipping, clothing all scattered,
A kiss in the kitchen, the dishes all shattered

We'll make a lover of you.

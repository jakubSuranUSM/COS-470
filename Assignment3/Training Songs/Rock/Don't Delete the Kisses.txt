Inside my mind, want you to stay
Beg through my eyes, words can't explain
I swim low 'cause I'm afraid to breathe, yeah
Uh uh, hairbrush, hairbrush, quietly say
Too true, too much, running away
Yeah I'm in love with ideas of us
And I'm in love with ideas of love, uh

What if it's not meant for me?
Love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
What if it's not meant for me?
Love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)

Tearing my muscles and rolling so hard
Trying to chase something, feelings that kill me
No, don't shut me down
No, don't shut me down, no, don't shut me down
No, you know I keep on pushing and pulling at heart strings
Yeah, symphonies, orchestras, screaming, I'm crying so loud

Promised I cried for you like a star
I cried for you like a star
I'd shine for you like a star
Silver and gold in your arms
Yeah, I burn for you in the dark
 
What if it's not meant for me?
Love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
What if it's not meant for me?
Love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)

A few days pass since I last saw you
And you've taken over my mind
I'm retelling jokes you made that made me laugh
Pretending that they're mine
I wanna tell the whole world about you
I think that that's a sign
I'm losing self control and it's you
It really is, one thousand times
I look at your picture and I smile
How awful's that, I'm like a teenage girl
I might as well write all over my notebook
That you rock my world
But you do, you really do
You've turned me upside down
And that's okay, I'll let it happen
'Cause I like having you around
I'm electric, a romantic clich√©
Yeah, they really are all true
When we catch eyes at that stupid party
I know exactly what to do
I'll take your hand, and we will leave
French exits from me and you
And now I'm home, a little bit drunk
Some things don't change
And I know now that

Me and you were meant to be
In love
Me and you were meant to be
In love
Me and

I see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die

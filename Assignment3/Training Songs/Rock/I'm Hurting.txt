Everywhere I go heartache just hurts me so
I can't escape from you, and I'm hurting
Sorrow is by my side, misery is my guide
Every minute is blue, and I'm hurting

Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you

I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting

Loving you from day to day, memories that make this poor fool pay
Time can't heal my yesterdays, loving you, loving you

I cry each tear in vain, my hopes are all the same
My future is nothing but blue and I'm hurting

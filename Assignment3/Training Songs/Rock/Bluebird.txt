Yeah, I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
And desolation lingers like a fog
The fire is growing dimmer in the wind

I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind the cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day
'Cause my bluebird went away

And I'm locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape, no way to get away
And my only connection with tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide not to stay away

I'm out on a limb
If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way is too much to bare
Can't find my bluebird anywhere, anywhere

I'm lost in the night
The icy wind is howling out your name
And desolation lingers like a fog
The fire is growing dimmer with the wind

I'm out in the rain
The moon has gone behind the cloud again
I can't stand to live another day
Bluebird, why did you go away?

Tell me, bluebird, why did you go away?
Little bluebird, why did you go away?
Won't you tell me?

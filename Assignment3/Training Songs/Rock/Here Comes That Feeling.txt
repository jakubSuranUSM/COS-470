Here comes that feeling again, and it ain't right
That lonely feeling that come to me last night
It hurts to see you in my arms of my friend
Here comes that lonely, lonely feeling again
I saw you last night, in a drive-in way downtown
Locked in her arm, you didn't know I'd be around
Alone in my room, I remember where you've been
Here comes that lonely, lonely feeling again
I've gotta get rid of this lonely feeling
That makes me feel the way I do when a day is done
Someday you're gonna know what it means to be lonesome
You're gonna want me back while I'm having fun
Here comes that feeling again, and it ain't right
That lonely feeling that come to me last night
It hurts to see you in my arms of my friend
Here comes that lonely, lonely feeling again
Oh, I'm so lonely
Mmm, I feel that feeling
And it's hurting me, mmm

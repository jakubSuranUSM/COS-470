don't know how to say goodbye to you
I'm not good at things that I don't want to do
Should I pretend that I don't care
that you don't feel what I feel is there

I don't know how to say Goodbye

A kiss might insist that we play
the game of lovers
A touch might give away too much
Would my feeling be discovered

Would you be scared if I just stared
And let you look inside me
Or should I smile and walk away
So my eyes won't betray me

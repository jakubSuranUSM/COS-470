If I held my breath in the mornin', would I wake up for a lifetime.
Lose my job in this depression, well I don't care 'cause I got your love.
In this depression, all I need is you.
In this depression, what is there to lose.

If I held your hand, in this town.
They would lock me up for possession.
But now they're strung out on heroin.
And we've gone out to California.

In this depression, breaks my heart in two.
In this depression, all I need is you.

I could make some friends down at the court house.
Get bailed out and go on ware fare.
I'd rather lay down in a pine box.
Then to sell my heart to a fuckin' wasteland.

In this depression, it's just me and you.
In this depression, what are we to lose.
In this depression, breaks my heart in two.
In this depression, all I need is you.

If I held my breath in the mornin', would I wake up in a new land.
I'd follow you forever, and dance all night in this depression.
In this depression
In this depression
In this depression
In this depression

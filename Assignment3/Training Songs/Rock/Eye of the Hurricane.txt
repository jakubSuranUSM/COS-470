Mission bells ring out from kingdom hall
A lone voice cries on the hillside
The winds from the north blow the sea to the shore
I walk away in the fateful moonlight

Love forsaken man, love forsaken land
For God's sake don't look back
Into the crucifix night
The storm of a cross
I live to love again and again
All my life

Oh Eye of the hurricane
I walk away in the wind and the rain
Into the eye of the hurricane
Face to face

The view from the hill looks bleak from where I stand
The waters are come in unto my soul
I can't cry no more my eyes are bone dry sore
There's a river of tears flowing down to the sea

I'm a desolate soul on a desolate shore
Destined to walk alone
Into the crucifix night
The storm of a cross
I live to love again and again
All my life

Oh eye of the hurricane
I walk away in the wind and the rain
Into the eye of the hurricane
Face to face

Hurricane when will I see you again?
Hurricane when will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

I'm a desolate soul on a desolate shore
Destined to walk alone
Into the crucifix night
The storm of a cross
I live to love again and again
All my life

Oh eye of the hurricane
I walk away in the wind and the rain
Into the eye of the hurricane
Of my life

Oh eye of the hurricane
I walk away in the wind and the rain
Into the eye of the hurricane
Face to face

Hurricane
Hurricane

I've been pushed
I've been shoved too long
They even tried to buy my song
But it ain't gonna be that way no more

In my heart
I believe it's true
A man has gotta get at you
Everybody wants to look the other day

Yeah, tell me lies
And place your lovin' arms around me

And there's things a man must need
And don't it make you, make you wanna 
Open up and bleed?
Yeah, open up and bleed

I've been lost
I've been pushed too long
I've been down harder than I've been too strong
Yeah baby, gonna find me another way

In my soul
I believe it's true
I didn't do what you wanted me too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, tell me lies
Place your lovin' all around me

I need it 'round me

I've been pushed
And I know it so
Even my heart has been pushed, I know
Everybody wants to look the other way

In my soul
I believe it's healed
And in my heart there's a hole so deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, tell me lies
Place your lovin' all around me

And there's things a man must need
And don't it make you, make you wanna 
Open up and bleed

Can't you see,that I want to be there with open arms?
It's empty tonight and I'm all alone, 
Get me through this one. 
Do you notice I'm gone? 

Where do you run to so far away? 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I'm writing again these letters to you on much I know. 

But I'm not sleeping and you're not here, 
The thought stops my heart. 
Do you notice I'm gone? 
Where do you run to so far away? 

I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so

No more looking I've found her.
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 

I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so
I'm gone away
I'm gone away

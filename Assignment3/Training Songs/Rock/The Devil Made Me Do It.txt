Well, the devil made me do it, do it, do it
The devil made me trip and fall
The devil drove me to it, to it, to it
Till I had no chance at all

What did I do that was so bad 
To go and get myself arrested? 
Just in town to have some fun 
But I ended up in the trash can
There I was in the witness stand
My eyes turned towards the jury
Trying to recall what went wrong last night 
But it won't come right back to me

Yeah, the devil made me do it, do it, do it
The devil made me trip and fall
Well, the devil drove me to it, to it, to it
Till I had no mind at all

The lawyer said, "Son, won't you plead the fifth 
And don't speak unless requested?"
Using all the words at his command
His skills were sorely tested
Then, to my complete surprise
They went and called a hostile witness
The devil himself; well, he took the stand 
And that's where my case rested

Well, the devil drove me to it, to it, to it
The devil made me trip and fall
Well, the demon drove me to it, to it, to it
Till I had no chance at all

What did I do that was so bad 
To go and get myself arrested? 
Well, I was just in town to have some fun 
But I ended up in the trash can
There I was in the witness box
My eyes turned towards the jury
Trying to recall what went wrong last night 
But it won't come back to me

Well, the devil made me do it, do it, do it
The devil made me trip and fall
Well, the devil drove me to it, to it, to it
Till I had no mind at all

The devil drove me to it, to it, to it
The devil made me trip and fall
The devil drove me to it, to it, to it
Till I had no see

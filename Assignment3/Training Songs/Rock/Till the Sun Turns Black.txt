10. Till the sun turns black

can you see the young and pretty
Confident as cops 
Blooming laughing in the shops
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the old and lonely 
Walking through the park
Pushing grocery carts
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the corporate man
He's winning on the telephone
His possessions are his throne
Till the sun turns black
Can you see him in his lounger
Watching tv in the dark 
Waiting for the spark
Till the sun turns black
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo ooh wee ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo ooh wee who are --
Can you see the working classes
Trudging through their days 
Time goes slowly when you're only waiting
Till the sun turns black
Can you see the wise man simply
Living loving quietly
Every breath he takes eternity
Till the sun turns black

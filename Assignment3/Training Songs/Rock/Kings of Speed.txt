Kings of speed, kings of speed, 
We're gonna make you, kings of speed, kings of speed
Between you and me Mr. see, I think we have what these boys need
Step this way lads, it ain't no lie, 
Try your luck and be the human fly
Kings of speed, kings of speed,
We're gonna make you, kings of speed, kings of speed
We're gonna take a tasty trip on Frank and Beasley's rocket ship
The biggest attraction, the brightest star, boys
you're going fast and far
Kings of speed, kings of speed,
We're gonna make you, kings of speed, kings of speed
We guarantee you the sweetest ride
You'll go so far you'll think you've died
Step this way lads it ain't no lie
Try your luck and reach the sky

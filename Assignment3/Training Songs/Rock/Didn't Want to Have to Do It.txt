Didn't want to have to do it
Didn't want to have to break your heart
Didn't want to have to do it
I kept a-hopin' from the very start
But you
Kept on a-tryin'
And I knew
That you'd end up a-cryin'

And I knew I didn't wanna have to do it at all
Didn't want to have to do it
Didn't want to have to be the one to say it
Didn't want to have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again

Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "the end"
Was a time that I thought our love could fly
And never never fall
Why should I suppose we were never really meant
To be close to each other at all

No, I
Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then

No, I didn't wanna have to be
The one to say "the end"
No no, not the end, no no no

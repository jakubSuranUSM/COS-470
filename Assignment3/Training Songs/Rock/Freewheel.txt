Save me from the movies and someone else's dreams
While angels make their music and give my spirit wings
I just concertina and wrap around the world
Staying out till six o'clock and singing like a fool

I've only got this morning to live
Look at all the colors at my fingertips

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

Save my feet from dancing with just anyone at all
Worn out shoes cause lotus blue keeps hanging in the hall
And you're this face in the distance I hope to recognize
But it's like running through deep water trying to look into your eyes

I've only got this morning to live
Look at all the colors at my fingertips

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on my soul

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this

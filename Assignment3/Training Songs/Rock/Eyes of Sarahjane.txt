Warwick Hotel
I know it well
We lived a dream so sweet, so sweet

I see Philly in the snowy gloom
We could have laid there 'til afternoon
Our cut runs deep, so deep, so deep

[Chorus]
And the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again

We couldn't sleep
Laugh 'til we weep
Then time stood still, so still, so still

Talked for hours in our bed
I fell in love with every word you said
It felt so great, so great, so great

[Chorus]

People love to fall in
Love they love to fall in
People love to be amused
But you won't see me laughing
In the sadness of our ways

Those were the days
Those were the days

[Chorus]

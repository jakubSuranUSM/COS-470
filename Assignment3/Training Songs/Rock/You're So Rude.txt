My mom she likes you, she thinks you're swell
Got the makings of a dance-hall girl
Your low-cut frock and your bird's-nest hair
Stiletto heels and the way that you swear
She says to take you back
To see my folks again
On Sunday

Why, it looks as though there's nobody in
They've all gone out to see my Auntie Renny
Don't you worry, you just come right in
I'm sure we'll pass the time 'till they come home
Well, let me take your coat
Kick off your shoes, warm your toes
Try the sofa

It's getting dark, we'll miss the late night bus
It's only eight but I'm not taking any chances
What's that noise, why'd they come back so soon?
Straighten your dress, you're really looking a mess
I'll wet my socks, pretend we just got caught in the rain
Oh, you're so rude

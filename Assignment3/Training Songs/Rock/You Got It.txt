Every time I look into your loving eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you I drift away
Afraid that you are here to stay
 
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
 
Every time I hold you I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do
 
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo you got it
I'm glad to give my love to you
I know your feel the way I do
 
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything at all, you got it, baby

Sulking
Walking 'round the city after dark
Need protection from street thugs
Who clip the tires and rip the doors
Off rugs like cowards

And all this life we've glorified
Robbing from the blind
Is not easy you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims, in my shadow
Staring back at me

Not me, I'm knocking
Tip toe outside a stranger's door
I casually let myself in
Fill pockets with trinkets, purses
China antique armoirs

And all this life we've glorified
Robbing from the blind
Is not easy you see
Don't think I don't know sympathy
My victims, in my shadow
Staring back at me

As robbers in my thoughts
They tell me what to think
They're hiding in my clothes
Crawling in the kitchen sink

There is something in the way
You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return
I don't believe in Gods
But I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't let them get you
Stay away from the sun
It's too bright for you
Your eyes getting blurry
Still I'm crying your name
I don't believe in God
But I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

There is something in the way
You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return
So the light fades out at you
So close to lose it

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for
Don't you leave no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live my life for
No don't leave
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away

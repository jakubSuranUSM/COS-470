First day of school they called me a disgrace
They didn't like the long hair, didn't like the face
A whole lot of rules that had to be obeyed
Get back in line and stand up straight

But I had my first guitar
And Hendrix on the wall

All of the kids hanging out in the yard
Platforms, feather cuts dying to be hard
I wanted to be older, wanted to be cool
So I smoked by the gym and lied like a fool

Then came my first slow dance
And I thought I knew it all

Those wonder days of my life
When the summer seemed so long
I won't forget until I'm gone

Every minute lasted hours
We were misunderstood, just looking for something to do

Just like every misfit, started up a band
Didn't have clue and I didn't understand
Why all of a sudden there were girls around
'Cause if the truth be known we could barely make a sound

I'm not one for looking back
But when I do I have to smile

Those wonder days of my life
When the summer seemed so long
I won't forget until I'm gone

Those wonder days of my life
When the summer seemed so long
I won't forget until I'm gone

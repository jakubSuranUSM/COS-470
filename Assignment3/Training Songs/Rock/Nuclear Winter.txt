Now we're leaving, father says
Our world's falling through and the fire spreads quickly
All I hear, all I know is the bombs and the screams
That haunt the sky as their ships sail on high
I fear to leave this behind

Escaping, running, pulling away
Into our atmosphere towards freedom
They've destroyed all we've known
Burned down our home, we must find another haven

Soldiers, disappear through the atmosphere
There she goes like a marble falling
From my weakening fingertips and I can't forget this
The comfort that I've known

Escaping, running, pulling away
Into our atmosphere towards freedom
They've destroyed all we've known
Burned down our home, we must find another haven

It's a nuclear winter, all we have is infinite space

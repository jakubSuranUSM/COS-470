Well it's 3a.m. I'm out here driving again
Through the wicked winding streets of my world
I take a wrong turn break it but I'm too far gone
I've got a siren on my tale and that's not the fine
I'm looking for

I see a stairway so I follow it down
Into the belly of a whale
Where my secrets echo all around
You know me now but to do better than that
You've got to follow me
Boy I'm trying to show you where I'm at

Hey pretty
Don't you want to take a ride with me?
Through my world
Hey pretty
Don't you want to kick and slide with me
Through my world

Well I've got a mind full of wicked desings
I've got a non-stop-whole in my head-imagination
I can't forget I am a sole architect
I built the shadows here
I built the growl in the voice I fear
You know me now but to do better than that
You've got to follow me
Boy I'm trying to show you where I'm at

Hey pretty
Don't you want to take a ride with me?
Through my world
Hey pretty
Don't you want to kick and slide with me
Through my world
Hey pretty
My pretty baby
Rock it through my world

Hey now
Can't you feel me longing
Hey now
Me
(You get the gist of the song now?)

Hey pretty don't you want to take a ride with me?

What about my philosophy, my philosophy
You gotta be your own, you gotta be your own dog
You know? you know what I'm talking about? That's right
You're supposed to say yes, like a James Brown-thing yeah !

You gotta go sniffin' on your own turf
Be your own dog, don't let nobody put a leash on you

Rubbadub a tub fish ping pong
Sneakin' in the dead zone boneyard
Sippin' on a catlap sing song
Trimming off my nostril hairs headcase
An angel in a mellowcake courtpie
Rubbin' like a pussycat gridlock
A stone within my eyeball too too
Dancin' with my socks on oh man
Singin' like a tomtit stop cab
You've been listening to the doors tip top
Entering a smoky barroom hey you
Smuggling a wombat what a day
Chewing on my necktie tweedoll
Tumbling in the margarine heroine
Hidden in the ribbonbrass too too
Actin' like a baby headcase

I don't need no thoughts in me, don't you want to rescue me?
There's a little light below, go there when I want to go

Want to buy the bubblegum? ping pong
Trying to pry the red shoes off headcase
Licking on my ice cream cone heroine
Surfing in the kitchen sink what a day
Sippin' on a diet coke hey dude
A toodle to the innercrop tip top
Shopping with my scapegoat top fish
Change a tenner for two fivers too too

Fell off the floor, fell off the floor man (8 times)

Rita hayworth (3 times)
Rita hay

Don't strap yourself to a Volkswagen in a weird harness
Get a harness, because it could be dangerous

Don't try this at home

Going out to steal a ruby (4 times)

Looking like a rayon, love to do it indoor
They all got a say on, falling off the damned floor
Succulent but sucked in, always I'll be in for
Wanted to be tucked in, falling off the same floor

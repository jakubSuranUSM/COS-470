Blow away, blow away down below away
Down below, into and down below away

When you fall asleep
Fall with me down into the deep
When you fall asleep
Fall with me down into

Down below, alone in your down below your heart
I wait for you, down below until you fall apart

When you fall asleep
Fall with me down into the deep
When you fall asleep
Fall with me down into the deep

Away, blow away
Down below, down below

The anchor is a kickstand 
So I'm taking you down with me 
To the wrong side of the quicksand and our flashlight destiny 
You can be the walker I'm gonna be your wire 
You can be the ugly truth
I'm gonna be your liar 
Still the future lit up so bright for all to see 
I can't look now you're all the same 
You're all the same to me up and away
Up and away the anchor is a kickstand 
So I'm taking you down with me
To the wrong side of the quicksand and our flashlight destiny 
It's all wrong
We tripped along so much worse off for it 
And only God can help the one who put the magnets in you 
Head up and away up and away with you
If I could just get up I'd be fine if I could just get up

I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me (yes)
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side, for you pretty baby I'll even die
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me (yes)
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna sit right down and cry
What 'ya gonna do when I say bye-bye?
All you're gonna do is dry your eye
I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

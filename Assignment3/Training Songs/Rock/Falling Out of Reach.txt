Slow down, slow down
You'll only get burnt out
Calm down, calm down
You're getting so worn out
They're trying to make you compromise
There's fire burning in your eyes
Darling

You're slowly drifting out of reach
I'm slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach 

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach 
Out of reach

So, home is just a word now 
You don't see it anymore
The child's eyes are vacant now 
And lights are just a glare
And the music's gone and you're always wrong
And there's people everywhere

But darling time will make amends 
You just need a rest
You just need your friends

They're slowly drifting out of reach 
You're slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach 
Out of reach

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach 
Oh oh keep falling, falling down

We don't need this, we don't need this now

We should be sleeping
Yeah you should be sleeping 
Oh you're slowly drifting out of reach
I'm slowly drifting out of reach,
We're slowly drifting out of reach 

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach 
Out of reach

Don't cry
Don't cry 
Birds are still up in the sky
(So the sun keeps burning, so the sun keeps burning, I don't know what to do)

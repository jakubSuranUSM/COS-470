Girls all over the world 
She got men 
Every now and then 
But she can't make up her mind 
On just how to fill her time 
But the only way she can wind

She got sick 
You wanna see her dingaling 
Well let's be in it together 
I'll guess she'll be in it forever 
You've got to take it now and ever

On just how to fill her time

I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your sip lingers even when you're not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching, like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, soul completely
I love the way you love me

I like way that you sing sweet and low
When they're playing our song on the radio
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At old time movies you've seen hundreds of time

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, soul completely

So listen to me and I could list a million things
I'd love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, soul completely
I love the way you love me
I love the way that you love me

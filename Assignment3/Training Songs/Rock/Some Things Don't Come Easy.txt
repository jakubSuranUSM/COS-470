If I did not love you so
I would not go through all this pain
I'd find someone else
But I know it would never be the same
We were made to be together
And I keep on thinking

Some things don't come easy
Some things take some time
Some things don't come easy
Some things take some time

I guess that there was a time
When I felt that you could do no wrong
You'd just be yourself
And the days were there for us alone
But nothing stays the same forever
We both keep on changing

It's me it's you
How to hold on to it
It's free it's new
How to hold on to it
You see it's true
How to hold on to it
Cause to leave you now
Be the hardest thing to do

I'm gonna do everything
To regain the feelings that we had
Love you all the way
And forget the things that made you sad
We were made to be together
And I keep on thinking

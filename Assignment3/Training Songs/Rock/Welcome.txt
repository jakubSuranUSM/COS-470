I see you standing in the doorway
A shadow in the sun
I'm reaching out to touch you
Is it better when you know
That you're not the only one
That I can hear you?

And there's so much I can do for you
Given time I know that I can prove
Now my world is opened up to you
Let it fly

Welcome to my life
Welcome to my world
Come inside

I see you picking up the pieces
The pieces of a dream
You tried to build around you
I know you're looking for a reason
A reason to believe
Now I've found you

And there's so much I can do for you
Given time I know that I can prove
Now my world is opened up to you
Let it fly

Welcome to my life
Welcome to my world
Come inside

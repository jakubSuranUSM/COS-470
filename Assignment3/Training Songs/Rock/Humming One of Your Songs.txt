I'm walking
I am walking along
And I am humming
I am humming
One of your songs

I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on

Everyday I hear your song now
Everyday
It wonÂ´t go away.
So I am humming 
I am humming
One of your songs

I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on
I just know one small verse in the middle of it
But it makes me wanna hear it
On and on and on and on

So I am humming
I am humming
One of your songs

Tell me what I could get from what you had
I'm not feeling yet quite so bad
I'm not getting half of what I earn
Thought that we were set but now I, I've yearned

So tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
'Cause I can't find it

All my troubles, yeah
Stem from you
Not much I expected you to do
I'm not feeling quite the way I should
Once I was upset now I've been feeling good

So tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
'Cause I can't find it

All my time I gave to you
All those trials you ran me through
Love like yours will have to wait
Not my style to hesitate
I'm not saying that I try
Hard enough to gain my stride
All I have to say to you
Is anything you want me to, so

Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
'Cause I can't find it

Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
'Cause I can't find it
No I can't find it
No I can't find it

What was unknown became known to me
Kind of cold heat, swept over me
A valediction from a terminal heart
Your misfortune was my work of art

There’s a cavalcade on desolation highway
In my veins
Like a cold parade on desolation highway
Coursing through my veins

A force unstoppable, now the stone has cracked
Another false dawn, well, sunset came too fast
Just in time for those wild staring eyes
You know I never blinked and now they’re frozen dry

There’s a cavalcade on desolation highway
In my veins
Like a cold parade on desolation highway
Coursing through my veins

When I saw you, what did you see?
A heart of stone, stone is bleeding
When you saw me, what did you see?

There’s a cavalcade on desolation highway
In my veins
Like a cold parade on desolation highway
Coursing through my veins

On desolation highway
In my veins
Desolation, desolation

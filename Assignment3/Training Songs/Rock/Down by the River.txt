Do you remember you took my hand
And we walked out across the fields
Down the lane and over the railway line
Our hearts were racing our feet were chasing
We were looking for a hide away
Getting lost and losing track of time

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

You let your long brown hair hang down
Your summer dress was swaying in the breeze
When we were skimming stones across the stream
You had a lazy style and a carefree smile
You were a breathless beauty to behold
The sweetest sight my eyes had ever seen

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

Well waters rise and streams divide
And that river keeps rolling on
Paper boats and pleasure drift away
And you may be just a memory
But you're shinning like a distant star
It seems to me as clear as yesterday

We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Where the water ran slow
Was where we let our loving run free
We went down by the river
We went down by the river
Just laying low
My true love and me

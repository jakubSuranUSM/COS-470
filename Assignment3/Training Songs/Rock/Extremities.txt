Extremities confusing me
Affect me night and day
Fascinated, devastated
Critical decade

Vanishing greenery
Changing scenery
Yet somehow I accept
Extremities confusing me
Yet somehow I accept

White heat (I watch a meltdown)
Cut the wood against the grain
Pleasure - pain (one word)
Extremities

I'm frightened
I'm excited
And I cannot differenciate between the two
(Can you?)

White heat (I watch a meltdown)
Cut the wood against the grain
Pleasure - pain (one word)
Extremities

Each and every one of us is watching for the signs
The days go by we count the moments
The moments of our lives
All the time all the time

The earthquakes came and the buildings all fell down
(And the waves I saw, I saw the people slowly drown)
Yes the sun grew hot and the children dehydrate
I saw the soldiers burn
I saw their skin just blister and break

Each and everyone of us is counting out the
Moments of our lives all the time

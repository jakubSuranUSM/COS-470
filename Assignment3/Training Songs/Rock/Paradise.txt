The phone it has been ringing
Ringing off the hook
And the creditors have said that all of your
Debts have grown legs and are
Running off the books
Correctional facilities sure I'll
Accept your calls
But the tales have grown tall
And the till isn't at all
And tears are only bread crumbs
For the crooks
And my paycheck it is bleeding
But it's fight or flight
The exit from debt could
Be the entrance
Into paradise

what are you doing daytimes
Shooting out your windows I bet
But the flocks of your dreams
Know that it's hunting season
It's a joke that you'll never get
Cause wooden ducks they do not bleed
And try as you might
The only goose that you'll bite
Is the goose egg you call your wife
When the bars announce it's closing time
And my heart it is still beating
But it's fight or flight
The exit from loneliness
Is not necessarily
The entrance into paradise
Into paradise

of all the men I've known who
Have money
I like you the most
Cause every dollar you invent
You're even more hellbent
On risking life and limb for another toast
When we were falling into puddles
I knew you had it in for me
Scraped my face on the ground
Till blood was down me
From my nose to the hem of my jeans
And my heart it is still bleeding
But it's fight or flight
The exit from loneliness
Could be the entrance into paradise
Into paradise

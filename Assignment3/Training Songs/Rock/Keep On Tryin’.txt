I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you told me
You're so ful of doubt
You just can't let it be
But I know
If you keep comin' back for more
Then I'll keep on tryin'
Keep on tryin'

And I've been drinkin' now 
Just a little too much
And I don't know how
I can get in touch with you
Now there's only one thing
For me to do, that's to
To get home to you

And I feel so satisfied when
I can see you smile
I want to confide in
All that is true, so I'll
Keep on tryin' I'm
Through with lyin'
Just like the sun above
I'll come shinin, trough
Oh yes I'll
Keep on tryin', I'm
Tired of cryin'
I got to find a way
To get on home to you

I've been thingin' 'bout
All the times you held me
I never heard you shout
The flow of energy was so fine
Now I think I'll lay it on the line
And keep on tryin'
To get home to you

And I feel so satisfied when
I can see you smile
I want to confide in
All that is true, so I'll
Keep on tryin' I'm
Through with lyin'
Just like the sun above
I'll come shinin, trough
Yes I will
Oh yes I'll
Keep on tryin', I'm
Tired of cryin'
I got to find a way
To get on home to you

Every morning 
'Bout the break of day 
Every evening 
She comes up and she says 
Na, Na, Na. 

She gets up 
then she goes outside 
She don't know what she does 
But it feels alright 

She says I 
I'm a sunny girl 
Yeah I'm feeling good 
And it's a shiny world 
Well here she comes 
She feels good 
She feels great today 
When I asked she said "
Hey, it's the Happy Club way" 

I don't know 
I don't know what to do 
But I know if I could 
Then I would do too 
I feel great 
I feel fine 

Today 
I joined the Happy Club 
And the Happy Club says 
I feel good 
I feel great today 
Now I know what to say 
Na, Na, Na.

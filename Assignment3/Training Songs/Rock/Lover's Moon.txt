There's a lover's moon tonight
As I look back over my shoulder
All the stars are shining bright
Just like the nights when I used to hold her

She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon
Lover's moon, won't you shine on me?
I'm dancing with a memory
I wish I may, I wish I might

Have one last chance to hold her tight
Waiting, I know she's waiting
I know she waits for me under the lover's moon.
There's a lover's moon tonight

Shining down on half of this world
So many souls are in it's light
But for me there is just one girl
And she's waiting, I know she's waiting

I know she waits for me under the lover's moon
Under the lover's moon.

Come with me 
It's oh so easy for me to see 
We can be 
Close together, for always forever 
You'll never believe but it's true 
You will see 
The happy corners where we will be 
It's for real 
I'll sing to you all the songs that we knew 
That's not true don't be blue they're for you 

Ooowah, ooohwah, oooh-wah (etc.) 

Can you feel 
It's spinning round like a great big wheel 
It's for real 
I'll sing to you all the songs that we knew 
That's not true don't be blue they're for you 

Ahhhahhh,

Come with me 
Come with me 

Come with me 
It's oh so easy for me to see 
Come with me 
When I find that you're not on my mind 
That's the time I will say come with me

Isn't it strange, oh it's funny,
Working for years have no money,
Suddenly luck can smile on you
And your life seems worth while to you.

[Chorus]
Just how much can you spend,
Give it back in the end,
And the time of your season,
Was no use, had no reason.

And you move, you go away
And you can't come home not today.
Spreading it out over the bad years,
Not for those men, they can't hear.

[Chorus]

Haven't had much in a long time,
Hoping that change is going to be mine.
Don't want to go, I want to stay here,
Spreading it out over the bad years.

[Chorus]

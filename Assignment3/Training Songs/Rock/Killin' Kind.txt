Did the lights go out forever?
Has the night just gone insane?
Did what's broken fall together?
Has my heart gone down in flames?

Though I heard your lies, I can't deny
I canker for the feeling
And I know it's wrong, but I'm hanging on
Crying in my sleep

So wrong
I'm over my head
So right
I'm out of my mind
Your love is the killin' kind
Two hearts
You swallow my heart
One life
Like you swallow my life
Your love is the killin' kind

If I only could remember
Why I let you in so deep
If I'd only known you better
I could have put these dreams to sleep

Well, you haunt me now, you wear me down
Get me where I'm weak
Yeah, you twist the knife
Your sacrifice
Bring me to my knees

So wrong
I'm over my head
So right
I'm out of my mind
Your love is the killin' kind
Two hearts
You swallow my heart
One life
Like you swallow my life
Your love is the killin' kind

I know
I know if the end of the world falls in your arms
I'll remember, every tear I've ever cried for you
Baby
Baby, when I said I'd die for you
I lied

So wrong
I'm over my head
So right
I'm out of my mind
Your love is the killin' kind
Two hearts
You swallow my heart
One life
Like you swallow my life
Your love is the killin' kind

So wrong
I'm over my head
So right
I'm out of my mind
Your love is the killin' kind
Two hearts
You swallow my heart
One life
Like you swallow my life
Your love is the killin' kind, yeah

So wrong
So right
Your love
Your love is the killin' kind
Two hearts
One life
Your love
Your love is the killin' kind
So wrong
So right
Your love
Is the killin' kind

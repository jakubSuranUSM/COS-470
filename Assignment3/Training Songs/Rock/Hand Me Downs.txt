You went through five schools, before you were 17
I can only guess what those brown eyes have seen
If we're just a blank state mixed with a little bit of DNA
And those weekend visits when he'd show up late
When I feel helpless, I see you smiling back at me
Like every little thing is gonna be okay
Ya you're a tough kid, way tougher than me
I'll put a bet on you any day

Ooh, when your head gets dizzy and you can't get right
Ooh, but ya push on through, don't be denied
Shake off those ghosts in every corner of this town
From the clothes on your back, to the color of your eyes
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 

No, it never made sense, but it's the only thing that you know
That resentment well it comes and goes
In your daddy's defense, he never really stood a change
You should see where he came from
And ? his brothers ended up?
We get all stuck, but babe

You've been acting reckless, to deal with the pain
I just hope you don't get carried away
And you wear this necklace, from graduation day
You said "I'll wear this chain, 'cause I'm breaking it
Yeah, I'll wear this chain, 'cause I'm breaking it"

Oooh, when your head gets dizzy and you can't get right
Ooh, but ya push on through, don't be denied
Shake off those ghosts in every corner of this town
From the clothes on your back, to the colour of your eyes
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 

First of the month, gets you stressed out
And moving trucks, bring you right back
Deep in the cut, there's a voice that's calling out, saying:
It's out of reach I gotta keep chasing
It's out of reach I gotta keep chasing
It's out of reach I gotta keep chasing
It's out of reach I gotta keep chasing

Oooh, when your head gets dizzy and you can't get right
Oooh, but ya push on through, don't be denied
Shake off those ghosts in every corner of this town
From the clothes on your back, to the colour of your eyes
From the clothes on your back, to the colour of your eyes
From the clothes on your back, to the colour of your eyes
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs
Oh oh oh 
Ain't no shame in some hand me downs

Excusez-moi, my pretty mademoiselle,
You are a french girl it's easy to tell,
Me, I don't smoke not even a french cigarette,
But I love my pomme de terre,

And always croquette,
I am from angleterre and you are from france,
And you will honour me by having a dance.

[Chorus]
Straight away!
I'm getting ready for a new sensation,
Never kissed them in another nation,
Internationally I'm in clover,
I was a native on the boat ride over,
Straight away!

I'm getting ready for my new vocation,
I am the man who will unite the nations,
Ooh la la/how you say it/ca va-this is love,

La la la la la la la language of love.
La la la la la la la language of love.
La la la la la la la language of love.

We've been together now for more than a day,
And I am waiting to hear what you say,
Come on, come on, I think you're telling me lies,
You are Italian, I can tell by your eyes,

I love chianti and I hope you'll agree,
That zefferelli makes the movies for me

[Chorus]

I try my french, latin, spanish and greek,
This is the language of love that I speak,
I never know if they're from paris or rome,
We stop the talking when I'm walking them home,

One little kiss and then heavens above,
This is the universal language of love.
Straight away!
Are you ready for a new sensation,
I'm gonna kiss a girl from every nation,

[Chorus]

This is love-the language of love.

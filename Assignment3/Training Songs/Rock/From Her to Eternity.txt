Ah want to tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in room 29
Why, why, that's the one right up top a mine
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry

O Ah hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor-boards
All through this lonesome night
Ah hear her crying too.
Hot-tears come splashin on down
Leaking through the cracks,
Down upon my face, Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Ah catch'em in my mouth!
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry-why!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

Ah read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizin' every lil bit of dirt
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt
Fled out of the window,
And shinning it down the vine
Out of her night-mare, and back into mine
Mine! O Mine!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! CRY!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, ah bet!
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen, Ah know it must sound absurd
But Ah can hear the most melancholy sound
Ah ever heard!
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry-why!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

O tell me why? O tell me why?
Oh Why? Why? Why?
O tell me why and don't tell me a lie!
Why the ceiling still shakes? Shakes! Shakes! Shakes!
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes?

This desire to possess her is a wound
And its nagging at me like a shrew
But, Ah know, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her.

O o o then ya know, that lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Go-o-o! From her to eternity!

From her to eternity! [Repeats]

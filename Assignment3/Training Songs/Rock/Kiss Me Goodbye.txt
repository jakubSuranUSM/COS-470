Like an ugly James Dean I was waiting for you
But I was never what you were looking for
I remember all the days I tasted you on my lips
I was in a haze
Yeah, I was in a haze 

You know it's so hard to let you go
Feeling so down yeah I was low
Leave it to die and then divide
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye 

Baby make the bed and just destroy it again
Like you always did like you did before
Yeah I heard you call my name from the top of the stairs
It'll never be the same
It'll never be the same 

You know it's so hard to let you go
Feeling so down yeah I was low
Leave it to die and then divide
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye 

Does anybody else here feel half alive
Staring out the corner of your eyes, your eyes 

You know it's so hard to let you go 
Feeling so down yeah I was low
Leave it to die and then divide
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye 

So long baby kiss me goodbye 
So long baby goodbye

So long baby kiss me goodbye 
So long baby goodbye

I could say love over and over and over
I could say baby baby baby 'til my tongue spirals out
of my head
When there's no one looking over my shoulder
I like to write rock and roll but it doesn't always
hang together
So what do I know
Or anyone know about love

You ask me how I feel
I said my heart was like a wheel
Why don't you listen to it sometime
I've walked upon the moors
On many misguided tours
Where Emily, Anne and Charlotte
Poured their hearts out
And what did they know
What could they know about love
Or anyone know about love

I could say love over and over and over
I could say baby baby baby and make you think I mean it
maybe
I'm goin' up a hill rollin' a boulder
Tryin to write rock and roll
But it doesn't keep body and soul together
So what do I know
Or anyone know about love

You ask me how I feel
I said my heart was like a wheel
Why don't you listen to it sometime
I've walked upon the moors
On many misguided tours
Where Emily, Anne and Charlotte
Poured their hearts out
And what did they know
What could they know about love
Or anyone know about love

Love over and over and over
Baby baby baby 'til my tongue spirals out of my head
Over and over and over
Baby baby baby and make you think I mean it, maybe
Love over and over and over
Baby baby baby 'til my tongue spirals out of my head
Over and over and over
Baby baby baby and make you think I mean it, maybe

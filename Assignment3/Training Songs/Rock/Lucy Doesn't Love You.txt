Nothing's ever going to make her happy. 
She doesn't mind 'cause she's used to it that way. 
Time, time, time drags on forever. 
She's still trying to get it together. 

Lucy doesn't love you. 
Not like you want her to. 
Some dreams don't come true. 
Lucy doesn't love you. 
No, she doesn't love you. 

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Four in the morning you're still wide awake. 
Just can't shake, shake, shake the headache. 
Up all night, up all day again. 
Don't want to talk to any of your friends. 

Lucy doesn't love you. 
Not like you want her to. 
Some dreams don't come true. 
Lucy doesn't love you. 
No, she doesn't love you 

I know it's hard for you to take. 
Everybody makes a few mistakes sometimes. 

Nothing's ever going to make you happy. 
You don't mind you're getting used to it that way. 

Lucy doesn't love you. 
Not like you want her to. 
Some dreams don't come true. 
Lucy doesn't love you. 
No, she doesn't love you. 
Lucy doesn't love you. 
Not like you want her to. 
Some dreams don't come true. 
Lucy doesn't love you. 
No, she doesn't love you. 

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

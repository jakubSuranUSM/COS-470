We don't have no plastic l.a. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine gq
We don't care if you're a lawyer or a texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
If you got soul we hang out with people just like you

Well my hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing a truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been
Red white and blue

Ride our own bikes to sturges pay are own dues
Smokin' camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where I've been just look at my hands
Yeah I've driven by the white house and spent some time in jail
Mama cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel but even god he understands

Well my hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been
Red white and blue

Yeah that's right

My daddy worked hard and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives
To serve this great country
So what are they complaining about
Yeah we love our families we love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where were at
If they don't like it they can just get the hell out, yeah

Well my hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you

Well my hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been
Red white and blue

Red white and blue
Ya know, ya know, ya know
Red white and blue
Yeah, red white and blue

(alright, let's do the museum piece!)

Elvis p. and jerry lee, .. (? ). perfect three (? )
Gather dust, an undercrust in cleveland
Everybody bows down to them
No one looks and says "hey, screw them,
Who cares what they did? let's kill a new band"

Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
Please don't let me be a museum piece
Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
I don't think there's any chance of that

John prine sings outside the door but
People going in ignore him
Ahmet forgot that he'd ever signed him
Lowell george was out of luck
He's much too good to be inducted
Sam the sham with one hit doesn't make it either

Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
Please don't let me be a museum piece
Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
I don't think there's any chance of that

An inch of dust lies on my shoulders
In my head's a touch of mould and
Half my foot has crumbled in my shoe
No one ever visits this wing
It's just like the cut-out bin
Little milton ended up here too

Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
Please don't let me be a museum piece
Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
I don't think there's any chance of that
Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
Please don't let me be a museum piece
Well I don't wanna be a museum piece
I don't think there's any chance of that

I will serenade you, all along the way
I will serenade you, anyway you say
Take you to the country, I'll take you to the shore
Show you to my garden, I know you'll make it grow

If you let me serenade you
You know that's what you come for
So that I will serenade you

I wake you in the morning, on your sunrise time
Your fire in the evening when it blows outside
If you let me serenade you, you know that's what you come for.
So that I will serenade you.

And when the walls begin to fall
Can't hold back the joy
That love will conquer all

Every moment, every day
If you want to hold me I will, I will, I will, I will stay
Let me serenade you, I will serenade
If you want to hold me, yeah, one more, one more now
Every body keep a singing, I sing it
I really love you baby
I will serenade you, I will serenade you
All along the, whoa
Let me sing it, whoa
I will sing a
I will serenade you, baby
I will serenade you
No, no, no, no

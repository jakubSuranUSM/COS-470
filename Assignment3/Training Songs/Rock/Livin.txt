Living in your town 
Mankind's crowd 
You try to say I'm lazy 
I just call it living in your town 

Well if everyone was just the same 
Then some just play a different game 
I call it living in your town 
Living in your town 

Living in this age 
World so full of rage 
You try to say I'm crazy 
I just call it living in that age

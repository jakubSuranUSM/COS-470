Someone cries, and it washes the street with tears
But when they are mine, they collect in my head for years
Rain or shine, still I'm standing on all I said
Cause it's in my soul, carry on when the feeling's dead
But if you can't hold on, let it go and come back in your heart
And if you can't hold on, maybe it's not time for you
And if you can't hold on, on your very last try
I'll be there in the morning to pull you through
Some one dies late at night and I'd never know
Even if I did, so afraid of the face I'd show
I feel trapped and enslaved to this dark contrast
I need a feeling now, give me something that's gonna last
And if you can't hold on, let it go and come back in your heart
And if you can't hold on, maybe it's not time for you
And if you can't hold on, on your very last try
I'll be there in the morning to pull you through
I wanna be free
Yes, I wanna be free
You say you wanna be free
But you can't fool me
And if you can't hold on
I'll be there
And if you can't hold on, let it go and come back in your heart
And if you can't hold on, maybe it's not time for you
And if you can't hold on, on your very last try
I'll be there for you, know that you're not alone

Okay what is it tonight?
Please just tell me what the hell is wrong
Do you want to eat, do you want to sleep, do you want to drown?
Just settle down, settle down, settle down

I'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills
Give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I'll even let you watch the shows you want to see
Just marry me, marry me, marry me

I'm so sick of you tonight
You never stay awake when I get home
Is something wrong with me, something wrong with you?
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew

I'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills
I'll give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I'll even let you watch the shows you want to see
Because you'll marry me, marry me, marry me
Marry me, marry me, marry me

I was young, I learned a game
When love and happiness were the same
Now I'm older and I don't play
I found out the hardest way
I got wasted, she got mad
Called me names and she called her dad
He got crazy and I did too
Wonder what I did to you?

I gave you candy, gave you diamonds, gave you pills
I'll give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I even let you hear the songs I want to sing
I'll give you anything, anything, anything

Anything... anything

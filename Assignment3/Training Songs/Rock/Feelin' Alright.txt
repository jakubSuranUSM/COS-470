Seems I got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left you on my own or so it seemed
I got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the keys

/ D7 - G7 - / :

{Refrain}
You feelin' all right, oh oh
I'm not feelin' too good myself, oh oh
You feelin' all right, oh oh
I'm not feelin' too good myself, oh oh

Boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
Then when I think of you, I start myself to cry
Just can't waste my time, I must get by
Gotta stop believin' in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

{Refrain}

   Feelin' all right
Ooh, don't you get too lost, in all I say
In a better time, you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get safe, so I guess I'm here to stay
'Til someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name, and a different face

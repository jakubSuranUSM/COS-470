My wanderings had taken me far from my home
I met a pretty woman said she's tired of being alone
Well one thing led to another
You know how things go
So we packed her up and headed back
To my little Texas home
Well I told her once and I told her twice
It's the best that I could do
Life in Tornado alley is where I live, don't be confused
But she was quite insistent, professed to me her love
I warned her where I lived
Now she's moved here and it's done
Storm seasons always come, storm seasons go
Never seems to stay the same but the wind always blows
Uncomfortable summer, cold in winter times
Very, very few moments when everything's just right
But me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny what you can get used to
If you take the time and don't count the days
It's mostly just flat land, not much to see
And I know she's bored and probably blames it all on me
And I'm sure it is quite different, it's not what she thought
Tornado alley's not a dream, but it's sure as hell what she got
Then of course there come a time a storm came roaring through
And I seen the look in her eyes, wondering what the hell she got herself in to
Wish nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From a freight train running through the middle of a room
Just want out alive
But me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny what you can get used to
If you take the time and don't count the days
Well after that, things changed, she said something about the fall
And how the waters rushed and roared, I heard a coyote call
On and on, long stories, of places I'd never seen
She'd get that faraway look in her eyes that did not include me
Maybe I should have known, there's something about this place
And unlike the wind that blows through here, she's gone without a trace
Well me, I just go on, but back to being alone
Tornado alley's where I live and have always called my home
'Cause me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny how you can get used to
If you take the time
If you take the time

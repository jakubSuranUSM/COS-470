You know enough to know the way
Six billion people, just one name
I found tomorrow in today
Apocalyptic and insane, my dreams will never change

You want to be the one in control
You want to be the one who's alive
You want to be the one who gets sold
It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time

Stand out on the edge of the Earth

Stand out on the edge of the Earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of a gun
Look into this new future's face

I know you know enough to, say
I know you know enough to, play
The game

You want to be the one in control
You want to be the one who's alive
You want to be the one who gets sold
It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time

Stand out on the edge of the Earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of a gun
Look into this new future's face

Stand out on the edge of the Earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of a gun
Look into this new future's face

Stand on the edge of the Earth
Stand on the edge of the Earth
Stand on the edge of the Earth
Look into this new future's face
Stand on the edge of the Earth

Stand out on the edge of the Earth
Dive into the center of fate
Walk right in the sight of a gun
Look into this new future's face

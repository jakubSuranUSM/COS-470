(Damn)
I order something, it took a while
This morning something was on my doorstep
What's this I'm holding?
Time capsule owner, cause I'm a brand new man
And I don't think I want it
I don't think I want it,
A roll of flies
Hang in behind me
What guarded up nights and questions, and photo-flashes burning,
And I'm so high, I can't recall my statements,
I only know I made them, because my face vibrated

Is it all in my mind?
I could've sworn I saw it
I thought I was high, just like this one I'm coming

Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall

I was startled when it was just feet on gravel
Two have come apart, I must have once been raveled
Now in pretty phrases, it don't mean nothing
And I wanna sell 'em, I see my wine again
So smooth you can hear the beard,
So smooth you can hear the beard,
(Hear the beard)
Three times it's poetry,
So smooth you can hear the beard

Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
If you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
And if you can't draw a crowd, settle for what you can draw

I'm just saying
I'm just saying
What a saying: that I'm just saying
But many wait, to what I'm saying
Always come back again, I can't ignore it
I'm a brand new man, but I'm still á¹—rayin' for it

Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
Oh-oh if you're feeling small, and you can't draw a crowd
Draw dicks on a wall
If you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on a wall
If you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on a wall
And if you can't draw a crowd, settle for what you can draw

I only wanted to be Stevie Wonder
But I got to settle for this vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd)
This vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd)
This vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd)
This vanilla thunder
If you feeling small

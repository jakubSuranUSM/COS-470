Wait for the lovers
We work one another
In an effort to uncover
What has happened to the Saturdays
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Despite ones on the corner
Dream of something warmer
Assemblence of our old ways
What has happened to our hand me days?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Way back when
We were the latest around
We lined and we painted this town
The faces are green and they
Don't know what they've done

Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh

Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey-oh

We can pull the map out
To tell you the direct route
Young ones go anxious
To proclaim to their advances to the fray
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If we don't wake up
And the truth never comes up
We will never have our own lane
We will never have the right away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Way back when
We were the latest around
We lined and we painted this town
The faces are green and they
Don't know what they've done

Back when
We were the latest around
We lined and we painted this town
The faces are green and they
Don't know what they've done

And won't you show
Us where your heart is?

Hey won't you show
Us where your heart is?
Hey won't you show
Us where your heart is?

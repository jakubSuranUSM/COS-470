When every day begins in yesterday
When every light around you shines
You are the lover of a hundred others
So don't tell me what to do
Retreat resist relent redemption
Be careful not to cut your hair
Be sorry for your sins and all their mothers
But don't tell me what to do, no no
(Chorus)
I am, forever trying to defend
I lost, my childhood qualities when I was ten
Don't quite recall when it began
Oooh I can't remember such a drain
Believe the truth before you breathe it
Beloved sometime very soon
Your pathway forward is an exit doorway
So don't tell me what to do
(Repeat Chorus)
oooh, I can't remember
Such a drain ... whoa ho yeah
(Repeat Chorus x2)

When people ask of me
what would you like to be,
now that you're not a kid any more?
I know just what to say,
I answer right a away.
There's just one thing 
I've been wishing for.
 
I wanna be Bobby's girl, 
I wanna be Bobby's girl.
That's the most important thing to me.
And if I was Bobby's girl;
if I was Bobby's girl,
what a faithful, thankful girl I'd be.
 
Each night I sit at home
hoping that he will phone,
but I know Bobby has someone else.
Still in my heart I pray,
there soon will come a day
when I will have him all to myself.
 
I wanna be Bobby's girl, 
I wanna be Bobby's girl.
That's the most important thing to me.
And if I was Bobby's girl;
if I was Bobby's girl,
what a faithful, thankful girl I'd be.

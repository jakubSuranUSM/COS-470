Girl you got this need to know what I'm all about
There's something that you dig you can't figure out
Well, you wanna know what moves my soul
And what ticks inside of my brain
But I've got this need I just can't control, and it's
A-drivin' me insane
I can't take it! Owww!

Because I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
Well I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you

I can almost taste it
It's sweet as wine

There's a custom-tailored world that I wanna own someday
With a special place up high where we can stay alone you and me
Girl, I'm gonna have it all someday if you'll
Just hang on to my hand
If I break some rules along the way, girl, you
Gotta understand
It's my way of gettin' what I want now, 'cause I'm hungry

Because I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
Well I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you

I can almost taste it now
Oh, it's sweet as wine
Ain't gonna waste it now
When it's finally mine

Gonna live each minute, fill the hours and days
'Til I've had my fill
Aw, girl, I'll be rollin' in it
Yes, yes, you know I will, yes I will, owww!

('cause I'm)

Because I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
Well I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you
Because I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
Well I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you

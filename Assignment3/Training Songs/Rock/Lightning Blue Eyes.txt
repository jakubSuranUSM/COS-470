The weight of persuasion
When you change your mind
I left the ground you just gave in
It was the only time

I felt awake I was way out
Under the closing night
Just as the morning became us
And we were only skies

What changed?
It's in my love

In your dreams you've seen it all
Through a window so far off
Remember watching while your
Lightning blue eyes reflected sunrise

Through the dawn I'd seen it, too
I caught a glimpse I thought was you
And I was overwhelmed
Lightning blue eyes against the daylight

I felt awake I was way out
It was the only time
To do away with persuasion
Oh when you change your mind

In her dreams she's seen it all
Through a window so far off
Remember watching while her
Lightning blue eyes reflected sunrise

Through the dawn I'd seen it, too
I caught a glimpse I thought was her
And I was overwhelmed
Lightning blue eyes against the daylight

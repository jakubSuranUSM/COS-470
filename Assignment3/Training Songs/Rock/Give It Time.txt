You can see 'em, the things that you want
But you don't have the means to buy
I've been eying what you've got in stock
And I'll tell you what's on my mind
We could meet in a room with a lock
If the world can't reach us, the world could be ours
You like moving all over town, where the music gets down in your heart
I've been watching the things that you shake
And they're driving me out of my mind
Can't you see that I'm here to decide
And the heat from your eyes, just burns my insides
Give it time

[Repeat: x12]
Give it time

Think about it
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah yeah

When I saw you in the clothes that you wore
I dreamed that I was amazed
No, I've never felt this way before
And I'm trying to think what to say, what do I say
Every time when you look at me
In your eyes I can see, there's nothing for free

[Repeat: x12]
Give it time

He said, "I'll protect you like you are the crown jewels", yet
Said he's feeling sorrier for me the more I behave badly I can bet

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

Jealousy is more than a word now I understand
I know you can stay a girl by holding a boy's hand

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

I've got my life of complication here to sort out
I'll take myself to an east coast city and walk about

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment
At this moment

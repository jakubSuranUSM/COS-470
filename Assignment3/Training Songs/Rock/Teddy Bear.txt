Baby let me be your lovin' Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear

I don't want to be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't want to be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough

Just want to be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear

Baby let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair and cuddle me real tight
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear

I don't want to be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough
I don't want to be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough

Just want to be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be (oh let him be)
Your teddy bear

Oh let me be (oh let him be)
(Your Teddy Bear)
I just want to be your Teddy Bear

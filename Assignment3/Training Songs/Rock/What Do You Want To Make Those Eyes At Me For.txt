What do you wanna make those eyes at me for 
If they don't mean what they say 
They make me glad, they make me sad 
They make me want a lot of things that I never had 

You're fooling around with me now 
Well you lead me on and then you run away 
Well that's all right, I'll get you alone some night 
And baby you'll find, you're messing with dynamite 
So what do you wanna make those eyes at me for 
If they don't mean what they say

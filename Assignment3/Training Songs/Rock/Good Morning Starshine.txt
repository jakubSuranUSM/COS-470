Good morning starshine, the earth says hello
You twinkle above us
We twinkle below

Good morning starshine, you lead us along
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning singing song

Gliddy glup gloopy nibby nabby noopy la la la lo lo
Sabba sibby sabba nooby abba nabba le le lo lo
Tooby ooby walla nooby abba nabba
Early morning singing song

Good morning starshine
There's love in yoru skies
Reflecting the sunlight
In my lover's eyes

Good morning starshine
So happy to be
My love and me as we sing
Our early morning song

Can you hear me?
Singing a song, humming a song, singing a song
Loving a song, laughing a song, singing the song
Sing the song, song the sing
Song song song sing sing sing sing song...

Janie was my first love
we shared the pains of school
she offered me a balance for awhile
and she gave me innocents
I seemed like less a fool
she always had a line to make me smile
but we seperated early
not an easy thing too do
sometime seem tomorrow'd never come
but we couldn't keep together
for all the times we tried
we had a sad reunion tonight

Oh how we laughed together
trapped in the grapes of wrath together
yes and we loved each other
Me and Baby Jane
but now she's gone forever
Lord help me stay together
see her vacant eyes and a needle in a vain
Oh baby, baby, Baby Jane

I see the purple mountains
I'm lost and inbetween
a place that I know well and in a bad dream
Others stand beside me too late to try and find
exscuses in the face of being blind
but now she is awaiting for the feeling of the cold
to free her from the nightmare of old
she was a part of me silently alone 
and too far down to draw the line

Oh how we laughed together
trapped in the grapes of wrath together
yes and we loved each other
Me and Baby Jane
but now she's gone forever
Lord help me stay together
I see her in the sky and early morning rain
Oh baby, baby, Baby Jane

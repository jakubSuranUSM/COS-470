Oh, baby come on, let me take you where the action is. (3X)
It's so neat to meet ya baby where the action is.

In every little town cross the U.S.A.
There's a spot where the people tangle everyday
Just leave your problems and get away
Come down and listen to the guitars play.

Dance, dance dance when you hear that beat
Dance, dance dance get up off of your seat
Dance, dance dance let your back bone slip
Let's go to the place on the Sunset Strip

Oh, baby come on, let me take you where the action is. (3X)
It's so neat to meet ya baby where the action is.

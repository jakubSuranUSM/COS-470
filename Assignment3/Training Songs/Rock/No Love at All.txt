NO LOVE AT ALL
(Johnny Tillotson - Lucille Cosenza)
Â« Â© '66 Ridge Music Â»

You've broken my heart and now the tears start to fall
Why should I go on carrying if there's no love at all
You've shattered my dreams and now the heartaches began
We're playing a game of pretend cause there's no love at all
No love and no fun there's not much left of me
Once I've thought you loved me but look how wrong a man can be
You've broken my heart but someday I'm sure you will find
You'll slowly go out of your mind if there's no love at all
No love and no fun there's not much left of me
Once I've thought you loved me but look how wrong a man can be
You've broken my heart but someday I'm sure you will find
You'll slowly go out of your mind if there's no love at all

Put your clock back for the winter
She asks when I'll be home again?
If I could see those eyes
I know they'd cut me down to size
You're not here, when i need you

So sit and wait
And bend and break
You rise and fall
Just you, that's all
I'm here, you're there
It don't mean I don't care
I'm so sorry I was miles away
It's been a day of tiny triumphs
It's been a week spent in despair
You can't send it down a phone line
I do my best, but i'm not there

So sleep and wake
And dream up your fate
And rise and fall
Watch you grow tall
I'm here your there
But you should know i still love you
When i am miles away

I'll be home again

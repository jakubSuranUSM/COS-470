I need the love of a woman
That's all I want in the world
I need the love of a woman
Yeah, that's all I'm asking of you, girl

I hear the love of a woman
Can make your world seem okay
Without the love of a woman
Lord, I just can't face another day

'Cause I'm tired of being so lonely
And you're constantly on my mind
So I ask you, please
I'll get down on my knees
If you'll take me home tonight

[Chorus:]
No, I don't want your money
And I don't want your car
I just want to be wherever you are
I don't need no power
No fortune or fame
There's just one thing I need
Nothing else will do
And that one thing I need, girl, is you, you, you

I get so tired of being lonely
And you're constantly on my mind
So I ask you, please
I'll get down on my knees
If you'll take me home tonight

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue
But there's something you could do
Oh woman, oh woman
Now ain't there something you could do?
I need the love of a woman

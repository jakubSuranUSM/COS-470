Calling all cars 
My back's to the wall
Send me some assistance
We've got a bar-room brawl

Smoke-filled, dressed to kill
Looking like a full-scale riot
When all I ever wanted 
Was just a little peace and quiet

Somebody get me out of this hole
(These wheels continue to roll)
(Have mercy, mercy on my soul)
Situation out of control

Takin' the curve 
At a high rate of speed
He said, "Wouldn't you know
This is all I need

Bad luck, pile-up
Praying that the brakes will hold
Don't you know 
It makes my blood run cold?"

Hey, hey 
Flames going higher and higher
Is it World War III?
Is this a trial by fire?

Ripstop, sure shot
Lord, they're creeping up behind
Bye bye, Baby
I'm crying on the battleline

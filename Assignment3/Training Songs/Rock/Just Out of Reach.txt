Take a walk, to the beach
Take a walk, back to the sea
Take a walk with me, back to the beach
I take a walk with you, just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach

I see the sun here
I see the sand
I see the sun here
You take my hand 
You take my hand 
You take my hand 
You take my hand 
?  sand

Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
You take a walk with me, back to the sea
You take a walk with me, back to the beach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach
Just out of reach

I see the sun on you
I see the sand
I see the sun on you
You take my hand 
You take my hand
You take my hand
Back to the sand

I know a man 
Back in Japan
Backyard Babies
Is his favorite band

I got a friend
His name is Ben
He's gone to hell 
But they won't let him in

Cause there is nothing
That touches me the way they do
And all the lies, you've been hearin' baby
They're all true
Cause there is nothin'
That touches me they way they do 
Nothing touches me the way these people do

I got a friend
Her name is Grace
When we broke up
It put a smile on my face

And there's a girl
That I love
Sadly she resides in
Heaven up above

Cause there is nothing
That touches me the way they do
And all the lies, you've been hearin' baby
They're all true
Cause there is nothin'
That touches me they way they do 
Nothing touches me the way these people do

Look at all these lonely people
They're born to lose
But they can not die

I love my friend
My only friend
He doesn't know me
But his word is my command

We meet our friends
Down at the bar
Celebrity intoxicated stars

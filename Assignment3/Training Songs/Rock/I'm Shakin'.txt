I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal
To be normal
And I've forgotten what food tastes like
The way it tastes right

The taste buds taste right
Well I wake up in so much spit and sweat
It is not normal
What is normal

I go to bed
When I wake up
After cleaning all
All the spit and sweat

Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' I'm
Sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now

I tossed and turned all night
'Cause I, cause I was looking for, for an ending
This was so because, because I watched all day
The "Neverending story" with Atreyu

The next day came but not a beam of light
Because the blinds were shut
Sh sh sh shut so tight
I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat

It made me very cold
Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin'
I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now

I'm supposed to feel better
This nightmare supposed to end
I am holding on
I'm shakin' now

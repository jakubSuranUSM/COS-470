Oh, here we go
Yeah yeah

Yesterday I saw my love light shine
Straight ahead in front of me
You never really know
When love will come or go

But yesterday I was alone
Suddenly I walked you home
I never really knew
What love could make me do

I'll send the message in a bottle
Trust in the mercy of the sea
Stormy weather, oh yeah
Waitin' for love to set me free

Everyday I watch the tide roll in
Stay until it rolls away
Though nothing's on the shore
I'm running back for more

I'll send the message in a bottle
Play for the mercy of the sea
Stormy weather, oh yeah
Waitin' for love to rescue me

Hey, feels so good, so good, ow
And it feels so nice, so nice
When love comes around
I feel good, so good, so good, so good
It feels so nice, so nice
Feels so good

Yeah, feels so good (feels so good)
Feels so nice (so nice)
When love comes around
I feel good
Gonna make her feel nice
When love comes around
I feel good
So good, so good, so good
Come on, baby
Make me feel good

So good
Get up, get up, get up, get up (so nice)

Hey baby, I feel good
(So good) ow
Now come on, now come on (so nice)

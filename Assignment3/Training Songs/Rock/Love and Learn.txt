Love and learn about the birds and bees and the flowers of the mystery
And if you really want to give yourself a blue love and learn about the blues
The rocky road is pretty hard to take
But you don't know nothing till your heart breaks

You want to know how much you've got to lose love and learn about the blues
Love is a game where your life gets spoken
But the game gets rough when your heart get broken
You'll say at home a sittin' all alone waitin' for the doorbell or the telephone

Then you'll know about what everyone must learn
If you play around with love your will sure to get burned
So when you go to pick a guy be careful who you choose
Or you'll love and learn about the blues

Love is a game where life gets spoken...

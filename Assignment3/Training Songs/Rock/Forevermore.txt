Looking back across the years
The good times and the bad
An echo in my mind

Whisper on a breeze
Sweet and bitter memories
Of all I left behind

If it wasn't for your love
Don't know where I'd be
Don't know what I'd do

Time and time again
Sing the same refrain
It's all because of you

For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore

Rest here in my arms
Forevermore
Forevermore

Through the dark night of my soul
You gave me a hand to hold
And help me make it through

Now all my doubts are all my fears
Held inside for all those years
Disappear when I'm with you

For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore
Rest here in my arms

Give me all your love
Give me all your love
And I'll be in your loving arms
Forevermore

For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore
Rest here in my arms

Give me all your love
Give me all your love
And I'll be in your loving arm
Give me all your love

Give me all your love
Give me all your love
And I'll be in your loving arm
Give me all your love

Forevermore

Forevermore

Forevermore

Forevermore

Forevermore

Forevermore

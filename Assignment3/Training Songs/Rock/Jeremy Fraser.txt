We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of a lance of silver
We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of a lance of silver
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There's no reason to know

We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of a lance of silver
In the middle of the trees all we taught him was
Freeze, freeze, freeze when it came to what
Dragged from the woods
And dumped in the middle of our old schoolyard
He was dragged from the woods and dumped
In the middle of our old schoolyard

Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There's no reason to know

Working hard on his appearance
What can you do when you're left
With a dead and bleeding heart?
His friends grow older
He stays too young

We're sorry for the life of Jeremy Fraser

Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There's no reason to know

We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of a lance of silver

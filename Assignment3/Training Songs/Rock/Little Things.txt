I bleach the sky
Every night
Loaded on wrong
And further from right
Spinning around
Two howling moons
'Cause they're always there
Whatever I do

The river is loaded
I've been there today
Took it some questions
She does me again
I'd die in your arms
If you were dead too
Here comes a lie
We will always be true

Going up when coming down
Scratch away, away, away, away
It's the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh the little things that kill
That little thing that kill

The bigger you give bigger you get
We're boss at denial
But best at forget
Cupboard is empty we really need food
Summer is winter and you always knew

Going up when coming down
Scratch away
It's the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh little little little 

Little little little 
Little little little 

I touch your mouth my will is food
Addicted to love I'm addicted to bull-shit
I kill you once I kill you again
We're starving and crude
Welcome my friends to

To the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
Oh that little little little 

Little little little 
Here it comes that little things 
Here it comes that little ah ah ah ah little, little

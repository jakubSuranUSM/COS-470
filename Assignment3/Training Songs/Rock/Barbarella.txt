You play the game 
I'll masturbate and sing a lullaby 
You run the race 
I'll pay the miles 

You sing the pink love fuzz 
And dance the musty queer 
I'll stay at home â€˜cause I'm the mouse 
So high that I can't fly 

More deep than space number nine 
Can't tell time by telling time 
She's so ready  I'm so heavy 
It's so heavy on me 

Can't hold time by holding time 
Barbarella 
Come and save me from my misery 
Can't you see it's a disease 

Shoot the bad guys 
And I'll gladly sing a tune for you 
Lost in space-we could be free 
Let go, let God they say 

I do believe but not in yours or yours 
I just believe it's all the same 
Don't know just who I am 
Don't know about the lamb 

I'm the meat of the feast 
Barbarella 
Come and save me from my misery 
Can't you see it's a disease 

Shoot the bad guys 
And I'll gladly sing a tune for you 
Lost in space-we could be free 
Na Na Na Na Na Na 

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 
Na Na Na Na Na Na 
And all the tangerines 
They taste like jelly beans 

This must be boring by now 
Grab a scale and guess the weight of all 
The pain I've given with my name 
I'm a selfish piece of shit 

Barbarella 
Come and save me from my misery 
Can't you see it's a disease 
Shoot the bad guys 

And I'll gladly sing a tune for you 
Lost in space-we could be free 
Barbarella 
Come and save me from my misery 

Can't you see it's a disease 
Shoot the bad guys 
And I'll gladly sing a tune for you 
We'll watch Lost in Space on my TV

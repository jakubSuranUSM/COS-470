Here we are again, always dream of places
Near and far, all those different faces
I`m gonna take it like a breath of life
Here we are again, we don't make much difference
Never start, pray for our forgiveness
Then we take it like a breath of life
2 X CHORUS:
From the wilderness all of us climb
Just a blink at the end of all time
Everyday watch the sun on the rise
Always lookin`
The moon & the stars in our eyes
So here we are again, like a dream unfolded
Every star, every theme exploded
Still we take it like a breath of life
2 X CHORUS
Keep burnin` bright, way beyond time
No shadows light up this long empty night
(guitar solo)
2 X CHORUS

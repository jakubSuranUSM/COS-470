Hugs and kisses from the girls and the boys,
We get it automatic

This jungle is massive,
So please don't be so passive,
Be aggressive,
Impressive,
And they will get the message,
Yet your mother, he had it,
Boy runs it's automatic,
Yet it's magic, and tragic,
Oh it's partie traumatic, do it!

This planet, is frantic
It's not our demographic,
We are stepping, galactic,
And just a bit satanic,
Yes your mother, she hacked it
Boy runs it's automatic,
Yes it's magic, death magic,
Oh it is partie traumatic, do it!

Hugs and kisses from the girls and the boys, (?)
Live like champs but we're unemployed
Stay the night you can have some grits,
I'll show you how to write this song, this tip

Alright, alright,
Alright, alright,
Alright, alright,
Alright, alright

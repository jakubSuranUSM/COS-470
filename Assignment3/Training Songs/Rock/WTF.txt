How much talking does it take
Talking 'bout your bad mistakes
Gonna to talk you wide awake
Talk until your ego breaks

The past is dust undo concern
There's hell to pay and it's your turn
The hardest thing you'll ever learn
Is what bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
(What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn)

How much talking does it take
Talking 'bout your bad mistakes
Gonna to talk you wide awake
Talk until your ego breaks
What's the matter with you?

What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn

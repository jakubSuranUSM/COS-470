Chill on the hollow ponds
Set sail by a kid
In the heat wave that hit us all
1976

I felt the percussion
The green man had gone
Half my road was now a motorway
1991

I was by the Black Sea
Two hours in time
Spiny urchins and the new school bell
1979

Changed into lakeside
In January
(Hollow ponds)
Modern life was sprayed onto a wall
In 1993

Where the horses and passing trains (horses and the passing trains)
Have been tangled, revealed
In the green woods where you walked with me
Ship on hollow ponds was filled
Up with the dreams (it turned into a dream)
We shared our own CDs (we watched on LCD)
Every moment now and everyday
Every moment now and everyday

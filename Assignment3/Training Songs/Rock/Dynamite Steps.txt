Memories to crucify
Are sent below
I suppose
I suppose

To me
A truer lie was never told
Now you know
Now you know

Some speak of a light
Control of the game
But I leave the past alone

Beckoning in the night
And a wolf in the wings
I was the last to know

As rain turns a fire
To ember
There you were
There you-

And I feel that it's my
Turn to fall
Now you know
Now you know

They'll scream and recite
Your words from their cage
As I lead the lamb below

Reckoning
Do or die
In control of the same
I'll see you at the door

One more time, dear
This I know

One more time, dear
This I know

In a black sky
Where your dreams collide
Push your faith aside
And you'll realize

That you can't lie
What you feel inside
Nowhere to hide
You're melting

Your medicine is faith
And your flesh divine
Tethered to the flame
Of a dying light
Break you on the wheel
And your bones we'll grind
You'll love me

You're never gonna feel
Like you felt last night
Ever wonder where went
Your guiding light?
Wake up in a field
With a second sight
You'll love me

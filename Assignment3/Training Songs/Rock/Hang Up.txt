They come on over, said the tripper to the was the ghost
Caught you real dead in, master of masters 
I tell you daddy, 
Don't, to a place all full when the angels are alive 
They believe in nature, 
I get so fear, I get so fear, 
I get so fear, I get so fear, 
And you was the and you are the Jesus the Moise the 
Yes there's a god higher 
Hang up the phone and come on over 
Don't act like that to a place when all the angels are alive, 
There been angels alive 

Higher so be there, 
Higher so be there, 
Higher so be there, 
Higher so be there, 
Higher so be there 

If the truth be told, does teh tripper show 
Is messing with the, to that drive that devil got now 
You can drag me and sometime with no clothes on 
With a problem and no poasing 

Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
I tell you this
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 
Hanging up the phone 

Higher so be there 
Higher so be there 
Higher so be there 
Higher so be there 
Higher so be there 
Higher so be there 
Higher so be there

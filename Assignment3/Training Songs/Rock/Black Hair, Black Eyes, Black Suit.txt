Another missing person another mystery
Another marriage on the rocks that's ending in misery
Another strike and another plague
Another mad dog held at bay
It comes as no surprise when I hear all the victims say
Black hair black eyes black suit
Black hair black eyes black suit
I'll take you out to the garden of eden
It was all those years ago
The same thing still happens today
As you all surely know
A poor girl consoles herself with thoughts of better days
And if you ask her why she looks so sad this is what she'll say
Black hair black eyes black suit
Black hair black eyes black suit
You'll find they're all blind when it gets to the lineup
Don't care if they stare when it gets to the lineup
I'll meet you out in the modern world
We got modern ideas too
So glad just to be around but I don't see nothing new
Its still the same struggle in the end
No matter who or where you be
Its still you on top and me down below and I'm trying to get free

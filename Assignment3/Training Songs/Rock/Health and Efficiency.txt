And we ate peaches in this very place
The juice was running down your face
I poured coffee from a flask; it tasted funny
And then we tried to make love by this lake
I remember you began to shake
And I was far too scared to ask if you were coming
We bought 'H & E' because we thought it was dirty
It's strange just how innocent it all looks today
We tried to imagine ourselves naked at thirty
But that always seemed such a long way away
We looked for mountaintops to climb
Just because we needed things to fill our time
We were young and free, and boy, did we abuse it
But everything was so clear-cut
And this is such a clich√© but
You don't appreciate the joy until you lose it
I was jealous and mean you were fragrant and flirty
It's strange just how innocent it all looks today
We tried to imagine being together at thirty
But that always seemed such a long way away

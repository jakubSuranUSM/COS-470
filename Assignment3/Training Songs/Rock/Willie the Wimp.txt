Willie the wimp was buried today
They laid him to rest in a special way
Sent him off in the finest style
That casket-mobile really drove 'em wild
Southside Chicago will think of him often
Talkin' 'bout Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin

That casket, it looked like a fine Seville
He had a vanity license and a Cadillac grille
Willie was propped up in the driver's seat
He had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talkin'
Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin

Yeah Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin

In his Cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner
He left like he lived, in a lively manner
With a-hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
He had flowers for wheels and a-flashin' headlights
He been wishin' for wings, no way he was walkin'
Talkin' 'bout Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Yeah, Willie the wimp and his Cadillac coffin

Willie the wimp, his Cadillac coffin
Willie the wimp, Cadillac coffin
Willie the wimp, Cadillac coffin

You don't have my number
We don't need any trouble now
We don't need the city
Who create all the culture now

'Cause I feel, I feel alive
I feel, I feel alive
I feel the streets are all pulling me down

So people of the city
I don't need your counsel now
And I don't need that good advice
'Cause you don't have my lover's touch

You don't have my number
We don't need any trouble now
Who create all the culture
We can move beyond it now

Now the wolves is knocking at my door
Bang-bangin', ask for more
Stand here we stand tall
We could move beyond these walls

I don't need your counsel
And I don't need these city streets
And I don't need that good advice
'Cause we can move beyond it now!

You don't have my number
We don't need any trouble now
Create all the culture
You don't have my lover's touch

'Cause I feel, I feel alive
I feel, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not far from here

Do you even hear me?
Do you even know my name?
Can we see the ocean now?
(You don't have my lovers touch)

Can you, can you hear me?
Now you're really listening now

'Cause you don't have my number
And we don't need each other now
You can't steal my phone though
'Cause you don't have my lovers touch

You don't have my number
And I don't need no one now
And I don't need these city streets
Who create all the culture now

Pictures of never ending dreams
I can't see what these images mean
Locked inside me, can't set the rainbows free
Like perishing flowers they sag and twist and die

There's a revolution
There's a revolution, yeah
There's a revolution
There's a revolution

Sorrow, what does revolution mean to you?
To say today's like wishing in the wind
All my beautiful friends they've all gone away
Like the waves they flow and they and die

There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a, there's a revolution
There's a revolution

There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution, yeah yeah

Joy or sorrow, what does revolution mean to you?
To say today's like wishing in the wind
All my beautiful friends have all gone away
Like the waves they flow and they and die

There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution

Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution, yeah

Life is so strange
When you don't know
How can you tell
Where you're going to
You can't be sure
Of any situation
Something could change
And then you won't know
Ask yourself

Where do we go from here
It seems so all too clear
It's just as far beyond as I can see
I still don't know what this all means to me
Tell yourself
I have nowhere to go
I don't know what to do
And I don't need to know the time of day

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something could change
It's unknown
And then you won't know
Your destination unknown

Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something could change
It's unknown
And then you won't know
Your destination
You ask yourself

When will my time come
Has it all been said and done
I know I'll leave when it's my time to go
Till then I'll carry on with what I know
Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
Something could change

It's unknown
And then you won't know
Your destination unknown
Life is so strange
Destination unknown
When you don't know
Your destination
And something could change
It's unknown
And then you won't know

Your destination unknown
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange
Love is so strange

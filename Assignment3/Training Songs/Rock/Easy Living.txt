I'm done with the easy living
I'm done with the easy living
I'm done with the slack you're giving me
I'm done with the easy living

I'm sitting in a house so pretty got a life so shitty and I want no pity
Come on with the nitty gritty yeah come on and hit me coz I'm feeling shitty

I'm done with the words I'm saying
I'm done with the words I'm saying
I'm done with the game I'm playing
I'm done with the words I'm saying

I'm done with the road I'm walking
I'm done with the road I'm walking
I'm done with the goddamn talking
I'm done with the road I'm walking

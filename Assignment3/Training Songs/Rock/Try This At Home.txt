Let's inherit the earth, 
'cause no one else is taking it
Come on do your worst, before the moment's passed
In bedrooms across England and all the western world
There's posters and there's magazines 
'cause music isn't ours.

'Cause we write love songs in C and we do politics in G
We sing songs about our friends in E minor
So tear down the stars now and take up your guitars
And come on folks and try this at home

Let's stop waiting around for someone to patronize us
Let's hammer out a sound that speaks of where we've been
Forget about the haircuts and stupid skinny jeans
The stampings and the irony of the media philistines

'Cause we write love songs in C and we do politics in G
We sing songs about our friends in E minor
So tear down the stars now and take up your guitars
And come on folks and try this at home

Because the only thing 
That punk-rock should never really mean
Is not sitting round 
And waiting for the lights to turn green
And not thinking that you're better 
'cause you're stood up on a stage
If you're oh, so fucking different 
Then who cares what you have to say?

'Cause there's no such thing as rockstars 
There's just people who play music
And some of them are just like us 
And some of them are dicks
So, quick turn off your stereo
Pick up that pen and paper
Yeah, you can do much better 
Than some skinny half-arsed English country singer

'Cause we write love songs in C and we do politics in G
We sing songs about our friends in E minor
So tear down the stars now and take up your guitars
And come on folks and try this at home.

Ooh broken
Ooh broken
Ooh broken
Ooh yeah

Whoa baby I'm broken
I can't be with you
Been tumbling down down down
'Cause my heart ain't got the room
I'm just so sorry
I know I'm moving too slow
And you want it now now now
Don't pretend nobody told you so

That's right
Oh that's right
I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
And that's right
Whoa that's right
I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
Ooh

I want to testify
I can't change overnight
I can try try try
But you know that I can't disguise it
Step away
I'm filled with trouble baby
It's such a grind grind grind
Working to hide all the time from saying

That's right
Whoa that's right
I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
And that's right
Oh that's right
And now I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken, hey

Broken baby
Now I feel I'm broken

Now I'm tumbling down down down
And I think you know
If you want it now now now
Then let's get going
Then we can drive drive
Till the night takes hold
It ain't a crime
Don't pretend nobody told you so

That's right
Oh that's right
I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
That's right
Whoa that's right
Now I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
That's right
Oh that's right
Now I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken
And that's right
Whoa that's right

Now I feel I'm broken
Ooh broken baby
I'm broken baby

I always believed in futures
I hope for better
In November
I try the same losing lucky numbers
It could be a cold night
For a lifetime
Hey now,
You can't keep saying endlessly,
My darling,
How long until this affects me?

Say hello to good times
Trade up for the fast ride
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets
Completely

I always could count on futures;
That things will look up
Why is it so hard to find balance
Between living decent .
And the cold and real
Hey now,
What is it you think you see?
My darling,
Now's the time to disagree

Say hello to good times
Trade up for the fast ride
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets
Completely

The past is told by those who win
What matters is what hasn't been
We're wide-awake and we're thinking
My darling,
Believe your voice can mean something

Say hello to good times
Trade up for the fast ride
We close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely
We close our eyes and the nickel and dime
Take the streets
Completely

Ivy you're a girl that I can never taste
I get violent feelings when I see your face
You're so warm and beautiful and soft and kind
I close my eyes but you're still shining in my head
Oh Ivy, Ivy

You eat me away every night everyday
My dreams are nightmares like heads are tails
I can see and hear you
I just can't get near you

Ivy Ivy, oh you destroy me yes you do
Ivy Ivy, oh you destroy me yes you do

Ivy you're a thousand girls tormenting me
My minds a hall of mirrors where you're all I see
I get sicker by the second you're my lifelong curse
My egg shell head is your to break I feel like dirt
Oh Ivy, Ivy

You mainline me stars and you scratch and you scar
I'm a fool for your jewels it's true
I'm burned out I'm damaged
You're so sweet and savage

Ivy Ivy you destroy me (x8)
You do
You touch me you chill me
You smile and you kill me
You kiss me you crown me
You twist me you drown me

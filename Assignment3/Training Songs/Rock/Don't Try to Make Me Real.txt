Make me of clay, make me of steel
But whatever you do don't try and make me real
Make me your dream, a secretive deal
But don't ever scheme to try and make me real

Stop trying to make me real
I haven't got the kind of heart a lover can steal
Stop crying, I just can't feel
Any sympathy for someone trying to make me real

Make me of shit in a two-teenier deal
Make me of pornography in a pedophile wheel
Whatever I do, whatever I feel
By your double standard I will never be real

Stop trying to make me real
I haven't got the kind of heart a lover can steal
Stop crying, I just can't feel
Any sympathy for someone trying to make me

Why can't you settle for a fantasy?
You're so convinced that I'm the man to see
I can't live up to
What you give up to
I fail to see the perfect man in me

Make me from your magazine a listed ideal
Dress me in the doll's house your knickers conceal
Make me your brother-lover beau-ideal
But you will soon discover lover can't be real

Stop trying to make me real
I haven't got the kind of heart a lover can steal
Stop crying, I just can't feel
Any sympathy for someone trying to make me real

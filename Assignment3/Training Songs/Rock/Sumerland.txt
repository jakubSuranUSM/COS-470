Your tempting me to all of life and all its pleasure
Take me to the dream, to the highs and the depths of my soul

Here we free thoughts inside, giving up for giving time

But a world without end where no soul can descend
There will be no summertime

How lost life's been, afraid of waking up
So afraid to take the dream

Shapes of angels the night casts
Lie dead but dreaming in my past

And they're here, they want to meet you
They want to play with you
So take the dream

Can't break free and I hear them call
They want to plague you
They're here once more
They want to lay with you
They want to take you to the shame of your past
Take the dream

Take me lead me far away
Take me there I'll fade away

But I can't hide and I cannot die
I take the dream

We're but fools of our fates, on this earth I shall wait
By the roots of my soul
I am losing control
Take the dream

The sleepers in you
Shapes of angels so deep within you
Feel your soul drowning
Unloosen your soul
Drowning in waters of reality

Tell me what is reality
Tell me tell me thought of god
Do dreams fall from god
Tell me what dreams may come
Break free thoughts all gone
We've all come down

Take me there you're my ticket out a here
All come down
Take me out a here
Take me there

We can dream together
We can sleep forever

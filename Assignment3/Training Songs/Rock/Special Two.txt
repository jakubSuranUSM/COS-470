I've hardly been outside my room in days
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine rays
The Darkness helped until the whiskey wore away
And it was then I realized the conscience that never fades

When you're young you have this image of your life
That you'd be scrupulous and one day even make a wife
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross
And if you happen to you wake completely lost

But I will fight for you
Be sure that I will fight
Until we're the special two
Once Again

[Chorus]
And we will only need each other
We'll bleed together
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's
'Cause we're the special two
And we can only see each other
We'll breathe together
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two

I remember someone old once said to me 
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell

So is it better to tell and hurt
Or lie to save their face
Well I guess the answer is 
Don't do it in the first place

I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now
But if by chance you change your mind
You know I will not let you down
'cause we were the special two and we'll be again

[Chorus]

I step outside my minds eyes for a minute
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease or someone that could ease the pain
But nothing cures the hurt you, you bring on by yourself
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

[Chorus]

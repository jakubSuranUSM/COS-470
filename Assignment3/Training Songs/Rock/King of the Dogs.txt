I got a smelly rear
I got a dirty nose
I don't want no shoes
I don't want no clothes

I'm living like the king of the dogs
I got a piece of meat
In between my teeth
I will bite your throat
If you move on me

I am sovereign
I'm the king of the dogs

Polite life will fill you full of cancer
I don't even own a pair of pants
I'm a dancer
I'm hanging out where the spirits dwell
I can smell the things that you cannot smell

I'm deadly
I'm the king of the dogs

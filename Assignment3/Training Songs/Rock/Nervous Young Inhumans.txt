You should've seen my cursive back then
Every letter was above the line
My ps and qs raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

Most people are jokes but you're so real
Most of the time that I use the word "you"
Well you know that I'm mostly singing about you

You swore you'd never use
The face that your ex invented
So let's meet up in
Uncanny valley

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve

Earlier in the song I used the term "galvanistic,"
And galvanism is the concept, uh, the obsolete scientific theory 
That there is a kind of electricity flowing through our bloodstreams, and that was our life force
I used the term because I came across it in mary shelley's "frankenstein",
And that book is sort of an exploration of the theme of creating a character or making up a person
So I used the term "galvanistic" to allude to that book as a sort of symbol of how
I, like, created you as a character, by pretending 
That I know a lot more about you than I actually do, and also to refer to the fact that
I've fallâ€”fallen in love with the characters you've created in, uh, your body of work
This is the part of the song where I start to regret writing it

When I try to phone, they say you're not at home
I don't believe that it's true
And when we fool around, you always put me down
Now what am I supposed to do

When you won't dance with me
And you won't hold hands with me
And that's not the way to be
Girl, you're treating me bad

So why should I bother to try
And why should I cry
When you don't want my love
When you don't want my love

I used to walk you home, now I walk alone
And it seems that you don't care
And when we're at school, you say I'm a fool
Why must you treat me so unfair

And you won't dance with me
And you won't hold hands with me
And that's not the way to be
Girl, you're treating me bad
So why should I bother to try
And why should I cry
When you don't want my love
When you don't want my love

Your baby takes your balls
And gives you back your teeth
Your baby takes your balls
And lights a fire in your belly

A sweaty pepper thing
How do we keep it clean?
No snow, no rain
How do you expect to keep this place clean?
[Incomprehensible content]

Sugar pills make bitter spit
And glitter skin
And golden sugar skin
Sugar skin and a golden ocean

Your baby joins your party
Kicks you out the door
Your baby is your Mardi Gras
In glitter and confetti

A sweaty pepper thing
How do we keep it clean?
No snow, no rain
How do you expect to keep this place clean?
[Incomprehensible content]

Sugar pills make bitter spit
And glitter skin
And golden sugar skin
Sugar skin and a golden ocean

He locked his eyes straight ahead
Aware of distractions
Would nod and agree with what she said
Now and then asking questions
His hands would shake
As he lit another cigarette
But she pretended not to notice 

Call it crazy
A woman and a man
Our days are numbered
So get out while you can
Wasn't it good
While it lasted
Wasn't it good 

She twisted and played with her hair
Cause he made her nervous
Kept smiling a no-one in particular
Avoiding eye contact 

She stirred the coffee more than it needed
But he pretended
Not to notice

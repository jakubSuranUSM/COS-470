Find it, who that? Mercy
Who that sayin' Mercy? So hot 'n' nasty

Oh hey Joe, don't forget to shake it
While you sleepin' on that bed
You know it really makes it
Look at me shake a leg, oh

I got my head in a cloud
I'm gonna stand out in the crowd
I wanna sing out loud
Ooh, got to do it with the feelin'
Now you gonna hit the ceiling

Do you get the message?
Do you get the message?
Do you get the message?

Hey boogaloo, I really love you
Look what you've done to my head
Take all my time, take all my money
But most of all you take all my bread

Oh, I got my head in a cloud, I wanna sing it loud
I'm gonna stand out in the crowd
You got to do it with the feelin'
Well, you gonna hit the ceiling

Do you get the message?
Do you get the message?
Do you get the message?

Don't forget to shake that thing, do it with the feelin'
Then you gonna, then you gonna hit the ceiling

Hot 'n' nasty, hot 'n' nasty, it's hot 'n' nasty
So hot 'n' nasty, so hot 'n' nasty

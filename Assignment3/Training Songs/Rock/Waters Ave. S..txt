Autumn falls down these streets we'll walk together
You take my hand inside your hand lightly

You used kiss me on the bus and now
I'll walk these streets alone

Meet me downtown we'll walk around just you and me
Hey there's my house Waters Avenue South

You used kiss me on the bus and now
I'll walk these streets alone
By myself

I know, you are, afraid of me
Don't care, my dear, and you will see

[Chorus]
Relax, relax, relax my little victim
Relax, relax, relax my little heller
Relax, relax, relax my little taker
Relax, relax, relax my little my faker

I know, you are, reminding everything
You've locked, the door, and ate, the key

[Chorus]

You got nowhere to hide
And you got everywhere to die
And you got nowhere to hide
And you got everywhere to die

Trapped here!
Sun inside, it freaks, so deep
Get me, to hunt, them close, to me

[Chorus]

Watch, them choke, it makes, me weak
To watch, them choke, it makes, me weak

And you got nowhere to hide
And you got everywhere to die
And you got nowhere to hide
And you got everywhere to die

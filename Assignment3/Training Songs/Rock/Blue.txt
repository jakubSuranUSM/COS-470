Where have all my friends gone
They’ve all disappeared
Turned around maybe one day
You were all that was there

Stood by unbelieving, stood by on my own
Always thought I was someone
Turned out I was wrong
But you brought me through
And you made me feel so

Blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

Live by an old woman
She'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone
Who won't sing with you

Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart
Never thought I'd miss you
That I'd miss you so much
You brought me through
And you made me feel

So blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

Stand by, stand by, waiting round
(All my life I’m waiting for, someone I could hold the door)
Now that I’m blue, that I'm blue
(But nothing seems to change, you'll come back I know)
From now on

So blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stay behind?
So blue, why don't you stop?
Look at what's goin' down

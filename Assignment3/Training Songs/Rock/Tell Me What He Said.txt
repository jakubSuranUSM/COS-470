I've lost him but I don't know how 
He's going with another now 
He'll be at the party on Friday night 
I'd go there myself, but it wouldn't be right 

But if you see him there 
Please tell him that I care and that I want him back again 
Tell him that and then 
Tell me what he said 
Just take him to a side 
Tell him how much I cried and I'm begging on my knees 
Tell him that and please tell me what he said 

If I hurt him I'm sorry 
Please tell him that I love him 
No matter what the trouble may be 
We can talk it over
 
I've never been so blue 
I'll wait right here for you 
But then I know I' d like to try 
If I should ever die 
Tell me what he said

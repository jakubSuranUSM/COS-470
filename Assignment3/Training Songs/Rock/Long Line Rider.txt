Wettin' it down, boss 
      Wet it down 
      Wipin' it off, boss 
      Wipe it off. 
      Doin' ten to twenty hard 
      Swingin' twelve pounds in the yard 
      Every day 
      Every day. 
      I came in with a group of twenty 
      There ain't left but half as many 
      In the clay 
      In the clay. 
      Long line rider, turn away. 

      There's a farm in Arkansas 
      Got some secrets in its floor 
      In decay 
      In decay. 
      You can tell where they're at 
      Nothin' grows, the ground is flat 
      Where they lay 
      Where they lay. 
      Long line rider, turn away. 

      All the records show so clear 
      Not a single man was here 
      Anyway 
      Anyway. 
      That's the tale the warden tells 
      As he counts his empty shells 
      By the day 
      By the day. 
      Hey, long line rider, turn away. 

      Somone screams investigate 
      'scuse me sir it's a little late 
      Let us pray 
      Let us pray. 
      This kinda thing can't happen here 
      'specially not in an election year 
      Outta my way 
      Outta my way. 
      Hey, long line rider, turn away. 

      There's a funny taste in the air 
      Big bulldozers everywhere 
      Diggin' clay 
      Turnin' clay. 
      And the ground coughs up some roots 
      Wearin' denim shirts and boots 
      Haul 'em away 
      Haul 'em away. 
      Hey, long line rider, turn away. 

      Well I heard a brother moan 
      Why they plowin' up my home 
      In this way 
      In this way. 
      I said, buddy, shake your gloom 
      They're just here to make more room 
      In the clay.

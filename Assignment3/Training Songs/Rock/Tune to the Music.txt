Excuse me crying, can't you hear what I'm saying?
I guess I'm dying, going on my way.
I know there's something, something's going wrong now
There's no tune to the music

My eyes are burning, can't nobody hear me?
My head is turning, need somebody near me
But since you wonder, everything is so wrong
There's no tune to the music

The sounds are ringing, emptiness is all mine.
Nobody bringing things to make me feel fine
I know there's something, something's going wrong now
There's no tune to the music

Excuse me crying, can't you hear what I'm saying?
I guess I'm dying, going on my way.
I know there's something, something's going wrong now
There's no tune to the music, no words to my song

I've got money in my pocket. I've got loving in the air 
There is nothing that will stop me and I really just don't care 
I just want to live my life that's the way it's gonna be 
And nothings gonna pull me down cause you know that I believe. 
The suns gonna Shine Shine. 
Let the music blow through your mind yeah 
Shine Shine 

Its gotta be Love 
Its got to be love from the very start 
Its got to be love not a broken heart 
Its got to be love my one true desire 
You know you set my world on fire 

Feel like jumping in the river or dancing in the rain 
The different places smiling faces always make my day 
And all you happy people just following your dream 
Cause everything you want is not a fly by fantasy 
The suns gonna Shine Shine 
Let the music blow through your mind yeah 
Shine Shine 

[Chorus]

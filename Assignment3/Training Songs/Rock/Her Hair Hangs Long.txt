Well her hair hangs long
Lingers like a Summer's day
Oh how lucky I am
And if we hit cloud nine
Who am I to undermine
Oh how happy I am

Seasons come and they may go
Promise me our love isn't so

Well her lips taste sweet
Sweeter than a lullaby
Oh how happy I am
I can't believe her eyes
Eyes when they look in mine
Oh how happy I am
You're in the years my friend
Sit back and enjoy the sun
Oh how lucky I am

I think I'll take it slow
Sit back and watch
Our love grow
Oh how happy I am

Seasons come and they may go
Promise me our love isn't so

Seasons come and they may go
Promise me our love isn't so

I am afraid of bridges
Sometimes I have to turn around 
When I'm driving towards one and my heart begins to pound 
Last night at the bridge to Johnsburg 
I swerved down a dead end street
I sat there shaking in an empty lot 
Full of broken glass and weeds
Then past me in the darkness 
Ran four wild dogs leaping over abandoned tires high into the air
In the air, in the air, someday I will live in the air 
Once I loved a girl named Joan 
Whose skin smelled just like falling snow
One day she drove us off the road into a dead field of corn
She laughed and hit the gas as we bounced across the rows
But I held onto the dashboard with my eyes tightly closed
Those wild dogs brought back that smell of falling snow 
And the girl who lives in Johnsburg across a bridge I can not cross

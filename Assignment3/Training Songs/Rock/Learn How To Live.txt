You got a lot to learn
You play in the fire
You might get burned
You gotta sacrifice

You're playin' the victim
Of your own device
You try to understand
The comb in the ashes
Isn't what you planned

You, it gets you every time
You're chasin' the visions
They're nowhere to find

Learn how to give
Learn how to take
Learn how to live
Before it's too late

You got the restless eyes
They turn to distraction
There's no compromise
You gotta take some time

And fight for the answers
They're hard to find
You now don'tcha fantasize
Start makin' your chances materialize

Learn how to bend, learn how to break
Learn how to mend broken heartaches
Learn to forgive, learn how to wait
Learn how to live before it's too late

Run from the light
And you lock all your doors
It's harder to fight
When you've gone down before

The scene's 're so right
But they play out so wrong
So into the night it goes on
And on and on and on and on

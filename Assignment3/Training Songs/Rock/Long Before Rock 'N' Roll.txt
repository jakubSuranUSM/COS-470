She said "I like just lying on the bed"
Beneath the ceiling with her head upon my pillow
There's nothing else I'd rather do
And I said I'd rather do it on the couch
Or in the kitchen whereabout
You seem so down child
Like nothing could destroy your world

But I never ever wanted to
You never ever let me to
I would but you must wait 'til it gets dark
So what is it that you want me to
I can't make it even good for you
So play me some from 1954
Before Rock 'n' Roll
Yeah, before Rock 'n' Roll
Before Rock 'n' Roll

Well later she came with flowers in her arms
And we can do it in the car my brother owns it
The driverÂ´s seat is made for us
And I said I'd rather grab a bite to eat
There is a diner down the street
Let's take it easy
And join this lovely harmony

But I never ever wanted to
You never ever let me to
I would but you must wait 'til it gets dark
So what is it that you want me to
I can't make it into good for you
So play me some from 1954
Before Rock 'n' Roll
Yeah, before Rock 'n' Roll
Before Rock 'n' Roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Before Rock 'n' Roll (6x)
Before Yeah, yeah, yeah
Before Rock 'n' Roll
Long before Rock 'n' Roll
Before Rock 'n' Roll

Yeah, yeah, yeah

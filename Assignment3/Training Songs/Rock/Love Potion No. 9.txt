I took my troubles down to Madame Rue
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I've been this way since ninteen-fifty-six
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said "what you need is Love Potion Number Nine"

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said "I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink"
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
I had so much fun that I'm going back again
I wonder what happen with love potion number ten?
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine

So what if I don't want to be like you, a slave
Working to the bone for a cheque on a Friday
Condemned to join the family business like my Dad
So what if I don't want to go to school
And be a fool driven by a brainwashed system
Like a first kiss, or a disgruntled mistress
I can't handle this...

Everything I do, sucks me into you
Who made you the judge?
Of everything I do...do...

A difficult phase, lust-crazed
Getting sick of the sin I commit, like a hypocrite
And the aching and the no direction
So what if I want to be a virgin and not do pills
Or felonies, I don't want to go to jail
And get my butt-raped by an ape, by mistake
On our first date and catch aids

Everything I do, sucks me into you
Who made you the judge?
Of everything I do...do...

I'm getting scared about people on TV
Don't wanna live and die, for the treasure that they seek
I want to wreck my town and live up in the trees
I...

Everything I do, sucks me into you
Who made you the judge?
Of everything I do...

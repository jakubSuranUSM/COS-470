Runs in your blood, it’s on your mind
Tucked in your skin, is where you’ll find
That little light, that mends your bones
You’ll feel it when the morning comes

And when that light reaches your heart
Slows every beat, holds every part
No need to speak, nowhere to run
You’ll know it when the morning comes

And when the veil is stripped away
And reveals the silver lining
All the hope, the rising sun
You’ll see it when the morning comes

With all your soul, and all your might
Keep your head straight, eyes to the sky
Be all you can, do what you want
You’ll hold it when the morning comes

And when the veil is stripped away
And reveals the silver lining
All the hope, the rising sun
You’ll feel it when the morning comes

You find your truth, then live it out
You find your song, go play it loud
The sweetest air will fill your lungs
You’ll breathe it in when morning comes

And when the veil is stripped away
And reveals the silver lining
All the hope, the rising sun
You’ll feel it when the morning comes
You’ll see it when the morning comes

Would you leave me alone, my sweet Simone?
If I lay on my back down below on the track
Remember the night, how I'd wade in the water
Be counting the stars and starting me over

They shine your eyes
Gonna make me rain, gonna make you rise
When I'm gone baby, don't you forget it
I did all I did just to get through to heaven

Got no mother, she can't find me
Got no father, he gonna blind me
Little girls might twitch at the way I itch
But when I burn it's a son of a bitch

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, all misery gone
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, all misery gone

Make me, shake me, bleed all over
Going down to the ground in deep black water
Let's ride, suicide
Say what you want but you make it, don't lie

Don't let me down, baby, on a bed of hard thistle
Gonna die when I drown just to have it away
Those lies in my eyes
Push you down in the river till you testify

My mother, she don't know me
And my father, he can't own me
Little girls might twitch at the way I itch
But the way I burn is a son of a bitch

Make me, shake me, deep black water
Gonna run through my pain, gonna make it rain
Baby I'm gone, so don't you forget it
I did all I did just to get through to heaven

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, all misery gone
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, all misery gone

If you could hear me love
I'd tell to you my story
To you and only you
So love that you might save me

I woke up from a dream
I woke up, I was crying
I saw an animal
With eyes like mine on fire

I saw my own true love
She was there selling flowers
Has she forget-me-nots
White lilies or red roses?

And then from far away
Who's that I see come riding?
Upon a pale white horse
Come riding fast as lightning

Oh, if you can hear me love
I'd tell you my story
So that you might save me
So that you might save me
So that you might save me
So that you might save me

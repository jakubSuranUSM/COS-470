Blue skies and telephone poles 
It's peaceful here but I still feel alone 
Blue skies and telephone poles 
The sun should make me smile but it don't 

There's Brian down the street who owns The General Store 
Tells me "hello" each morning and he means it 
You know the way towns like this go 
Amanda has been kind to me the nights when I call 
She know what I can give and she don't ask me for more 
She lets me go 

Blue skies and telephone poles 
My baby's gone and I feel so alone 
Blue skies and telephone poles 
To have today I'm luckier than most 

Hannah holds my hand while the doctor administers the medicine 
She's soft like a bird 
She's kind like a minister who don't believe in sin anymore 
We sit in silence while I get the treatments 
They say I'm gonna make it but that don't make a difference 

â€˜Cause oh, way she goes 
Alex used to say that when we was younger 
Working summers on the roads 
Way she goes 
You work until you can't 
You do the best you can 
And then you go
Well

Blue skies and telephone poles 
My baby couldn't take it so she's gone 
Blue skies and telephone poles 
I'll sit and stare at them until I'm gone too

Johnny put a shotgun to his head
Rolled the dice and died
Late to say you're sorry
Living on the edge for much to long
Tried to carry on
Hunting down the glory

Say it will be sunshine after rain you-hu
I wonder if something stays the same you-hu
Close your eyes, and dream you life away

Hard to say goodbye
Spread your wings and fly
Hard to say goodbye
When we've just said hello

Somewhere down highway 55
Pulled up to the side
that's the end of story
Your body gets out of this alive
Some live for the pride
And some live for the glory

They say there will be sunshine after rain
Wonder if something stays the same
Close your eyes and dream your life away

It's hard to say goodbye
Spread your wings and fly
Hard to say goodbye
When we've just said hello

Sleepless nights, restless days
Memories of the gentle ways
Love locked out looks for a home
A place to find a shelter from the storm

She said you are the air I breathe
The life I love, the dream I weave
Without a word, with just a touch
Now I realize you meant so much

Been awake so long
I feel like I belong
With the rain

Morning light appears
The feelings of the night
Remain

Somewhere in between
The waking and the dream
Feel you close to me

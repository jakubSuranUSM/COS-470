In a land across the seaa
Ruled by dragons known only to me
My lady Ashley waits for me
Holding out her hand
Holding out her hand
A magic carpet couldn't take you there
'Cause its locked inside your head
And you travel all the way
Travel first class
Travel with your mind
Just travel with your mind
Oh, so many people and they're locked inside
Feelings they can't hide
Concrete and stone have shut them inside
Made them live all alone
Oh, just take your mind for a ride
And see what it's like when you're on the outside
Oh, just take your mind for a ride
And see what it's like when you're on the outside
Just travel with your mind
Just travel with your mind

Oh, so many colours never seen before
But they've been there all the time
Locked inside your mind, they've been there all the time
Like a crystal glass filled with life
The bottom is never dry
And your mind a magic sailing ship to take you on any trip
Just travel with your mind
Just travel with your mind
Just travel with your mind

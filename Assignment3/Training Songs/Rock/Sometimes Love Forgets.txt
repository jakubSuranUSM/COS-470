I see the question in your eyes
Wanna think about it twice
For you find your feelings
Reaching out to me
Two different worlds
Too far apart
Too many stops
Right from the start
That say our love could never be
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
And sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You got to let it go
Don't let go yet

Sometimes love forgets
We found each other in the dark
We felt our way to where we are
Didn't plan on this
It happened much too fast
And though the odds may be unkind
I'll take my chances--I don't mind
Stranger things have come to pass

Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You've got to let it go
Don't let go yet
Sometimes love forgets
So let me hold you
Do you want me to hold you
I could hold you forever and ever
Oh, sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You've got to let it go
Don't let go yet
Sometimes love forgets...

I start counting the leaves
While everybody's behind
I'm waiting here for the meek
They will inherit this time
And everybody's laughing 
When you say you're gonna rise above
And there's no use asking 
When you pray that all you need is love 

It doesn't matter to me
Well, does it matter to you
They didn't give you much space
They didn't give you much time 
In this golden age 

Too much has been told
And too much has been said
But you'll never get old
When everybody's dead
And all your children are laughing
When you say you're gonna rise above 
And there is no use asking 
When you've got memories to dwell upon

it doesn't matter to me
Well, does it matter to you
They didn't give you much space
They didn't give you much time 
In this golden age 

I start counting the leaves
While everybody's behind
I'm waiting here for the meek
They shall inherit this time
And everybody's laughing 
When you say you're gonna rise above
But there's no use asking 
When
You pray that all you need is love 

it doesn't matter to me
Well, does it matter to you
I didn't loose my face
I didn't trace my time
In your golden age

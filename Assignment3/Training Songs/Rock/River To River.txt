You'd better cover your face tonight
Someone might take it away
I've been watching with second sight
And I don't like what I see
There's a shadow over me

River to river I call your name
Waiting for the water to rise
Anything forgotten is all the same
To a lover who lies
To a lover who lies

Now I've got an answer to what you need
But I'll never give it away
For each desire that isn't freed
One thing still remains
But your world is wrapped in chains

River to river I call your name
Waiting for the water to rise
Anything forgotten is all the same
To a lover who lies
To a lover who lies

Running lonely here
It's cold and lonely here
I shiver in the night, shiver in
Running lonely here
It's cold and lonely here
I shiver in the night

I'd better cover my heart tonight
Someone might take it away
I've been watching you dress in white
For someone else's touch
And well, I don't need you that much

River to river I call your name
Waiting for the water to rise
Anything forgotten is all the same
To a lover who lies
To a lover who lies

River to river I call your name
Waiting for the water to rise
Anything forgotten is all the same
To a lover who lies
To a lover who lies

You'd better cover your face tonight

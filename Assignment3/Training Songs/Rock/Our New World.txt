Like her father once said
Love is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen
So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever
In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world, yeah

Yeah, we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

Yeah together
We'll build a new world
A wondrous world
Yeah
We'll build a new world
A bold new world

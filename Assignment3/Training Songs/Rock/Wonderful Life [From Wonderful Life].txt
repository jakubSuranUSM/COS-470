Birds in the sky
Flying way up high
Mmm they seem to sigh
It's a wonderful life

Fish in the sea
All born to be free
Yes, they all agree
It's a wonderful life

All over the world
In the heart of each boy and girl
You will find treasure there
Waiting to be unfurled

So follow the sun
And you'll have lots of fun
And then you will see
It's a wonderful life

Go to the places that you've never been
See all the people that you've never seen
Do al the things that you do in your dreams
And you'll see it's a wonderful life

All over the world
In the heart of each boy and girl
You will find treasure there
Waiting to be unfurled

So follow the sun
And you'll have lots of fun
And then you will see
It's a wonderful life

Go to the places that you've never been
See all the people that you've never seen
Do all the things that you do in your dreams
And you'll see it's a wonderful life

A wonderful life
It's a wonderful life

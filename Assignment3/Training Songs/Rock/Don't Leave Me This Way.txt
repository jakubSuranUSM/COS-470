I'm sick and tired and lonely, sitting in my room
Staring at the shadows, blowing smoke rings at the moon.
Every night I try, but, every night I cry, tryin' to work out why
I just want to know, got to know, why you keep on pushing me, baby.

You love me when you want, and take me when you need
Whatever you say to me, baby, makes my poor heart bleed.
Now I don't want to win, but, I don't want to lose
An' I don't want to be alone no more, no more
I just want to give you love, I just got to give you love.

But, you keep on giving love,
You give another man your love.
Ooh baby, don't you leave me this way,
Don't you leave me.

I never want to hurt you, don't want to tie you down
But, every time I take a look in the mirror,
I can see the heartache hangin' 'round.
I'm going down to the ground,
Why you always want to bring me down
Baby, baby, why do you always bring me down.

''cause you keep on giving love,
You give another man your love.
Baby, baby, don't you leave me this way.
Don't you leave me, baby, baby, baby.
My heart is aching, my heart is breaking for you
And I can't take it anymore, no more, no more.

I'm sick and tired and lonely, nothing left to say
Just thinking 'bout you, baby, takes all my night and day
All my nights, all my days,
Baby, babe, you take my breath away.

'cause you keep on giving love,
You give another man your love.
Baby, baby, baby, don't you leave me this way.

I can't stop my love from falling down
I want to love you in the morning,
Want to love you in the evening time.
Don't you leave me, baby,
Don't you ever leave me, baby.
Don't you leave me, baby, no.

Don't you leave me, baby.

Goodnight,
Tomorrow morning isn't far
I will be interesting 
When you're alone and feeling bored
I watched a city cry, I thought I lost you in the fall
I thought of everything, I cannot lose you anymore

So won't you stay? I'm drowning in the rain
Darlin' say the words and I will stay the night

I'm just the trouble that you need
I'm just a year away from when the future swallows me
And when you're left behind
It takes a lifetime to be seen
'cause something happened here
Somehow we're younger in our dreams

So won't you stay? I'm drowning in the rain
Darlin' say the words and I will stay

You're different, and all the rest are the same
Yes, you're different, and all the rest are the same

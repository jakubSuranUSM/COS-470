I think I'd like to go back home, and take it easy
There's a woman that I'd like to get to know livin' there
Everybody seems to wonder, what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day to day runnin' around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows, everybody knows

Every time I think about back home, it's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there right now, just passin' time
Everybody seems to wonder, what it's like down here
I gotta get away from this day to day runnin' around
Everybody knows this is nowhere
Everybody, everybody knows, everybody knows

Merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Yeah! merry merry merry Christmas baby
Babe you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
And now I'm living in paradise

Oh! I'm feeling mighty fine this morning
I've got good music on my radio
Hey baby, I'm feeling mighty fine
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
About half past three
He got all of these presents that you'll use
See, I'll help you put on these

Merry merry merry Christmas baby
Oh! you sure been good to me
I haven't had a drink this evenin' baby
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree

Hey! merry merry merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I said, merry merry merry Christmas baby
I've got good music on my radio
I would love to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

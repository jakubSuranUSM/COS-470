I was born in a crossfire hurricane, well
And I howled at my ma, at the driving rain, ooh yeah

But it's alright, oh, that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas, oh yeah

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag, yeah
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes, I was

But it's alright, and that is a gas
I said, it's all right
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas

I was drowned, washed up and left for dead, yes, sure was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, ooh
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes, I did
I was crowned with a spike right in through my head, oh yeah

But it's all, it's alright, oh, and that is a gas
I said, it's all, alright
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, yes, it is

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, jump, jump)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Jump, will you jump?)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh, [Incomprehensible] me)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Real gas)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Girl, yes I was)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(I was schooled with a strap right across my back)

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh, yeah)
(I frowned at a crust of bread, yeah)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas

Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
(I was crowned with a spike runnin' through my head, yeah)
Hallelujah

Here we go from town to town
Set them up, I'll knock 'em down
Another drink, another round we go

I don't know which road to take
Holding on, for heaven's sake
Looking for the words to say to you

And I feel the push and pull
Taste the flesh and lose your soul
I think that I'll just let go to you

[Repeat: x2]
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall, oh-oh

Oh I like the way she looks
Hope she cleans and hope she cooks
Take her home, a second look, no need

Well is this sex or is it love
Hoping you don't call my bluff
Either way, you're something that I need

And I feel so justified
Laying next to you tonight
Hear the sound, it's calling out to me

[Repeat: x2]
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall, oh-oh

No, I can't find you
No, I don't want to

No, I can't find you
No, I don't want to

No, I can't find you

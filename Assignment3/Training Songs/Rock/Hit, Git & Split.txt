Hit, git and split, I'm coming back home to you
Hit, git and split, I'm coming back home to you
There's nobody here gonna take the place of you

I got the blues, my baby's not here with me
I got the blues, my baby's not here with me
She's a little bitty chick and I'm never gonna let her be

Hit, git and split, I'm coming back home to you
Hit, git and split, I'm coming back home to you
There's nobody here gonna take the place of you

Clean the house woman, this time I'm on my way
Clean the house woman, this time I'm on my way
Don't make no plans for I'm coming back home to stay

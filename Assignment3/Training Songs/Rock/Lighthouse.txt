I never meant this,
I never meant anything like this.

and that's the story,
I never met anyone like you.

come to me
and make it special.
come to me
and make it real.

come to me and make it special.
come to me and make me feel.

shine your bright light over me
and help me see.

I walked on water.
I came through slaughter just for you.

come to me
and make it special.
come to me
and make it real.

come to me and make it special.
come to me and make me feel.

shine your bright light over me,
lay your dreaming at my feet.

follow me down to where I'll always be.

Well, I'd like to send an orchid at the start of every day
For flowers show more beauty than words could ever say
You've done so much for my world till all I want to do
Is try my best in every way to make love sweeter for you

A thousand special compliments I'd pay to you each day
Your ears would never tire of all the sweet things I would say
You never would be lonely, honey, you never would be blue
'Cause my one aim in life would be to make love sweeter for you

You given me the faith that took to make my dreams come true
That's why I want to live and breathe my every breath for you
You've cleared the windows of my life and now that I see through
I'll do my best in every way to make love sweeter for you
I'll do my best in every way to make love sweeter for you

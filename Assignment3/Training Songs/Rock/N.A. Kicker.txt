You could take your precious time  draining all my blood 
If I ever make you mine  I wonder if I could 
I could be a different trip nothing but a buzz 
Yes I think I'm on the tip I told you what it does 
I'm sure you've heard this one a million times before 
You're the one I want to adore  
And I can't shut it up anymore 
I just hope it's not becoming a bore 
'cause I can't daydream anymore 

Sending you a valentine every single day 
You might say it's summertime a thousand miles away 
It would be a Superdrag if you should pass me by 
I could smoke a million bags, you can get me high 

I'm sure you've heard this one

Well could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night?
Now I'm feelin' like I usually feel after I feel alright
I don't wanna hear another word about mornin'
I can't take the light
Well could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night?

You see there's something inside this world that's gone so wrong
There's a gap between the rich and the poor a million miles long
I dig the fact that you and your friends wanna stand up and make it right
But could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night?

I was down at the bar like the fool I am
Dancin' on the table to Son of Slam
I met a whole lotta people that I still don't know
I just rolled in an hour ago
Could you try to keep it down?
Try to keep it down
Try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night

I don't wanna hear about this Lollapalooza tour
Man I just woke up and where I am I couldn't say for sure
I ain't the kinda guy to come and break all your records
But then again I might,
Well could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night?

I was down at the bar like the fool I am
Dancin' on the table to Son of Slam
I met a whole lotta people I still don't know
I just rolled in an hour ago
Could you try to keep it down?
Try to keep it down,
Try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night
Try to keep it down,
Try to keep it down,
Well could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last night?
Yeah
Well could you try to keep it down?
Try to keep it down,
Well could you try to keep it down I was up kinda late last,
I was up all night last night

Juke box jingle jangle,
Shake your silver bangle.
Dancing all night 'cause it feels alright,
Hold your dress up high.

Sweet baby send me,
Bee bop baby bend me.
You look so good,
Make me wish you would,
Hold your dress up high.

[Chorus]
I'm so sure that you got the cure,
For anybody feeling insecure.
One injection and it feels alright,
One more poke and you can do it all night.

Juke box gypsy shake me,
Juke box gypsy break me.
But get out of hand,
Just pass me a plan,
Hold your dress up high.

[Chorus]

Juke box jingle jangle,
Shake your silver bangle.
Dancing all night 'cause it feels alright,
Hold your dress up high,
Hold your dress up high,
Hold your dress up high,
Hold your dress up high.

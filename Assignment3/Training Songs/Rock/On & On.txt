We got down tonight
With words and with wine
And as you carried me home
I knew I'd never be right
In your eyes

We changed all the signs
Controlled all the lies
And I, I can't change the past that brings you back to these halls
And how long I've gotta go

How long, how long I've gotta go
How long

On and on so far to run I'll shy and turn away
On and on so far to run I'll shy and turn away
In and out of love and life I'll fall and run away
On and on and on
But that ship set sail so long ago, turn away

We got down tonight
You seemed so surprised
But I, I've watched as the calls go in and out of your house
And how long I've

Hey now, I know what's on your mind

On and on so far to run I'll shy and turn away
On and on so far to run I'll shy and turn away
In and out of love and life I'll fall and run away
On and on and on
Never gonna hurt you, never gonna say it all
Never gonna hurt you, never gonna say it all
Only gonna hurt you if I have to say it all

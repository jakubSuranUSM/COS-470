Angel, such a pretty little angel
You know I'm gonna take the trip to talk of love
Angel, such a pretty little angel
And when I take you for that ride, well, then you'll see just why I lied
Angel, such a pretty little angel

You know what happens when I don't get my way
I'm like a devil in disguise driving up the skyway
So don't tell me where I've gone wrong because I'm right here where I belong
The only thing that I've been told is gain the world and lose your soul

Angel, such a pretty little angel
My angel, such a pretty little angel

You know what happens when I don't get my way
Like the devil in your soul tearing up your skyway
See the light that hides in faith disappear without a trace
The only way to end your life is dive straight in and twist the knife

Angel, such a pretty little angel
My angel, such a pretty little angel

I can't believe the things I've done and all the people I've become
I never want to live in chains, let's just say I'd be ashamed
I can't believe the things I've seen and all the evil in between
I never want to live the lie, please believe it, why oh why

Angel, such a pretty little angel
My angel, such a pretty little angel

Angel, such a pretty little angel
My angel, such a pretty little angel

I found out I often disagree 
And they say there is something wrong with me
I don't even listen to them anymore

A friend gave me something to believe 
But that friend meant nothing more to 
Mend I don't even listen to him anymore
Oh Sweetheart

Someone studies architecture and someone works 
With fabric textures we don't even listen to them anymore
A friend gave me a call to say I was wrong 
But that friend means nothing more now I don't even listen to him any more

Oh Sweetheart
Whatever you say I take it back, 
Whatever you say I didn't mean that
Oh Sweetheart
They say I don't listen no more

You can't laugh, you can't cry
Your actin kinda funny and you don't know why
Cause your heart keeps beatin like a big bass drum
And the beats gettin strong and it?s so much fun
And you keep on singin but the words are wrong
And you can't stop laughin  baby what's goin on
It's only love, tryin to get trough
It's only love, tryin to get trough
It's only love, tryin to get trough
You can't run, you can't hide
No matter what you do your on a ten cent ride
Goin up, down baby and it's so much fun
And your heart keeps beatin like a big bass drum
And the beats gettin strong and it just won't quit
Better hold on baby, cause you know that
It?s only love, tryin to get trough
It?s only love, tryin to get trough
It?s only love, tryin to get trough From: "J. R. Walskey"

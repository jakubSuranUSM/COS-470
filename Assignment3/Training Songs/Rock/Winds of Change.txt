'There are winds of changes blowing
Gathering leaves up in its path
And the people who are the leaves 
Will remain in our hearts
With love, till eternity 
 
King Elmore was born,
So was Duke Ellington
Jelly Roll made love
Bessie Smith was created in heaven above

Robert Johnson sang the blues
Shick Webb did those things that only he could do
Charlie Christian started a new thing
And, oh my, how Billie Holiday could sing√öFFFF85

Alan Freed rock and rolled, 
Joe Turner's voice was very low
B.B. King wailed
Charlie Parker cried

Louis Jordan smiled
Ray Charles moaned, 
Chuck Berry rock and rolled
Fats Domino made me feel good
Elvis Presley did things that no one thought he could 
 
Then came the Beatles, Rolling Stones
Whole new thing was going on.
Frank Zappa zapped
Mamas and Papas knew where it was at

They all listened to Ravi Shankar
Now that we got Jimi Hendrix
We know where we are (and Louis Jordan smiled)
And the winds of change go on blowing, blowing,
Gathering more and more leaves in its path, 
As time goes past
 
Winds of change keep on blowing, 
Winds of change keep on blowing,
Bob Dylan sang about the winds of change
Blowing, it's all blowing, the winds of change

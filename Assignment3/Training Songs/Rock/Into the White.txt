And there ain't no night
And there ain't no night
Did you hear what I said?
But into white

Into white
Into white
Into white

And there ain't no day
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night

Into the white
Into the white
Into the white

Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?
Deeper than your sleepy head
Deeper than your sleepy head
Ain't nothin' to see
Ain't nothin' in sight

Into the white
Into the white
Into the white

Go and you'll go real far
Go and you'll go real far
Just pass the big quasar
Just pass the big quasar
Can't hitch a meteorite
Can't hitch a meteorite

Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
...

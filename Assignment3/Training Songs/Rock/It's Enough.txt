.45 caliber in the face
Shot him in the head because of his race
Now that he is dead, will we plead his case?
While the executioner's out on grace

I just thought somehow
That things would get better

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
In the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

What's that going down in the Middle East?
Do you really think it's to keep the peace
How we love to control a foreign land
Taking what we can is always the plan

And they know, they know
That Africa is the centre (centre, centre, centre, centre)

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
In the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

When will the desire for love
Outweigh the desire for power?
When will we face the truth
And allow our hearts to flower?

For the planet, for the people
For every living thing upon this world, yeah
For destruction (destruction) and the hatred (oh, the hatred)
Is about to take us down for good

What's the in all those trails up there in the sky?
Why has all the food become modified?
Pushing all your drugs just to keep us high
While the media propagates the lie

And I know, oh yes, I know (I know)
The all-seeing eye is the devil

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
In the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
In the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
In the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

We are living in these times
Where the evil one has come to rob us blind, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh people, we must understand
That it's time to wake up and do what we can, oh yeah yeah yeah
Hoo (boom boom)

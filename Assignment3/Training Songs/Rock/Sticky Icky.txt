I was gathering the crops across the fields
What happened to me baby, you won’t believe
I was picking up peaches, all ripe & good
In the middle of a row, Satan stood
He was hitting on a pipe of cherry wood
Told me « little sinner, I know you would »
I took a little in, blew a little out
The demon’s chronic smoked me out

All you people you got to know
The devil’s harvest is sweet to grow
With the blossom your troubles go
Forget about your sticky icky icky icky hydro

Mama called the feds on me that day
They’ll never let me travel the U.S.A
I'm a work the land until I die
And harvest with my devil while getting’ high

All you people you got to know
The devil’s harvest is sweet to grow
With the blossom your troubles go
Forget about your sticky icky icky icky hydro

Everybody has a secret
Real pain that they all conceal
Maybe mine is contagious
With time it can make you feel
Like a fake, like a failure
All I wanted was a brand new start
I never needed to remember
When the truth can break your heart

Ooh now I got it all out
It's all on the floor

Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river in the daylight
Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river
Before the daylight gets away from me

I wear a mask in the spotlight
Backstage there's a room so dark
I'm not even going in there
I'm afraid it would tear us apart
There's a sun when the dawn breaks
There's a light that will lead you home
When the truth is contagious
This is all we need to know

Ooh now I got it all out
It's all on the floor

Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river in the daylight
Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river
Before the daylight gets away from me

Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river in the daylight
Come party with the river in the daylight
Yeah with the river
Come party with the river
Before the daylight gets away from me

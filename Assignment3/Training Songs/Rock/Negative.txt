Stop, you're looking miserable
Can't be bothered getting up today
My future's looking positive
No one even picked on me today
So you tested negative
Panic in your bedsit goes away
You convert to scientology
To feel part of something once again

I look downwards
I look downwards
Feeling negative, looking negative
I see downwards
I see downwards
I look downwards
I see negative, feeling negative
Looking downwards

Have you ever told a lie to hide a lie
Shame on you, you've compromised again
'Cos things are closing in on you
Not so far away as they may seem
Have you ever told a lie to hide a lie
Shame on you, you've compromised again
And things are closing in on you
Not so far away as they may seem

Someone knocked me in the street
Someone looked at me twice
Now I'm negative
Someone nudged me in the street
Someone poked me in the eye
Now I'm negative

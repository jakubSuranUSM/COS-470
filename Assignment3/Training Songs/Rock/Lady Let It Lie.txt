You should have listened to what your mother said
You should have listened to what your father told you to do
But you always did just what you always wanted to do
Now you end up here singing in a gilded cage
And for half your life you were wishing you were half your age
Lady let it lie

It's hard putting down your family roots when you're living in
A mobile home, but there's always blood even in a rolling stone
You squeezed me hard for the white collar dream
But you woke up to a tie dye lifestyle and its choking me
Lady let it lie

All the boys want to be all the girls want to be all the boys
I don't want to be me no more
All the boys want to be all the girls in this turnaround world
I don't want to be me no more

They once said I was a rising star declaring me a bright contender
When it all worked out I was just a pretender
I could never disagree if you said you were dissatisfied
But why you got to take it out on a guy that tried
But surely there's something left, something worth fighting for
Something out of all this mess that's worth building on
Maybe we can start again, maybe give it one more try
Or do we just walk away, and maybe fade and die

All the boys want to be all the girls want to be all the boys
I don't want to be me no more
All the boys want to be all the girls in this turnaround world
I don't want to be me no more
I don't want to be me no more
Me no more

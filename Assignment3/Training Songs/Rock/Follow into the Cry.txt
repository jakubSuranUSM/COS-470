All these years IÂ´ve been alone
Yearning for a change to my life
Like abandoned child

I face the voidness of this so called life
With all fears inside

And the time wonÂ´t leave behind any shattered tears
You look into my eyes
The darkness faces the light

I follow my fears, I cry
Empty downhearted soul
For so long in darkness I have dwelled
I follow my fears, I cry
Roaming alone all day

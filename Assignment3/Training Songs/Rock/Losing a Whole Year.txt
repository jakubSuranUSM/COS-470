Losing a whole year
I remember you and me used to spend the whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
Lying in your room we'd lay like dogs
The phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
Rich daddy left you with a parachute
Your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
But your daddy left you with no love
You touch everything with a velvet glove and
Now you want to try a life of sin
You want to be down with the down and in
Always copping my truths
I kind of get the feeling like I'm being used
And now I realize you never heard
One goddamned word I ever said
Losing a whole year
Took your stuff and put it in the basement
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
I've seen you pop that check
Craning your neck at my car wreck
It always seems the juice used to flow
In the car, in the kitchen you were good to go
Now we're stuck with the tube
A sink full of dishes and some aqualube
I remember you and me used to spend the whole gotdamn day in bed
Losing a whole year
And if it's not the defense then you're on the attack
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
Convinced you've found your place
With the pierced queer teens in Cyberspace
When you were yourself it tasted sweet
But it sours into a routine deceit
Well this drama is a bore
And I don't want to play no more
I remember you and me used to spend the whole gotdamn day in bed

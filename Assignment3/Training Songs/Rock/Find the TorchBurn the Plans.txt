Dream the dream if you can't
Find your way though the sand

Sing it like you already own it
[Incomprehensible] so show it
Oh, oh, oh

Find the torch, burn the plans
State your case in the land

Scream like you already know it
Our dream is all that we owe it
Oh, oh, oh

Live your life if you can
Ride the wave with all [Incomprehensible]

Shout like you already know it
Our dream is all that we owe it
Oh, oh, oh

Sing it like you already own it
[Incomprehensible] so show it
Oh, oh, oh

Sha, la, la, sha-la-la
(Sha, la, la, sha-la-la)
Sha, la, la, sha-la-la
(Sha, la, la, sha-la-la)
Oh, oh, oh

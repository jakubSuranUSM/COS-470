Seven months to the day since I saw your face
You're on the earth like a fire holding out to the bitter end
You're holding on to the bitter end

I take a walk in the town
It's like a dead-end street
The sidewalk sings your name underneath my feet
Echoes of, forgotten love

Baby where did you go?
Did you sail away over some distant ocean?
Darling what we had
It cannot be taken
It cannot be stolen
And it won't be forgotten
No, it won't be forgotten

Summer disappears like a dream I had
And winter comes with a knife that cuts you down
And it never ends
Ooh, it never ends

I hurry past the place you like to drink alone
Seven months to the day you left me here on this avenue
And now I think of you

Baby where did you go?
Did you sail away over some distant ocean?
Darling what we had
It cannot be taken
It cannot be broken
And it won't be forgotten
No, it won't be forgotten

Seven months to the day and you don't leave a trace
I searched the cracks in the ground, the tallest buildings
They never knew, oh they never knew

Baby where did you go?
Did you sail away over some distant ocean?
Darling what we had
It cannot be taken
It cannot be broken
And it won't be forgotten

Baby where did you go?
Did you sail away over some distant ocean?
Darling what we had
It cannot be taken
It cannot be stolen
And it won't be forgotten
No, it won't be forgotten

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing dignity
Everything I own is right in front of me
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep

I'm holding on, I'm insecure
About my life, about my work
But now I know the things I hold
Are the things I miss about my life

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing dignity
Everything I own is right in front of me
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep

I must believe, I must retrieve
The things I know, the things I trust
The things I treasure, the things I need
Are the things I miss about my life

I'm losing sleep, I'm losing dignity
Everything I own is right in front of me
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep
And it's getting me down, I'm losing sleep

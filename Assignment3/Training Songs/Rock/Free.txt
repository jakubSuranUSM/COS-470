I can break your chains
Crack your cage apart
I can tear your walls down 
With the beating of my heart
And if you said I have no choice
I would tell you you're a liar
I'm not afraid to chuck this frying pan into your fire

I'm a million miles high 
I'm a piece of the sky
Well I'm the purple in the rainbow
My my my
I'm like wind in your hair
I'm like the rain on the sea
Cause I'm free I'm free I'm free
Oh!

Oh you can't keep me down
Put me in your place
I will never wear your 20th century pacemaker face yeah
You will never bleed 
The spirit out of me
I'm flesh and blood, I'm real
I'm not your factory fantasy
No not me

I'm a million miles high 
I'm a piece of the sky
Well I'm the purple in the rainbow
My my my
I'm like wind in your hair
I'm like the rain on the sea
I'm free I'm free I'm free
Yea!

Well you can't keep me down
Put me in your place
I will never wear your 20th century pacemaker face yeah
You will never bleed
The spirit out of me
NO!
I'm flesh and blood, I'm real
I'm not your factory fantasy
No not me

I'm a million miles high 
I'm a piece of the sky
Well I'm the purple in the rainbow
My my my
I'm like wind in your hair
I'm like rain on the sea
Well I'm free I'm free I'm free

I'm a million miles high 
I'm a piece of the sky
The purple in the rainbow
My my my
I'm like wind in your hair
I'm like the rain on the sea
Well I'm free I'm free I'm free

All the little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love
All the little boys and girls
Living in this crazy world
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love 

Why must we be alone?
Why must we be alone?
It's real life
Yes, it's real 

I don't expect you to understand
The kingdom of Heaven is in your hands
I don't expect you to wake from the dream
Too late for crying, now, that it seems 

All their little plans and schemes
Ain't nothing but a bunch of dreams
All you really needed to do
Was, maybe, some love

I am the best message out of the rest of them
Are you all alone, are you all alone?
I am the best message out of the rest of them
Are you all alone, are you all alone?

I am the best message out of the rest of them
Are you alone, are you all alone?

You're selling your soul, you're selling your soul
Have you got it called?
You're ice cold with your eyes closed
You're ice cold, have you got it all?

You're selling your soul, you're selling your soul
(I am a message, I am a message)
You're selling your soul, have you got it all?
(I am a message, I am a message)

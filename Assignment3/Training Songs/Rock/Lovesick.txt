Who the devil has that boy been calling?
Hotel manager was such a sight
Making moves with a plastic lover
Runs about a thousand pounds a night

Mr. Fickle with the passive finger
Come on, baby, what you waiting for?
My heart is on the blinkers
I have your picture but I want more
You're out of reach and I'm stuck in the USA
I need to know that this is gonna go down my way

Don't stop for breathing
Leave it when you're older
Listen to that devil on your shoulder
Don't stop for reasons
Be a little bolder
Everybody's got their lovesick seasons

I think I'm going into hibernation
Pull the blankets up around my face
Hold tight for information
My hands are ready to take their place

Mr. Fickle with the sticky fingers
Come on, baby, what you waiting for?
My heart is on the blinkers
I hear your voice but I want more
You're out of reach, I'm stuck in the USA
When I get you this is gonna go down my way

What are you wearing?
I don't know

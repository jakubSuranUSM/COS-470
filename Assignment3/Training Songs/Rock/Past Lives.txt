Save me
From the prime of my life
And I'll try
To carry you home tonight

Annie
Over Kansas in heels
Like a child
Laughing at endless skies

I will wait for you
At the end love
Let your past lives too
Then you wake up

Take me
To Dorothy Chandler tonight
And I'll find you
Reflected a hundred times

You can spend all your sugar you know me
Sprawling out on a California king

I will wait for you
At the end love
Let your past lives too
Then you wake up

Through the catacombs
Into nothing
And then ran it through
To the beginning

Save me
From the prime of my life
And I will wait for you
At the end, love
There your past lives too
Then you wake up
When the spirit comes
Over water
That'll come for you
A little farther

Through the catacombs
Into nothing
And it mattered through
To the beginning

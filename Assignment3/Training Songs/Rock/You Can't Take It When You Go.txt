Don't try to possess me
I'll slip from your grasp
the things that you seek
have already passed
in rushing to own everything that's in sight
nothing is left
no, not even your life

You can't take it when you go
that's something that you oughta know
Love isn't counted in gold
only in heart and soul

Lies can't hurt
at least that's what you say
but there'll be confusion
as sure as night turns to day
truth is a feeling you just can't deceive
life's an illusion
when you don't believe

You can't take it when you go
that's something that you oughta know
Love isn't counted in gold
only in heart and soul

repeat

over and over
day after day
life's precious moments are wasting away
if dreams are the schemes on which  future's are made
dream on sweet dreamer
til you reach your grave

You can't take it when you go
that's something that you oughta know
Love isn't counted in gold
only in heart and soul

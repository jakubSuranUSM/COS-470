Taking a picture 
Of you and you
Sits on my shoulder, 
Whispers in my ears
Makes me feel good

Absolute gesture
Makes me feel frailty
Makes you feel guilty
It still can happen
Let's just sing
Give it a shot

I need pretensions
No discussion
I pity the downfall
I pity the second
You're sincere
You know how it feels

At the foot of the canyon
There's nothing to share
I like to go there
With nothing but
Reechy poison
Mess with distortions

Well, I don't know
What I want us to
Figure out what I'm suppose to
Seems like nobody's coming too
I don't know what I want us to do

Cheese is bound to
Fill up the Aso
Liquid is empty
Stuff it with candy
Though she's a sad alibi

and where's the pretty?
Where's the young?
Bring your eyelids
Sing a song
Hold your tongue
I want you to go

Well, I don't know
What I want us to
Figure out what I'm suppose to
Seems like nobody's coming too
I don't know what I want us to do

No, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Now it's time 
To say good night to you
Now its time 
To bid you sweet adieu

Baby, drink a cheers to yesterday
And maybe you'll drink your tears away

So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight

So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause I'll be home tonight
Tonight
Tonight

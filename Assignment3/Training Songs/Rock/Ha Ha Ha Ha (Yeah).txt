From the moment we met you could see that I was filled with desire
Only one thing in common baby, but our love is pure fire

As sure as the birds ought to sing
I wouldn’t ask you to change one thing

So be yourself
Try to have a good time
Be yourself
Try to have a
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah yeah

Ain’t always fun playing games, but baby baby I get that feeling
As my name moves across your lips, you see a grown man reeling
You know the way that you act with with such tact has got me reaching for the ceiling

You’re the one whom I always turn when I’m having trouble dealing

I’m wanting you like the desert wants a drink
I’m wanting you like the whole kitchen sink

So be yourself
And try to have a good time
Be yourself
Try to have a good time
Ah be yourself

Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah yeah

I need you I need you I need you
And there’s nothing you can do about it
Spending many miles away, lots of days to get on stage and sing about it
Maybe a ramblin' man but I can't, can't be your one if you allow it
You're a mystery so deep, Archimedes wouldn't think of trying to figure out it

I need you like bacon needs eggs
I need you and there’s nothing more to say

So be yourself
And try to have a good time
Be yourself
And try to have a good time
Be yourself
And try to have a
Ha ha ha ha yes
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha yeah

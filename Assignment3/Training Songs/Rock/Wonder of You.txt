When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me love and consolation
You give me hope to carry on
And you try to show your love for me
In everything you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you.

And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
And you're always there to lend a hand
In all I try to do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you

Guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me like you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you.

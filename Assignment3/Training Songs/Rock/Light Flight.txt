Let's get away, you say, find a better place,
Miles and miles away from the city's race,
Look around for someone lying in the sunshine
Marking time, hear the sighs, close your eyes...

Ba - da - pa do da da - ba - pa do da da...

Stepping from cloud to cloud passing in their flight
Visit the frosty stars in the backwash light
Star becomes a vision, never mind the meaning,
Hidden there, moving fast, it won't last...
Time passes all too soon, how it rushes by,
Now a thousand moons are about to die
No time to reflect on what the time was spent on,
Nothing left, far away, dreamers fade

Ba - da - pa do da da - ba - pa do da da...

Strange visions pass me by, winging softly thru the sky
Over the water, oooohh 

Swirling, the waters rise up above my head.
Gone are the curling mists how they all have fled.
Look, the door is open, step into the space
Provided there

Da do da, - da, do da ....

Just he uses love for sex
And sure she uses sex for love
And they're both hoping for the best
I also have that dream you're thinking of
If we place a blindfold on our eyes
Iron and gold appear the same
It's intense hope that makes us try
So we go on and play the game
And once again we get attached
And think we've found the answer
Here we go again
Ran into many walls
But I know I'll get that answer
Here we go again
We loved not wisely but to well
We're hoping (s)he will be the one
But we never learn from our mistakes
And based on beauty love soon dies
Then we make our move to separate
Yes iron and gold appear the same
But one is costly to obtain
And I'll be the only one to blame
If I resist I know I'll gain

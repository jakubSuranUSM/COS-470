Life's been good, I can't complain so far
Designer clothes, expensive caviar
And gated homes to keep the wolves at bay
Tinted glass to hide my guilt and shame

Neon signs and vagrants at the door
Broken values, needles, liquor stores
And won't somebody help me to believe
Help me to deny the things I see

Now whatever comes your way
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
When it all comes down, you make it through

You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around
Something tells me not to make a scene
Open up your heart and let me in

I've traveled far enough
To meet my own demise
Seems that every one I know still
Wears the same disguise

Tape me, rape me, push me down
As long as I'm understood
Like the soldiers view from the bunkers
To the towers at Park Avenue, yeah, yeah, yeah

Something tells me not to make a scene
Open up your heart and let me in
You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around

Something tells me not to make a scene
Open up your heart and let me in
You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around

You got the whole world around
You got the whole world around
Yeah, you got the whole world around
Yeah, open up your heart and let me in
Don't be afraid

Theres a place out Hollywood way 
Where the crowd goes to play 
They jump and shout and have a ball 
And let me tell you that aint all 

They do the CC Cinnamon Cinder..CC Cinnamon Cinder 
CC Cinnamon Cinder... Its a very nice dance. 

You can do any step you choose 
Its a dance of rhythm and blues 
Just shake your shoulder and shuffle your feet 
And keep in time to that low down beat 
And do the CC Cinnamon Cinder..CC Cinnamon Cinder 
CC Cinnamon Cinder... Its a very nice dance. 

You can dance right out of this world 
So hey boy get a girl 
And hey girl get a boy 
And come on down to that land of joy. 

And do the CC Cinnamon Cinder..CC Cinnamon Cinder 
CC Cinnamon Cinder... Its a very nice dance.

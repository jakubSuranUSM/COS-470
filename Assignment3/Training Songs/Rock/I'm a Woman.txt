I can wash out forty-four pairs of socks
And have them hangin' out on the line
I can starch and iron two dozen shirts
Before you can count from one to nine

I can scoop up a great big dipper 
Full of lard from the drippin's can
Throw it in the skillet, go out and do my 
Shopping and be back before it melts in the pan

'Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
I'll say it again

I can rub and scrub till this old house 
Is shinin' like a dime
Feed the baby, grease the car and 
Powder my face at the same time
Get all dressed up, go out and swing
Till four a.m. and then
Lay down at five, jump up at six 
And start all over again

'Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
I'll say it again

If you come to me sickly, you know 
I'm gonna make you well
If you come to me hexed up, 
You know I'm gonna break the spell

If you come to me hungry, 
You know I'm gonna fill you full o' grits
If it's lovin' you're lackin, I'll kiss you
And give you the shiverin fits

'Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
I'll say it again

I can stretch a greenback dollar bill
From here to kingdom come
I can play the numbers, pay my bills
And still end up with some

I got a twenty dollar gold piece says
There ain't nothin' I can't do
I can make a dress out of a feed bag
And I can make a man out of you

'Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
I'll say it again

'Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
And that's all

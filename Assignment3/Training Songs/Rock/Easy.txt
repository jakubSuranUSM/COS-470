The moon came up
The sun went down
Somebody said you were back in town
I kept my mouth shut and waited for the sound
Of your footsteps on the stair
I knew you'd be around
The circumstances were too good to be true
All roads lead to Rome
But mine all led to you
Standing in the backyard sniffing at the sky
How could it be? I had to wonder why...
It's so easy... you made it so easy for me
You made it so easy
You made it so easy for me
I see you in the street, alone with yourself
Crawling my way like a crab on a shelf
I could still read the secrets in the back of your mind
Coming back to haunt the places you left behind
Looking for excuses, searching all around
When you caught sight of me I had to settle down
"Come on", you said, " it should be easier than this"
I never lied, I wanted your kisses.
So easy
You make it so easy for me
It should be so easy
It could be so easy for me yeah
You're so easy
You make it so easy for me
It should be so easy
You make it so easy for me yeah
Days ran into weeks
Weeks ran into years
Before I knew it I was mopping up the tears
Another tragedy just left the dance floor
I put my boots on
Went running back for more
Keep me in the picture
Keep me in your book
I'll go out of my mind
If you let me off the hook

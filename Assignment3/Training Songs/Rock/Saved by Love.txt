Laura loves her little family,
And she's the kind of woman who loves them with her life.
But sometimes in the evening,
When the world rests on her shoulders
With four walls closing in,
She'll close her eyes.

Oh

It's not like she misses being younger,
Though she never was in Vogue magazine or on TV;
Her husband loves her dearly,
And the morning shows her clearly,
Kisses her little baby girl.
Laura, she's the queen of the world.

Can't imagine ever leaving now,
Now that she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
Listen to her quiet heart singing loud.
Laura, she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
I know that she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
Saved by love.

There's nothing quite like my family's love to warm me,
And nothing short of death's gonna ever leave me cold.
Well, still at times it's lonely,
But through it all it only
Makes me love Jesus more,
And this is what He came here for.

I can't imagine ever leaving now.
Now that I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
He's gone and turned my crazy world back around,
And I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
I know that I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love

Oh, I'm never leaving now,
Now that I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
He's gone and turned my crazy world back around,
And I've been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love.
Amy, she's been saved by love,
Saved by love, saved by love
Saved by love.

I'm saved by love.

That's right.
And nothing I can say,
Nothing I can do, nothing I can say.

We're all just saved by love.
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do.
Only love can say, only love can do,
Only love can say.

Only love can say, only love can do,
Only love can say.

I'm say-yay-yaved by,
I'm saved by, by,
Nothing you can do, nothing you can say,
Only love can say

All across the sky
The mysteries of faith
Fossils of desire all assume their rightful place
Is there any danger in their fire
Is there any solace in their wake
Could it really make a world of difference for goodness sake

Train rolls a cappella
To a sympathetic moon
Carrying the stories of every heart, earned wound
Will there be a lover at the station
Will there be a last conductor's call
Will there really be a happy ending after all

[Chorus]
To the rendezvous
Fortunes to be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where we can find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time

Painting the horizon
A mast beyond the blue
Caught up in the tempest of another point of view
Could there be a mutiny in the making
Could it be a lorelei in song
Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along

Will there be a jewel beneath the boulder
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all

[Chorus]

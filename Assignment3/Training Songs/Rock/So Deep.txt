I use to be so happy, now I'm sad.
You wrecked a good love and now your glad.
It wasn't very hard for you to do.
You handed back the heart that loved you so true.

Now I'm in so deep, I can't get deeper
I'm in so low, I can't get lower
I'm blue so blue, I can't get bluer
All because of you

It really hurt to find out that you lied
I can't believe the pain I feel inside
I guess all along you were laughin' at me
Oh what a shame I couldn't see

But I'm in so deep, I can't get deeper
I'm in so low, I can't get lower
I'm blue so blue, I can't get bluer
All because of you

Wish I could fool myself and say I'm fine
Forget the past and get it out of my mind
(So Deep Lyrics on http://www.lyricsmania.com)
And though I'm tryin' just as hard as I can
I can't shake the state that I'm in

Because I'm in so deep, I can't get deeper
I'm in so low, I can't get lower
I'm blue so blue, I can't get bluer
All because of you

In so deep, I can't get deeper
I'm in so low, I can't get lower
I'm blue so blue, I can't get bluer
All because of you

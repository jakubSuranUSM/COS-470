You're only pretty as you feel
Only pretty as you feel inside
You're only pretty as you feel
Just as pretty as you feel inside

When you wake up in the morning
Rub some sleep from your eye
Look inside your mirror
Comb your hair

Don't give no vanity a second thought
No, no, no
Beauty's only skin deep
It goes just so far 'cause
You're only pretty as you feel
As pretty as you feel inside
You're only pretty as you feel

So girl, don't hang yourself up
On no plastic face
A little bit of soap will wipe away
Any grease 
'Cause

You're only pretty as you feel
Say, you're only pretty as you feel inside
Strip
So now you're feeling so pretty
Now you're feeling so good
Now you're ready to face the world
Now you're feeling good
Go out there and knock them silly girl
Go out there, show them how to thrill
Go out there show them how to thrill
Oh, go
You're only pretty as you feel
Say, you're only pretty as you feel
Mama
You're only pretty as you feel (pretty as you feel inside)

You're only pretty as you feel
Feelin' pretty, feelin' pretty
You're only pretty as you feel
Feelin' so pretty, feelin' so pretty
Feelin' so pretty, feelin' so pretty
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty mama

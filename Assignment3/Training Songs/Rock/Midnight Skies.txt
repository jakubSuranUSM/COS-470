Lemonade in the shade
Of the Western trees
We got it made in the shade
Of an Easter breeze

The midnight sun
Has just begun
Midnight skies
In your eyes in the summertime

Serenade as we wade
Into Tropic seas
We'll let it play
Holiday kinda melodies

The midnight sun
Has just begun
Midnight skies
In your eyes in the summertime

Picnic baskets, no umbrellas
Let me tell ya, I love the motion
On an endless screen of deep emotion

Promenade, a parade
In the summer breeze
We'll masquerade, a charade
Of our fantasies

The midnight sun
Has just begun
Midnight skies
In your eyes in the summertime

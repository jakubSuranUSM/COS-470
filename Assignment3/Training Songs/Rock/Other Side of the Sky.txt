To pass beyond the countless worlds
The eternal wheel
The ceaseless tides of selves
Ever passing away before your eyes 

All life's light that I've seen 
Here before me 

Hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare hare supermarket!
Hare hare London bus!
Hare hare ladies' lavatory 
Hare hare hare hare hare hare

I was once a son, now I'm on my own
Went through every war and I've got myself to show
But trials and tribulations seem to always track me down
I'll ride off into the sunset and try me another town

I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul,
Walk on side roads
'Cause that's the only way I know

I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul

Watch for who you know, careful what you try
Everywhere I go I still got myself to fight
And one day if my child ever wonders what is wrong
I won't bat an eye when I tell him "daddy don't belong"

I'm an odd soul
Ah, yes an odd soul,
Walk on side roads
'Cause that's the only way I know

I'm an odd soul,
Ah, yes an odd soul
Follow ? road
Just trying to find a place called home

(Got an odd soul, 
Is that all right?)

I see it
I'm an odd soul, 
Ah, yes an odd soul
I see it
I'm an odd soul, 
Ah, yes an odd soul

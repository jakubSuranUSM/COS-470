Everybody does the same things
Everybody's the same
Everyone that is 'cept for my friend Nicki Lighthouse
She is from the jungle and has never rode a bike
Instead she rides on apes and llamas
Everywhere she goes

And everywhre she goes the boring people say
"There she goes again
The strangest girl that's ever been"

Everybody thinks the same things
Everybody's the same
Everyone that is 'cept for my friend Nicki Lighthouse
Where she's from forward is backward
And down is up
So she eats her dinner on the ceiling
And wallpapers the floor

And everywhre she goes the boring people say
"There she goes again
The strangest girl that's ever been"

I'm a big fan Nicki Lighthouse
You know that I am
You know that I am

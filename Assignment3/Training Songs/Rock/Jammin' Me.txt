You got me in a corner 
You got me against the wall 
I got nowhere to go 
I got nowhere to fall 

Take back your insurance 
Baby nothin's guaranteed 
Take back your acid rain 
Baby let your T.V. bleed 

You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me, 
Quit jammin' me 
Baby you can keep me painted in a corner 
You can look away, but it's not over 

Take back your angry slander 
Take back your pension plan 
Take back your ups and downs of your life 
In raisin-land 

Take back Vanessa Redgrave 
Take back Joe Piscopo 
Take back Eddie Murphy 
Give 'em all some place to go 

You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me 
Quit jammin' me 
Baby you can keep me painted in a corner 
You can walk away but it's not over 

Take back your Iranian torture 
And the apple in young Steve's eye 
Yeah take back your losing streak 
Check your front wheel drive 

Take back Pasadena 
Take back El Salvador 
Take back that country club 
They're tr yin' to build outside my door

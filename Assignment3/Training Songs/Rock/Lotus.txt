Hey hey

It was hell 
Sarcastic silver swell. 
That day it rained 
Tough spun, hard won, no 
Ocean flower aquarium 
Badlands, give a hand. 
Honey dipt, flim flam 
Hey hey. hey hey. 
That cat can walk like a big bad man. 

So happy to show us 
I ate the lotus. 
Say haven't you noticed? 
I ate the lotus 

Storefront window  I reflect. 
Just last week I was merely heck 
Tip the scale, I was hell 
Picked me up then I fell. 
Who's this stranger? crowbar spine 
And I feel fine. 
Let it rain, rain, rain 
Bring my happy back again. 

So happy to show us 
I ate the lotus. 
Say haven't you noticed? 
I ate the lotus 

Let it rain, rain, rain 
Save me from myself again 
Wash away my ugly sins 
Opposing thumb, dorsal fin 
That monkey died for my grin 
Bring my happy back again 
Let it rain, rain, rain 
Bring my happy back again 

So happy to show us 
I ate the lotus. 
Say haven't you noticed? 
I ate the lotus 
I ate the lotus 
I ate the lotus

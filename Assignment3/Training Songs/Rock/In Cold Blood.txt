It's hot at night in the summertime (ooh!)
The summer's mine, that's underlined
King Push, Kingpin put none over mine
Dope boys workin' overtime
Lotta hustle, got an open mind
Real time foreign cars
Real time foreign broads
Watch face froze in time
True drug overlord
We just goin' overboard
Yacht parties, jet-skis
Say you ballin', let's see
Pull up in the SL
Let her do the SC
Ask her what's her ring size
Let her do the Gretzky
I just do it king size
All I know is ringside
All we do is celebrate
You know how a king ride
Push!

Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer

(In cold blood)
(In cold blood)

Cali let's dive, dive down
To the pool's bottom where we belong
Cali you're sinking like a bleeding stone
Heard it down on the radio

(In cold blood)
(In cold blood)
(In cold blood)

Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Zero one one one one zero zero one one
Cryin' zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault, sign my backflip
Pool summer, summer, pool, pool summer

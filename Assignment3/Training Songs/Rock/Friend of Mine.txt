In my tortured mind,
It happens all the time
It's not too encouraging, 
You never prayed for anything.
What makes you so great? 
Something I would indicate?
I may withstand the strongest
Can't help their similarities…
[Doesn't seem at all to hear]
Is it fair now? Does it matter?…
[Backwards through another year]
And come down, too
To tell me what to do!

I make no claim on your design,
I will not call you a friend of mine!
I cannot follow your disguise,
I will not!
I will not!

Not sure what you say
Makes any difference anyways
Tell me what you mean
With any hope of coming clean
It's bit too late to you now
But I appreciate 
The never-ending signals
We've had days like this before

I make no claim on your design,
I will not call you a friend of mine!
I cannot follow your disguise,
I will not!
I will not!

I make no claim on your design,
I will not call you a friend of mine!
I cannot follow your disguise,
I will not!
I will not!
I will not call you a friend of mine,
I will not call you a friend of mine,
I will not call you a friend of mine,
I will not!
I will not!

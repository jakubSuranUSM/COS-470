You've run into the city
The center of it all
New vision and new language
To camouflage the fall

But they had no reason
To stand there doing time
Profit from the season
The path consumes the lie

Shine on
Illuminated
Shine on
Illuminated

Angel head destroyer
Young heart torn to shreds
You savage violent favors
On canvas blood is shed

But they had no reason
To stand there doing time
Profit from the season
The path consumes the lie

Shine on
Illuminated
Shine on
Illuminated
Shine on

And we all shine on
And we all shine on
Illuminated

But they had no reason
To stand there doing time
Profit from the season
The path consumes the lie

Shine on
Illuminated
And we all shine on
Illuminated

Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Illuminated

Tried so hard to breakaway, 
Another home a place to stay, 
Somewhere no one will follow me, 
A little town of history.

Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long.

It's getting harder with everyday, 
Another down no other way, 
Fighting hard got heavy load, 
I hit the tracks I hit the road.
 
Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long.

Time to leave time to go, 
People search nobody knows, 
Of my departure so suddenly, 
From little town of history.

Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long, 
Please don't be long.

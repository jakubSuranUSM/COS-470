What's that over there moving on the wall
A second glance and it's not there at all
What's that sitting there on the page of my book
It hides behind the words when I try to take a closer look

I can't reach out and grab it but that's ok with me
What's that jumping up and down in the middle of the street
It lingers then it melts into the wavy liquid heat
What are all those dizzy circles in the corner of my eye
They laugh and float away as I look into the sky
Can't get my arms around it but that doesn't bother me
'cause all I have to do is dream

I see you every place I go
I see you in people I don't even know
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
I see you

Who am I to close my mind from what it wants to see
And who are you to tell the truth and kill my fantasy
Why are all those people always saying things about me
I'm not a loser, I'm just lonely
Yeah I wanna lay down next to you
But I'm not one to complain
Yeah I wanna touch you too

Do me a favor and appease my aching eyes
Won't you please materialize
Play another of your tricks with my sight
Be here in the flesh tonight

What's that pretty little thing crawling up my wrist
Call me crazy, call me a masochist
But I'd rather have you in my mind than completely out of sight
So I'll just go on dreaming for the rest of my life

I see you every night and day
I see you in a million different ways
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
Yeah, I see you

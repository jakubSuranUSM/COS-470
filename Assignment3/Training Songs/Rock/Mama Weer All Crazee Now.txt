I don't want to drink my whisky like you do
I don't need to spend my money but still do
Chorus
Don't stop now a c'mon
another drop now c'mon
I want to lot now so c'mon
That's right, that's right
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
I said Mama but we're all crazy now
A you told me fool fire water won't hurt me
A you tease me and all my ladies desert me
Chorus
 don't want to drink my whisky but still do
I had enough to fill up "H" Hill's left shoe
Chorus
Mama mama mama mama oh yeah...

Alta Mira
Yesterday I said goodbye to all my misery

I floated down the river just to see what I could see
Yesterday I said goodbye to all my misery
I came upon the ocean and its beauty took me in
I floated down the river just to see what I could see
A bird's course may take my mind is where I must begin
I came upon the ocean and its beauty took me in

A bird's course may take my mind is where I must begin
Alta Mira, oh set my spirit free

Alta Mira, like the wind that moves the sea
Alta Mira, oh set my spirit free
Alta Mira, let it set your spirit free
Alta Mira, like the wind that moves the sea
Alta Mira, we can live in harmony
Alta Mira, let it set your spirit free

Alta Mira, we can live in harmony
The sun was like a burnin' flame

That sinks beneath the sea
The sun was like a burnin' flame
Beckoning with all its color
That sinks beneath the sea
Come and follow me
Beckoning with all its color
Its flame was my reflection
Come and follow me
Though I knew it wasn't real
Its flame was my reflection
I had to find out what it was
Though I knew it wasn't real
And how it made you feel
I had to find out what it was

And how it made you feel
Alta Mira, set my spirit free

Alta Mira, like the wind that moves the sea
Alta Mira, set my spirit free
Alta Mira, let it set your spirit free
Alta Mira, like the wind that moves the sea
Alta Mira, we can live in harmony
Alta Mira, let it set your spirit free

Alta Mira, we can live in harmony
Hey, Alta Mira…

Set my spirit free…
Hey, Alta Mira…

Set my spirit free…

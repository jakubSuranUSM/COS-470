And even in your darkest hour
The recipe I cook for you
Can release its latent power
And make your body feel brand new

Can't you hear the music play
Being center of what you want
Try to leave the past behind
Memories don't appeal

All the things we said
All the things we did
All the things that passed
Were satisfied

( Rossi / Frost )

You thought that I would be so warm and tender
That love could be so very nice
I made a call to find suspicion on the line
Why couldn't you be all
I thought you wouldn't be a young pretender
Again too late I realise
The reasons now I find, conditions at the time
Did not allow for you to be

So don't you worry
I've got it all under control
Take time don't worry
I'm only halfway through a dream

Now love can really be so warm and tender
And can be oh so very nice
But not that way I said, too late too soon you said
Too soon, you said, too late to soon

So don't you worry
I've got it all under control
Take time don't worry
I'm only halfway through a dream

You thought that I would be so warm and tender
That love could be so very nice
I made a call to find suspicion on the line
Why couldn't you be all
I thought you wouldn't be a young pretender
A young pretender, be a young pretender
I thought you wouldn't be a young pretender
A young pretender, be a young pretender
I thought you wouldn't be a young pretender
A young pretender, be a young pretender..

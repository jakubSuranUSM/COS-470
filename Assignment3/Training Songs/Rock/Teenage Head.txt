I'm a monster
got a revved up teenage head.
Teenage monster
California born and bred.
Half a boy and half a man
I'm half at sea and half on land, oh my
Bye-bye.

Got a woman,
she's my hopped up high school queen.
She's my woman,
she's a teenage love machine.
She knows how to turn me on
and get me high and get it on and on,
yeah she does.

When ya' see me,
better turn your tail and run,
'cause I'm angry
and I'll mess you up for fun.
I'm a child of atom bombs
and rotten air and Vietnams; I am you,
you are me.

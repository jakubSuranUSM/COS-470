More despair, no more being scared
No bottom lip sticking out through your hair
No talking down, no staring through
The walls I won't let them come crashing down on you
No modest bear, no worried tiger
And don't you fret
And I won't either
We'll go to the ferry and get some chips
And then I'll kiss your salty lips
Then we'll see my great granny's grave
And we'll feel mortal then we'll be saved
We'll stop the clouds from coming in
And we will win.
The world can't come, in here today
Shut the curtains, phone in sick,
It's time to play,
You and me, me and you,
Together we're strong enough to do what we want to do.

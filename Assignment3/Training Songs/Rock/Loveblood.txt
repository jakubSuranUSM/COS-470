Waiting with my arms out
Whisper then a loud shout
Lost in the way she says my name
I'm such a creep
Fortune brought me lovers
Shadowed taro colors
Fated to kill the sweetest things
One by one

Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?
Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?

Hiding in the silence
One-way form of violence
Taste of the thunder from her thighs
Makes me shake
Calmly kicking outwards
Is she misunderstood?
Walking along the razor's edge
And she sweetly moans

Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?

Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?
Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?
Hey, what's that from above?
Is it love for blood?

One last kiss and away she goes
Obsessed with loveblood and yet no one knows

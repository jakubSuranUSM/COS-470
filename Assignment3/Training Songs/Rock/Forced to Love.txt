Well, if you think about it
Then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it
Well, am I cool yet?
'Cause it's the word of the knife that won't cut you up
And if we think about it
Well, is it true yet?
'Cause there's no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it
Well, are we through yet?
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

When we speak about it (made the right, always on mine)
And if I speak about it (erase the lies, love is frozen)
So if you think about it
What would you do?
You're just the man with the plan saying we are not lost
So let's think about it
Are we through yet?
It's just the time to decide if we can move up, up, up, up

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

Well, if you think about it
Then you're a fool, yeah
'Cause you decide to believe in what we made up
And if I think about it
Am I cool yet?
'Cause there's no lie like that lie that made us give up

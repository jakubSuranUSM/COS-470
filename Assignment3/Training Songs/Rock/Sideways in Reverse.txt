C'mon
On a dead high wire we'll make a connection
Never knowing my shepherd never knowing my witness
C'mon now honey you're so sick and pretty
C'mon now sugar 'cause you know it ain't easy
Bang bang bang let me shoot it all over
Go down people give me your love
You're another mistake, you're a sign of disaster 
Go down people give me your love
Gonna shake shake shake as a matter of course
Going down goin' down people give me your love
It fights like a bitch and it kicks like a horse
Goin' down goin' down people give me your love
Ain't you glad ain't you glad ain't you glad little sister
Go down people give me your love
Sideways in reverse I don't know any better
Go down people give me your love
You gotta keep it running clean keep on fixin' the machine
(gonna give me your love) Goin' down goin' down people give me your love
Keep it running clean keep on fixin the machine
(gonna give me your love) Goin' down goin' down people give me your love 
Going down people give me your love
Going down people give me your love
Goin' down goin' down people give me your love

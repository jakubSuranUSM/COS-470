I don't know where I'm going
I don't know what I'm doing 
But it feels alright

I have one eye to Morocco
I only have to follow
Through the scented night

Conversation 
Is fading away
The last thing 
I heard you say
Was just a murmur
A distant blur
Your lips are moving
But I hear no words

All day
Sitting alone in my room 
Waiting for no-one to call me
Lost in a dream of my own

I'm drawn by this obsession
With a tantalizing vision
Of a swirling robe

I have one eye to Morocco
By the time I reach tomorrow
I'll be on that road

Sweet temptation
Draws me on
Gives me the strength
To cross my Rubicon
Past a point
Of no return
Ever onwards
As my bridges burn

All day
Sitting alone in my room 
Waiting for no one to call me
Lost in a dream of my own

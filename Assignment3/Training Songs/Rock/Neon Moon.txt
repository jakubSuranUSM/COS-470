When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world, turns blue

There's a rundown bar
'Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
Close my eyes
Sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
You'll come back one day

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

But I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
And I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

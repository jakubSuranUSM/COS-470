I think I'm coming back home 
It's safer if I stay close to home 

If I could 
If I only could 

I would give everything 
You know I would, if I only could 

It's all enough to suffocate me 
Irritate and separate me 

It's all enough, but not enough for me 
It's all enough, but not enough for me 
It's all enough, but not enough for me 

I'm sorry for the inconvenience 
It's only 'cause I'm losing patience 
Call me over, Sophia 
When it's over, hurry up

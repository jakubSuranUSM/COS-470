You got to get it to give away
You got to give it to get away

Outside feelin kind of faded
Inside I'm holdin conversations

You got to give it to get away
You got to get it to give away

You got to get some
Come on and get some
You know you want some
Come on and get it then

Landslide comin up behind you
Joyride hope they never find you

You got to get it to give away
You got to give it to get away

Get it to give away
Give it to get away

Get it

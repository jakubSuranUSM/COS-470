Haven’t we made
Enough for a living wage?
We accept the fatal gift
A soup stone for our stove
And a blindfold for our tears
Paying for a living wage
Know it’s a deceptive deal
We accept the fatal gift
They hover over where we live

The things you own, they own you

Haven’t we saved
Enough to go away
Enough to reach the coast?
Why do we stay
Paying for a living wage?
I know it’s a deceptive deal
We accept the fatal gift
They hover over where we live

All the things you own, they own you
The things you own, they own you

And you own it and it owns you
And you own it and it owns you

Close my eyes
Close my eyes

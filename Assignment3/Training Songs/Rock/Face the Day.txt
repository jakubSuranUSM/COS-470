(Brewster-Neeson-Brewster)
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Long night leaves me stranded
Black visions, danger signs
No love, need protection
Feels like I'm on production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted-day
Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late, the luckless warning
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Outside, screaming city
Red lights and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time
It's raining in a world of traders
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living
Is 24 hours too long!
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Give the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
Can't see the tears I cry
I know it's coming loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time
I don't wanna face the day

Their eyes light up 
When you put them down 
Heartbeat increases 
When you shove 'em around 
Spill a drink on her 
She's your friend for life 
You can carve out a disciple 
If you have a knife 

Oh, hurt me 
Ok, I'll hurt you 
Heartbeat you 
Then I'm goin' to sleep 

Maybe I'm the prize fool
andbecause I try
but if i gave up life would really suck

I'm not one of those cats that you meet 
Don't try, you can't impress me 
But there's pages missin' 
What's it about? 
Each page leaves somethin' you'll never find out 

Oh, hurt me 
Ok, I'll hurt you 
Heartbeat you 
Then I'm goin' to sleep 

Oh, hurt me 
Ok, I'll hurt you 
Heartbeat you 
Then I'm goin' 
Think I'm goin' to sleep 

Maybe I'm the prize fool because I tried 
But if I gave up 
Life would really suck 

Oh, hurt me 
Ok, I'll hurt you 
Heartbeat you 
Then I'm goin' 
Then I'm goin' sleep

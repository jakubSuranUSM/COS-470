I was looking to see some dreams drip from your fingers
I was working in that lonely place where memory lingers
If there were words, if there was hair that I could drag you back with
If there was one single little hook that I could break your back with
Here we go
Oh yeah
Better get my head down there
Oh where?
Down there in that cavern where heaven grows
It's somewhere down there between daytime and the dark
And I'm gonna sweat beneath the light of a warm world
Oh yeah
Better get my head down there
Oh where?

Down there in that cavern where heaven grows
Out here in the street, naked in front of God and everyone
I'm beginning to see daylight yawning down there
And I'm just sitting here waiting for things to come
Cram that page baby, you know I'm marvellous
You think I'm sweating like this just for fun?
And hey I know it's true but I just can't say it
(Say it, say it)
Hey I know it's true but I just can't say it
(Say it, say it)
All right, all right!
Just.... one..... touch
And everything will be all right
Just.... one..... touch
And everything will be all right

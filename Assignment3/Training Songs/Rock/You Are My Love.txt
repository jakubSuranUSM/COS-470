You are my love
You are the one I've waited for
You are my love
You are the one that I adore

Oh you are my love
Oh you are my love

You are my day
You changed my winter into spring
You came my way
And then my heart began to sing

Oh you are my love
Oh you are my love

Times were getting lonely
I was thinking only yesterday
Of all the friends I thought I had
But no one came to call on
Never were around to close the door on
Never thought things would get that way

You are my love
You are the one I'll always need
You are my love
For you I'll get down on my knees

Oh you are my love
Oh you are my love

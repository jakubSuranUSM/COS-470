We've been crying now for much to long 
Now we're gonna dance to a different song 
Gonna scream and shout to my dying breath 
Gonna smash it up 'til there's nothing left 

Uuh, Smash it up 
Smash it up, smash it up 

People call me villain it's such a shame 
Maybe it's my clothes must be to blame 
I don't even care if I look a mess 
Don't want to be a sucker like all the rest 

Uuh, Smash it up 
Smash it up, smash it up

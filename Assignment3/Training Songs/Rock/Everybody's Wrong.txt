Listen to my song
It isn't very long
You'll see before I'm gone
That everybody's wrong

Those of us who run
To catch a moment in the sun
Seem to find the when we're done
That we weren't supposed to run

And there's to many words going down
They keep wringing 'gainst the walls with a hollow sound
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you'll see
It ain't payin', you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the times you've fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been bought

And there's to many words going down
They keep wringing 'gainst the walls with a hollow sound
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you'll see
It ain't payin', you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the times you've fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been bought

The ingots are burning red
I'm working time and a half
Tomorrow I'll stay in bed
What a life I lead, what a life

I burn my fingers, why don't you
Laugh with the rest who know it well
I tripped and then I fell for
The beauty of Wynonna

Oh at night I toss and I turn
I try and dial your number
Oh it's changed and God only knows
Where you been since last December

Where you been with that twisted smile
Throwing your mother in the pond
Break him easy when he go down for
The beauty of Wynona

Girls they skip double dutch
I saw you go mama gone
Our prayers don't mean nothin' much
To the heart that cannot be won

And in your wishing well
Right here in my own bed
Break him easy when he go down for
The beauty of Wynonna

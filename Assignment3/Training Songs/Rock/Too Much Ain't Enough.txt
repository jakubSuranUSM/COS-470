You walked in my life, with an angel's smile
How could I have known. The hunger locked inside
We can start a fire, but we can't control the flame
Now I just can't wait, to feel that heat again
And in the middle of the night you cry

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burnin' heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Just seems like yesterday, I was runnin' alone
I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie
Can't get enough, when I'm lyin' my your side
And in the middle of the night I cry

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burnin' heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Shadows movin' on the wall
Slowly we begin to fall
Lyin' in a pool of sweat
Another night I can't forget

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

When you feel the dream is over,
Feel the world is on your shoulders,
And you've lost the strength to carry on.
Even though the walls may crumble,

And you find you always stumble through,
Remember never to surrender to the dark.
'Cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way, The story has to end.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,

You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.

In you're head so many questions, 
The truth is your possession,
The answer lies within your heart.
You will see the doors are open,

If you only dare to hope and you,
Will find the way to fight the fears that kept you down.
'Cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way,
The story has to end.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.

Looking at your situation,
There's so much that you can do,
Now's the time to make your stand.
This is just an observation,
In the end it's up to you, 
The future's in your hands.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.

Lately been thinking about 
What it means to be in a country that's not
All that it should be.
I don't know if I'm all ready to leave.
Do you really want to be in America? 
See, you don't really have to be in America
Somewhere else might be better 
I'm not just talking about weather
But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go
You've got the answer?
Speak up if you know
Maybe it's just that I know
What it means to me to be living a life
Almost thinking free 
I can pretty well choose how I want to be 
Do you really want to be in America? 
See, you don't really have to be in America
Somewhere else might be better
I won't be living here forever
But I don't think that I'd be willing to get up and go
You've got the answer 
Speak up if you know
Who says your life's an easy ride? 
Who says the government's on your side?
Think for yourself
Who cares what they decide . . .

I want more than this bed
I was about to get through with this
It's too short but you got a hold
Of what's wrong in life with me more or less

I feel you let go and I feel you let go
And I feel you let go and I feel you let go

I'm on Telamon bridge
And I'm professing of your lies ever more
I can't fake, can't fake it no more
And I'm too tired to make it so leave it alone

How will these innovations
Impact their entry as a whole
I want more than this bed
So I'll give you my case and then I'll go on home

Breathless drive on a downtown street,
Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat.
Dust that hung from the desert skies -
Run though we'd run, it still burned our eyes.

Oh yes, we may walk on the wild, wild side of life.
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side.
In the shadows of a promise you can take my hand,
And show me a way to understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.
Yes if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you can stand by me,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.

Reckless night in a nameless town,
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound.
A beach that wept, the deserted waves -
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe.

Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me.
But there's a lot I can learn and a lot I'd get to see.
I know you've got my life lying in your hands,
It's up to you to make me understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.
Yes if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you can stand by me,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.

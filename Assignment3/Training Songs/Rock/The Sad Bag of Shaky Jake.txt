When I was just a kid back in Abeline
I had to use a gun, well for my own sake
I shot a man down when I was just eighteen
And from that day they call me Shaky Jake

Shaky Jake, boy, what you gonna do?
Texas Rangers coming after you
Here's the price you pay for one mistake
So get off the streets, it's Shaky Jake

Ma says I was born under bad sign
I was lookin' for the chance to make or break
I cut my teeth on a brandin' iron
I'm the devil's own son, I'm Shaky Jake

Shaky Jake, boy, what you gonna do?
Texas Rangers coming after you
Here's the price you pay for one mistake
So get off the streets, it's Shaky Jake

I keep on the run now
I travel by night
I don't need anyone
But someone, one day, somewhere's gonna see me right

Dig a hole about six foot deep
Pray the Lord my soul to take
I don't want flowers and nobody's gonna weep
Here lies that outlaw, Shaky Jake

Oh Shaky Jake, boy, what you gonna do?
Texas Rangers coming after you
Here's the price you pay for one mistake
So get off the streets, it's Shaky Jake

Shakey Jake
Shakey Jake
Shakey Jake
Shakey Jake
Shakey Jake
Shakey Jake

Oh Shaky Jake, boy, what you gonna do?
Texas Rangers coming after you
Here's the price you pay for one mistake
So get off the streets, it's Shaky Jake

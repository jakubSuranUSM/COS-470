You're my flower, you're my road,
That I try to stay up on,
Even when things ain't your wrong,
Yeah you stayed with me,
You don't stay for what I do,
Sleepless nights I drug you through,
When I say the things I don't mean to,
You stay there with me,
You uncovered this sound-loss soul,
Should have gone baby long ago,
But you shined a light where it was dark,
On my wasted heart,
When I flew, you hold me down,
When I crashed, you were the ground,
When my bones scattered all around,
You stayed with me,
You uncovered this sound-loss soul,
Should have gone baby long ago, but you shined a light where it was dark,
On this wasted heart,
My wasted heart, needed healing and you saved it for me,
I've got a new start,
Rest your eyes in time, these days we'll see what I never could,
Yeah you stayed with me,
You uncovered this sound-loss soul,
Should have gone baby long ago,
But you shined a light where it was dark,
Yeah,
You uncovered this sound-loss soul,
Should have gone baby long ago, but you shined a light where it was dark,
On my wasted heart.

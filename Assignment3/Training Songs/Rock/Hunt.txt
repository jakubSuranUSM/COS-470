One year in five we'll stay alive it's a reason to behold
When it's just another fear to fry within this sacred fold 
I am innocent 
The sweat pours in like an ancient grin and laughs like a suffering one 
It's colder now as my mouth runs out 
How many times are we taken over? 
I am innocent
There's one of us in the middle and there's two now on the end
Do you have the guts to falsify as you stand up on the ledge?
You are innocent 
Sentencing can't save me and I shuffle to the night
The curtains closed 
My substance old 
I am innocent

I pack my suitcase with myself but I'm already gone
I cringed myself with that atoning hell, but I'm already gone!
I cleanse myself with vitamin health but I'm already gone
I saw it rising on the horizon and I saw it fall.
When but Jesus fever is falling all over you,
Believe 
But Jesus fever's fallin' all over
You believers and lovers

In a breath 
In a black bowl I found a broken skull now I'm already gone.
You can write my whole life down in a little book when I'm already gone.
I started shaking and my heart breaking, my belly crawls,
But Jesus fever's fallin' all over
You believers and lovers

When I'm a ghost, I see no reason to run,
When I'm already gone!
If it wasn't taped you could escape this song,
But I'm already gone

Early in the evenin',
Just about supper time,
Over by the court house
They're starting to unwind.

Four kids on the corner,
Trying to bring you up.
Willy picks a tune out,
And he blows it on the harp.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

Rooster hits the washboard
And people just got smile,
Blinky thumps the gut bass,
And solos for a while.
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out
On his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance
And doubles on kazoo.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

You don't need a penny,
Just to hang around,
But if you've got a nickel,
Won't you lay your money down?

Over on the corner
There's a happy noise.
People come from all around
To watch the magic boy.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

Down on the corner
Out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playin'
Bring a nickel
Tap your feet.

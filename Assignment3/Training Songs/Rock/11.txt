Here in this empty room
The memory still remains
You may never learn
You make the same mistakes again

One by one
You count them one by one

Days that were lost and found
The memory still remains
Here in this empty room
You count them one by one

One by one
You count them one by one

Here in this empty room
You count them one by one

Oh hoh
Oh hoh

One by one
You count them one by one
One by one
You count them one by one

Here in this empty room
The memory still remains
And you never learn
You make the same mistake again
Those days are lost and found
The memories will still remain
The memories will remain
You make the same mistake again

One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one

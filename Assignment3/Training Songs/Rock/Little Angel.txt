Hear it calling from afar
A gentle voice brings words unspoken

Little angel learned to fly
But she fell down, her wings were broken
Every day she dies insied
Can't close her eyes and shut it out
Little angel hear her cry
She's calling you, her heart is broken
Is it you? Is it you? You...

Never let the fire burn out
That spark of hope is all she's got

Little angel tried to fly
But she fell down, her wings are broken
Is it you?

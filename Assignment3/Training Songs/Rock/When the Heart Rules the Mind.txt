Mother protect me, protect me from myself
Lately I can't tell, who really are my friends
Burning the candle, the candle at both ends
Through crowds, across floors
Each night I just pretend

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance forget the past

Watching the actor, that takes the stage by storm
Stealing the limelight, while we're in the wings
Sometimes the hero, must play the underdog
But I don't feel the same
I must have everything

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance forget the past

Seasons will change
You must move on
Follow your dream

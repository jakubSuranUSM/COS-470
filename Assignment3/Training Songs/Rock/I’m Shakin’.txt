When ya touch my hand 
An' talk sweet talk 
I got a knockin' in my knees 
And a wobble in my walk 

I'm tremblin' 
And I'm shakin' 

A-when ya take me in your arms 
To talk romance 
My heart starts doin' the St. Vitas dance 

An' I'm pantin' 
An' I'm shakin' 

Early in the mornin' time 
Late in the middle of the night 
Whenever this chill comes over me 
I wanna hug you with all-a my might, ay-ay 

An' I'm sweatin' 
An' I'm shakin' 

A chill an a fever 
So I've been told 
Makes your head spin around 
An' your feet run cold 

I got fever 
An' I'm shakin' 

Feel like I been run through the mill 
I can't move around an' I can't stand still 

I'm so jittery 
An' I'm shakin' 

Samson was a mighty good man 
Strongest in his day 
Then along came Delilah an' clipped his wig 
An' it looks like you took me 
The same old way 

So, I'm 'noy-vous' 
An' I'm shakin' 

Well, a storm rocks a ship on a sea 
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree 
I'm like a nervous wreck 
I'm all shook up 
And that's what you are doin' to me 

'Cause I'm jumpin' 
An' I'm shakin' 
An' I'm jumpin' 
An' I'm shakin' 

Sha-aaaa-kin' 
Shakin', shakin', shakin' 
Shakin', um-mmm-mmm 
I'm shakin'

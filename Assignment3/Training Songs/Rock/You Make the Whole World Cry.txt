Young thing - saw it
And calls his brother
And brother's angry
You make the whole world cry
You can't tell me
I rid my secret
You can't own me
You make the whole world cry
Young thing downing
And it maybe hurting
And it maybe the best day you ever had
And I've gone courting
And I'm just chasing
But baby, you make the whole world cry
Yes, you make the world cry
I tell you honestly
Yeah, I tell you honestly
So we go dancing
And you start laughing
And I start choosing
A room to hide in
But I'm not hiding
And I'm not running, anymore
So it's so good
And it's so bad
And it's walk
To the end of you're so sure of yourself
Baby you make the whole world cry
Yeah, you make the whole world cry
Yeah, you make the whole world cry
Yeah, you make the whole world cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

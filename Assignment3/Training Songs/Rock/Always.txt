The life you had known
The pain that you show
I count all of the times you choke
The last miracle
The emptiness of hope
When all you want is to be a stranger

The lives you recall
The things that you stole
The push backwards that makes you fall
The scars that you show
The lover that you hold
Is no more than a ghost

And I've seen the cold and the rain
And I pushed you back

Always

Don't you need it in the worst way?
Control, I need it in the worst way, babe
But if you ever come back, if you ever come back
I will let you

Always

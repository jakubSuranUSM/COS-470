I know you'd rather talk instead about the
Things inside your head, but everything, everything,
That I overheard, tells me you just don't have the words. 
Cause you never learned to speak the language
Of life, and here you are a grown man who can't talk
To his wife. And the children you don't understand.
You think you're come on pretty far, still
Got the job, the house and the car. But there's one
Thing, one thing that you never get -a grip on life?
Sweet alphabet. Cause you never learned to speak the
Language of life, and here you are a grown man who
Can't talk to his wife.
And when things get out of hand, and the kids you
Don't understand, love is foreign land. Over words
You have no command, you have no command
But it's not that you don't care
Admit it baby,
And you're half way there. Cause you know, you know
That you feel much more than you ever have the words for.
Cause you never learned to speak the language of life,
And here you are a grown man who can't talk to his wife,
And the children you just don't understand.

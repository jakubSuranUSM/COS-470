Got an angel on the stairs
As if you'd even care
When the lights are up
And the sun had nearly gone, down

Did you see him on the street
Did you pass him at your feet
Did you think at all
How dare they even look me in the eye

And he loves the girls
And he loves the boys
Gonna make
Twenty dollars before the weekend's over

So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the king of New Orleans

Got a ticket to a show
Did you see him take a blow
When the drunk one said
Cat Stevens was the greatest singer

Did you kick him in the head
Did you see the blood run down
Did you laugh at all
When the people walked right by and said aloud
Gutter punks, you're all the same
Gonna make
Twenty dollars 'fore the weekend's over

So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the king of New Orleans

Set him up
Let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the King of New Orleans

Radio in my head
Radio in my car
Goin' down again
He's goin' down, again

Any way you look
Any way you talk it over
It's easier
To let it slip out of your mind

But it rips your heart out
Then it kicks your head in
Would ya you give him one more chance
Try and see the beauty in his world

All the way in on my hands
In on my feet and shoulders
Gonna make
Twenty dollars before the weekends over

So set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the king of New Orleans

Set him up
Then let him fall
Turn him over in your hands
God save the king of New Orleans
Yeah

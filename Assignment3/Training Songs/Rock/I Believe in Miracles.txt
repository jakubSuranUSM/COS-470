I used to be on an endless run;
Believed in miracles 'cause I'm one.
I've been blessed with the power to survive;
After all these years I'm still alive.
I'm out here kickin' with the band;
Oh I'm no longer a solitary man.
Every day my time runs out.
Lived like a fool, that's what I was about.

Oh I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh-oh-oh, I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you

Tattooed your name on my arm;
I always said my girl's a good luck charm.
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live

Oh I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh-oh-oh, I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you

I close my eyes and think how it might be
The future's here today
It's not too late
It's not too late, no!

Oh I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you
Oh-oh-oh, I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world for me and you, you, you...

You can't play with feelings, the way you sometimes do 
and hide your true intentions, behind those eyes so blue 
Always pretending, you're nobody's fool 
Now until forever, the world was made for you 

You cheat, you lie 
you hurt, my pride 
You fake desire 
upset my life 
You fly solo, make up your own rule 
You break your word 
as if I don't know 

Whisper in a crowd 
just like a silent scream 
Ah ah ah ah, no one, will hear 
Your cry of fear 

You made your seven wishes 
none of them came true 
Like your expectations 
you gotta face the truth

In truth we never gave up
On the philosopher's stone
I guess anything you wanna do
You gotta do it on your own

For the love of you
For the love of me
For the love of everyone
Who's yet to be free

Borders are scars on the face of the planet
So heal away my alchemy man
Even atheist holds up the candle
We rise again
We rise again

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future
We rise again

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future
We rise again

Las fronteras dividen, solo crean cicatrices
Hay gente que te engaña y se roba tus raíces
Cuando uno es guerrero, uno no puede rendirse
No dejes que tu dignidad nadie la pise

Borders are scars on the face of the planet
So heal away my alchemy man
When even atheist holds up the candle
We rise again
We rise again

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future
We rise again

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future
We rise again

Not enough not enough
It's not enough not enough
When even atheist holds up the candle
We rise again
We rise again

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future

With a fist full of heart
And relics of future
Mama we rise again

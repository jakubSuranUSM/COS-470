Air full of feathers
Fluttering distant laughter
Air full of signs & strange magic
Planets aligned in warning
Trap door sprung beneath me
And I'm falling
But I'm rising..
Downwards into blue sky
I'm rising

Downwards into blue sky
Re-entering the earth
Comet's tail behind me
Signaling a birth
The northern lights, all burning
Hot & cold at the same time
My spirit, white & liquid
And I have learned & I am learning
But I'm rising
Downwards into blue sky
I'm rising
Downwards into blue sky

I am the other half
And you are what I am for
I won't lie to you or hurt you
I'm not like that anymore

I am with you all the time now
One soul. One mind. One heart.
The other half cannot be parted
From the other half
From the other half

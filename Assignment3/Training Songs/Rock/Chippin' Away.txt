Are you ready?
Thumbs are up
One, two, three, four
Hey mister take a load off let me explain

I'm not hidin' from you carry the blame
Have yourself a good look from the Saskatoon plain
Nothing's that clear in life I swear by the claim
I rack my conscience for the will to achieve

I could lie, die, cry and to this day not receive
'Cause I'm not steady like Eddy
I may not smile for awhile
Got a little of the devil and a mean streak
'Cause I hope to one day be complete

In the meantime, yes
We're just chippin' away?
Eh, got 'ole Michael Hehir playin' on guitar
Sometimes we go for months
Not talk at all
No crumblin' wall here

The journey's come too far
'O rocket spaceship
Take us to the stars
They're building castles

Straight up to the sky
But the Empire States
Still looks to me like it's high
(I'm not steady like Eddy
I may not smile for awhile
Got a little of the devil, and a mean streak)

'Cause I hope to one day be complete
In the meantime, yes
We're just chippin' away?
O yea
(I'm not steady like Eddy
I may not smile for awhile)
Got a little of the devil and a mean streak
I hope to one day be complete, yea
I'm not steady like Eddy, 'o no
And I may not smile for awhile
Got a little of the devil and a mean streak, yea
I hope to one day be complete

God I'm not steady like Eddy, 'o no
I may not smile for awhile
God bless the poor man, who knows what he seeks
Cause I hope to one day be complete
In the meantime, yes (yoa)
We're just chippin' away
O-o, (yoa)
O-o
O-o.
"Ha, ha, I'm a bastard." (spoken)

Like walkin' on the moon was such a good feeling 
Lyin' in bed and I'm staring at the ceiling 
Can't wake up on Monday morning 
Thinkin' about what makes me yawn and 

As I look outside it's raining, pouring 
Cats and dogs I want to do no more an' 
When I gotta get up an get out my bed 
Rather sleep in late and smoke a be	

Load instead 
'Cause the harder you try 
Less you succeed 
Don't try at all and get everything you need 

'Cause the harder you fall 
More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 
'Cause you best not step on me 

I said the harder you try 
Less you succeed 
Don't try at all and get everything you need 
'Cause the harder you fall 

More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 
'Cause you best not step on me 
'Cause if you're ugly on the outside 

It don't matter 
If you're beauty on the inside 
It overpowers 
If the beauty on the outside 

It won't matter 
If you're ugly on the inside 
Baby don't want it 
And if you the type of person getting no recognition 

Reach inside your pockets 
And then all your money missin' an' 
You want to shoot your guns 
But you got no ammunition 

Open up your mind and find 
It's time to take a listen 
The harder you try 
Less you succeed 

Don't try at all and get everything you need 
'Cause the harder you fall 
More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 

'Cause you best not step on me 
I said the harder you try 
Less you succeed 
Don't try at all and get everything you need 

'Cause the harder you fall 
More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 
'Cause you best not step on me 

It's always hard when you're working for the other man 
Tyrin' to make a dollar with the palms of my empty hand 
It seems so easily 
But it never seems to last long 

Thinkin' thatcha got it for a minute then a minute's gone 
The harder you try 
Less you succeed 
Don't try at all and get everything you need 

'Cause the harder you fall 
More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 
'Cause you best not step on me 

I said the harder you try 
Less you succeed 
Don't try at all and get everything you need 
'Cause the harder you fall 

More it's gon' bleed 
Watch where you steppin' 
'Cause you best not step on me

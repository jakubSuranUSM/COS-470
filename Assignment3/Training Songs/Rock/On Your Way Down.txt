Sunrise, sunset
Since the beginning, it hasn't changed yet
People fly high, begin to loose sight
But you can't see very clearly, when you're in flight

Well it's high time (backing vocals)
That you find
The same people that you must use on your way up
You might meet up (pause) on your way down

Vintage wines from the year sixty two
Is your thing, is your thing
(Backing vocals) is your thing, is your thing
What pleases you
Not to be found for you cross town
The thing is for other girls just to have you around

Well it's high time
That you find
The same dudes that you must use on your way up
You might meet up (pause) on your way down

(Yeah) You feel the sunrise, set for you
But the same sunrise is step and shine, for the old folks due
I don't mind, your turn around
I myself would even like for a little higher ground

It's high time (backing vocals)
That you find Mr G
The same people you work hard on your way up
You might meet up (pause) on your way down

(Rollin' over)
Goodbye sunshine, I'm on my way
I'll be long time gone by the break of day
Tell everyone that I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin' gonna stop me

(Rollin' over)
(Rollin' over) save all your lovin' till I get home
To the sweetest lovin' sunshine that I've ever known
Tell everybody I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin' gonna stop me

Roll
Rollin' over, shak-do-way
Wah-wah-doo, yeah-yeah-yeah (rollin' over)
Shak-do-way
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Shak-do-way
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Shak-do-way
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Shak-do-way
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Shak-do-way

Little by little 
My heart grieves
Little by little 
I call your name
Little by little 
My tears flow
Little by little 
Everything changes

Little by little 
The time goes
Little by little 
The days pass by 
Little by little 
The air clears 
Little by little 
I can breathe again 
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again

Back at the mirror 
Your good friend
Talk to the mirror 
Play out the game
Stop in the middle, 
I stop then
Look at the winner 
And the price you pay

Cold was the winter
I trembled
Long was the fall
That had no end
Now little by little 
The air clears
Little by little I can breathe 
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again

Call your name
Call your name
Call your name
Call your name
Everything changes 
Everything changes
I call your name oh
I can breathe again
I can breathe again

Waiting in the dark, darkness
Facing the consequences of my actions
Then I saw you
Glowing brighter than the ?
Mystery embedded in your golden eyes

Beauty, love me
Take me further than I've been waiting for you
Sunflower, to feel me 
Wandered farther than before 
Mystery embedded in your flawless touch

You're the only one, 
You're the only one
You're the only one, 
You're the only one

Don't question my love sent from above
You're the only one, 
You're the only one
You're the only one, 
You're the only one, I love
You're the only one

Well you started by yourself

and then you lived with someone else
But you can't go back the way it was before
And I can see it in the eyes
I just know when things aren't right
And nothing seems to matter anymore.

It doesn't matter anymore (x3)

Well how does it feel when you're on your own their now,
How does it feel when I'm on my own terms now,
Goin all the way and I don't care what you say,
No way, no way, no way.

Well you started out as one
Another one made twice the fun,
But you tried to do some digging and got buried,
Well its happened twice before
And you know it'll happen more,
Now I can't feel my legs like I'm being carried.

It doesn't matter if I
Try counting out on all my five fingers
Where I'm supposed to go
I tried hanging round with all the dead ringers
People I used to know.

Well how does it feel when you're on your own their now,
How does it feel when I'm on my own terms now,
Goin all the way and I don't care what you say.

'cause don't you know that ooh
I've started again, started again
And if I didn't have you
I'd have to pretend, have to pretend.
When nothing is right where do I go
And what do I say and who do I know

It doesn't matter anymore (x3)

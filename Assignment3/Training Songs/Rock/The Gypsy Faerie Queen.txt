I'm known by many different names
My good friend Will
Calls me Puck and Robin Goodfellow
I follow the gypsy faerie queen
I follow the gypsy faerie queen

She walks the length and breadth of England
Singing her song, using her wand
To help and heal the land
And the creatures on it
She's dressed in rags of moleskin
And wears a crown of rowan berries on her brow

And I follow, follow, follow
The gypsy faerie queen
We exist, exist, exist
In the twilight in-between

She bears a blackthorn staff
To help her in her walking
I only listen to her sing
But I never hear her talking
Anymore
Though once she did
Though once she did

And I follow, follow, follow
My gypsy faerie queen

We exist, exist, exist
In the twilight in-between

And I follow, follow, follow
My gypsy faerie queen

We exist, exist, exist
In the country in-between

Me and my gypsy queen

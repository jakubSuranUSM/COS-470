Well, the moon I know, in the town I live, is steady as she waits.
It seems as though she yearns for me and calls me by my name.
Sometimes she says come to me, kiss me while it's late.
And other nights she's just hanging with the stars.

And I've seen her waiting from all her mistakes
And what if he never comes when you call?

And, "Hey, hey it's alright," she says,
"Once upon a time I lived a perfect night.
Hey, hey in another life," she says,
"In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago."

"Don't look back," I heard a voice, in velvet I couldn't see.
The pictures then were black and white, and the details were in between.
I heard about a woman once, who did everything ever asked of her.
She died last week and her last words were, "It wasn't worth it."

And I've seen her patience through all her mistakes
And who's gonna save you now?

And, "Hey, hey it's alright," she says,
"Once upon a time I lived a perfect night.
Hey, hey in another life," she says,
"In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago."

"Hey, it's alright," she says,
"Once upon a time I lived a perfect night.
Hey, hey in another life," she says,
"In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago."

"Hey, hey it's alright," she says.
"Hey, in another life," she says.

Way back when, when we became friends, I was you, you were my defense.
And quiet was the night.
You showed me that bridge, and it brought you home.
You told me about it and I never let it go,
And I guess I might've been doing the same.
Anyhow, quiet was the night.

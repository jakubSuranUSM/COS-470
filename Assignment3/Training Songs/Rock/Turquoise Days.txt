Just when the thought occurs
The panic will pass
And the smell of the fields
Never lasts
Put your faith in those
Crimson nights
Set sail in those
Turquoise days
We've got a problem
Come on over
We got a problem
Come on over

It's not for glory
It's not for honor
Just something
Someone said
It's not for love
It's not for war
Just hands clasped together
It's not for living
It's not for hunger
Just lips locked tight
It's not rebellion
It's not suffering
It's just the way it is
And my pistols packed 
And my God goes with me
I fell easy
And I want it
And I need it
And I've got it
It's not for this
It's not for that 
It's not any of it
Did you say knowledge?
Did you say prayer?
Did you say anything?
If not for good
If not for better
If not the way it is

Just when the thought occurs
The panic will pass
And the smell of the fields
Never lasts
We'll place our faith in those
Crimson nights
Set sail in those
Turquoise days
Place your faith in those
Crimson nights
Set sail in those
Turquoise days
You've got a problem?
Come on over
You've got a problem?
Come on overNow I think I know just what to say....

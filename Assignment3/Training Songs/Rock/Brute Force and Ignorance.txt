Brute Force and Ignorance, 
Just hit town, 
Looking like survivors, 
From the Lost and Found. 
Brute Force and Ignorance, 
Have come to play, 
A one-night stand at eight o`clock, 
Then they`ll be on their way. 
  
This old town`s exploding, 
And the mayor`s uptight, 
He`d like to make it to the show, 
But he knows it`s not his night. 

He`s got to be beholding, 
To his legal spouse, 
But she`s put the thumbscrews on him, 
And snuck out of the house. 
  
There she goes. 
  
The picture on the poster, 
Raised an eyebrow or two, 
At fifty-five to seven, 
Lord, you should`ve seen the queue. 

City slick and country hick, 
They came one and all, 
The traffic-light girl and the downhome kids, 
Assembled in the hall. 
  
Brute Force and Ignorance, 
Yes, that`s the name, 
The young folks gonna miss them, 
Now they`ve gone away. 

Well, the show got so crazy, 
Today they took the billboard down, 
I`ll never forget the scene last night, 
When the band was escorted out of town. 

This little town`s back in slow motion, 
I`m sad to say, 
After the confusion, 
It`ll never be the same. 

Well, I took a walk down Main Street, 
Just to pass the time, 
And I could hear that music, 
Still rolling through my mind. 
  
Brute Force and Ignorance, 
They sure hit town, 
And if you want to find them, buddy, 
They`re down at the Lost and Found.

She gave herself to Jesus
She gave it all to Him
I can't take it anymore
Life is too damn grim
She tore it all to pieces
Swept it in a pile
Lit it with a kitchen match
Praying all the while
We could get up early
Get into my car
Drive on down to trestle 8
It isn't all that far
You jump from the left side
I'll jump from the right
Last one to the bottom 
Has to buy the beer tonight
She was my sunshine
My uncloudy day
Standing on a highway
Pants around my knees
I'd write her name out on the road
But I can't piss Denise
She gave herself to Jesus
She gave it all to Him
I can't take it anymore
Life is too damn grim
She was my sunshine
My uncloudy day
My last high hope
Why'd she have to go

Well I saw her just as I was leaving
Crossing in between the cars
Sometimes seeing is just not believing
Like a spaceship coming down from mars

Total attraction you're driving me insane a chain reaction
Baby, tell me what's your name baby, what's your name
Yeah, you know I'm not that underhanded
But I didn't know what else to do
So I told her that the ships had landed
And I told her "I'll take care of you"

Total attraction you're driving me insane a chain reaction
Baby, tell me what's your name baby, what's your name?
Come on girl, what's your name?

Oh, look out

Well, I know you wouldn't understand it
Didn't know what I should say or do
And it wasn't quite the way I planned it
But I had to find a way to you

Total attraction you're driving me insane a chain reaction
And baby, tell me what's your name?

Baby, what's your name, baby, what's your name?

Cuma westas chickadee
Have a housemaid on your knee
Eat an apple ev'ry day
An onion keeps ev'ryone away

Have an athlete on your feet
Have a lovesmell on your sheet
Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to keep away

He'll tell you
Thanks for the memory
Thanks for it all
Wham bam thank you ma'm
Thanks for the ball

Have a burgular alarm
Have a milkmaid on your farm
Can you raise a ballyhoo
If only there's nothing else to do

Have some butter with your fly
They said bananas could get you high
Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to earn his pay

He'll tell you
Thanks for the memory
Thanks for it all
Wham bam thank you ma'm
Thank for the ball

Break

Cuma westas chickadee
Tap the water on your knee
Eat an apple ev'ry day
The doctor has got to keep away

[Repeat: x2]
He'll tell you 
Thanks for the memory
Thanks for it all
Wham bam thank you ma'am
Thank for the ball

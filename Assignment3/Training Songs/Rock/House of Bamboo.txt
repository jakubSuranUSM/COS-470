Number fifty-four, 
The house with the bamboo door, 
Bamboo roof and bamboo walls, 
They've even got a bamboo floor! 

You must get to know Soho Joe, 
He runs an Expresso, 
Called the House of Bamboo. 

It's a made of sticks. 
Sticks and bricks, 
But you can get your kicks 
In the house of bamboo. 

Well in this casino, you can drink a chino, 
And it's gotcha swingin' to the cha cha 
Dance the bolero in a sombrero. 
Shake like a snake! 

You wanna stop in when the cats are hoppin'. 
Let your two feet move-a to the big beat; 
Pick yourself a kitten and listen to a platter 
That rocks the juke-box! 

I'm-a telling you, when you're blue, 
Well there's a lot to do 
In the House Of Bamboo.

No stranger, No danger in your home.
It's walking, It's talking on it's own.
No stranger, No danger in your home.
It's walking, It's talking on it's own.

One staring eye with no sight or feature
It only winks, when there's time to think.
It tells you nothing, but still your teacher.
And still you take it, It makes you hate it,
Takes care that you're always there.

REPEAT.....

It makes you safe moving with protection.
A mind for you trying very hard.
And still you can't make the disconnection.
Does all it's told to,tells what it wants to,
Says all that you have to know.

REPEAT.....

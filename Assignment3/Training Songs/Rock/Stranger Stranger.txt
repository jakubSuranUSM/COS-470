There's a crazy moon, a crazy sky, looking down on me
I've been losing track of time
It's been the hardest day, the longest night i've ever spent alone
I can't get you off my mind

You know what i've been missing, do i really have to say
We talk but you don't listen, it's not always been that way, no... she's a

[Chorus]
Stranger, stranger - you're not the girl i knew, will you ever be the same
You act like a stranger, stranger - tell me it ain't true
Won't you please explain, why you're so strange

In the morning gloom, this empty room, i can see your face
When i look again, you're gone
Your memory, so close to me, it leaves a trace
Won't you tell me what went wrong

No sign, no words, no warning, we can never be the same, no
When you walked out that morning, you know you left nothing but the blame

I know that you're a...

[Chorus]

You're a...

[Chorus: x2]

Stranger, stranger - you're not the girl i knew, will you ever be the same
You act like a stranger, stranger - tell me it ain't true
Won't you please explain, why you're so strange

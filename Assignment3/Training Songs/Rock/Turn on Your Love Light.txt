Without a warning you broke my heart you took it darling and you tore it apart
You left me standing in the dark crying you said your love for me was dying
I'm begging you baby baby please I'm begging you baby baby please
Turn on your lights let it shine on me turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine shine let it shine
I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darling to make things alright
Come on baby come on please come on baby baby please
Turn on your lights let it shine on me turn on your love light let it shine on me
A little bit higher little bit higher just a little bit higher a little bit higher

Come on baby baby please turn on your lights and let it shine on Jerry Lee woo
Come on baby I'm feeling alright turn on your lights mama and I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright
I'm glad I've got you back baby
Oh I'm feeling alright in the middle of the night
Well I'm glad baby one I'm packed baby two I'm packed baby two I'm packed baby
I'm packed baby woo I'm stand up I'm feeling alright

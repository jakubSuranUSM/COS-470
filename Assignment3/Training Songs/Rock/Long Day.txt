It's sitting by the overcoat
The second shelf, the note she wrote
That I can't bring myself to throw away
And also
Reach she said for no one else but you
'Cause you won't turn away
When someone else is gone

I'm sorry 'bout the attitude
I need to give when I'm with you
But no one else would take this shit from me
And I'm so
Terrified of no one else but me
I'm here all the time
I won't go away

It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Hey it's me, and I can't get myself to go away
Oh God, I shouldn't feel this way now

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right

Well I'm surprised if you'd believe
In anything that comes from me
I didn't hear from you or from someone else
And you're so set in life man, a pisser they're waiting
Too damn bad you get so far so fast
So what, so long

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right

Oh, ain't that right

It's me, yeah well I can't myself to go away
Hey, well it's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way, now

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Well, reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
Reach down your hand in your pocket 
Well, reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
Oh, ain't that right
Well, ain't that right, right, right on, shut up
Right, right, right on, right on, shut up
Come on

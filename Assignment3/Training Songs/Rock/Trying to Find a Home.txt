Still trying to find a reason 
Still trying to find a home 
Just some place to spread my things in 
A place from where I can run 
Came from so far so silent 
You saw the stars above 
Your smiling faces cheer up (?) 
Take what we never had 

[Chorus]
The lowered sun 
Brings another memory 
I held in my head 
So I can see 
Every color you were wearing 
Every color in your eyes 
Came from far so silent 
You saw the stars above 
Your smiling faces cheer up (?) 
Take what we never had 
And I hear you whisper 
Where are you?
And I see my hand 
Upon your skin 
I can feel me searching for you 
Still trying to find a home 
And there'll come a time 
When everything's so tough (?) 
Everything's apart 
Trying to find a home 
We're so near (?) 
We're so apart

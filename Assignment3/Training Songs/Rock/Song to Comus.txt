Bright the sunlight summer day Comus wakes he starts to play
Virgin fair smiles so sweet Comus' heart begins to beat
Rise up Comus sing your song bewitch the maiden the day is long
Cast your spell sweet music crack her virtuous shell
Enchanted damsel curious ear Comus music dispel all fear
Dainty feet they skip so light Comus laughs soon comes the night
Through the forest dark and deep she follows Comus' dancing feet
He moves away the mossy stone reveals the cave Comus' home
Comus glare, Comus glare, Comus bare,
Comus rape, Comus break sweet young virgin's virtue take
Naked flesh flowing hair her terror screams they cut the air

Comes the sunlight summer day Comus wakes he starts to play
He starts to play he starts to play he starts to play
Aah
Chastity chaser virile for the virgin's virtue
Excite her exciter you better go before you bleed and he hurts you
He chased the chaste you better leave if you value your virtue

All right now
Hey aah hey aah hey aah hey aaah

Virgin fair smiles so sweet Comus' heart begins to beat
Enchanted damsel curious ear Comus music dispel all fear
Through the forest dark she follow Comus' dancing feet
He moves away the mossy stone reveals the cave Comus' home
Misty air, Comus glare, Comus bare
All right now

Chastity chaser virile for the virgin's virtue
Excite her exciter you better go before you bleed and he hurts you
He chased the chaste you better leave if you value your virtue

Hymen hunter, hands of steel, crack you open and your red flesh peel
Pain procurer, eyes of fire pierce your womb and push still higher
Comus rape, Comus break sweet young virgin's virtue take
Naked flesh flowing hair her terror screams they cut the air

Comes the sunlight summer day Comus wakes he starts to play
He starts to play he starts to play he starts to play

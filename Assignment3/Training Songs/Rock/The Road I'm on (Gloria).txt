It's a long and a dusty road, it's a hot and a heavy load
Folks I meet, they aren't always kind
Some are bad, some are good, some just do the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound

I had a friend from home, he started out to roam
I hear that he's out by Frisco bay
Sometimes when I drink a few, his voice comes singing through
Iâ€™m goin' out there, gonna see him some old day

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound

I had a girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
I believe that I loved her to my soul
But I was too blind to see, she was driftin' away from me
One day she left me out in the cold

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound

Bring the action to this table baby, I'm rich and able baby
So come on and let me show you baby, just let me hold you baby

So, can't you see, the story of you is the story of me, the story of me
Two unlucky souls doin' what they do ‘cause they can't stay hungry

I can't let you go now, though I want to, though I need to
I can't let you slow down, though you want to, though you need to
I can't let you go now, though I want to, though I need to
I can't let you slow down, though you want to, though you need to

Bring the action to this table baby, I'm very able baby
Crazy satisfaction baby, I'm sexy action baby

So, can't you see, the story of you is the story of me, the story of me
Two unlucky souls doin' what they do cause they can't stay hungry

I can't let you go now, though I want to, though I need to…

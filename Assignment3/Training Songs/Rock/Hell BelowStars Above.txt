Never heard you say goodbye 
Read your letter it made me cry 
Saw you with another guy 
Never want to waste your time 
Your in love your in love 
Hell below me, stars above 

Saw you with another man 
Feathered hair and tall and tan 
Treat him like I know you can 
Stroke his cheek and hold his hand 

Your in love your in love 
Hell below me, stars above 

Stars above me are shining down 
Nothing ever gonna hurt me now 
And I slip away happy as a clam 

Stars above me are smiling now 
Ever since you put me down 
And I close my eyes 
And I can't see your face.

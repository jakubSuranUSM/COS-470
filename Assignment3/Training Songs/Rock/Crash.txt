I put my best foot first and it got burnt
Communication always hurts
I've got myself so deep inside a hole
I taste the air go thin as I get old, as I get old
I don't think so

CHORUS:
She's my hands, she's my hands
Picks me up when I crash down
Build me wings so I can glide
She's my novocaine ride

Pick up the pieces of my world
Glue thme together, I wish I could
I can't believe it as the picture fades
Just like a TV, but the sound remains
I don't think so, no, I don't think so

CHORUS

Feel it as I shake
Shatter illusions fade
Taste my bitter tears
Cut my heart with shears

I don't think so, I don't think so

CHORUS

That's the way you go 
This city is so cold
And I'm, I'm so sold 
That's why I'm know

I said hit it
Born to lose, born to lose, born to lose
Oh baby I'm born too loose 

Nothing to do
I've nothing to say
Only one thing that I want
It's the only way

I said hit it
Born to lose
I said hit it
Born to lose
I said hit it
Born to lose
Oh baby I'm born too loose
Oh baby I'm born too loose 

Living in a jungle 
It ain't so hard
Living in the city
It will eat out, eat out your heart
I said hit it
Born to lose
I said hit it
Born to lose
I said hit it
Born to lose

Baby I'm born too loose
Oh baby I'm born too loose
Oh baby I'm born too loose
Oh baby I'm born to ...

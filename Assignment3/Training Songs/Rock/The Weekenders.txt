There was that whole weird thing with the horses.
I think they know exactly what happened.
I don't think it needs any explaining.
I'm pretty sure I wasn't your first choice.
I think I was the last one remaining.
I wish we hadn't gone and destroyed it.
'Cause I was thinking we could pull another weekender.
If you've still got a little bit of clairvoyance.

I remember the metal bar.
I remember the reservoir.
You could say our paths have crossed before.

So if it has to be a secret.
Then I guess that I can deal with it.
You and I both know it's a negative thing.
In the end only the girls know the whole truth.

There were a couple pretty crass propositions.
There were some bugs in the bars.
There was a kid camped out by the coat check.
She said the theme of this party is the industrial age.
You came in dressed like a train wreck.

I remember the OTB.
The five second delivery.
You could say our paths have crossed before.

So if it has to be a secret.
Then I guess that I can deal with it.
God only knows it's not always a positive thing.
To see a few seconds into the future

Let me tell you something

Have you seen her
One stray cat
She's not the same girl
Running with the pack

Running through the night
Broken glass in her way
One thing on her mind
Nothing left to say
Cat's eyes
On the highway
On the highway
On the highway

Nothing is for certain
No reason to stay
No reason to stay
?
She's gone away
She's gone away

Running through the night
Broken glass in her way
One thing on her mind
Nothing left to say
Lying on her side
Broken glass in her way
One thing on her mind
No reason to stay
(Cat's eyes)
No reason to stay

On the highway
On the highway
On the highway
On the highway

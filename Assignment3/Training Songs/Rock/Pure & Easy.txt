There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breathe rippling by
The note is eternal
I hear it, it sees me
Forever we blend as forever we die

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

As people a**emble
civilization is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Gas on the hillside
 Oil in the tea cup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dream
And our love is enough to knock down any wall
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
In us all

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Today is the day the sound curdles mountains
Flowing and blowing each man in its wake
Destroying itself in the end with vibration
There's nothing on earth it's challenge can take
Excepting one note

Excepting one note pure and easy
Playing so free like breath rippling by

Excepting one note
Excepting one note
Excepting one note, pure and easy
Excepting one note, pure and easy
(repeated)

There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen

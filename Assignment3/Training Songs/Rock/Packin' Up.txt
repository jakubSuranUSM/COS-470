I'm packin' packin'
I'm packin' up got enough
This woman talk I took to much
I'm packin' up gonna leave this woman here

She like to cook beans without no meat
The rice she cooked is tears like grease
She irons my cloths and binds them up 
I'm tellin' you people I've got enough
Packin' up got enough
I'm packin' up gonna leave this woman here

She sleeps so much she leaves track of the day
The only time she woke is when I get my pay
When I get some money she goes downtown
Comes back callin' me all kinda clown
I'm packin' up got enough
I'm packin' up gonna leave this woman here

Sometimes she loved me sometimes she's gone
Sometimes she kissed me sometimes she won't
I ain't was she comin' from 
She tell me where she's goin'
I ain't so was she do she leave me alone
I'm packin' up got enough
I'm packin' up gonna leave this woman here

Oh I'm packin' up got enough - got enough
This woman talk I took to much
I'm packin' up gonna leave this woman here
Oh yes I'm packin' up I got enough
This woman talk I took

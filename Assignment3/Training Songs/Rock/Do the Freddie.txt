Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, Gonna do the Freddie
Do the Freddie
There's a dance that crossing the nation

Causing more than a great sensation
You flip your wings just like a bird
I know it sounds crazy
But you gotta take my word

You wave your hands up to the sky
Kick your legs out to the side
Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, we're gonna do the Freddie

Better do the dance every day or night
If you want to learn to do it right
It's good to the second hop around
Your heart starts pounding like it's upside down

Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, we're gonna do the Freddie
are mums and brothers, sisters and ya daddio
Soon as you learn the Freddie

Other dances gotta go oh oh

Do it in your house and down at school
Do it with the hippies and with the fools
Do this dance every day and night

If you want to learn to do it right
You gotta wave your hands up to the sky
Kick your legs out to the side
Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie

Are you ready, get ready Freddie
Kick your legs out to the side
Gonna do the Freddie
Kick your legs up high

Gonna do the Freddie...fade

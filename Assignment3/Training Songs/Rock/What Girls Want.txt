I met her somewhere in the corner of my eye
I keep her somehow in the back of my mind
It wasn't long ago I tried to show her my affection
She turned, looked at me and ran in the other direction

I want love, I want drugs, I want sex and affection
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
Rod Stewart's hair and Keith Richards' stagger

That's what girls want
That's what girls want
That's what girls want

So I took her back home to my studio apartment
And that's where I told her exactly what my heart meant
I started to think, she threw it back in my face
I poured her a drink, she said let's get out of this place

I want love, I want drugs, I want sex and affection
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
Rod Stewart's hair and Keith Richards' stagger

That's what girls want
That's what girls want
That's what girls want
That's what girls want

That's what girls want
That's what girls want
That's what girls want
That's what girls want

She came around and moved in three weeks later
We got a one room shack just north of the equator
With a giant stereo and a manic TV
Every once in a while she says these things to me

I want love, I want drugs, I want sex and affection
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
Rod Stewart's hair and Keith Richards' stagger

I want love, I want drugs, I want sex and affection
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
Rod Stewart's hair and Keith Richards' stagger

I want love, I want drugs, I want sex and affection
I want everyone in this room here to look in my direction
I want a man with lips just like Mick Jagger
Rod Stewart's hair and Keith Richards' stagger

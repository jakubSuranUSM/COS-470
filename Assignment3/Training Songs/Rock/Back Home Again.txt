There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning; supper's on the stove
But it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm.

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, 'n, hey it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him, how did you spend your time?
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last friday, sunshine made her cry
And you felt the baby move just yesterday

Yes, 'n, hey it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, 'n, hey it's good to be back home again

And oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down
And feel your fingers feather soft on me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that livin' with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning and supper on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, 'n, hey it's good to be back home again

Hey, it's good to be back home again, you know it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Hey it's good to be back home again
I said hey it's good to be back home again

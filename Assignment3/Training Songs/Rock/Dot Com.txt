It's a wide world out there so much wider than imagined
I can't quite put my finger on the pulse
Of your heart softly beating just beneath the raw silk sheen
That reflects the tints of autumn from the hills

So punch my name
And in case you wonder
I'll be yours, I'll be yours dot com

Executive accommodation, bland but nonetheless appealing
Waiters discretely at your beck and call
Place the tall sun down potion, lightly by your velvet elbow
While you compose a message on the wall

So punch my name
And in case you wonder
I'll be yours, I'll be yours dot com

So punch my name
And in case you wonder
I'll be yours, I'll be yours dot com

With your handmade leather valise packed and ready, ready waiting
Showered and dressed down lightly for the heat
Give a clue, leave a kind word, hint as to a destination
A domain where our cyber souls might meet

So punch my name
And in case you wonder
I'll be yours, yours dot com

So punch my name
And in case you wonder
I'll be yours, I'll be yours dot com

When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept a-right on sayin'
Oh, no, not my baby,
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls
Who play with the men hearts like they were toys.
My mama told me; "Son, when rumors spread
That there is truth somewhere, and you should use your head."
But I sure didn't listen to what she said, don't you know
I kept a-right on sayin'
Oh, no, not my baby,
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls
Who lead you on and
Tell you lies
No, no.

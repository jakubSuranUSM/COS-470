Quiet Day
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said
Quiet Day
In my head
Shouldn't stay upon
Couldn't stay in bead on a
Quiet Day
In my head
Please don't be afraid
All the things I can't explain
Let's just act like everything is okay
Quiet Day
I am not in my head while you moving your lips
Quiet Day
Just like this
I don't even mind
'Cause I don't know what I miss on a
Quiet Day
Just like this
Please don't be afraid
All the things I can't explain
Let's just act like everything is okay
Please don't be afraid
All the things I can't explain
Let's just act like everything is okay

I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more,
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more,
I keep forgettin' that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more.
 
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before.
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist,
Starts knocking on your front door.
 
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more,
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more,
I keep forgettin' about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things that you said - oo.
 
Though I know in my heart,
We've drifted apart,
Still I can't believe our love is dead.
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me,
I just can't get it through my head.
 
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more, (you don't love me no more)
Don't love me no more, (love me no more)
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more.
 
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more,
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more,
I keep forgettin' about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things that you said - oo.
 
Though I know in my heart,
We've drifted apart,
Still I can't believe our love is dead.
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me,
I just can't get it through my head.
 
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more, (no, don't love me no more)
Don't love me no more, (oh, you don't love me no more)
I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more. (yo!)

I feel alone, 
Someone takes my picture, 
But never looks at me in the eye 
You don't see me laughing 
You don't, 
But I'll still be here waiting for you 
I feel like you are ecstasy, 
It's you that I'm craving 
I feel like you are my energy 
So why do you hate me? 

I feel at home, 
Someone takes my feelings 
And throws them all away 
And I know 
You don't see me laughing 
You don't 
But I'll still be here waiting for you 
I feel like you are ecstasy, 
It's you that I'm craving 
I feel like you are my energy, 
So why do you hate me? 

Leave and take me with you, 
Take me with you 
I'll still be chasing you... faster. 

(Take me) 
Chasing, faster 

Leave and take me with you 
Take me 
I'll still be chasing you 
I feel like you are my ecstasy it's you that I'm craving 
I feel like you are my energy so why do you hate me 
I'm holding you, holding you close to me you are my angel 
I lost control, you were my enemy but now you're my friend.

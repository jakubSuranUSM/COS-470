My eyes scroll to the back of my head
When the Lord's name taken in vain
Keepsake battalions, phantom couplets
A new tactile cremation attested
Opaque spurs, contemplative mayhem keeps us

Branded on the wrist "Do not embalm"
A paper nest truancy of wasps
Wrap me up in mylar film
The anachronism enacts the indigenous
Prolonged exposure to combustible nativism

Thirty days spent in the hole
Raise yourself a May Day pole
Inoculated at the liquor store
Drunk on the piss of sycamore embers

The hospice waltz of corpus flowers
Leaves pinko fumes from turret guns
Sawing at the base of pylon towers
Banking on the drought banking on the tower
Opaque spurs, I've defeated every crypt

In the potter's field of Machuca
Calling from the blossoming dust
Slid down the bank, choking on shit
A new tactile cremation attested
To opaque spurs, contemplative mayhem keeps us together

Thirty days spent in the hole
Raise yourself a May Day pole
Inoculated at the liquor store
Drunk on the piss of sycamore embers

Thirty days spent in the hole
Raise yourself a May Day pole
Inoculated at the liquor store
Drunk on the piss of sycamore embers

Raise your May Day poles
Raise your May Day poles

Put your heart in a safe
Throw it in wet cement
Never speak of this to a living soul
Heed the mercury blots
Of this Rorschach advice
No good will come of your insect rebellion

Thirty days spent in the hole
Raise yourself a May Day pole
Inoculated at the liquor store
Drunk on the piss of sycamore embers

Raise your May Day poles
Raise your May Day poles
Raise your May Day poles
Raise your May Day poles

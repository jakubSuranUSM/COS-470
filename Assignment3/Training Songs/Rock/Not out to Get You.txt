No, I am not out to get you
And I never meant to upset you, baby, baby
And I'm so glad that I met you
I do not think I will regret you, baby, baby

No, I am not out to get you
If you wanna leave then I must let you, baby
So take your hands from 'round my throat
I'll buy you a ticket for the boat to sail away from me

Just think how happy you could be
If you were far away from me
You and the friends inside your head
There'd be no need for me to be dead and you'd be free

You are right, I stand corrected
I've been a fool and I've neglected you lately, lately
So you can put your knife away
This is no way for grownups to play, baby, baby

No, I am not out to get you
If you wanna leave then I must let you, baby
So take your hands from 'round my throat
I'll buy you a ticket for the boat to sail away from me

Just think how happy you could be
If you were far away from me
You and the friends inside your head
There'd be no need for me to be dead and you'd be free

These days don't know how I'm coping
I've had to sleep with one eye open lately, lately
I pray that drunkenness will keep
You from my throat while I sleep lately, lately

No, I am not out to get you
If you wanna leave then I must let you, baby
So take your hands from 'round my throat
I'll buy you a ticket for the boat to sail away from me

Think how happy you could be
If you were far away from me
You and the friends inside your head
There'd be no need for me to be dead

Just think how happy you could be
If you were far away from me
You and the friends inside your head
Yeah, there'd be no need for me to be dead and you'd be free

No, I am not out to get you
If you wanna leave I must let you, baby

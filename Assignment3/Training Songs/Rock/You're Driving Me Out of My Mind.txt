Feeling bluesy, you know you do confuse me all night
I sit at home, alone and wonder if you're all right
I count the hours and lie awake until you return
And search my mind with overtime
I've so much to learn
Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
"You're driving me out of my mind."
So alone, the home we had has turned out its lights
I walk the floor and wonder who is sharing your nights
And all around, your sound, your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait
I'm always wanting you here
Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
"You're driving me out of my mind."
Though it may be hard to see
If you change your mind, will you know just where I'll be
If you ever need me
Feeling bluesy, you know you do confuse me all night
I sit at home, alone and wonder if you're all right
And all around, your sound
Your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait
I'm always waiting to here
Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
"You're driving me out of my mind."
I'm out of my mind
You're driving me out of my mind
You're driving me out of my mind

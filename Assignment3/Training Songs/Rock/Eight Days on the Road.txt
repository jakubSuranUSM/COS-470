Sugar lady, be my savior
'Cause I'm tired, I've been eight days on the road
That's right, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, ain't no town, ain't no rest tonight

Broke and busted, standin' on the county line
I've been traveling eight days on the road
That's right, well, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, ain't no town, ain't no rest tonight, oh

I'm out here thinkin', thinkin' 'bout what I've done
That's why, oh that's why, I'm eight days on the road
That's right, well eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
I'm comin' home, I won't be long, I'll make Birmingham tonight

Oh sugar lady, be my savior
'Cause I'm broke, busted, I've been eight days on the road
Hitchhike, I've been eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight

Comin' home, and I won't be long (Eight days on the road)
Sugar lady don't you do me no wrong (Eight days on the road)
Ridin' on the highway and I'm outta luck (Eight days on the road)
Mmm, ooh ooh

I'm makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Makin' it back to you
Eight days on the road
Eight days on the road

Eight days, well, woo!

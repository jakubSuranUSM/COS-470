I was born by the railroad tracks 
Well the train whistle wailed and I wailed right back 
Well papa left mama when I was quite young 
He said now "One of these days you're gonna follow me son" 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Now I had me a woman she was my world 
But I ran off with my back street girl 
Now my back street woman could not be true 
She left me standin' on the boulevard thinkin' bout you 
I got an empty feeling deep inside 
I'm going over to the other side 
Last night I dreamed I made it to the promise land 
I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand 
Saint Peter said "Come on in boy, you're finally home" 
I said "No thanks Pete, I'll just be moving along"

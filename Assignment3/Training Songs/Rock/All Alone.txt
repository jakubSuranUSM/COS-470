I fell in love with a wind-up souvenir
I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you
She sounds like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep
Now that you're gone, she's all that I've left to hold

And I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired

And I feel so all alone

I gave her to you
I thought you might appreciate
The way that she dances
The painted look upon her face
She must have come from the sun
I want to take her through the park
Where she'd tell me I'm all that she wants
If she could even talk

I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired

And I feel so all alone
I feel so all alone

And she sits on my shelf
It makes me think of you
The way she carries the things that remind me of who
We used to be before we became antiques
She's a lot like you
But when I hold her too tight, I know she'll break
She just takes some glue to stay

I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired

And I feel so all alone
I feel so all alone
I feel so all alone

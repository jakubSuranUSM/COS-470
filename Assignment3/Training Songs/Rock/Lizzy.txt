I'm sin 
Done in water
You might be over him 
He's somebody's daughter
As far as is well known 

Send me a black one 
Muzzled in a big fat one 
Open with a castrate 
Mystery man 

He sits here with father
We seem so in love too 

Open up a cat skin 
White with a pretty hand 
Wish the little beast gone 
Half-made man 

Elvis has honor 
Not half-boned siksura 

Heavy Betty big bone 
Little Kitty big bone 
I'm not sweetly
Give me one 

Eat more with your collar
Calling me a man 

Time is a big one 
Lonely and a bit of fun 
Mystery and hopeless 
Happens with the palm trees 
And she makes me want to see 
Bring the kid and carry me 
Rig it with the closeness 
Hang my bones.

If I were only a boy again
I would build a big house
For all my friends to live in
And I swear
It would be all love there
Oh to, be back then

If I were only a boy again
I would do it all different
Than I did it back then
And I guess
The simple grown up world could mean
Peace on earth

Only a boy, Only a boy
Only a boy
My sweet love
Only a boy
Only a boy, Only a boy
My sweet love

If I were only a boy again
I would build a new shelter
For all the kids to live in
And I swear
It would be no less grand than
The place I am

If I were only a sweet sweet boy again
I would sail a big ship
To all the places I've been
Once again
I'll sail across the sea to find
The love I need

Only a boy, Only a boy
Only a boy
My sweet love
Only a boy
Only a boy, Only a boy
My sweet love

Only a boy, Only a boy
Only a boy
My sweet love
Only a boy
Only a boy, Only a boy
My sweet love

Only a boy, Only a boy
Only a boy
My sweet love
Only a boy
Only a boy, Only a boy
My sweet love

Find a way into society
There might be a way -mediocrity
I'll travel that road
Some others have tried
You might laugh at me
You've got so much pride

But you and your friends you might cry
When you see that I have passed you by

Are you gonna be there
When I make my mark?
Are you gonna be there
When I set the spark?

At the love-in
With your head in the air

When I make my move, I ain't gonna lose,
There's people out there who'll help me
If I choose the right direction
When I'm makin' my connections in this world.

There's too many people don't know where they belong
They need someone to tell them right from wrong
You better break away, try to be yourself
Don't leave your future to someone else

Design the laws that gonna govern your fate
You better watch yourself it might be too late

Are you gonna be there
With a broken heart?
Are you gonna be there
When I make my mark?
At the love-in
When I set the spark

When I set that spark that starts the flame
That burns up in the souls that have been
Too late to be accounted for
I'll open up my door and let them in

Are you gonna be there?
Are you gonna be there?
Are you gonna be there?
I'm gonna be there
I said I'm gonna be there

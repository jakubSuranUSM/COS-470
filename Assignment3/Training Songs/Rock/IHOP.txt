Is there a doctor in the house?
In the house of pancakes?
You got a banana split 
Personality 
Lately it's been happy house 
All day long 
Sip it slowly and leave the olive 
She is very fond of you 

You stand accused 
Of smoking English cigarettes 
That's a provocation 
If ever one was 
Brother number 1 
Brother number 2 
Why are you fighting?
What are you gonna do?

And at the weekly meeting 
Of anonymous cads 
You shuffle your feet 
And whistle out aloud 
Listen to what they're saying 
What a load of crap 
You ain't no Cary Grant 
But then again, who is?

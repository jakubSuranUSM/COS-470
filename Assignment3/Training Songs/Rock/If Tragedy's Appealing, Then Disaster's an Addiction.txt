Well tragedy's appealing
Disaster an addiction
Waiting for the good in everything
While the world keeps feeling
There's safety in this distance
This painting, entertainment
Waiting for the good in everything
While the world keeps feeling
'Cause distance
With these problems
I'm not a failure now

Anxiety's misleading
It's kosher, yet revealing
Waiting for the good in everything
While the world keeps feeling
And shine a light down on this
And shine a light down on everyone and everything we see
While the world keeps feeling
This distance
With these problems
I'm not a failure now

You wonder why
And realize what we're made of
Afraid of
Failing
Failing now
In spite of this
I'm not a failure now
In light of this
I'm not a failure

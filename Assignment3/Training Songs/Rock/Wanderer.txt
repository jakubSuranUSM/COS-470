Well I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are well you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me their all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze them, they don't even know my name
They call me the Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round

Well there's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
But Janie is the girl, well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I'll tear open my shirt and show them Rosie on my chest
'cause I'm a Wanderer, yeah a Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round

Well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron I'm goin' nowhere

Well I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself falling for some girl
Well I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world
'cause I'm a Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round and round and round

Well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron I'm goin' nowhere

Well I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself falling for some girl
Well I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world
'cause I'm a Wanderer, yeah a Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round
They call me the Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round and round and round

They call me the Wanderer, they call me the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round
They call me a Wanderer, yeah a Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round and round and round

They call me the Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round
'Cause I'm a Wanderer

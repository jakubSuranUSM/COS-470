I would've liked you to have been deep frozen too
And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my return to Earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you
Let's see you'd be about 60 now,
And long dead by the time I return to Earth
My time held dreams were full of you,
As you were when I left;
Still underage
Your android replica is playing up again
Oh, it's no joke
When she comes she moans another's name

That's the spirit of the age,
That's the spirit of the age.
That's the spirit of the age,
That's the spirit of the age.
Ah, the spirit of the age.
That's the spirit of the age.
Oh, spirit of the age.
That is the spirit of the age.

I am a clone, I am not alone
Every fibre of my flesh and bone
Is identical to the others
Everything I say is in the same tone
As my test tube brother's voice
There is no choice between us,
If you had ever seen us,
You'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness
Something special of your own
Being a clone, I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen,
Has just been written by
Oh, another twenty telepathic men,
Word for word, it says:
"Oh, for the wings of any bird,
Other than a battery hen".

That's the spirit of the age
That is the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
It's just the spirit of the age
It's just the spirit of the age
It's just the spirit of the age
Just the spirit of the age

Spirit of the age
Spirit of the age
Spirit of the age
Spirit of the age

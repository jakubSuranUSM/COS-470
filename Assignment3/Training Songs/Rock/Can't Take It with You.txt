Can't take it with you
Everybody knows
Can't take it with you when you go
Can't hide your love away
Save it up for a rainy day
Ya can't take it with you when you go

Play it high or low
Break the bank in Monte Carlo
You can play it just the way it falls
Cut it like you want to
But it just might come back and haunt you
Lady Luck's your mama when she calls

Can't take it with you, everybody knows
Can't take it with you, when you go
Can't hide your love away, save it up for a rainy day
You can't take it with you when you go

Hot-wire a fast car, just to take a ride
You can run, but you sure cannot hide
Oh, tell her a lie
And live with it 'til you die
But you can't take it with you when you go
And it hurts so bad when you finally have to show

Can't take it with you, everybody knows
Can't take it with you, when you go
Can't hide your love away, save it up for a rainy day
You can't take it with you when you go

Can't take it with you, when you go
Can't take it with you, when you go

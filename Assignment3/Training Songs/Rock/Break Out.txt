I wake up to the sound again,
Of red lights flashing on my bed.
Sirens blazing in my head,
And I’m such a wreck
Cause I’m running to the fire now,
But there’s so fire to put out
My mind is turning upside down,
Gotta turn around.

All these words are not enough

I’m gonna break out
I’m gonna break free
Not gonna think twice
You’ll never stop me
Don’t even try
I’ll knock you down
I’m saying hello to a new dream
I’m taking it back what’s left of me
Don’t even try,
You can’t stop me now!

Is it always gonna be this way?
Now that my scars have gone away.
Don’t open them back up today,
I can’t take the pain
And the white noise calms me down at night.
If I don’t look into your eyes
It’s no fun when it’s your life,
Hanging on the line

All these words are not enough

I’m gonna break out
I’m gonna break free
Not gonna think twice
You’ll never stop me
Don’t even try
I’ll knock you down
I’m saying hello to a new dream
I’m taking it back what’s left of me
Don’t even try
You can’t stop me now!

I gotta feeling where I used to be numb.
I can feel it now rushing through my blood.
I’m stronger than I ever thought I was,
And now I found another way out of here.

All these words are not enough
Now these words mean so much

I’m gonna break out
I’m gonna break free
Not gonna think twice
You’ll never stop me
Don’t even try
I’ll knock you down

I’m saying hello to a new dream
I’m taking it back what’s left of me
Don’t even try,
You can’t stop me now!
I’m gonna break out!

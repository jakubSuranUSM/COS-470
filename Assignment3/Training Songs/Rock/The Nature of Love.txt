You think you've got it in the palm of your hand
Then it slips through your fingers like a grain of sand
You're blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, it's famine or feast, that's the nature of the beast
Screams like an eagle, cries like a dove, oh-oh,
that's the nature of love

Now some will find it on their wedding day
Some will never give their hearts away
It can be so cold you, think you're gonna freeze
Or burn you up like a slow disease

[Chorus]
The nature of love

Like blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

[Chorus: x 2]

That's the nature of love, that's the nature of love,
the nature of love
Screams like an eagle,
cries like a dove,
that's the nature of love... [Repeat until fade]

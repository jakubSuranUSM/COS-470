She walks through an open door,
That shuts and locks behind.
She's in somethin' new.
When everything's the same

You can't tell when they change,
But I think I do.
And please if you know,
Don't tell me.

And please if you know, Don't tell me.
'Cause I know that it's the same, 
When they all come back again, 
You think I'd know by now.

And I know it's in the plan,
When my heart is in my hands, again.
They walked together and shared a smile,
Feeling only doubt at first

You know it just gets worse.
Finding more reasons to stay,
But they all get washed away
Out of her mind.

My hear is in my hands

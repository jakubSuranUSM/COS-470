Once I said I wanted you
I don't remember why
I often wonder if it's true
That you could make me cry
I only know it's long ago
You said I love you too
But I got one solution that
We're gonna start anew

How do you do
Mm Mm
I thought
Wa-na Na-na Na-na
Just me and you
And then we can
Na-na Na-na
Just like before
And you will say
Na-na Na-na
Please give me more
And you will think
Na-na Na-na
Hey that's what I'm living for

How do you do
Uh huh
I thought
Why na Na-na
Just me and you
And then we can
Na-na Na-na
Just like before
And you will say
Na-na Na-na
Please give me more
And you will think
Na-na Na-na
Hey that's what I'm living for

Once I said I wanted you
And I remember why
I often wonder if it's true
You still can make me cry
And now it's not so long ago
You said I love you true
'Cause I had one solution left
And that's we start anew

How do you do
Uh huh
I thought
Wa-na Na-na
Just me and you
And then we can
Na-na Na-na
Just like before
And you will say
Na-na Na-na
Please give me more
And you will think
Na-na Na-na
Hey that's what I'm living for

How do you do
Uh huh
I thought
By na Na-na
Just me and you
And then we can
Na-na Na-na
Just like before
And you will say
Na-na Na-na
Please give me more
And you will think
Na-na Na-na
Hey that's what I'm living for

How do you do
Uh-huh
La-la-la-la...
Hey that's what I'm living for

How do you do
La-la
La-la La-la-la-la-la...

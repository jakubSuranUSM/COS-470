Ever since the world began
Men have sailed to foreign lands
And the fortunes that they've found
Are now buried in the ground.

Some would say the ocean roars
As it stumbles to the shore
But to me it only sings
Of the sorrow that it brings.

All my friends are dead
Or they're dying.
Empty laughter turns into crying.
It's death-defying.

Well, I barely learned to swim,
Just enough to save my skin.
Now I'll never sail alone,
And my harbour is my home.

All our friends are dead
Or they're dying,
And our laughter only turns into crying,
It's death-defying.

If there's one thing that I've learned,
It's the point of no return
And if that's to be our fate
Now's no time to hesitate.

She said I know you
And I wanted her to know me
She said it's beautiful
And I asked her to show me

We walked through gardens
Where the flowers sang in color
We touched the things that
Are only sometimes touched by lovers

She moves so gracefully
Through silk and satin shadow
We knew of things that one time were only known
With eyes closed

We both caressed the air
And made it sing
She knew of love
She knew of everything

The sun shone down on her
Through clouds of pink and orange
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

She spoke in words that told of
Things that really mattered
Be kind to rabbits
And have pity on Mad Hatters

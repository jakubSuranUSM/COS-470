Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man but you can do the job
While you're in town"

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man but you can do the job
When you're in town"

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

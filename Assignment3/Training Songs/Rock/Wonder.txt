Wonder
Natalie Merchant
Album: Tigerlily

Doctors have come from distants cities, just to see me
Stand over my bed, disbelieving what they're seeing

1-They say I must be one of the wonders 
  Of God's own creation
  And as far as they see, they can offer
  No explanation

Newspapers ask intimate questions, want confessions
They reach into my head to steal, the glory of my story
(repeat 1)

Ooo, I believe, fate, fate smiled 
And destiny laughed as she came to my cradle 
Know this child will be able
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience, and with faith
She'll make her way, she'll make her way

People see me I'm a challenge to your balance
I'm over your heads how I confound you 
And astound you
To know I must be one of the wonders
(rpt...1)

Ooo, I believe, fate, fate smiled 
And destiny laughed as she came to my cradle 
Know this child will be able
Laughed as she came to my mother
Know this child will not suffer
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience and with faith
She'll make her way, she'll make her way

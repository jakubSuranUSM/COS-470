You share a cross
Never breach my trust
But kill with kindness
Is what you do
Flowers in winter bloom
Maybe I fear I see you broken

Please hold onto your heart of gold
While you struggle against the cold
You keep dragging that heavy load
Just let go

Whatever's on your mind
Just let go
Whatever's on your mind

Please take my hand
Don't misunderstand
It's time for moving
It's time to go

We ramble and from ? we grow
You give til you're gone
And I'll have nothing

Please hold onto your heart of gold
While you struggle against the cold
You keep dragging that heavy load
Just let go

Whatever's on your mind
Just let go
Whatever's on your mind

Please hold onto your heart of gold
While you struggle against the cold
You keep dragging that heavy load
Just let go

Whatever's on your mind
Just let go
Whatever's on your mind
Just let go
Whatever's on your mind
Whatever's on your mind

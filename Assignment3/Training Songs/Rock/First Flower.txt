I like all of you
I like the things you say, the things you do
Every day I wake up, watch you as you go
You don't have to tell me, baby
I know, I know

You (you)
You are my man (my man)
You (you)
You are my man (my man)
You are (you are)
My man (my man)
You are (you are)
My man

Just like the first flower that blooms in spring
To me you are, you are my everything
I like the way you hold me
Hold me, don't let go
You don't have to tell me, baby
I already know

You (you)
You are my man (my man)
You (you)
You are my man (my man)
You are (you are)
My man (my man)
You are (you are)
My man

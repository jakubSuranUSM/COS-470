Are you and me gonna happen
Are you and me gonna happen soon

The gods smiled hard down upon
The love that's shared
Heaven's awaiting those who dare

Are you and me gonna happen
Are you and me gonna happen soon

A sweeter feeling I can't guess will ever be
A truer union I can't see

I don't know how much more I can take
I will run through th streets
I'll howl at the moon
If you and me can not be happening soon

Are you and me gonna happen soon
Are you and me gonna happen soon

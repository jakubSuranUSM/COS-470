Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

The power to devour all the creeping things he made
Slip up in the shower singing ‘home-made lemonade’
Bring me Louis Cartier I need a diamond halo
For me and my seven billion brothers

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe

Soldiers and the children still shivving in the Jago
And whoever runs the ship for the others

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe 
But I never know what to do, babe

Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
And I never know what to do babe, do babe, uh babe 

I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe

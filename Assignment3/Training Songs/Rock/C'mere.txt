It's way too late to be this locked inside ourselves
The trouble is that you're in love with someone else
It should be me. Oh, it should be me
Sacred parts, your get aways
You come along on summer days
Tenderly, tastefully

It's so me, we make time
Try to find somebody else
This place is mine

Set the day, you know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts little girl
I'm in love with something real
It could be me, that's changing!

It's so me, we make time
To try and find somebody else
We pass a line

Now season with health
Two lovers walk on lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo (?)
See the stands long ending path

Oh, how I love you
And in the evening, when we are sleeping
We are sleeping. Oh, we are sleeping

It's so me, we make time
We try to find somebody else
Who has a line

Now season with health
Two lovers walk on lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo (?)
See the stands long ending path

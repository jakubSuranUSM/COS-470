Every day I wake up
Lord, I try to face up
Try to make some sense out of misery
I just keep rollin'
Gotta keep rollin'
Somewhere out there, there's a life for me

Cause, love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round
Love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round

Alone I can't face it
Lord, I try to fake it
Gotta get my ass back in gear
I just keep rollin'
Gotta keep rollin'
Rollin' my way outta here

Cause, love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round
Love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round

I swear

I hold my head up
I hold my head up

I was happy, with my head in the clouds
I felt so strong and I felt so proud
Cause I believed in everlasting love
The love of God and the Heavens above
Cause, I just keep rollin'
Gotta keep rollin'
I just keep rollin'

Cause, love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round
Love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round

Everyday I wake up
Lord, I try to face up
Try to make some sense out of misery
I'll just keep rollin'
Gotta keep rollin'
Rollin' to the praise of the Lord

I swear, love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round
Cause love keeps dragging me down
Twisting my head, pushing me round

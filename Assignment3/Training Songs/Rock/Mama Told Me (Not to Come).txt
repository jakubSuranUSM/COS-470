Will you have whiskey with your water
Or sugar with your tea
What are these crazy questions
That they're asking of me
This is the wildest party
That there ever could be
Oh, don't turn on the light
'Cause I don't want to see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said, that ain't no way to have fun

Open up the window
Let some air into this room
I think I'm almost choking on
The smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smoking
'Bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window
Let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said, that ain't no way to have fun

The radio is blasting,
Someone's beating on the door
Our hostess is not lasting
She's out on the floor
I seen so many things here
I ain't never seen before
I don't know what it is
But I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
Mama said, that ain't no way to have fun

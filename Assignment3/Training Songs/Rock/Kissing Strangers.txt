Stifling a roar
Beauty the crashing bore
Time worn verse and phrase
Young hearts on the chase

Haste to dull the wits
Ransacking photo-fits
Smiles that don't belong
Like the one that's gone

Been kissing strangers
Trawling the night sky
Drinking the bars dry
All is closing in
All is closing in

Heard you found your feet
And fell on a winning streak
A well groomed weakened brute
A seed that's taken root

And I'm the backward town
That needs razing to the ground
But you were passing through
Half way to somewhere new

Been kissing strangers
Trawling the night sky
Drinking the bars dry
All is closing in
All is closing in

Been kissing strangers
Running a long line
With luck of the wrong kind
All is closing in
All is closing in

Twitch from a neon heart
The fumbling in the dark

Been kissing strangers
Trawling the night sky
Drinking the bars dry
All is closing in
All is closing in

Been kissing strangers
Running a long line
With luck of the wrong kind
All is closing in
All is closing in

Where was Jodie when the lights went out
Standing in the corner shouting, shout, sister, shout!

[Chorus:]
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could wail away!)
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!)

The girl wore a dress with no shoes on
The big tenor man really blew his horn

[Chorus]

Somebody called a cop about half past four
He really just couldn't get through that door

[Chorus]

Where was Jodie when the lights went out?

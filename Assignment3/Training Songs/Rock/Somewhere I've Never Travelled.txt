SOMEWHERE I'VE NEVER TRAVELLED
THAT'S WERE IV'E BEEN TODAY
SOMEWHERE BEYOND ALL REASON
BUT IT CAME THE ONLY WAY

I COULD FIND IT SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
I CAN FIND IT

SOMEPLACE I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF
THAT'S WHAT I FINALLY SEE
AND WHEN I'M THERE I FEEL LOVE
SO THERE I ALWAYS WANT TO BE

I BELIEVE IT
BELIEVE IN MYSELF
I HAVE SEEN IT

AND TEHERE'S A DAY WHEN YOU'LL WAKE
WITH THE SUN IN YOUR EYES
HEARING A VOICE THAT IS CALLING
WITHIN YOU TO RISE
(RISE)

SOMEDAY I'LL BE THERE
THOUGH I KNOW NOT
WHERE I GO
THERE I'LL BE
WHEN I GO

SOMEWHERE I'D NEVER TRAVELLED
THAT'S WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
AND AS MY DREAMS UNRAVEL
I LONG TO GO THAT WAY AGAIN

I AM WAITING
WAITING TO TAKE YOU THERE NO MORE WAITING
(OFF YOU GO)

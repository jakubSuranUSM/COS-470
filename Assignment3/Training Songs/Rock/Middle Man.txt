Yes I quite understand
I just might have your man tonight
He'll be lookin' good Hollywood
Everything right on cue
That's a clue
If you're in town and he's around
Well anything I can do
Maybe
I could get him on the line
Yes I think you'd like him fine
You could spend all his money.. honey

He'll want a little
Just a little
Taste of your love
He'll need a little
Just a little
Bit of your love
He'll take you uptown
Downtown
Up Third Avenue
So if you need a little
I'll be the middle man for you

There's a hot moon tonight
If I feel like jumping I just might
We could grab a pack go back and start
A little thing or two me and you
I can't resist you know there's
Something I've been dying to do
Maybe we could take in all the sights
We could roll some heavy dice
And we could blow all my money.. honey

I want a little
Just a little
Taste of your love
Not just a little
But every little
Trace of your love
I'll take you uptown downtown
Up a lonely avenue
Yes I'm in the middle smack dab middle
Man for you

I want a little
Just a little
Taste of your love
Need a little
Just a little
Taste of your love
I'll take you uptown downtown
Down a lonely avenue
Oh I am the middle
Yes the middle man for you
Yes I need a little
Just a little
Taste of your love

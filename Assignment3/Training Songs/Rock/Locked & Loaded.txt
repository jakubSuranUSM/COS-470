Bring it on
I don't have a word here in my mind
You look strong
Let's see how you gonna take to losing

So you wanna put your liveness tonight
Now you really gonna save me

Locked and loaded
I don't apologize
And I can keep it going all night, all night
You're outcome, baby
You should have realized
You've brought a knife to a gunfight, gunfight

Show respect
Looks like you've forgotten just who I am
Turn the cheek
That's for someone else, no not in my (?)

So you wanna put your liveness tonight
Now you really gonna save me

Locked and loaded
I don't apologize
And I can keep it going all night, all night
You're outcome, baby
You should have realized
You've brought a knife to a gunfight, gunfight

Empty shells scattered on the floor
And you don't want to no more
There's no bell, don't try to ignore
You're tongue-tied, you don't want no more

So you wanna put your liveness tonight
Now you really gonna save me

Locked and loaded
I don't apologize
And I can keep it going all night, all night
Locked and loaded
I don't apologize
And I can keep it going all night, all night
You're outcome, baby
You should have realized
You've brought a knife to a gunfight, gunfight

Falling and spinning 
Losing and winning 
Keeping my head 
Watching for signals 
Wearisome vigil 
Was I mislead 

I remember you said 
That you don't want to forget me 
It doesn't matter 
Which of our fantasies fail 
Every tomorrow 
Looking tomorrow 
A piece of today 

Run a bit faster 
Here comes the catcher 
Making his play 
You had better not stay 
You will soon be surrounded 
It doesn't matter 
Which of our fantasies stay 

SOLO
Lonely and winsome calling 
For someone living right now 
Something is shallow ugly and hollow 
Doesn't even allow you to want to know how 
You might live for the living 

Give for the giving moment by moment 
One day at a time 
It doesn't matter 
It's nothing but dreaming anyhow

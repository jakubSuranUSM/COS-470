I confess
I need you badly
Hold me in your arms
Love me madly

Life without you only brought me heartache
I've had all the lonely I can take
Now I know letting go was my mistake
I'll say it again and again and again

I confess
I need you badly
Hold me in your arms
And love me madly

Life without you only brought me heartache
I've had all the lonely I can take
Now I know letting go was my, my mistake
I'll say it again and again and again

I confess
I need you badly
Hold me in your arms
And love me madly

I confess
I'll be your Daddy
Ask for anything
I'll do it gladly

Ask for anything
I'll do it gladly

Hold me in your arms
And love me madly

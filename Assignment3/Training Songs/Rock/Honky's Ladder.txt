Got you where I want you
Motherfucker
I got five up on your dime
And if you want to peep on something
Peep what I got stuck between
Your eyes
And since I don't believe
A word you say
Save it for another, baby brother
Swallow time to pay
Up on the ladder they sing
How high?
Does a brother have to climb
To touch the light
But wait 'till I get done
With you
If you tell me
"Don't get mixed up with the Devil"
That's exactly
What I'm gonna do
Caught you while you waited
For your boy to come
And fix you up again
Come a little closer, baby
I only want to try to
Be your friend
Since I ain't got nothing
Left to lose
Got you where I want you
Motherfucker
Don't you try to move
Up on the ladder they sing
How high?
Does a brother have to climb
To touch the light
Won't you take me up there
With you? You said you would
No one ever could shake 
That ladder like I could
So I wait

Ron, when we were young
I told you not to cry
Now we're growing old and you're a jerk
You've gone and worked it out

But that's when we were young
It never really was
And now we're really old
And that's when we were young

Son, you're growing old
I told you we would die
But that was then
I've gone and worked it out

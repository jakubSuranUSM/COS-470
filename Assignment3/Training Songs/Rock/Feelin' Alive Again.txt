When I can't count on no one else and nothin' seems true Then I begin to doubt mvself and I come to you 
You've cried with my disappointments 
And laughed at my lies 
Showed me the way to live again and I realize
I realize 
That I'm feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man 
Feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man
Babe, tell me what you do
To make every single dream come true 
You give it all and now I'm givin' it back to you
Wherever we may choose to live the rest of our lives 
If this is the best that we can give you know it's all right There may be expectations that we hold inside 
As long as we live up to this love we'll be all right 
'Cause I'm feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man 
Feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man
You know that I do feel about you 
You know that I do feel about you
Maybe it's all behind us now, we're not so far 
To find everything we need somehow right where we are There are no hesitations, only the way 
To live inside your love again 
And here I will stay 
Here I will stay 
'Cause I'm feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man 
Feelin' alive again 
Feelin' like a real man

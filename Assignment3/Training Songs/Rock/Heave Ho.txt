Way up there
They think they found
A world for us
To settle down
And I know now
We failed somehow

Pick my feet
Up from the ground
The hills have rolled into the clouds
And callous faces
Line the alleyways
Where I long for you

It is no revolution
See, it always has been you and me
In the bar on the photo
Trying to find common ground

And she sings to me
When I'm wound
"If you can't love this
All goes away"

Way up there
They think they found
A world for us
To settle down
And I know now
We failed somehow

Pick my feet
Up from the ground
The hills have rolled into the clouds
And callous faces
Line the alleyways
Where I long for you
(What's a boy to do?)

It is no revolution
See, it always has been you and me
In the bar on the photo
Trying to find common ground

And she sings to me
When I'm round
"If you can't love this
All goes away
If you can't love this
All goes away"

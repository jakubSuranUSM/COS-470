So you think there's someone missing
Somebody to hug and kiss and then still be friends
So you think there's more than singing 
Reading magazines about the scream
I know what you mean

Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?
Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?

So you think you're someone special
Very glamourous, one of a kind
A brilliant mind
So you find it disappointing
Realising what you won't achieve
I know what you mean

Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?
Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?

So you think there's something missing
Something everlasting, somehow kind
It's hard to find
So you think you really miss her
The perfect girl to kiss and then, still be friends

Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?
Now you know how it feels 
Know how it feels
And how does it feel?

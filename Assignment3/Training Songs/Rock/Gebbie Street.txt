I don’t know, kick it out of sight of you 
I’m breaking in, you make me feel explosions in my heart
Tell you all, noises were clear and loud
Mess it up, clean it up, this poison empty house

Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation
Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation

I could see color up but I ain’t blind
Love to be center up with you on sunrays shine
You ran away, still waiting for the best time of your life
Burn slow, breaking up, this fire’s back in your house

Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation
Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation

Well, I don’t know, get you out of sight and you went out
Walking in, make me feel explosions in my brain
Play it all, noises were clear and loud
Mess it up, clean it up, this poison empty house

Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation
Your eyes like diamonds tickle gold
You know our bodies make the right conversation

I want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t need this art killer
I want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t need this art killer
I want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t need this art killer
I want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t want to jump in
I don’t need this art killer

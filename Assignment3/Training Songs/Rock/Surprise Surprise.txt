I came home the other night
Much to your surprise
The blinds were down, the lights were dim
And love was in your eyes

The table lit by candle light
A record playing low
And from the room I heard a voice
A voice I didn’t know
Say, "I need you, I need you"

Can you imagine how I felt?
To know like someone else
Making love to you in there
It should have been myself

I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t cry
My heart was filled with pain
And as I turned to walk away
I heard his voice again
Say, "I need you, I need you"

I felt so sad, I had to take a walk outside
To find out what went wrong and if I'd really tried
To love you girl and be there when you needed me
In spite of what you’d done, I love you hopelessly

You’ve got such a pretty face
That's why you appeal to him
But he don’t know you like I do
‘Cause you say everything

You say that you love me
Now just look at what you’ve done
‘Cause you’ve got one more in your arms
The other on the run
‘Cause I need you, I need you

I need you, I need you, I need you

And though I think of you tonight
I cannot hope to hold you tight
But I've got this feeling in my heart 
And when tomorrow I'll be gone
How can I hope to carry on?
I've got a feeling in my heart 

I can no longer see
What's making things go wrong
You've stayed away before
It always seems so long 

But wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know I'll always be with you
'Cause I've got this feeling deep in my heart 

I can no longer see
What's making things go wrong
You've stayed away before
It always seems so long 

But wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know I'll always be with you
'Cause I've got this feeling deep in my heart 

Baby, you're in my heart

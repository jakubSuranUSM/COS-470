I see a great big sign on a one way street
Goin' down the wrong way who do I meet
A big policeman walkin' his beat
Everything I do is wrong

Everything I do is wrong on me
Everything I do is wrong
I just don't see how I'm gonna get along
'Cause everything I do is wrong

Well I'm busy getting ready for a big date
Rushin' like a mad man to keep from being late
I take a wrong turn and wind up in another state
Everything I do is wrong

Everything I do is wrong on me
Everything I do is wrong
I just don't see how I'm gonna get along
'Cause everything I do is wrong

Well I hate to be the type of a guy who complain
Every time I wash my car it's bound to rain
I take a trip North and catch a South bound train
Everything I do is wrong

Everything I do is wrong for on me
Everything I do is wrong
I just don't see how I'm gonna get along
'Cause everything I do is wrong

Mmm on me

Work twenty years and they'll take care of you 
They'll buy you a diamond, they'll send you on a cruise 
Give it all your money, give it all your time 
Then wake up one morning and wonder why 

Let me up 
I've had enough 

I believe you baby, I know you wouldn't lie 
Like a dog won't bark, like a bird won't fly 
Yeah pretty little baby, you're a weapon with eyes 
I know what you want, but it's a surprise 
Let me up--I've had enough 

Yeah, yeah, bet honest with me 
Honey am I what you thought I would be 

You tell me you love me baby, you'll be true 
I want to believe you, but I don't know why I do 
I woke up this mornin', there was a car in the drive 
I didn't recognize it, who was that guy? 

Let me up 
I've had enough 

I believe you baby, I know you wouldn't lie 
Like a dog won't bark, like a bird won't fly 
Yeah pretty little baby why, you're a weapon with eyes 
I know what you want, but it's a surprise 
Let me up--I've had enough 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I tell ya, this is not 
A question of humility here

Hard as a rock, you have made your heart
And you're so sure that its me to blame
How can you lose when you hold all the cards
But who can win at a losers game
You told me that I had to live without you
Hey loneliness is no stranger to my life
And I know you'll get by

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
No it don't come at all

I'm wide awake but I feel no pain
Lying alone in this bed of thorns
Headlights scream across these walls likes flames
Is this the calm just before the storm
I thought that I could never live without you
Funny how things change when life says jump
You're not the only one

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
It don't come at all

I thought that I was headed for a broken heart
But a heart can fall so far and not apart
I'm lying in the dark

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
I'm not reaching out for you in the night
But something deep inside me says it's alright
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
It don't come at all
No it don't come at all
No it don't come at all
No it don't come at all

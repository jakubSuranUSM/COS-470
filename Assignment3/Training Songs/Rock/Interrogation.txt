Who do I blame
Impale
When I have nailed someone
Nailed someone for crimes
I harbour in my mind
My self-righteous mind
When I have raised my colours
Raised my colours high
These chains I've forged
Sinking like a stone
Sunk to depths
Interrogation
All I judge
I have become
Interrogation
Of my own

Let the records show
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Digging a hole, digging a hole, hole
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Digging a hole, digging a hole

Scrape the blade
Under my jaw
Where I have caught myself before
This blade repeats mistakes
Tiny lies
Where I have nicked myself
The lies drain out the light

Holes
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Digging a hole, digging a hole, hole
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Liars, lies and self-deceit
Digging a hole, digging a hole

In the spring the birds begin their singing
In the trees where blossom is so sweet
No other love is quite so happy
No other love is complete

Well, it's rain-rain-rain it keeps on falling
Upon my window pane tonight
Though our love is even colder
Still wonder where she's at tonight

I'll never forget the day she left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you left an old pain dear
And it lingers in my heart tonight

Yeah, it's rain-rain-rain it keeps on falling
Upon this window pane tonight
Though our love is even colder
Still wonder where she's at tonight
Still wonder where she's at tonight
Mmm, where she's at tonight

I said go, I said baby don't want to go
I said freeze, I said baby don't want to freeze
And if it's night or day we don't care if what we get along whatever you do
And it won't be long 'till they get my file and turns it black as black as afternoon
And turns it black as black as afternoon

I said you, I said you and me and her
I said us, I said us makes white a blur
And if it's night or day we don't care if how we get along whatever you say
And it won't be long 'till they get my file and turns it black as black as grey
And turns it black as black as grey

I said you, well you do

We don't care if you care for the mob
We don't care if you care for the sub
We don't care if you care for the mud
Cause we've got mo town blood in our veins
Cause we've got mo town blood in our veins

I said move, I said baby don't want to move
I said groove, I said baby don't want to groove
And if it's night or day we don't care if what we get along whatever you do
And it won't be long 'till they get my file and turns it black as black as afternoon
And turns it black as black as afternoon

I said you, well you do

We don't care

Crash on the levee, mama
Water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise
And no boat's gonna row
You can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me
Mama you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee
And, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's king for king
And it's Queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Well, that high tide's risin'
Mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase
Mama, don't you make a sound
Well, it's sugar for sugar
And it's salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It's gonna be your own fault
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

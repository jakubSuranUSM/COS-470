I spend half of each day just eyeing the clock
And dream of all the things I'd like to do
And nothing ever changes from day to day 
I've just been guarding this desk for you
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
There must be something else I could do 
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
Instead of guarding this desk for you

Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away

I'm getting very tired of waiting for the weekend
Then there's nothing when it comes around 
I need a little more excitement
Give me some adventure 
I don't know you've held me this long
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
Time just marches on
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
I don't know how you've held me this long

Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away

Chances are chances and I know I've had a few
But at the time it just seemed wrong
Now I'm sitting here wondering
Waiting watching out his window
Well I'm sure my day will come
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
Time just marches on 
It's a Mayday
It's a Mayday
But I'm sure my day will come

Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away
Time's up! You've been wishing your life away

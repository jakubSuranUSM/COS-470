Groooooahhh!

Coming down
Sadie, I love it
Now now now
Death valley '69

You're right
You're right
You're right
You're right
You're right you were right
I was on the wrong track
We're deep in the valley
How deep in the gully
And now in the canyon
And now in the canyon
Out in the yonder way out in the yonder
She started to holler
She started to holler
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
But she started to holler
So I had to hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Deep in the valley
In the trunk of an old car
In the back of a Chevy
I got sand in my mouth you got sand in your mouth
And you got sun in your eyes I got sun in your eyes
Blind blinded
And you wanted to get there
But I couldn't go faster I wanted to get there
But you couldn't go faster
So I started to hit it you couldn't go faster
So I started to hit it
I started to hit it hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it

Coming down
Sadie, I love it
Now now now
Death valley '69
Death valley '69
Death valley '69
Death valley '69
Ieieieioooooaoaoaieeih!

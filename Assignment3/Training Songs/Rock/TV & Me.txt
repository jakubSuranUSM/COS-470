Gunned down in a fight
It was a bloody pleasure
Though I couldn't walk
I'm not dead
I smell the pavement
And the end there's a light
And so pretty women
Though I couldn't see
I'm not blind and inside my mind

Fright night on the radio
Starving junkies on the TV
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
While there's Conan Something
MTV's burning up from lack of fever
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
I just wish there was something more to this
TV & me

Lift off into space
It's all on discovery
I don't understand why it takes
So long for me to turn
So long for me to turn it off

Fright night on the radio
Starving junkies on the TV
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
While there's Conan Something
MTV's burning up from lack of fever
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
I just wish there was something more to this
TV & me

Well there's fright night on the radio
Starving junkies on the TV
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
While there's Conan Something
MTV's burning up from lack of mercy
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
TV & me

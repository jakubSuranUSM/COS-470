There's something special 'bout six o'clock 
In the morning when it's still too early to knock 
And the dusky light shines down on the block 
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock 
Six o'clock, six o'clock 

A few hours ago she was standing here 
Just watching the stars in our eyes and the lights as the tights 
disappeared 
And I could feel I could say what I want 
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante 
But now I'm all alone with just my shadow in front 
At six o'clock, six o'clock 

I went home and found that time to sleep was rare 
Just watching my eyelids, knowing my brain bids the night not 
to care 
I got up and got scufflin' around 
But somehow it just wasn't the same happy town 
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound 
At six o'clock, six o'clock 

If I go back where we parted 
Could I ever feel like that again 
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow 
But what can I do 'til then 

Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn 
Yes, I had to learn going back where we were wouldn't help at all 
And I wish my head had been working right 
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night 
And now I'm back alone, bein' twisted up tight 
Six o'clock, six o'clock 

Now I'm back alone 
Yes, now I'm back alone 
I'm back alone

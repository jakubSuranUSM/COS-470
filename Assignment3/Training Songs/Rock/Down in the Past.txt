Well I don't want to hang around with you 
I've got my motor baby and I'm gonna see you through 
You think I want to be alone with you 
It doesn't matter baby cause you're overreacted, too 
But since you're down there, 
where will I just be 
I'm getting fine girl, 
dressing up for stormy weather 

So touch me down in the past 
where my mother will last 
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last And she will make sure that you remember 

Well I don't want to slide away with you 
I've got ten little soldiers pointing at you 
Honey you just left me for a new one 
It doesn't matter baby cause your hair is ugly too
But since you're down there, where will I just be I'm getting fine girl, 
dressing up for stormy weather 

So touch me down in the past,
where my mother will last 
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last And she will make sure that you remember 

Well I don't want to hang around with you 
I've got my motor baby and I'm gonna see you through 
You think I want to be alone with you 
It doesn't matter baby cause you're overreacted too 
So touch me down in the past
That you remember
Come on

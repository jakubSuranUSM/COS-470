Here's the man whose voice speaks for everyone
And whose actions touch the lives of us all
He rose with energy and style
Shake my hand, kiss my child
Sway us all with your smile
He readily accepts acclaim
But soon forgets that he came
From the back streets like them

So we pray to the east
We pray to the west
And we see the gods of the new church
As they undertake their vow
Tell me who can save us now?
Save us from the lords of the new church
Don't say no

Here's the man some believe is a visionary
Here's the man who is driven by greed
He made a fortune overnight
In a deal that he knew
Was too good to be true
Now as he bends the rules of play
Becomes obsessed with the game
Has to go all the way

So we pray to the east
We pray to the west
And we see the gods of the new church
As they undertake their vow
Tell me who can save us now?
Save us from the lords of the new church
Don't say no

They feast and they fly
While we pay the real price
But what price do we place on life?

So we pray to the east
We pray to the west
And we see the gods of the new church
As they undertake their vow
Tell me who can save us now?
Save us from the lords of the new church
Don't say no

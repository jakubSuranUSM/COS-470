There's a light in the window that tells me you're home
Eyes in the rear-view mirror that I call my own
There's a time I remember when I called you mine
Memories of your kisses much sweeter than wine

Maybe I won't be afraid to love somebody new
Maybe I can open up my heart
Then I won't drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears

There's a place where we used to meet every day
And a time when we used to love every way
All that's left is the pieces of a broken heart
And a house full of emptiness since we're apart

Maybe I won't be afraid to love somebody new
Maybe I can open up my heart
Then I won't drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears

There's a light in the window that tells me you're home
Eyes in the rear-view mirror that I call my own
There's a time I remember when I called you mine
Memories of your kisses much sweeter than wine

Maybe I won't be afraid to love somebody new
Maybe I can open up my heart
Then I won't drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears

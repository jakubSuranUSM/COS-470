I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I spend all my money on whiskey and beer
And now I'm returning with gold in great store 
And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no,nay,never
No,nay,never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told my landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit she answered me nay
Such a custom as yours I could have any day

And it's no, nay, never

I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened up with delight
She said she had whiskeys and wines of the best
And the words that she tolt me were only in jest

And it's no, nay, never

I went home to my parents confest what I'd done
And I asked them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they'd caressed me as oft times before
I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never

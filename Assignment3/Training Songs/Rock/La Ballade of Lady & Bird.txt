[Lady] Yes, bird?
[Bird] It's cold
[Lady] I know
[Lady] Bird...I cannot see a thing
[Bird] It's all in your mind
[Lady] I'm worried
[Bird] No one will come to see us
[Lady] Maybe they come but we just don't see them What do you see?
[Bird] I see what's outside
[Lady] And what exactly is outside?
[Bird] It's grown-ups
[Lady] Well maybe if we scream they can hear us
[Bird] Yeah, maybe we should try to scream
[Lady] Ok, Bird
[Lady] & [Bird] Heeeelp, Heeeelp!! Can you hear us now? Hello! Help! Hello, it's me...hey, can you see? Can you see me? I'm here... Nana, come and take us! Hello? Are you there? Hello?

[Bird] Do you want to come with me, lady?
[Lady] Will you be nice to me Bird?
[Lady] You're always nice to me because you're my friend
[Bird] I try, but sometimes I make mistakes
[Lady] Nana says we all make mistakes
[Bird] Maybe we should scream more
[Lady] Yes bird, let's scream more
[Lady] & [Bird] Help! Help us! Come on! Help! Hello? Help! Hello? We're lost!
[Lady] I don't think they can see us
[Bird] Nobody likes us

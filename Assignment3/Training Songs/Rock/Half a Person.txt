Call me morbid, call me pale 
I've spent six years on your trail 
Six long years on your trail 

Call me morbid, call me pale 
I've spent six years on your trail 
Six full years of my life on your trail 

And if you have five seconds to spare 
Then I'll tell you the story of my life 
Sixteen, clumsy and shy 
I went to London and I 
I booked myself in at the why W.C.A. 
I said I like it here, can I stay? 
I like it here, can I stay? 
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?

She was left behind, and sour 
And she wrote to me equally dour 
She said in the days when you were hopelessly poor 
I just liked you more

And if you have five seconds to spare 
Then I'll tell you the story of my life 
Sixteen, clumsy and shy 
I went to London and I 
I booked myself in at the why W.C.A. 
I said I like it here, can I stay? 
I like it here, can I stay? 
And do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?

Call me morbid, call me pale 
I've spent too long on your trail 
Far too long chasing your tail, oh

And if you have five seconds to spare 
Then I'll tell you the story of my life 
Sixteen, clumsy and shy 
That's the story of my life 
Sixteen, clumsy and shy 
The story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
The story of my life 

That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life 
That's the story of my life

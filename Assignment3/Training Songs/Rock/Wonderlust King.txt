Back in the day yo as we learned
A man was not considered to be
Considered to be fully grown

Has he not gonna beyond the hills
Has he not crossed the 7 seas
Yeah, 7 seas at least

Now all them jokers kept around
Just like the scarecrows in hometown
Yeah, scarecrows in hometown
From screen to screen, them travelin'

But I'm a wonderlust king
I stay on the run, let me out, let me be gone
In the world beat up road sign
I saw new history of a time, new history of time

Through Siberian woods breaking up their neck
Breaking up their neck
Chinese moving in building discotheques
Building discotheques

Tran-Siberian sex toys and what not
Yeah, why not?
Oh well at least it's something different
From what they got in every other airport

Ja ne evrei, no koje-chto pohozge
Sovrat ne dast ni Yura ni Seryozga
Simple because I'm not a total gadjo
Da ja shut, ja tziratch, nu tak stozge?

I traveled the world looking for understanding
Of the times that we live in
Hunting and gathering first hand information
Challenging definitions of sin

I traveled the world looking for lovers
Of the ultimate beauty but never settled in

I'm a wonderlust king
I stay on the run, let me out, let me be gone
In the world beat up road sign
I saw new history of a time, new history of time

And presidents and billionaires and generals
They'll never know, they'll never know
What I have owned, what I have owned

I'm a wonderlust king

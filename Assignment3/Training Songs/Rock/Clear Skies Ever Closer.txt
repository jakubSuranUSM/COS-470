In five flights of true blue grace
You drag your bags to Gare du Nord
The crude tracks of love that streak
Roll down your cheeks and hit the floor

Cross the way to the wind
I watch you slip away
But seasons will turn
And I will do the same

Clear skies ever closer
All of our goodbyes we will get over
Oh, the darkness descends down on me again
Through it all you stood tall

And in the photograph
You have caught me in my prime
Love and lust, girl, shoulders wide
A token of a kind of time

When the weight of the world
Would skip across your lips
And I know, the universe
It’s at my fingertips

Clear skies ever closer
All of our goodbyes we will get over
Oh, the darkness descends down on me again
Through it all you stood tall

I’m in love, I’m in love with
I’m in love, I’m in love with
Shine a light on the whispering

Clear skies ever closer
All of our goodbyes we will get over
Oh, the darkness descends down on me again
Through it all you stood tall

Just pulled out of a train station we're moving sideways
I'm sitting here with three other people in the carriage
Passing churches, passing stations, a bustling complex
I see a sequence 22 rivers out my window
 
Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me
 
The skyscrapers the cloud scratchers 
Here comes a city
The sandwich maker the trollycar pusher 
Here comes a city
 
Pushing you away from me
Pushing you away from me
 
Etterzhausen, Frankfurt Central, here comes a city
And why do people who read Dostoevsky always look like Dostoevsky?
 
A crowded train, a silent night
The country's black and the cities are bright
 
On this flight, through the night
On this flight, historic night
 
Here comes a city

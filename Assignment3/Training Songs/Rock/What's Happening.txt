Well here I sit just hanging around
I don’t feel like doing anything she really got me down
I wish that I could see her then we’d both say our goodbyes (yeah)
Well my mind’s running everywhere well I’d even say I do feel high

Well I like to get out of this big dark corner I’m in 
But something’s got me tied in, well I just can’t see a thing 
And I wish that I could talk to her and just make her see it my way (yeah)
But it’s too late boy ain’t it now, by now she’s gone far far away (oh yeah)

Stranded at the drivin', branded a fool
What will they say Monday at school?

Sandy, can't you see I'm in misery?
We made a start, now we're apart
There's nothing left for me

Love has flown, all alone I sit and wonder why yi-yi-yi
Oh why you left me, oh Sandy, oh Sandy

Baby, someday, when high school is done
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one
In heaven forever and ever we will be
Oh, please say you'll stay, oh, Sandy!

Sandy, my darlin'
You hurt me real bad
You know it's true
But, baby, you gotta believe me when I say
I'm helpless without you

Love has flown, all alone, I sit
I wonder why yi-yi-yi,
Oh why
You left me,
Oh Sandy
Sandy, Sandy
Why yi-yi-yi

Oh Sandy

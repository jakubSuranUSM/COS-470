You can turn back the tide of the cold tears from your eyes,
The pangs of wounded pride if you hold me.
Did someone do you wrong yeah, good lovin's good as gone.
Maybe you ain't as strong as you want to be.

[Chorus]
It's alright if you don't want to go home.
It's alright if you don't want to be alone.
It's alright if you don't want to go home.
I understand.

Nothin' stays if it's gotta go now.
You can't get water from a stone now.
Sometimes you've got to think about.
The things you're gonna love.

[Chorus]

Now that you're doing alright.
You're pretty much outta sight.
I don't see you knockin' 'round my door anymore.
I'm glad to hear you're doing well.
But I know that time will tell.
Only when you're broken down,
Is that what friends are for?

[Chorus]

It's alright if you just want to go home.
It's alright if you just want to be alone.
It's alright if you just want to go home.
I understand.

Have you seen her face her eyes reflect the colors in the sky
A warm familiar place to be swept into
Whenever she's close by makes me wonder why

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

Must be the way she walks a style made up to capture all she needs
No time to spend on loose talk
If your luck runs right she might see you tonight anything in sight

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes

You'll find your locked in her spell all the sights and sounds
Your senses will be found
That only time will tell how much love can be to wait so patiently
Wait and see

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes

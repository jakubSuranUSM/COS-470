Jefferson Airplane Takes Off
Almost been a year since we've been together
Seems so long ago since you drifted away
Suddenly the past has fallen in behind us

Now all I know is I want you to stay
Don't slip away, oh no, don't slip away
Now that you're here we should just let it happen
Some things are best if they're only forgotten

You know I'm sorry, but what can I say?
The best years are after tomorrow
But time for changing should begin with today.
Don't slip away, oh no, don't slip away

Now that you're here we should just let it happen
You can't hide what we shared with each other
I know you still care and feel the same way
I'm sure there's more love in your heart than you're showing
Now it depends on what you have to say.

Don't slip away, oh no, don't slip away
Now that you're here we should just let it happen

I cry up to the man in the moon
He's the only one can help me now
I bought the line 
that as long as I tried
I could not leave empty handed
But I've done all I can do
and now I leave it up to you

I'm waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me 
To take me away

Goodnight moon
I should be talkin' to Neptune
He's the one who will teach me patience
For whoever rules the sea
is now the ruler over me

I'm waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me

So I have proved
some things can't be moved
And here I wait 
but my faith is weak,
and the water's creeping up to my chin
I am

waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting for the tide to turn
Waiting, waiting for the tide
to take me

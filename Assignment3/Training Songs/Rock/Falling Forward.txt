(written by Julia Fordham/John Watkin)

I've been living on wishes, living on wishes all my life
And I wish I could make one
To make everything in your world right

I'm falling forward while you wait behind
Lost for your reasons and missing your time
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you

And I'm only an hour, not even an hour away
But you're keeping your distance
We're more than a million miles apart these days

I'm falling forward while you wait behind
Lost for your reasons and missing your time
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)

And suddenly I'm the villain of the piece
You're lying awake, wondering how I sleep

I'm falling forward while you wait behind
Lost for your reasons and missing your time
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm
Wishing for you (falling forward)
And I, I, I'm, I, I, I'm

We are sailing in a ship that's got no sails
We are riding on a train right off the rails
We are in an old sedan that's lost a wheel
But it makes no difference to the way we feel

It's been a long time - seems like a lifetime
To be where we are
Take a little tumble, fall and maybe stumble
Now we've gone so far

All along the highways of the sun

No one knows how far it is we have to go
Because every step we take reveals some more
But we'll keep right on as far as the eye can see
Over there where landman scares appear to be

Crusing down the highways of the sun

All along the driveways of the sun

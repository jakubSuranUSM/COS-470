Don’t be, don’t be so cold 
Bones rust decay and mold 
Head first, it is what it is 
Youth lost kicks us to live
I am contagious, I am breaking down
I am nothing, I am no one’s fault
I am contagious, I am plagued with lies 
Flesh of our fathers, I am no one’s fault
Let go don’t be so vain
All the masses all the names 
Look out and into the sky 
Full of light, fullof life
I am contagious, I am breaking down
I am nothing, I am no one’s fault
I am contagious, I am plagued with lies 
Flesh of our fathers, I am no one’s fault
Crystals in the night, we are surrounded
I am contagious, I am breaking down
I am nothing, I am no one’s fault
I am contagious, I am plagued with lies 
Flesh of our fathers, I am no one’s fault

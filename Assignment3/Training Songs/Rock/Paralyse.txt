I see the smoke clear but I ain't watching the screen 
I get the joke, and yes I know what it means 
Don't think I'm dead I still believe it 
You all come and go but nobody sees it 
Been walking round like a space cadet 
With a bubble around my head 
I don't remember the things you taught me 
I just remember the things you said 
Are lies that paralyse 
Don't step on me man look at your own skies 
Lies add no surprise 
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise 

A pointless phone call, imminent panic 
I got the main ball, but I don't want it 
Pull down the blind I think I'm in it again 
Why don't we ever get the signals we send? 

And when the threads are false and warn 
I just want to be reborn 
I think I'm getting the pains again 
I think I've lost all my so called friends 
Are lies that paralyse 
Don't step on me man look at your own skies 
Lies add no surprise 
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise 

Been walking around like a space cadet 
With a bubble around my head 
I don't remember the things you taught me 
I just remember the things you said 
Are lies that paralyse 
Don't step on me man look at your own skies 
Lies add no surprise 
I get the feeling that its me and the sunrise 
Lies that paralyse 
Don't step on me man look at your own skies 
Lies add no surprise 
I get the feeling that its me and the sunrise.

You look through your window and you think you've made your name
Now there's worry and roses circulating in your brain.

Do you remember that dream ? Has it come true?
Aren't you worried what people gonna think to you?

I wanna see the beginning and never see the end
Get on up there and play now, don't you know you've got some friends?
Let me hear your music loud and new
Keep on going yeah, buddies bash on through.

Play don't worry
Play don't care
Don't you think about them
Start your dreaming again of tomorrow.

Don't you know it's big business to be a big hit band ?
Your potential's enormous, don't you eat right out of their hands ?
Keep on playing right now, I wish you would
Uh keep on playing right now, I think you should.

Play don't worry
Play don't care
Don't you think about them
Start your dreaming again of tomorrow.

Play don't worry
Play don't care
Don't you think about them
Start your dreaming again of tomorrow.

Da da da de da da da

Let's go

It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change that for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

Ooh, ooh

I sold my soul to the open road
Now I live my life alone
You'll find me in the same spot believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed
I write what I feel, I say what I mean
You can't buy sincerity

I sold my soul to the open road
Now I live my life alone
You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

Don't forget yourselves, we've made up our minds
We signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted lines

Don't forget yourselves, we've made up our minds
We signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted lines

You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong

You'll find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down

Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leavin' and not coming back

You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all, this town will be the downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us all
Downfall of us all

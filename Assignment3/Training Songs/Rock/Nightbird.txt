And the summer became the fall
I was not ready for the winter
It makes no difference at all
'Cause I wear boots all summer long

My eye make up is dark and it's careless
Some circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin
Is my eyes without any shadow

And when I call
Will you walk gently
Through my shadow
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of
The ones who walk away
Capes pulled around them tight
Cryin' for the night
Cry for the night bird tonight

And so the winter is really here now
And the blankets that I love
I am surrounded sometimes
By too much love

And when I call
Will you walk gently
Through my shadow
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of
The ones who walk away
Capes pulled around them tight
Cryin' for the night
Cry for the night bird tonight

And the darkened eyes
Through the net of the lace
In the darkness
It's hard to see her face
Pulls back the net
And you feel the touch 
Of her fingers
And you see she turns the eyes
And you see the eyes of a night bird
The ones you dream of
Finally the night bird
Finally the night bird
Tonight

She was standing at the station 
Small town suitcase in her hand 
There were dreams she found inside her 
That no one cared to understand 
She never talks about her childhood 
So much past to leave behind 
She's so scared to go 
But still she says goodbye 
When you walk on that road 
You walk alone 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
When your only hope 
Is to find a home 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
The great unknown 

Born and raised in poverty 
Daddy died when he was young 
All the fears that raged inside him 
His spirit needs to overcome 
Each day he tears down the reflection 
Of who he used to be 
And with a little luck 
He'll rise eventually 

When you walk that road 
When you walk alone 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
When your only hope 
Is to find a home 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
The great unknown 

In the search of our salvation 
Relentlessly we climb 
Just looking for a reason 
In creation's grand design 
If patience is a virtue 
Then let us humbly begin 
We'll be here waiting 
'Til our ship comes sailing in 

When you walk that road 
When you walk alone 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
When your only hope 
Is to find a home 
You're just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
In the great unknown 
Don't want to walk through life 
An undiscovered soul 

Searching for the road 
Looking for a home 
In the great unknown 
Don't want to walk through life 
An undiscovered soul 

Searching for the road 
Looking for a home 
In the great unknown 
Don't want to walk through life 
An undiscovered soul 

Patience, virtue, identify, soul

Now, when you're coming through the door
I'll tell you what I'm looking for
You gotta sit down honey
'Cause everything will be alright

Ooooh-hoo!
Everything's alright
I say, hey
Everything's alright
Guitar yeah!

Oooooh-hoo!
Everything will be alright

Lord, lord, lord
Everything will be alright

Good god,

Give it to me
'Cause everything will be alright
Rolling, rolling, rolling, yeah
Everything will be alright.

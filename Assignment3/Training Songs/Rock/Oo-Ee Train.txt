Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

Well, I never had me no money
Never had me no money
Never had me no money
I ain't that kind of guy

Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

I'm gonna work to the good Lord calls me
Be workin' to the good Lord calls me
I work until the good Lord calls me
It'll be in the by and by

Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

Jailer, if you see my baby
Jailer, if you see my baby
Jailer, if you see my baby
Just tell her I said: "Bye bye"

Everybody
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

Everybody
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

One more time
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kind-a dry

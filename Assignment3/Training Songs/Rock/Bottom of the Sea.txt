I swam to the bottom of the sea 
For you 
I climbed to the top of the trees 
For you  
I swam to the bottom of the sea 
For you 
I climbed to the top of the trees 
For you  

Farewell my lovely 
Your face has shriveled up
In the heat of the sun 	
Yeah I said so long, bye to thee  	
No more of your ugly ways  	
And not a word to no one  
	
I tried hard to be a different freak
For you
Oh I got up so early just for you
For you  
Yeah I swam to the bottom of the sea 
For you 
I climbed to the top of the trees 
For you  
	
Farewell my lovely 
No more of your ugly words  
You little bitch  
Yeah I said so long bye to thee
You don't know how much I hated your presence here  
	
There is a sound
A dusty sound
That smothers 'round you
Tries to shroud your thinking somehow  
And there's a heart, a broken heart 
Inside it's molten rock
It split and ran down my chest 
There is a sound, a dusty sound 
That smothers when you
Tries to shroud your thinking somehow  
There is a heart, a broken heart
Inside it's molten rock
It split and ran down my chest  
	
I say well bye farewell so long to thee 
And no more of you
You little witch 
Oh I say farewell my lovely 
You don't know how much I hated your presence here   
Yeah I say so long, bye to thee 
No more of your ugly ways and ugly words
Yeah I say bye, farewell, so long to thee 
No more of you, you little witch  
	
I swam to the bottom of the sea for you 
I climbed to top of the trees 
For you

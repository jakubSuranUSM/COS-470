Somewhere the sun is always shining,
Somewhere the breeze blows in another brand new day,
So let us gather up our tears
We'll save them for a rainy day.

Come on let's fill our world with laughter,
Let's put the sunshine into everybody's heart,
Then peace will last for ever after
Oh what a lovely start.

It gives you hope for a brand new day,
Have faith in love it will show the way,
Happiness, who could ask for anything more,
So realise there's no need to hide,
Show yourself to the world outside,
Don't you know that the world is an open door,
Don't you know that love's the key to open any door.

Don't you know that love's the key to open any door.

The earth is good, why do we abuse it,
Our land, our seas, our skies, let's try our wings and fly
Across green meadows hand in hand,
Let's be the brotherhood of man,
Come on, let's fill our world with laughter,
Let's put the sunshine into everybody's heart,
Then peace will last for ever after,
And that's a lovely start.

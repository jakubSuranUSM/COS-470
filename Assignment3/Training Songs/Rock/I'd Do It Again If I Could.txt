You and I've got something caught between our eyes 
A figure of fun and a teller of lies 
You and I need nothing more to taint our lives 
Would I do it to you? Well I'll do it this time 

I'd do it again if I could 
I'd do it again if you told me I should 
I'd do it again for you my love 
Follow me and I'll do it again 

You and I feel nothing - we're anaesthetised 
When you've got no shame you've got nothing to hide 
Just one click of your heels and I'd lend you my soul 
Would I do it for you? Well I do what I'm told 

I'd do it again if I could 
I'd do it again if you told me I should 
I'd do it again for you my love 
Follow me and I'll do it again

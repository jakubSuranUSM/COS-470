You sat down
Staggered out
You're acting strange
And I feel tense
As I can sense
That you're insane
Your eyes on fire
Burning bright
Your lips are wet
I thought you could have
Pulled a gun
You took out your cigarette
And it looked to me
Like you've been going down too long
It looked to me
Like you've been on the ground too long
Then later on
I'm going home
I think I see you everywhere
Down in the station
Round a corner
In the darkness
You wait to catch me unaware
Will it be you
Walking me home
And I feel strange
Like I've been in this town too long
You make me strange
Since I've been hanging round too long
You sat down
Staggered out
You're acting strange
And I feel tense
As I can sense
That you're insane
I look for you
Walking me home
It's funny how
Since I've been hanging round too long
I've been in this town too long

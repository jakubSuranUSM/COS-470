Canadian mounted baby, a police force that works
Red and black, that's their color scheme
Get their man, in the end

It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my honey knows it's all right
It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my baby knows it's all right
c'mon little husky

Frontenac Chateau baby
I'll cross the frontier at ten
Got a whip in my hand baby
And a girl or a husky at leather's end

It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my honey knows it's all right
It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my baby knows it's all right

Horn swoop me bungo pony, dogsled on ice
Make a dash for freedom baby don't skate on polar ice
It's too think to be sliced by the light
Of long and white polar nights

It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my honey knows it's all right
It's all right (repeat four more times)
Oh yeah my baby knows it's all right

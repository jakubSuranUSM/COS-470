Help the aged,
One time they were just like you
Drinking, smoking cigs and sniffing glue
Help the aged
Don't just put them in a home
Can't have much fun when they're all on their own
Give a hand, if you can
Try and help them to unwind
Give them hope and give them comfort
'Cause they're running out of time

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover, baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

Help the aged
'Cause one day you'll be older too
You might need someone who can pull you through
And if you look very hard
Behind those lines upon their face
You may see where you are headed
And it's such a lonely place, oh

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover baby
Teach you stuff although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

You can dye your hair but it's the one thing you can't change
Can't run away from yourself, yourself, yours-s-s-s-self

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away.
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover, baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away
Oh, it's funny how it all falls away
Funny how it all falls away
Oh, it's funny how it all, how it all falls away
So help the aged

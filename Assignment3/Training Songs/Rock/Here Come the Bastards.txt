Here they come
Here come the bastards
I heard it from a confidant
Who heard it form a confidant

They're definitely on their way
There's one with this idea
Something about a hammer head shark
Nosehairs and flatus

Best keep your distance because
Here they come here come the bastards
Bury your head deep in the sand
Anonymity is a virtue in this day and age

Amazing hand dexterity
Flagrant misuse of security
Better run, run, run, run, run
Run run run run, here they come.

She went out
And found
Her father face down on the ground
Out in the cold

Walked her way 'round
A hill where the sun's sinking down
Into the snow

Oh, white caps of the waves slap
Like last hand claps
And the dark
Water dies in the crash
Is sucked back with a moan
Smoke on the coast
And old, piled fathers
Soft-sighing daughters
Where does it go

It's a dream now
I'll describe
Let your mind drift on down
Like so
To when the world was young
Big sky
Blue with a dead
Bachelor's tongue
Blood-red bloom on the rose

So, some line someone told
Says, "Even light can get old"
Oh, slobbering lovers
Drink-clinking brothers
They don't have to tell us
'Cause we know

"What a way down
What a ride
What a slide
Spin around
What a life to have known
What a time"

And how
I was singing out in a crowd
Of a thousand of the most frightening faces I've known
When the lighthouse
Lending a sight, finally went out
What a fright we felt in that night
Friends, just shout it all out
All the 'why's and 'no-no's
All the cries in your throat

How right
We felt
With our hands tightly closed
Around something we broke
And then our whimpering sisters
Sobbing well-wishers

Well, it's over
Just let my hand go

Well I can't exist
When you disappear
Disintegrate tonight
Swallow everything

Sister don't be scared
A thousand times or more
I've walked away alive
On my feet again

(Kill/Give your life/love?)
I will wait for you mother
I will wait for you father
I will wait for you sister
I will wait for you brother

But I can't exist
So I can't explain
How I lost a thousand dollars
On the street again

Sister don't be scared
A thousand times or more
I've walked away alive
On my feet again

(Kill/Give your life/love?)
I will wait for you mother
I will wait for you father
I will wait for you sister
I will wait for you brother

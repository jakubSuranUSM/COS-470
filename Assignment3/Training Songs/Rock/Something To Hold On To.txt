It's where you go when you're in danger
And how you open your disguise
It's your uncompromising anger
It's how you cope with all your ties
If you look over your shoulder
You'll find a kindred soul in me
Never said that it was easy
But I need to make you see

When the time comes 'round don't slip away
Give me something to hold on to (Something to hold on to)
I'll give you more than you came for
You give me something to hold on to

It's how you look when you are angry
About the things you say you see
The way you search for what you're after
I wish you'd look around at me
I look for you in Blue Jay Way
But I find you wouldn't stay
I never said that it was easy

When the time comes 'round don't slip away
Give me something to hold on to (Something to hold on to)
I'll give you more than you came for
You give me something to hold on to (Something you can hold on to)
You're the Jacaranda in my morning
You're my laser in the night (Something to hold on to)
When the time comes 'round don't slip away (Something you can hold on to)
You give me something to hold on to

In fields of love and indecision
I'll find you lying in the sun
I might trap you in my whirlpool
Where there's nowhere left to run
Where there's nowhere left to run

When the time comes 'round don't slip away
You give me something to hold on to (Something to hold on to)
I'll give you more than you came for
You give me something to hold on to (Something you can hold on to)
When the time comes 'round don't slip away (Something to hold on to)
When the time comes 'round don't slip away (Something you can hold onto)
You give me something to hold on to

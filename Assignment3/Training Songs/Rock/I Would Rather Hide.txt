Yeah, yeah
I know we're all insane when there's no one else around
Yeah, yeah
I know we're all insane when there's no one else,
And there's no one left you can blame

In the night I'm on my own
Unglue my mind and burn my telephone

I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside inside
I would rather hide

I feel a phantom fly from my fear
(Ain't goin' nowhere)
follows the voice I sometimes hear
(Ain't goin' nowhere)

I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside inside
I would rather hide

Yeah, yeah
I know we're all insane when there's no one else around
Yeah, yeah
I know we're all insane when there's no one else,
and there's no one left you can blame

I think aliens abducted me
I close my eyes if I want to see

I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside inside
I would rather hide

I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside inside
I would rather hide

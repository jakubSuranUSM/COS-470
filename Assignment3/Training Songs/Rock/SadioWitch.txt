Enslaved to the black drug
Her web surrounding me
It knows my weakness
Forever my Priestess

The black drug took my soul away
Her venom my blood
My tortured mind is numb
Now I am a slave
Forever in her chains

The night is in my veins
For an hour I'll rule eternally
But I walk amongst the dead
My obsessions killing all around me

The black drug took my soul away
Her venom my blood
My tortured mind is numb
Now I am a slave
Forever in her chains
There's nothing here to find
The night is in my veins
Sadiowitch
Sadiowitch
Sadiowitch
Sadiowitch

The black drug took my soul away
Her venom my blood
My tortured mind is numb
Now I am a slave
Forever in her chains
There's nothing here to find

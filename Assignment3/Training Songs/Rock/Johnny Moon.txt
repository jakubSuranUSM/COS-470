Answers the question before it`s asked
You can see Johnny but he`s not here
Nobody saw Johnny disappear
Mother says his mama`s too easy

Letting him come and go as he pleases
Walls and windows won`t do it
Lock the door
Johnny goes right through it

It`s so hard to get his attention
When he`s out there in another dimension
Johnny I want to follow you outside
I want to feel that high

It`s so hard to get his attention
When he`s out there in another dimension
Johnny, I want to follow you outside
I want to feel that high

Johnny, you, I can pretend with
You`re only one I can really bend with
Take me `cross the river Styx
Fill my eyes with fire tricks

Anything you got up your sleeve
Anything you tell me, Johnny, I`ll believe
It`s so hard to get your attention
When you`re out there in another dimension

Johnny, I want to follow you outside
I want to feel that high

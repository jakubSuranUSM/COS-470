Simple sister 
Got whooping cough 
Have to burn her toys 
Take her treats 
Eat her sweets 
Scare off all the boys 

Simple sister 
Got whooping cough 
Have to put her out 
Wear her clothes 
Steal her bows 
Tell her that she's stout 

Simple sister 
Got whooping cough 
Lock her in a cell 
Throw the key 
Into the sea 
Hope she never gets well

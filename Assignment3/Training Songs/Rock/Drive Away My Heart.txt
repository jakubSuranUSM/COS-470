Fear is no longer hanging around
You should capture my view
Cause I don't want nothing else but you

You can treat me like you please
Baby, it's OK with me
Leave me bleeding on the floor
From my heart, from my heart's core

Oh, drive away my heart tonight
Cause it is no loner mine
Drive away my heart tonight
Cause it's no longer mine

I wanna give you love
I wanna show you love
And so love will be my grave
Love will be my grave

Oh, drive away my heart tonight
Cause it is no longer mine
Drive away my heart tonight
Cause it's no longer mine

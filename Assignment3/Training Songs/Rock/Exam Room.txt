Now you've got 40 more years
To go drown in your tears
And the little hand's slower
Than the big hand, honey

With your heart up high
You keep asking why, oh why
Don't you know, don't you know
That the answer's in your home
Feel that hole

I know what it feels like, baby
If only you and I were one
I know what you're asking for, honey
This thing we're going through ain't no fun

Now you got 40 more years
To go drown in your tears
And the little hand's slower
Than the big hand, honey

With your heart up high
You keep asking why, oh why
Don't you know, don't you know
That the answer's in your home
Feel the hole

Just too soon
I know you know about it
Some nights are hard to see
What about the love we had together, honey
We're only friends and that's not me

Now you've got 40 more years
To go drown in your tears
And the little hand's slower
Than the big hand, honey

With your heart up high
You keep asking why, oh why
Don't you know, don't you know
That the answer's in your home
Feel the hole

Now you've got 40 more years
To go drown in your tears
And the little hand's slower
Than the big hand, honey

With your heart up high
You keep asking why, oh why
Don't you know, don't you know
That the answer's in your home

Now you've got 40 more years
To go drown in your tears
And the little hand's slower
Than the big hand, honey

With your heart up high
You keep asking why, oh why
Don't you know, don't you know
That the answer's in your home
Feel the hole

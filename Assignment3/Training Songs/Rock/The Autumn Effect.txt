Casting a cool breeze
Supplied by the autumn
Question where it went wrong
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Kindly could you re-evaluate
Autumn's animated growth

Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Keep on fighting
One died from
Burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly
Stole the breath of body, mind, and soul

Try and come to willingly embrace
Karma's kiss of withering decay
Death feeds, hell breeds
Subside in the autumn

Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of
Beauty as we know
Keep on fighting
One died from
Burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly
Stole the breath of body, mind, and-

Silent beauty
No one cares
Silent ending
No one is there

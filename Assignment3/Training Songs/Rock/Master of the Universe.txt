I am the master of this universe and I've got so big it hurts. Raise your
Eyes and graze your kness because your master is displeased, because you
Dared to doubt his word, his polished surface dulls and cracks. Your
Bitter laughter breaks his back. I am the master of this universe. I
Taught you everything you know. Now you must bear your master's curse for
I will not let you go. Now you must walk this town 'til down in every
Public open place, your master's look upon your face. Oh now look what you
Have done; you've spoilt it all for everyone. The master masturbates alone
In a corner of your home. You feed him scraps when in the mood. You beat
Him hard and keep him nude. You cut your master down to size. Now he
Cries and he cries now. Now he begs both night and day. He lets you take
Him on your knee. He comes on losing consciousness, he dearly loves his
New mistress. Now he repeats it every night. Every night on point og
Death - "You are the master of the universe". You are the master of the
Universe.

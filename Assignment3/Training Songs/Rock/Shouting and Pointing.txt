There's trouble coming
I feel it deep in my bones
I can't avoid it, no way,
Gotta face it, not gonna be long
It's got me shouting, pointing, 
panting, begging tonight
I need some people
To see me through it
Loving me right

Gonna pull some tarts together
Better dress them up in leather
Gonna find some kindred spirits
Gonna throw the searchlight in it
Want some volunteers!

You do and you do and you do
Get in to trouble
And maybe you do and you do and you do
Get in to luck
''cause I've been shouting, pointing, panting
And when it's done
We're gonna walk out smiling, laughing
Because we won!

Gonna pull... (etc)
Watch out, they'll get ya
They're hiding under your nose
They'll try to dare you, scare you, snare you
Stand on your toes
''cause they'll be shouting, pointing, panting
And when it's done
We're gonna settle down a-loving, and a-howling
Because we won

Gonna pull... (etc)

I've come over here today
Just to show you
A short letter word
Perhaps a crime

Is that anyway to know
That I adore you
A matter of words
A matter of time

But you try to criticize
You come and I'll do it now

I've come over here again
Just to know you
A four letter word
To know you better

It won't be the usual disguise
I'm gonna know you
Just to show you
Just to show you

I've done everything I can
Just to ignore you
A matter of fat
And now it's a crime

But you try a different size
You come and I'll do it now

It won't be the usual disguise
I'm gonna know you
Just to show you
Just to show you

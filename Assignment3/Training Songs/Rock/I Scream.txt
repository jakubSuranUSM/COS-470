All scorn me
A monster should be feared
Witch hunt blame
Regret and f*ck the day

I scream

Fallen leaves
From the same family tree
Wind blown halves
Regret is all that's left, all that's left

Words cut deeply, no secrecy
So long since seeing, my life time appealing
The two are not healing
I cannot help feeling regret, regret

Reflecting on our memories
We know the pains of living
And I know he's seeing both of we
Regret he would not want to be

I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream

I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream
I scream

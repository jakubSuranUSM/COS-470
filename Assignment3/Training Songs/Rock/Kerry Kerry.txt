Well at least can't you 
Look at me when I'm speaking to you? 
Because there are things I've got to say 
Well what was he sneaking to you 
When you thought I'd looked away? 
I get it, I get it 
Now I understand just what you're playing 
I get it, I get it 
I guess there isn't any point delaying 
You would rather that I wasn't here 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
You bought him presents with my money 
That makes me feel just great, although 
I've got to say that it is kind of funny 
That you could think I'd never know 
I get it, I get it
It was just another way of saying 
I get it, I get it 
That you really didn't want me staying 
Oh I bet you just wish that I'd disappear 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
Lying in my bed 
You remember when 
It was you who said 
That we'd never be apart again 
But now the longer that I hang around 
The more anxious that you get 
Oh it looks like Romeo has found 
A nervous Juliet 
Because you would rather that I wasn't here 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
Oh I bet you just wish that I'd disappear 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear

What makes you forget is the structure
You're in, all your life
Can't you feel there is the animal inside
Growing roots, still, inside your mind

Suppress your underbeing and let them rule
You don't care, yeah you don't give a damn
As long as you've got your car
Do you actually go so far, as giving in your
Adrenaline away

You're the minstrel gigolo
Don't you know
You sing your songs of love so soft
And low
And they want you more and more

All the young and lonely girls wait
For you
There by the backstage door
And they're hoping to
Be the one

And when you start to sing
You will be their everything
And when you start to sing
Every woman will open up her heart
And let you in

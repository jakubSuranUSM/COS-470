I never had much but I gave what I had
I've been abused, I've been so sad
Now I've seen the errors of my ways
Said goodbye to all my happy days

I'm gonna try to see my way again
ain't gonna be easy ain't got a friend
I know, I ain't gonna lose
Ain't gonna lose my way again

Now I've seen the errors of my ways
Said goodbye to all my happy days

I never had much but I gave what I had
I've been abused, I've been so sad
I know, I ain't gonna lose 
Ain't gonna lose my way again

Time may pass but I may still remain [Repeat]

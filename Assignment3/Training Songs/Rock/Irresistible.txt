I wish you could be be here, I'm sending you my best
It's easy to reach here, no geography test
And here's a confession, I'm willing to contest
The truth I heard since I was small

I'm having a good time, we're doing all twice
I'm happy to be here, we're learning to survive
I'm easing my conscience by putting it on ice
It's so warm, so warm, so warm and getting warmer

One thing I know
Truth can be irresistible
One thing I know
Truth is the key, how can it be so irresistible?

It's lovely to be here, the people are so kind
I'm talking to soldiers, they're picketing my mind
I'd rather be simple and think like a child
I don't read the papers, I take as I find

They're building a new town, there's rubble in the streets
The children are playing, there's no trick and no treats
There's smoke in the sunshine, this is paradise in heat
It's so warm, so warm, so warm and getting warmer

One thing I know
Truth can be irresistible
One thing I know
Truth is the key, how can it be so irresistible?

I'm going to rest now, the thunder has died down
I'm looking for peace now, I've had it with this town
We're learning to handle a weapon we found
It's so warm, so warm, so warm and getting warmer

One thing I know
Truth can be irresistible
One thing I know
Truth is the key, how can it be so irresistible?

It comes all shapes and sizes
It's something you can never buy
Don't wait until it's over
Before you say it's all been fun
Obituary columns are filled with love 

Don't wait until I'm waving
And drowning in a sea of tears
It is too late tomorrow
Obituary columns are filled with love
Filled with love

If everybody said it to
The person that they feel it for
Then their heart
Would be full and free

It comes all shapes and sizes
It's something you can never buy
Don't wait
Don't wait

Obituary columns are filled with love
Filled with love

Don't wait until it's over
Don't wait until it's over
Obituary columns are filled with love
Filled with love
Filled with love
Filled with love
Filled with love

Over and Over baby
Making you play this game
If true love waits
It's a big mistake
No need to feel ashamed

[Chorus]
When the prices stop
We're all goin' to drop
I don't care if we get caught
When the prices stop
We're all goin' to drop
I don't care what you been taught
I say baby, you say bumping
All you want to do is get real jumpy
When the prices stop
We're all goin' to drop, all goin' to drop, all goin' to drop

If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
I sure know it's apocalypse
But Can't it wait to kiss your lips
If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you

Baby

You make me feel so helpless
I need you after school
I'm so tired of kissing
Truly missing
Making me a fool

[Chorus]

You never want to give me some
You never know from kingdom come
If the lord take you tonight
Come on baby treat me right

Don't believe in [unknown]
You're going to give me your last dance

If half of what they say is true
Look at me when I rock with you
Rock with you, 
Rock with you,
Rock with you,

[Chorus]

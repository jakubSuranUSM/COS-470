Let it slide overhead
When I believe in you my soul can rest
But as love that's really love can never fail
But fail it does
When we shine like the sun
You seem the only one my only friend

You're so pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
When you're faithful

I resigned from myself
Took a break as someone else
It's like we've come undone
But I've only just become inflatable for you

You're so pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
When you're faithful

I don't mind most of the time
But you push me so far inside

You're so pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
So pretty in white pretty when you're faithful
When you're faithful
When you're faithful

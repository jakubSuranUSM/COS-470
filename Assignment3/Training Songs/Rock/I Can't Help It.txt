I just can't help myself
You've got control of me
I'm not the kind who likes to hang around
I just can't help myself
I should walk away
But something's telling me to stay

I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
I can't stop it
And I'm not gonna try to
I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
Got to fill this emptiness inside

I just can't help myself
You've got control of me
It's a tragedy what you have done to me
A major catastrophe
It's getting out of control
You could stop it if you tried

I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
I can't stop it
And I'm not gonna try to
I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
Got to fill this emptiness inside

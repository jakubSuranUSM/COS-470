I am the driver of an underground train
Chaos in the streets above, to me it's all the same
I shake your houses, then I'm gone keeping time down here below
I could drive my train to hell, not a soul would know

I am the driver of an underground train
Just imagine who I am and breathe the letters of my name
Any time you say the word my wheels and humming on the line
We'll be meeting face to face, we'll be meeting face to face, somewhere beyond the danger sign

I am the driver of an underground train
The lonely life can't bother me, far away from wind and pain
I come upon the station lights with a mighty rushing sound
Listen for the hiss of brakes in tunnels underneath your town

I am the driver of an underground train
Climb aboard, just climb aboard, your loss is my eternal gain
Squeeze your precious body in before I quickly close the doors
Come riding in the smoky dark, where you are mine, and I am yours.

High On A Horse

Ain't no doctor, who can help the way I feel.
Once you got her, boy, she let's you know it's real.

Learn to love her, or the opposite is right.
To rise above her, you'll be so high you're out of sight

Feel so good, yeah! That you never want to come down.
But you should, yeah! If you want to stay around.

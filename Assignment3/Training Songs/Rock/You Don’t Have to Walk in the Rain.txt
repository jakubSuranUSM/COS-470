I looked at your face; is that the face I love? 
It's been a long time since I've seen you 
You've got a lovely place; the kids must send their love 
We stood there lonely, baby, without you 

CHORUS: 
& girl, you don't have to walk in the rain 
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before 
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl 
When you walk through my door, you'll be home 

I was so afraid I almost turned away 
But you know I need somebody to cling to 
I looked at your face; I love you anyway 
It's been a long time since I've seen you 

(chorus twice, then repeat its 1st line & fade)

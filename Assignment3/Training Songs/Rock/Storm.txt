Storms out on the water
I watch you getting closer
Are you coming home
All these years with wonder

Trying to break the cycle
All these years of hope
In my heart feels the strange
But it makes me like I'm alive again

Sometimes in our lives
We need to pain
So I find some candles
Put out all the anchors

Pull the shadows down
Make me think about us
All the things that got lost
Still we're holding on

From the storm rushes in
But it makes me feel I'm alive again
Sometimes in our lives
We need to pain

The wind, the rain, the storm will wash us clean again
The wind, the rain, the storm will shake us sober again
The wind, the rain, the storm will make us think again
The wind
And maybe we can start again

Storms out on the water
Seeing skies become one
Are you coming home

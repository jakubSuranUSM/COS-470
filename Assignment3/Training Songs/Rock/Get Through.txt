And I can chase away the fears
The ones you've built up all these years
You don't have to hide away
When you're talking to me 

And we don't have to change our dreams
It's getting near or so it seems
That will never change a thing
You're talking to me 

And I'm feeling stronger now
I'm feeling stronger now 

Cos living in the Summer is easy
And it's living in the Winter that's hard
But we'll get through 

And I can fade away the days
The ones you're feeling out of place
Promises are all I make
But still you believe 

Well, it's not how it's supposed to be
I'm running out of faith I see
Should have done things differently
But still you believe 

So I'm feeling stronger now
I'm feeling stronger now 

Cos living in the Summer is easy
And it's living in the Winter that's hard
But we'll get through

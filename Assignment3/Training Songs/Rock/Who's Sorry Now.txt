Ah ah uh uh
Who's sorry now? 
Who's sorry now?
Whose heart is achin' for breakin' each vow?
Who's sad and blue, who's cryin' too?
Just like I cried over you

(Ah ah uh uh) right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

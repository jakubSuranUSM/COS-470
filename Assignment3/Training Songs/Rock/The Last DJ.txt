Well, you can't turn him into the company man,
You can't turn him into a whore,
And the boys upstairs just don't understand anymore.
Well, the top brass don't like him talking so much,
And he won't play what they say to play,
And he don't wanna change what don't need to change.

Chorus:
And there goes the last DJ
Who plays what he wants to play,
And says what he wants to say,
Hey hey hey.
And there goes your freedom of choice,
There goes the last human voice,
And there goes the last DJ.

Well, some folks say they gotta hang him so high,
Coz' you just can't do what he did.
There's some things you just can't put in the minds of those kids.
As we celebrate mediocrity,
All the boys upstairs want to see,
How much you'll pay for what you used to get for free.

(Repeat Chorus)

Well, he got in a station down in Mexico,
And sometimes it'll kinda come in,
And I'll bust a move and remember how it was back then.

(Repeat Chorus)

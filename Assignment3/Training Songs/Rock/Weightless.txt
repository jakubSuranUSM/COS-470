(Weightless)

It's the firing line again
And I'm waiting in the blindfold
Every feeling has been erased
And I'm floating on the wind of despair
There's a fine line between us
Like a mountain and a landslide
I'm way up in the clouds
And I'm never coming down

Weightless, nothing to hold me down
Weightless and its cold in space
(Weightless now)
I'm weightless now
(Weightless now)
So weightless now

In the firing line again
It's no different from the last time
I'm falling from the sky
And things will never be the same

Weightless, nothing to hold me down
Weightless and its cold in space
(Falling from the sky)
So cold
So cold
(Weightless now)

Weightless, nothing to hold me down
Weightless and its cold in space
Weightless, feeling weightless now (weightless now)
So weightless now

(Falling from the sky, weightless)
I'm falling, falling from the sky
(Weightless)
I'm falling from the sky
Feeling weightless now
I'm weightless now, so weightless now
(Falling from the sky)

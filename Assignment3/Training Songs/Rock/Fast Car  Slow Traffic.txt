Zoomin' in and out
Of the slow traffic mumble
Tryin' to make the lights
Get me out of the jungle

It's been a long day
And my head's all gone
I'm tryin' to make the bridge
Before the sun goes down

Fast car, slow traffic
Fast car, slow traffic
Fast car, slow traffic
Fast car, slow traffic

Zoomin' in and out
Through the slow traffic mumble
Tryin' to make the lights
Get me out of the jungle

It's been a long day
And my head's all gone
I'm tryin' to make the bridge
Before the sun goes down

Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)
Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)

Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)
Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)

Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)
Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)

Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)
Fast car, slow traffic
(Slow traffic, slow traffic)

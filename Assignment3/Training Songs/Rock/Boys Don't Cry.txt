I would say I'm sorry if I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time I have said too much been too unkind

I would break down at your feet and beg forgiveness plead with you
But I know that it's no use 'cause now there's nothing I can do

I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes

'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I love you if I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's too late 'cause you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
I took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more, more

I would do most anything to get you back by my side
But I'll just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes

'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

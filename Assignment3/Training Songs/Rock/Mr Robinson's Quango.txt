Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Oh Mr. Robinson and his quango
Dirty dealer, expensive car
Runs the buses and the Evening Star

He got a hairpiece 
Ooh he got herpes
His private life is very discreet
A nicer man no you're never gonna meet
And he's a self professed savior of the dim right wing
He got respiratory problems and a mason's ring

Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Oh Mr. Robinson and his quango
Drinks with generals and county wives
And the family business is doing all right
(Ah) They're doing tangos down in the quangos
He makes 'em tick ooh he makes them tock
And if you don't fit he'll put you in the dock
Just sits in his leather chair and twiddles his thumbs
Gets his secretary in and pinches her bum

Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh

He ran into the toilet in the town hall
He got his biro out and he wrote on the wall:
"I'm wearing black French knickers under my suit
I've got stockings and suspenders on I'm feeling rather loose
Oh I'm a naughty boy
Oh, I'm a naughty, naughty boy"
I said ooh!

He's a self professed savior of the dim right wing
He got respiratory problems and a mason's ring

Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh
Ooh ah ooh

Ooh, I'm a naughty boy (naughty, naughty boy)
Ooh, I'm a naughty, naughty boy

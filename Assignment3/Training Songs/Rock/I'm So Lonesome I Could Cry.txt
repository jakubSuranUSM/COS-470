Hear that lonesome whippoorwill 
He sounds too blue to fly 
That old midnight train oh, she's whinin' low 
I'm so lonesome I think I'm gonna cry 

Did you ever see the night so long
When time goes crawlin' by? 
That old moon it just went behind the cloud
To hide it's face, hey and cry 

Did you ever, ever see the robin weep 
You know when leaves begin to die? 
Well, that means he's lost the will to live 
I'm gettin' so lonesome I, I-hi could cry

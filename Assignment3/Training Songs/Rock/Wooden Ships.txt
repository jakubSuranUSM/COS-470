If you smile at me you know I will understand
'Cause that is something everybody everywhere does
In the same language

I can see by your coat my friend that you're from the other side
There's just one thing I got to know
Can you tell me please who won
You must try some of my purple berries
I been eating them for six or seven weeks now
Haven't got sick once

Probably keep us both alive, yeah

Wooden ships on the water very free and easy
Easy you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free and easy

Sail away where the morning sun goes high
Sail away where the wind blows sweet and young birds fly
Take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this barren land
Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cry 
Stare as all you human feelings die
We are leaving
You don't need us

Oh
Go and take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this foreign land
Somewhere where we might laugh again
We are leaving
You don't need us (need us, no)
You don't need us

Sailing ships on the water very free and easy
Easy you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free
And gone
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh) no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh)
Ride the music, ride the music, ride the music
Go ride the music (oh ride), oh ride the music (oh ride), oh, ride the music, c'mon

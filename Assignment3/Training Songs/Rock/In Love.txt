Hey, I feel lonely
But I got so many different women on my mind
It's uncool, to be kind
Why do you keep on running?
Why do you keep on humming?
It's uncool, to be kind
Kinda, kinda like I'm in love

I'm in Love

Oh, I believed ya
But when I saw you coming I couldn't concede yeah
It's uncool, to be kind
Why do you keep on running?
Why do you keep on humming?
It's uncool, to be kind
Kinda, kinda like I'm in love

I'm in love

Girl when we say that we're in love
We best believe that we're in love
But I don't know
Don't know what I'm saying..

Oh, baby this happens all of the time
And sugar yeah it's driving me wild 

I'm in love

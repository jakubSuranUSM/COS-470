Just a kiss
Just a smile
Hold my hand baby
Once in a while
That's all I need 
That's all I need
And I'll be satisfied

Think of me
When you're away
Call me darling
Just once a day
That's all I need
That's all I need
And I'll be satisfied

Oh, true love came to me
When I met you
True love makes me know
I won't forget you
When you're around me
It makes me feel that 
Life is worth livin' baby
Love is so forgiving

Just a kiss
Just a smile
Hold my hand, baby
Just once in a while
That's all I need
That's all I need
And I'll be, no no no no no
That's all I need
That's all I need
And I'll be
Yeah yeah yeah
That's all I need 
That's all I need
And I'll be so satisfied

Sit right down if you can spare me a minute
I got a tale that's bound to break your heart
Concerns my brother, who's thin and played violin
Got it in his head that an IQ is all you need

He went his way; I couldn't discover mine
I didn't worry if I ever saw him again
He's made a profit while I don't even own a pocket
And the last I heard he was sitting at the top of the tree
Wait a minute

Late last night, reading my underground press
Came a knock on the door; thought it was the third world war
Lord above, I did not recognize him
I said have a cup of coke here, maybe that's all you need

He said the smell of the city, kid - it's trying to kill me
My eyes are getting muddy, Christ; I'm aging fast
My kind of music I knew - it wasn't gonna to be simple
But have a quick listen, kid, maybe that's all you need

Don't stop; you make me feel much better
Tell me, my brother, do you think that's all I need?
Yeah, yeah

Don't it make you happy?
Well, well, well, well, well

That's all you need

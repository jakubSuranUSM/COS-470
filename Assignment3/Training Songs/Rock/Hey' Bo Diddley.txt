Bo diddley done had a farm,
On that farm he had some women,
Women here, women there,
Women, women, women everywhere.

But one little girl lived on a hill,
She rustled and tustled like buffalo bill,
One day she decided she'd go for a ride,
With a pistol and a sword by her side.

She rolled right up to my front door,
Knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore,
When she turned and walked away,
All I could hear my baby say:

Hey bo diddley, oh bo diddley,
Hey bo diddley, oh bo diddley.

Saw my baby run across the field,
Slippin' and slidin' like an automobile,
Hollerin', my baby got towed away,
Slipped on from me like a cadillac-8.

Hey bo diddley, oh bo diddley,
Hey bo diddley, oh bo diddley.

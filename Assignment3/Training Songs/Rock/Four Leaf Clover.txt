I've tried turning you over and over
But you're never gonna be my four leaf clover

I've slept on in again and again
And I gotta tell you that you're just a has been

I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind 
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind

I don't wanna see your smiling face
Because you're coming in last in the great love race

You can touch me, kiss me, do what you will
'Cause I've swallowed handful of sleep-alone pills

I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind 
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind

Take my hand and I'll show you the way
To the end of the line where you're going to stay
You're going to stay
There's a place in my heart that I want you to know
That it's empty and hollow, but I think you should go, yeah
I think you should go
And I was thinking

I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind 
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind

I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind 
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, I've made up my
I've made, made up my mind

What kind of fool am i
Reaching into a world
I thought might have changed
Somehow re-arranged?
Yet here i am
Stepping into the night
Like a keenly sharpened knife
Carving holes in my life
When i know
That

What is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is?

You see I've been somewhere
Not far away, but such a different space
Just to sit in one place?br> and just when i thought
I could take no more
The bells started to ring
My soul to sing
And i know
That

What is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is

Chasing the tail of understanding
As it runs through my mind

Chasing the tail of understanding
As it runs through my mind

When i know
That
Hmm, oh what is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is?
What is, just is
Just is

I want a robot man to hold me tight
One that I can count on every si-ingle night
He wouldn't run around like other guys
I wouldn't have to listen to his alibis

A little robot man to call my own
I'd never have to worry that he wou-ouldn't phone
He'd never dance with anyone but me
I'd just have to wind him with a robot key

I'd have a steady da-ate (yay-yay-yay-yay)
Seven nights a wee-eek (yay-yay-yay-yay)
And we would never fi-ight (yay-yay-yay-yay)
'Cause it would be impossible for him to speak

Don't want a real live boy, they give me grief
Always make me cry into my ha-andkerchief
So it's a robot man I'm dreamin' of
Because I can depend upon a robot love, yeah

Mmm, we'd have a steady da-ate (yay-yay-yay-yay)
Seven nights a wee-eek (yay-yay-yay-yay)
And we would never fi-ight (yay-yay-yay-yay)
'Cause it would be impossible for him to speak

Don't want a real live boy, they give me grief
Always make me cry into a ha-andkerchief
So it's a robot man I'm dreamin' of
Because I can depend upon a robot love

Yeah, just hope I can depend upon a robot love
I mean, because I can depend upon a robot love
Do-oo, because I can depend upon a robot love
Oh-oh, just hope I can depend upon a robot love
I mean, because I can depend upon a robot love [fade]

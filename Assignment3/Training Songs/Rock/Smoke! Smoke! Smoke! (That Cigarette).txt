Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold 
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met 
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said "aces is full pal how about you?" 
He said "I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette"

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said "Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigarette

Well I roll and tumble
Brother all night long
Well I roll and tumble
Brother all night long
Well I woke up this morning
All my thrill was gone

Well I know my baby
She got a red dress on, yeah baby
Well I know my baby
She got a red dress on
When the sun goes up now
I tumble walking out

Well when I blow that whistle
She comes running down
Well when I blow that whistle
She comes running down
Oh I can hear them talking
With my baby there

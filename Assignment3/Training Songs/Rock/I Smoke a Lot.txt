I smoke a lot
I'm not talking weed or pot
I smoke the regular stuff
I smoke a lot
And if you're a smoker too
You are to know sometimes it's tough
To be in healthy company
People who always say
You smoke a lot
Imagine the amount of money you could save if you'd quit
You smoke a lot
By now you'd have a bike, aren't you concerned about the kids
Well, of course, sure I am, concerned (a bit)
But about that bike, I could get killed on it
And is that what you really want
(It's not)

So I smoke a lot
I smoke a lot
My God I smoke a lot, and I feel fine
I smoke a lot

I smoke a lot
Sometimes it's great
Sometimes it's not
But I smoke a lot

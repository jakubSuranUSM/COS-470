I'm waiting for my man
Got twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned and nobody cares
Pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just waitin' for a dear, dear friend of mine

I'm waiting for my man (waiting, waiting for my man)
I'm waiting for my man (waiting, waiting for my man)
(Waiting, waiting for my man)

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Pr shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is you always got to wait
I'm waiting for my man

Hey baby, don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, it's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man

(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man (waiting)
I'm waiting for my man (waiting, waiting for my man)
(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man

(Waiting, waiting for my man)
(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man
(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man
(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man
(Waiting) I'm waiting for my man
(Waiting, waiting for my man)

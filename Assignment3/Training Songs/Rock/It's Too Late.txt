Lately I've been thinking
And how the whole world's come undone
Everybody's got this sinking feeling
Feeling they're on the run
But I know a place where time stands still
I can picture it in my mind
But I'm not sure if we can get there

(there is no reason reasons rhyme
Why can't you see we're almost out of time)

It's too late it's too late it's too late
To cover what you've done
It's too late it's too late it's too late
To call for anyone at all
Well I guess I should be so brave to think that I'm the only one who knows
It's too late it's too late it's too late
To cover what you've done

Oh no we need a change (this world's stranger now)
Now is not the time to run away (there must be a way)
A way that we could listen to the warning signs so pay attention
This is my intention to prevent this fate before it gets too late

And as the hands of the clock go round and round
And the world keeps marching on
Can you afford to let it fall now?

(the fish in all the streams are dying
Fluorocarbons fill the sky
And I don't really want to die before my time has come)

It's too late it's too late it's too late
To cover what you've done
It's too late it's too late it's too late
To call for anyone at all
Well I guess I should be so brave to think that I'm the only one who knows
It's too late it's too late it's too late it's too late
Now now
It's too late

(lately I've been thinking
Haven't had that sinking feeling now)

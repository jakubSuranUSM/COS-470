The porridge's been good 
The marmalade too. 
I take another slice of bread, 
The bacon is hot but I don't mind. 
Too long I boiled the egg. 
I'm still a little tired, my bones are weak, 
Another day off I take, 
I guess the sun had the same idea 
And now we have a break.

It's a rainy day, a rainy day 
But I love it. 
It's a rainy day, 
The water comes down 
But I love you.

Milkman Mr Miller is ringing my bell. 
Do you take a liter or two?
But I don't wanna drink his milk today, 
I feel fine without it too. 
He steps into a puddle by going away. 
I hear him swearing at, 
The forecast promised
High pressure today 
And now he's getting wet. 

It's a rainy day, a rainy day 
But I love it. 
It's a rainy day, 
The water comes down 
But I love you.

It's a rainy day, a rainy day 
But I love it. 
It's a rainy day, 
The water comes down. 

Rosalie MacLovely is waiting for a cab 
In the middle of the pouring rain. 
Old bold head MacArthur is waiting 
For his hair to grow again.
Once upon a time he was a curly head 
But all those days are gone 
And now he's looking like a fireball, 
When he gets into the sun.

It's a rainy day, a rainy day 
But we love it. 
It's a rainy day, 
The water comes down 
But I love you.
It's a rainy day, a rainy day 
But I love it. 
It's a rainy day, 
The water comes down (down down down down),
The water comes down (down down down down),
The water comes down (down down down down),
But I love you.

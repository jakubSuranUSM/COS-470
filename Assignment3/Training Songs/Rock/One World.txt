[Chorus]
One world is enough
For all of us
One world is enough
For all of us

It's a subject we rarely mention
But when we do, we have this little invention
By pretending they're a different world from me
I show my responsibility

[Chorus]

The third world breathes our air tomorrow
We live on the time we borrow
In our world, there's no time for sorrow
In their world, there is no tomorrow

[Chorus]

Lines are drawn upon the world
Before we get our flags unfurled
Whichever one we pick
It's just a self-deluding trick

[Chorus]

I don't want to bring a sour note
Remember this before you vote
We can all sink, or we all float
'Cause we're all in the same big boat

[Chorus x 2]

One world is enough
For all of us

It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer everyday
It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer everyday
It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer everyday

One world...

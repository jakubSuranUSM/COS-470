Oh fight fire Oh fight fire
When you tell me a lie girl
It don't make me cry girl
I gotta fight fire with fire

Oh fight fire Oh fight fire
You know that I need you girl
I tried to believe you girl
But I gotta fight fire with fire

Oh fight fire Oh fight fire
Well go on and try girl
But don't ask me why girl
Cause I gotta fight fire with fire
Oh fight fire Oh fight fire

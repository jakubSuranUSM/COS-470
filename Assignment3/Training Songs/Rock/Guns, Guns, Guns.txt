American hunter, bring 'em up the north side
Guns, guns, guns
Run, take the money, here's a bullet for your boyfriend
Guns, guns, guns
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Guns, guns, guns
You be the red king, I'll be the yellow pawn

God speed mother nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature, you know that I'm calling it now
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye

Shoot a few, knock 'em down, cost you half a buck now
Guns, guns, guns
Babe give you kisses if you hit a rubber duck now
Guns, guns, guns
You be the red king, I'll be the yellow pawn
Guns, guns, guns
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Guns, guns, guns
Eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Guns, guns, guns
Oh eagle all gone, and no more caribou
Guns

God speed Mother Nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature, I'm weeping, I'm crying for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature, you know that I'm weeping for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
God speed mother nature, and I'm crying
Never really wanted to say goodbye
I know you're gonna hear me, I'm weeping, nature
Weeping, mother nature
Never really wanted to say goodbye
And I'm weeping for you
Weeping for you, mother nature
And I'm crying for you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Take care and visit me, Mother, Mother Nature
And I'm missing you
Never really wanted to say goodbye
Where have you gone?
God speed, Mother Nature, and I'm weeping for you

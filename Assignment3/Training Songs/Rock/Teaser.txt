That woman's got a smile, puts you in a trance.
And just one look at her, makes you want to dance.
Those dark and those red ruby lips, only a fool would pass them by.
With just a hint of ruthlessness, sparklin' in her eye.

She's a teaser and she's got no heart at all.
She's a teaser and she'll tempt you 'til you fall.
Yeah she'll tempt ya 'til ya fall.

She sips gin from a teacup, wears those fancy clothes.
And somebody always knows her no matter where she goes.
She'll talk to you in riddles, that have no sense or rhyme.
And if you ask her what she means, says she don't got no time.

(doo-wah, doo-wah, have a good time)
(doo-wah, doo-wah, have a good time)

Goodbye (goodbye) I hate to see you go
But have a good time (have a good time)
So long, I'll miss you, dear, I know
But have a good time (have a good time)

	Have your fling, be gay with your new love
	I'm setting you free
	Dance and sing, pretend that it's true love
	Don't worry 'bout me

I-I-I-I know (I know) that tears will only drive you
Farther away (farther away)
Just go, forget that I'm alive
It's your holiday (it's your holiday)

		When you're tired of being reckless and carefree
		Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
		So have a good time (have a good time)




		And, honey when you're tired of being reckless and carefree
		Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
		So have a good time (have a good time)

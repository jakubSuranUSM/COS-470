Hey what's the big deal?
Tell me how to feel?
I know where we boomeranged and fell from grace.
Point me to the stars I'm up for the chase.
I know where we fell on our face.
Jump with me.
You jump with me.

Hey, what's the big deal?
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.

I don't want to boomerang.
I don't want to cannonball.
I'm not angling.
I don't want to fall.
Tell me I'm the anchor of my own ascension.
Tell me I'm a tourist in the fourth dimension?

Hey, what's the big deal?
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.

Work it out.

I am vibrating at the speed of light.
Take my hand, we'll wind up the night.
Spin me, win me, lift me, kiss me.
Trip me, cuss me, bend me, trust me,
Touch me now.
You take my hand.
You trust me now
You understand.

So what's the big deal?
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.
I'm an animal.

I am vibrating at the speed of light.

If you're looking to get a good thing going for yourself
House and pool, a new Rolls Royce and some degree of wealth
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves

Take a ride out West to find that freedom that you crave
Kick that nine to five, don't let them make you a slave
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't makes waves

And when the toys that you dreamed of have finally come
They all will break and you're back where you started from

Now that blue is calling you with days and nights so warm
You can find excitement any size, shape or form
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves

Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves

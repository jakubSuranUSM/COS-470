Around the corner the wind blew back follow the yellow brick road
It ended up in black on black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children painted joy sunshine bright girl and boy
bag of trick s and candy sticks peppermint kite for my toy
Yellow brick black on black 
Keep on walking and don't look back 

I walked along happy and them came back 
I follow the yellow brick road
Lost and found I saw you down on the bound off the bound 
Taught against the love yellow brick road took my load 
Sunshine girl sunshine girl come to my abode one, two, three, four, five miles long 
Oh I can't ever (so) go wrong
Clouds were gray yesterday down on my shoulder it's time to play
Yellow brick black on black 
Keep on walking and don't look back

September girls do so much 
I was your Butch and you were touched 
I loved you, well, never mind 
I've been crying all the time 
December boy's got it bad 
December boy's got it bad 

September girls, I don't know why 
How can I deny what's inside 
Even though I'll keep away 
They we'll love all our days 
December boy's got it bad 
December boy's got it bad 

When I get to bed, late at night 
That's the time she makes things right 
Ooh when she makes love to me 

September girls do so much 
I was your Butch and you were touched 
I loved you, well, never mind 
I've been crying all the time 
December boy's got it bad 
December boy's got it bad 
December boy's got it bad, woo ooo

Unlearn me
Ditch what I read
Behind what I heard

Look, find, free
Yet, do you get it?
Yet, do you get it?

From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map
Of it all, it all

Evidence
March of the air
Pulse of the sea

Look, find, free
Yet, do you get it?
Yet, do you get it?

From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map
Of, it all, it all

On a line indivisible
A crow left of the murder
Every piece contains a map
Of, it all, it all

Everything I wanted
Wanted to know
Everything I wanted
Wanted to see, to see

Unlearn me
Unlearn me
Do you get it yet?

Look, find, free
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?

Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it?

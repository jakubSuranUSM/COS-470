True, you ride the finest horse I've ever seen,
Standing sixteen, one or two,
With eyes wide and green,
And you ride the horse so well,
Hands light to the touch,
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

Ride on, see you,
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

When you ride into the night
Without a trace behind,
Run your claw along my gut, one last time.
I turn to face an empty space
Where you used to lie,
And look for a spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in my eye.

Ride on, see you,
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to.

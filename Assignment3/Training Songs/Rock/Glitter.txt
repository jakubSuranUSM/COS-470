Thoughts surround me
Everywhere I go
I don't fear nothing
Unless it's broke
I got it over
None till you're ahead
'Cause I know
That's where you've been

Take it all now
Don't miss a thing
Your human country
Has been conquering
I don't fear god
I don't fear anything at all
'Cause I know
That's where I've been

Thoughts are moving
I've been wondering
When they take my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
But I want you back
Underneath my skin

Thoughts surround me
Everywhere I go
I don't fear nothing
Unless it's broke
I got it over
Not till you're ahead
'Cause I know
That's where we've been

Thoughts will move me
I've been wondering
When they take my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
But I want you back
Underneath my skin

Thoughts will move me
I've been wondering
When they take my turn to get a win
Everyone is out to get you again
And I want you back
Underneath my skin

Thoughts will move me
I've been wondering
When they take my turn to get a win
And you feel like
Everyone is out to get you again
I want you back
Underneath my skin

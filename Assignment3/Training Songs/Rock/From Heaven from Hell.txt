If there's a reason why you leave me
Then I like to hear it now
I'll simply bend my head
I won't cry out loud
I know all this time we spent together
Was not so important to you
You always knew, there would come a time
That I would sing my blues
And now you're playing with me
Like you're playing card
I'm losing before you start
You know every trick of every game
You look right through my heart
Oh woman, oh woman, you make it mine
Ah, ah, yeah, oh woman, oh woman
Oh yeah, you will be right at my door
Ah, ah, oh
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
For ever I'm lost in your spell
Ooh and I would be a liar
If I'm telling you, that I don't give a damn
That you don't love me like I do
Oh babe, babe I'm begging you
I'm begging you down on my knees
Oh please stay some more time
I'd rather be dead than free
Alright you leave me all alone
I see the curtain fall
And while you softly close the door
It's your name I call
Oh woman, oh woman
Oh woman, oh woman, here right at my door
Yah, yah, yah, yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh you're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
You're from heaven, from hell, from heaven
For ever I'm lost in your spell

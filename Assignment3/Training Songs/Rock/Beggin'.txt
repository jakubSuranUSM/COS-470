Ooh, put your lovin' hand out baby
I'm beggin'

Beggin', put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out baby

Ridin' high, when I was king.
Played it hard and fast cos' I had everything
You walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

I'm beggin' you, won't you put your hand out baby,
I'm beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out baby

I need you to understand,
That I tried so hard to be your man,
The kinda man you want in the end,
Only then can I begin to live again.
An empty shell, used to be shadow of my life
Is hangin' over me
Broken man, without a throne
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

I'm beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out baby,
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out baby

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
But I just can't make it on my own
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black.

I'm beggin' you, put your lovin hand out baby,
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out baby

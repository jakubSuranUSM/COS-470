Oh-woh-woh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh...
You never expect it to be in your wildest dreams
So take a step backwards for a little while
You'll find it there
It's somethin' that I can't explain
So I remain trapped inside
Still holdin' strong
Still holding o-on to you
To you

Take me back to you
It's been a long time
Although every night 
I think of you
It's such a lonely life

I watched you wave goodbye as you drove away
I didn't know that it would be your last time with me
You said - life ain't worth living if nobody cared
You said that all the time
Oh I take a step back and see your starin' eyes
I see you on the day you die

Take me back to you
It's been a long time
Although every night 
I think of you
It's such a lonely life (yeah)
And take me back to you
Take me back to you

Oh-woh-woh-oh-oh

Take me back to you
It's been a long time
Although every night 
I think of you
It's such a lonely life
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Take me back to you
Take me back to you

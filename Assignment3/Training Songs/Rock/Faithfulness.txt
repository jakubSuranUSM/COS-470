Faithfulness
Distracts me from my ever changing
Tastefulness
My mouth upon the richest tongues
I run for this
Static at the same time by it all 

Common sense
Can slap me in the face
And yet I calm dissent
Embarrassed by your obvious
Indifference
Disgusted at the same time by it all
Watching as my ego breaks your fall 

Don't you know that I've
Been running from you heart
And I feel like you've been running too 

Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying too. 

Leave you now
Can't convince myself
That you're the one somehow
To free me from this smile
I call my loneliness
Stuck inside this need to feel complete
Now I've left you standing on your feet 

Don't you know that I've been
Running from you heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've been
Lying from the start
And I feel like you've been
Lying too. 

Faithfulness is just a little rule
We break
Still pretending lust was just a fool
We faked, we made

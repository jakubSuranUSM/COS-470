You keep telling me
Don't hang around
While you play around 
With the clowns
That you've found 
It ain't right 
Now and then I get tired of the sound
Of you burning me down
While you're playing the town 
Every night 

I'm getting hung up 
Yes I am, yes I am 
And you don't give a damn 

No you don't have to treat me like a fool 
No you don't have to be so bloody cool 
No you don't have to make up all the rules 
No you don't no, no, you don't 
No you don't 

You keep on playing out reckless games 
That will give you fame 
But I'll take the blame for your name 
Well you think you've got my life in your hands 
But I'm a man, I'm a myth
And I've got my own plans, I'm a man 
I'm goin' down 
Yes, I am, yes I am 
And I don't give a damn

No you don't have to treat me like a fool 
No you don't have to be so bloody cool 
No you don't have to make up all the rules 
No you don't no, no, you don't 
No you don't 

No you don't no you don't

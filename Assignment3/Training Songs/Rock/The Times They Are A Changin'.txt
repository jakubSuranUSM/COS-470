Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
Accept it soon, you'll be drenched to the bone

If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin', you could sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters, beyond your command

Your old road is rapidly agin'
So get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'

For the times, they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
The present now will later be past

The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'

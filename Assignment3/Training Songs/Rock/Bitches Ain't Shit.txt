Bitches ain't shit 
Bitches ain't shit 

[Chorus]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
Lick on deez nutz and suck the dick 
lets get the f*ck out after you're done 
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright 
We used to roll around and f*ck the hoes at night 
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangster beats 
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets 
Peep, that shit got deep and it was on 
Number 1 song after number 1 song 
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat 
I didn't give a f*ck where the bitch was at 
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do 
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2 
And the ends she got didn't mean nothin' 
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit 

Bitches can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 
So now she's takin' me to court 
It's real conversation for your ass 

I once had a bitch named Mandy May 
Used to be up in them guts like everyday 
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung 
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pro-tung 
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good 
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood 
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine 
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time 

I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail 
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail 
I get's released on a hot sunny day 
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre 
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news 
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues 
I ain't been out a second 
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin checkin'

Move up the block as we groove down the block 
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock 
Kick in the do', I look on the flo' 
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo 
I un-cocked my shit,I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed 

Man, f*ck that bitch! 

[Chorus] 

Bitches can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 
So now she's takin' me to court 
It's real conversation for your ass 

[Repeat: x4]
Bitches can't hang with the streets

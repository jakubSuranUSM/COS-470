So, when ya dance all night
And you ain't around for sleepin'
If you would step
Hidin' and a-peepin'

(They're so good)
They're so good, but baby, it's alright
(It's alright)
We're gonna pick it up
And we're gonna freaky dance tonight

And all the real cool kids are down in Silverlake tonight
It's so tight
It's so tight 
It's so tight 

So if you date this guy
(He's gotta)
Don't be uncool man, 'cause the owner's like my best-friend
Make sure you tell him, girl, just how important that I am
I am from Silverlake, and therefore I don't give a damn

Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?

And so we danced all night
And ain't nobody sleepin'
I know a place
(Is it cool?)
It's aight
(aight)

There's a place I know
It's just right there where you never been

And all the real cool kids are down in Silverlake tonight
It's so tight
It's so tight 
It's so tight

So if you date this guy
(He's gotta)
Don't be uncool baby, you know you are my everything
Make sure you tell him, girl, just how important that I am
I am from Silverlake and I am in a cool band

Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?

And all the real cool kids are in Silverlake tonight
It's so tight
It's so tight 
It's so tight 

Okay, I'm not the guy
I might have said I am

Its almost closing time
Come on, man
Please just let me in

Can you not the see the style of hipster
I most surely am?

I'm trying twice as hard
As anyone you just let in

Don't you know who I am? (I have never seen you before)
Don't you know who I am? (I have never seen you before)
Don't you know (who I am?)
(I have never seen you before)

Don't you know (who I am?)
Don't you know (what the hell you've seen me before)
Don't you know (who I am?)
Don't you know (what the hell you've seen me before)

I don't know who I am

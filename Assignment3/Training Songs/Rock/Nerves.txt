Landlord church
Car crash work
My head aches
And silver lake

You nerve me

Well, I hate work
I'm a mail room clerk
[Incomprehensible]
Stop me from making mistakes

But you nerve me

The girl's on glue
When the rent check's due
I suicide
Stop me from calling late

But you burned me

And I think it's gonna be
A long walk home
And it's gonna be
A long walk to the car

And I think it's gonna be
A long walk home
It's gonna be
A long walk to the car

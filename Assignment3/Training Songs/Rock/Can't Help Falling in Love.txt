I just can't help falling in love with you) 
Wise men say only fools rush in 
But I can't help falling in love with you 
Shall I say would it be a sin 
(Be a sin) 
If I can't help falling in love with you 
Like a river flows (Oh) 
To the sea (Oh) 
So it goes 
Some things are meant to be 
Some things are meant to be 

[Chorus] 
Take my hand (take my hand) 
Take my whole life too (life too) 
For I can't help falling in love with you 
Wise men say only fools rush in 
But I, I can't, I can't help 
Falling in love (falling in love) 
With you (with you) 

Like a river flows (Oh) 
To the sea (Oh) 
So it goes 
Some things are meant to be 
Some things are meant to be 

[Chorus: x2] 

Like a river flows 
That's the way it goes 
I just can't help fallin' in love with you 
(Fallin' in love with you) 
Like a river flows (yea yea) 
That's the way it goes ('cause I can't) 
Fallin' in love with you 
Like a river flows (I just can't help myself) 
That's the way it goes 
I can't help falling in love with you 
(I can't help falling in love with you)
(I can't help falling in love with you) 
Fallin' in love with you

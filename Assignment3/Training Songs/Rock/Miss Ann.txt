Oh, oh, oh, Miss Ann, you're doin' something no-one can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Miss Ann, you're doin' something no one can
Because believin' and deceivin', it's drivin' me to grievin' now

I want to hear, hear, hear Miss Ann, I want to hear her call my name
I want to hear, hear, hear Miss Ann, I want to hear her call my name
Because she keep callin' loud, but she calls it so sweet and so plain

Well, I told Miss Ann once, and I told Miss Ann twice
Yes, I told miss Ann once, and I told Miss Ann twice
Boys, when I'm with Miss Ann, I'm livin' in paradise

If she thinks I'm gonna let her be free, how wrong can Miss Ann be
If she thinks I'm gonna let her be free, how wrong can Miss Ann be
I'm in love with Miss Ann, and that's the way it's gonna be

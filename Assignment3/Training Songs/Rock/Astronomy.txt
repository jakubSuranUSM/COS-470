The middle lane has trapped my car
In red-light claustrophobia.
I slip the shackles, cut the rope 
Stand naked with a telescope
As the cat walks alone
Under a big sky.
Against the dark so thin and white 
Gonna be a big sky night.

Miss Galileo, come with me
And view the new Astronomy.
Black hole dressing on salad plate
Quasar at the kissing gate
Now the cat, he walks alone
Under a big sky.
Umbrella dome pin-pricked in lights 
Gonna be a big sky night.

My spectacles, my white lab coat 
My coffee, thermos and my notes.
I pat my pockets. I got the keys
To the secrets of the observatory.
And closing the door,
I feel a new dawn
As the darker slides align 
You to yours and me to mine.

And now you stand, assisting me 
I can touch what I can see, see, see.
I look in wonder, I feel no shame 
See the consequences of the game.
Expand the universe.
Head for the Big Bang.
Reach for my switch and shout 
Gonna turn the big sky out.

There's got to be astronomy.
Astronomy.

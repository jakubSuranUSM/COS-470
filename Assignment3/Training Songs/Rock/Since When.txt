I am falling away from what was you
Only one thing I said I'd never do
I knew something was wrong
When you got all caught up

what was going on and not what was going in
Since when did it matter if the outside world fit in.
Make it believable, Love can be beautiful make it believable
Lay that old burden down you got to turn around and be a believer

I am leaving today on a loves' lost train
Never thought that I'd riding on the rails this way
You know as well as I do
That the question has nothing to do

With the money honey and all dem things
Since when did it matter what the outside world would bring.
Make it believable, Love can be beautiful
Make it believable

Lay that old burden down you got to turn around
We had a fever so right
And the dream was definitely real
As the fever broke so did the dream

Since when did it matter what the outside world would be
Make it believable, Love can be beautiful
Make it believable
Lay that old burden down you got to turn around
Be a believer

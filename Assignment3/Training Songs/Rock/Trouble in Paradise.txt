(x2): 
Calling all angels, calling all angels, calling all angels oo---ou 

There's trouble in paradise 
My turtle doves changing wings 
There's trouble in paradise 
The birds no longer sing 
Some devil told my angel alot of lies 
& now my tears are falling 
Like raindrops from the sky 

There's trouble in paradise 
The stars no longer shine 
There's trouble in paradise 
'Cause she's no longer mine 
That devil told my angel I'd been untrue 
Won't somebody help me please 
Tell me me what to do 

Bridge: 
Mr. Moon, Mr. Sun 
Tell her she's the only one 
Guide her with your lovely light 
Back into my arms tonight 

There's trouble in paradise 
& heaven's not the same 
The angels sit & cry 
They say it's such a shame 
They'd like our love to be just like before 
Then the trouble in paradise will be no more 

(repeat bridge) 

(repeat & fade): 
Calling all angels, calling all angels

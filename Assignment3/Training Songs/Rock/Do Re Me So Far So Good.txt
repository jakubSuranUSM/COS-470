In spite of all you been told about Elvis
The good die old and helpless
In bobble hats and armchair football scarves
For the big match with Antarctic thistle
They didn't catch the half time whistle
When they wheeled on the pop music stars
With their pop music guitars
And they were singing
One, two, three, happy neighborhood
Do Re Me, so far so good

Because life Mrs Brown
It's just one big knees up
A night on the town, a storm in a teacup
(More like a teacup in a storm)
Where are the songs about boozers and buildings
Banning the bomb and abusing the children
Who'll one day be pop music stars
With their pop music guitars
And they'll be singing
One, two, three happy neighborhood
Do Re Me, so far so good

Quicksand closing in around my eyes
Quicksand forcing me to realize
Nothing that I see
Can get through this wall to me

This wall of quicksand closing in around my mind
Quicksand and I'm losing track of time
Sinking like a stone
All the dreams that I have ever known

Sinking into quicksand closing in around my heart
Quicksand teaching me further poems
From the things I feel
All that it can steal, taken and concealed
Not to be revealed about quicksand

From the things I feel
All that it can steal taken and concealed
Not to be revealed about quicksand

Talking about quicksand
Singing about quicksand

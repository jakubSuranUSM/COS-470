Today I woke up and thought how much
I love the sun and if you go I'll be so sad
If you fly to another planet
Where things are sane

Then it came to me the other day
It was so unreal so mannequin
And they're right the body's just a shell
If you stare hard enough you'll notice

[Chorus]
The it came to me
From another place
And I buried it
I buried it
Sun

Then it came to me the other day
It was so unreal so mannequin
And they're right the body's just a shell
If you stare hard enough you'll notice

See the farmer on the other side of town
He's always working hard 'til the sun goes down
He's up every morning right on five, a wanting green seeds just to come alive,
But he don't wear a no farm clothes, he's always using a rake and hoe,
But his seeds are starting to grow, like a big stalk up through the sky

He used to live in an apartment in a big old city
With thick and priestly windows built right in it
But he decided to move to a little tiny town
He wanted to be a farmer all year round
And on a country road where you can't see a thing
He's got five acres filled little green things, he said
He's working so hard all night and day

Mr. Farmer let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer let me harvest your crops
I want to have a dream come true
I said a farmer, farmer, farmer
I want to be just like you

See the farmer a walking down town, always draws a crowd when he's around
He's always wearing seedy clothes, he's shows them off wherever he goes
You can spot him anywhere, got a bright pink thumb but he don't care,
I said, he looks like something from a very bad dream

Mr. Farmer let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer let me harvest your crops
Mr. Farmer let me save your crops

I said, a farmer, farmer, farmer

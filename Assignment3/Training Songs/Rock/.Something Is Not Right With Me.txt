Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
How was I supposed to know?

Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Tryin' not to let it show!

I tried to call you collect
You said you would not accept
Your friends are laughin' cause
Nobody uses pay phones

Gave me quarters to select
So I'm on the jukebox again
People dancin'
Shoulda never chose "Girlfriend"

Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
How was I supposed to know?

Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
I'm trying not to let it show!

Crash into the people who're
Sleepin' late into the evening
Reach behind they can hardly find their spines

Crash into the people who're
Sleepin' late into the evening
Reach behind they can hardly find their spines

Crash into the people who're
Sleepin' late into the evening
Reach behind they can hardly find their spines

You said you too like old cars
I bought a beat up brown Dodge
It was smoking but it died in your front yard

You follow whose dating who
But, but when it comes to you
One is pulled a dozen
Different ways in the mind

Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
How was I supposed to know?

Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
Something is not right with me!
I'm tryin' not to let it show!

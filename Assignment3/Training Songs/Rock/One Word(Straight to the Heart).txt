One word, one heart
One night is all I want
One word, one heart
One girl is waiting there for me

Midnight and all is well
I hear the mission bell
Out on the road, nothing is moving
As I speed from town to town
(Hey, hey)

Two hearts are beating fast
But they are still many miles apart
Oh, the mood was shining on a distant shore
Burning like a fire in my heart
I've got to see her, I've got to say, hey, hey

One word, one heart
One night is all I want
One word, one heart
One girl is waiting there for me

I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
I'm gonna to tell her tonight

(Straight to the heart)
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
Like a cannonball

Headlights are blazing through
Turn on the radio, I hear the news
Hand on the wheel, foot on the floor
And on, and on, and on we go
(Hey, hey)

This car is like a friend
Bring her the message that I want to send
Oh, the dawn was breaking and I saw the sun
Burning like a fire on the bay
I'm nearly there now, I'm gonna say, hey, hey

One word, one heart
One night is all I want
One word, one heart
One girl is waiting there for me

I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
I'm gonna to tell her tonight

(Straight to the heart)
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
Like a cannonball

One word
(Yes)
One heart
One night
(Yes)
One girl
(Yes)

I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)

I've got to give her my love
(Straight to the heart)
I've got to give her my love
(Straight to the heart)

I've got to tell her myself
(Straight to the heart)
I've got to tell her tonight
(Straight to the heart)
Like a cannonball

Yes

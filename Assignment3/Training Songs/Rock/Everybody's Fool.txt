You impress me with your style
I think you're really cool
Everybody looks at you
Cause you're everybody's fool

I don't fuckin' care (I don't fuckin' care)
What clothes you wear (What clothes you wear)
You're still fucking square

You say you've taken lots of drugs
You really must be hip
But you'll never get to know yourself
When you're underneath your drip

I don't fuckin' care (I don't fuckin' care)
How you wear your hair (How you wear your hair)
You're still fucking square

And I'm laughing at you all the time
And I'm laughing at you all the time
And I'm laughing at you all the time
And I'm laughing at you all the time

Late last night when the squire came home
Inquiring for his lady
Some denied and some replied
She's gone with the Black Jack Davy

Go saddle to me the bonny brown steed
For the grey was never so speedy
I'll ride all day and I'll ride all night
'Til I catch that Black Jack Davy

[Chorus]
He rode up hills and he rode down dales
Over many a wild high mountain
And they did say that saw him go
Black Jack Davy he is hunting 

He rode east and he rode west
All in the morning early
Until he spied his lady fair
Cold and wet and weary

Why did you leave your house and land
Why did you leave your baby
Why did you leave your own wedded lord
To go with the Black Jack Davy

[Chorus]

What care I for your goose feather bed
With the sheets turned down so bravely
Well I may sleep on the cold hard ground
Along with the Black Jack Davy

Then I'll kick off my high healed shoes
Made of the Spanish leather
And I'll put on my lowland brogues
And skip it o'er the heather

[Chorus]

Let me tell you bout a girl I know
She my woman and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in an old tin cup

That's why I know
Yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends

I know she'll love with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know

Yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
When she calls me on the telephone
Baby, I'm all alone

By the time I count, one to four
I hear that woman on my door
And In the evening when the sun goes down
And there is no one else around

She kisses me and she holds me tight
Eric, baby everythings all right
That's why I know
Yes, I know

Hallelujah, I just love her so
All right now
Now when I call her on the telephone
Hey baby I'm all alone

By the time I count, one, two, three, four
I hear that woman on my door
And in the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around

She kisses me holds me tight
Says baby everythings all right 
That's why I know
Yes, I know

Hallelujah, I just love her so
Whoa yeah
Hallelujah, I just love her so
She's my woman

Hallelujah, I just love her so
One more time
Hallelujah, I just love that gal so
Oh baby yeah

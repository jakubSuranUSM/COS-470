I hate music
What is it worth?
Can't bring anyone
Back to this earth
The feeling of space
Between all of the notes
But I got nothing else
So I guess here we go

Let me do back to the mallow yeah
All of our friends with the plan on
So watch out all the old... sea
All of it takes to pull off our feet
We got out stereo freaks
We got our sweet summer breeze
Had it all the record estranged
Hours a day we were never the same

Me and you and Jackie Mittoo
Me and you and Jackie Mittoo
Me and you and Jackie Mittoo
Me and you and Jackie Mittoo
Me and you and Jackie Mittoo
Me and you and Jackie Mittoo

I hate music
What is it worth?
It can't bring you
Back to this earth

Hey man come on over here 
Let me play some of nothin' for your ears.
Well I sat down and listened to him 
Say love keeps getting in the way.
How many times will I fall in love with a girl that was my friend 
You see love is a hole in the middle of my heart
Like a well that has no end
And I said...

[Chorus:]
Oh yeah I know what you mean 
Cause a friend in love is a friend in need 
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh yeah I know what you mean

Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
She said hey man come on lets go 
Let me tell you about something that you don't know.
Well I paced the floor and listened to her say 
Love keeps getting in the way. 
How many times will I fall in love with a boy who was my friend 
You see love is a pole that blocks the door with a key
The boy can't lend and I said.

[Chorus]

And I tried to find some reason why I know our love is better 
But I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin'.
Well I tried to find a corner in my mind leave it all behind 
But I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'.
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time 
I remember sittin' 'neath the stars, talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car. 
He said what are we gonna do we've lost our way 
And love keeps gettin' in the way. 
Well I replied to the question on his face 
Said love's not a time or convenient place. 
You got rocks in you're shoes you gotta fly if its love 
There is no question why he said. 

[Chorus]

Oh yeah, oh yeah 
I've been sinkin'
I've been sinkin' babe
I've been sinkin'
I've been sinkin' baby

The shapes are shifting in
Rolling
Like a snake is slithering
Sinking sand

Listen to silence
Hear the invisible tongue
Lay it all to rest

Half asleep wavering
All knowing who you are
Patient like the trees

Energy
What you give
The echo ride
Coming to you in return
Energy
Scatter in the wind and grow

Decay in soil
A cycle of the earth
Repeated and learned

Receive what's thrown out
Finding out where you are
Circle and return

Energy
What you give
The echo ride
Coming to you in return
Energy
Scatter in the wind and grow

And then you'll know deceit my friend

Just a pawn
Between your dreams
You're alive

One pull
Under your feet
From the deep

Energy
What you give
The echo ride
Coming to you in return
Energy
Scatter in the wind and grow

Oh, oh
I've been in a cave,
For forty days,
Only a spark,
To light my way.
I want to give out,
I want to give in,
This is our crime,
This is our sin.

But I still believe
I still believe
Through the pain,
And through the grief,
Through the lives,
Through the storms,
Through the cries,
And through the wars.
Oh, I still believe!

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Flat on my back,
Out at sea,
Hopin' these waves,
Don't cover me.
I'm turned and tossed,
Upon the waves,
When the darkness comes,
I feel the grave.

But I still believe
I still believe
Through the cold,
And through heat,
Through the rain,
And through the tears.
Through the crowds,
And through the cheers.
Oh, I still believe!

Oh, oh, oh
Oh

I'll march this road,
I'll climb this hill,
Upon my knees if I have to
I'll take my place,
Up on this stage,
I'll wait till the end of time,
For you like everybody else.

I'm out on my own,
Walkin' the streets,
Look at the faces,
That I meet.
I feel like I
Like I want to go home.
What do I feel?
What do I know?

But I still believe.
I still believe.
Through the shame,
And through the grief.
Through the heartache,
Through the tears,
Through the waiting,
Through the years

For people like us,
In places like this
We need all the hope,
That we can get,
Oh, I still believe!

Oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh

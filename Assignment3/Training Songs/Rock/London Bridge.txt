I went an' burnt my bridges at the weekend, 
An' now there's nothing left but another week to end, 
An' a sick an' sunken soul in a drunken body like mine,
From London bridge I swim east along the tide.

She says I won't wait I won't wait,
An' now she tells me that she wants me,
She says I won't wait I won't wait, 
An' now she tells me that she wants me, 
An' won't ya take me home.

When battered heads dissemble and descend into a mess upon the city,
When bleeding hearts awake from single beds and paint themselves so very pretty, 
Oh from London Bridge you know its not such a bad sight oh no no.

Shuddered hard at those memories of those filthy nights we spent,
I never wanted to be the one who just came and went,
Oh lover you know I can't afford your game,
Oh lover no I can't afford your game

She said, 

When battered heads dissemble and descend into a mess upon the city,
When bleeding hearts awake from single beds and paint themselves so very pretty,

When you're just eighteen, you never win an' no it's not right,
Well from London Bridge you know its not such a bad sight.

Woahh, I won't wait I won't wait,
An' now she tells me that she wants me,
She says I won't wait, I won't wait,
An' now she tells me that she wants me, 
And that she loves me, oh take me home,
Take me home, woah won't you take me home, come on take me home

Blacking in and out in a strange flat in east London
Somebody I don't really know just gave me something to help
Set me down and stop me always thinking about you

And you know your life is heading in a questionable
Direction when you're off in days with strangers
And you can't remember anything except way you sound
When you told me you didn't know what I should do

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light
A long road out to recovery from here,
A long way to make it right

And so I wake up in the morning just like every other day
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain,
And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
But you're not lying there any longer and I know
That it's my fault so I been pounding on the floor
And I've been crawling up the walls and I've been divvying my darkness
And Serotonin boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light
A long road out to recovery from here,
A long way to make it right

So on the first night we met you said well darling let's make a deal,
If anybody ever asks us well let's say that we met in jail
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like
A southern face that comforts but today I need to hear
Some truth if I'm ever getting through this
Yea you once sent me a letter that said if I was lost at sea
Close my eyes and catch a time idea and only think of me
Well darling now I'm sinking I'm as lost as
Lost can be and I'm hoping you can drag me
Off and down and out to my recovery

If you could just give me a sign and just a subtle little glimmer,
A suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
Then I'd stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time
'Cause I know that you are cynical but I think
I can convince you yea 'cause broken people
Can get better if they really want to
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I'm hoping to survive

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light
A long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to whats right

Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,
Darling, sweet lover, one day this will all be over

Did you ever feel somethin' in the air 
And you block it out, but you know it's there 
Did you ever find, things about to change 
I can see the signs all along my way 
And I can feel that 

Something's comin' up 
And I don't know what it is 
Something's comin' up 
And I don't know where it's gonna take me 

But there's something dyin' 
Something bein' born 
I think I'm gonna leave, I gotta get away 
Maybe try Mill Valley, maybe try L.A. 

The people I thought I loved 
Well, we don't think the same 

There's fury in my blood 
And I can't stand it one more day 
And I can feel that 

Something's comin' up 
And I don't know what it is 
Something's comin' up 
And I don't know where it's gonna take me 
But there's something dyin' 
And something bein' born 

Something's comin' up (comin' up) 
Something's comin' up (comin' up) 
Something's comin' up (really don't know what it is) 
Something's comin' up (really don't know what it is)

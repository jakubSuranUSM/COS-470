I walked into this bar
And the man refused;
He said, "We don't serve strangers
In blue suede shoes; 
We don't give credit, and
We don't give way 
We have to think about what the people might say..
Uh, you know what I mean "
I said, "Sure, man"

Oh, he gave me a smile that was sickly and wet, 
And I offered him one of my cigarettes.
He took it, afraid that he might appear rude,
Then proceeded to sell me some second class food.
Nice guy   meet 'em everywhere

He said, "My oh my, I have suffered too long, 
And this cigarette seems to be very strong; 
I don't make the rules 
I just get what I take
And I guess every rule was made to break. 
You can take what you like, it won't hurt me
Cause I'm just working for the company."
From the green cigarette, He took a long drag, 
And said, "I think I'll pick my traveling bag.

I'm tired of cheating, and wasting my head 
And filling the boss's bags with bread. 
I want to get out in the sun and rain, 
And feel the wind on on skin again;
The world is large, and I've got time yet. 
And, by the way, thanks for that cigarette. 
Thank you very much."

"You know, I feel like a new man
Yes I do, I don't know why;
I'd just like to say
Thank you very much(indeed)
It's a beautiful day
I think I'll be on my way (right away)
I'd just like to say
Thank you very much.
Yes, I'm getting the hell out of here
Yes, I am - bye, bye.
That's the end of the message
Thank you very much.
Bye bye

Look up as I lie in bed
Feeling the presence of the dead
I get a feeling from your stare
This is something that we know

I hear you
Do you hear me?
There's something I've got to ask
Are you part of my family tree?

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know
But I'm curious all the same
I've been thinking for some time now
Please, tell me why you came

Is it something else in you
Or is it something passing through?
Does it show you any light
Or does it tell you what to write?

'Cause I feel you
Do you feel me?
There's something I've got to ask
Will you become part of me?

[Chorus]

Please, tell me why you came
When my heart has skipped a beat
I feel it's someone I'm gonna meet
Is this just my imagination
Or have I built my own creation?

I'm near you
And you're near me
There's something I've got to ask
Is there life after death for me?

[Chorus]

Please tell me why you came

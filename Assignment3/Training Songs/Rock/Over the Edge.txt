Keep it centered - keep it low 
Keep it runnin' - let's go 
Watch it climb - on its own 
The more we see - the more we know 

We know 
Four wheels and a lift 
What we gave - we get 
The convoy was down 

There was nothing left - no one around 
We strapped ourselves in tight 
We were the first - and we're alright 
It's movin' way too fast 
Now shut the doors - and hit the gas 

[Chorus: x2] 
So over the edge 
They said

I lift my head I soon realized 
I remembered - back in time 
What was rollin' along 
Movin' circle - on and on 

An image so small 
We heard the word - we heard the call
Let's keep our story straight 
It doesn't matter - it's way too late 

[Chorus: x2]

The more we see We know the more we know [Repeat: x4]

Here we go, time to start, if you're ready,
Just get on out there, don't look so serious,
Take that expression off your face, put a smile there in its place.

Now you know we're on your side, so don't worry,
You look the part with your faded Levi's shirt,
You've got a brand new Telecaster, what more could you want?

[Chorus]
What am I doin' here? What does it all mean to you?
If I could only disappear, I wonder what you all would do?

Don't forget what we told you, it'll be all right
As long as you remember, there's so much at stake,
We can't afford to make mistakes, tonight of all nights.

[Chorus]

Here we go, time to start, if you're ready,
Just get on out there, don't look so serious,
Take that expression off your face, put a smile there in its place.

Now you know we're on your side, so don't worry,
As long as you remember, there's so much at stake,
We can't afford to make mistakes, tonight of all nights.

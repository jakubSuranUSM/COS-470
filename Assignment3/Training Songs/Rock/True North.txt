If this ever gets to you
Will you know it's from me?
Or would you think it was a joke
Throw it back to the sea

[Chorus]
Or do you, do you know
Everything I'm feeling
Do you know
No one could love you more
My true north

If this ever gets to you
Will you please forgive me
I was the one who let you down
It's too late for "sorry"

[Chorus]

If I told you then
I'd made it clear
Would you still be here?

[Chorus]

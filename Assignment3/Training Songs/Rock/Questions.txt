Can this feeling that we have together
Oooh, suddenly exist between
Did this meeting of our minds together
Oooh, happen just today, somewhere
I'd like to know,
Can you tell me -- please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing

Was your image in my mind so deeply
Was your image in my mind so deeply
Oooh, other places fade away
Blocking memories of unhappy hours
Oooh, leavin' just a burnin' love
I'd like to know,
I'd like to know,
Can you tell me -- please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing
Yes it does now baby

Can this lovin' we have found within us
Oooh, suddenly exist between
Did we somehow try to make it happen
Oooh, was it just a natural thing
I'd like to know,
Can you tell me -- please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing
Yes it does now baby

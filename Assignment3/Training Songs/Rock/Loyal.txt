I can't remember last time I thanked you,
Keeping my distance unintentionally.
Too close for comfort, just ain't close enough.
If I could have more time we would brainstorm.
And I love you tender, but we must walk away,
Keeping you on my greeting card file.
And if it were different did you know it ain't?
Let's get on with it love

And call me loyal I'll say you're loyal too.
I know you're loyal I feel your loyal truth,
Call me loyal I'll hold you loyal too,
And we are loyal, keep it that way

Keep it that way girl
Out in the battle, flung far and used.
Where does allegiance lie?
Sometimes when all of your hopes, and all of your dreams,
Are too much to value in one moment.
And all of us anxious, but why hurry love?
History's here and now.
Oh and why are you waiting waiting for what?
The history of some love?

And call me loyal I'll say you're loyal too.
I know you're loyal I feel your loyal truth,
And call me loyal I'll hold you loyal too,
And we are loyal, keep it that way baby

And we are loyal - haven't you known me long enough girl?
If I could see your heart right now,
Maybe there'd be a change or two.

And you can call me loyal I'll say you're loyal too.
I know you're loyal I feel your loyal truth,
And call me loyal I'll hold you loyal too,
And we are loyal, keep it that way

Loyal! I will say you're loyal too!
I know you're loyal I will feel your loyal truth,
And call me loyal I will hold you loyal too,
And we are loyal, keep it that way baby

Keep it that way baby,
Keep it that way now!

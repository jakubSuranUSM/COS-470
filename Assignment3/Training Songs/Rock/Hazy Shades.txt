Long ago, in the book of man
To come and take me back again
But I know I won't see a friend
To come and take me back again and
Even thought the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
Hazy shades
All come home
Even though the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
A pair lay
In a home
Long ago, in the book of man
To come and take me back again
Lonesome stow, I won't see a friend
To come and take me back again
Even thought the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
Hazy shades
All come home
Even though the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
A pair lay
In a home
(Even though the sun is coming out
Even though the sun is coming out
Even though the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming
Hazy shades
All come home)
Even though the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
Hazy shades
All come home
Even though the sun is coming
Even though the sun is coming out
A pair lay
In a home

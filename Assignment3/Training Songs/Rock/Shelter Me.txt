This ain't no place for losers
Or the innocent of mind
It's a full time job
For anyone to stay alive

The streets have shallow boundaries
For the war that's everyone
What a wasteland for
Broken dreams and hired guns

Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

I've gone to sleep with one eye open
The other rolls my tears
In the darkness I can hide my heart
But none of my fears

In the morning like a soldier
I look closed up battleground
Another day, another [Incomprehensible] me
And the world goes round

Shelter me
Won't you shelter me?
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
Oh, shelter me
When I lose control of my only home
Shelter me

Every time I tumble down
I wanna pack it up and leave this town
But when I finally get the nerve
Get cleared out of the shoes
I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you

Baby shelter me, please shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
When I lose control of my only home
Shelter me

Won't you shelter me?
Oh, shelter me, baby please
Shelter me

Stay back and shelter me
Come on and shelter me
When I lose control of my only home
Shelter me

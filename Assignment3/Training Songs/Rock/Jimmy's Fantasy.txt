Climb the mountain with your fingertips
Right hand strumming while the left hand grips
Broken fingers turn to broken dreams
Nobody splits until the hag screams

Howlin' Wolf will never understand
Doty Crips, the Bloods or Zeppelin

Jimmy's fantasy of love and affection
Jimmy's fantasy of love and deception

Have you seen the witch she's on the side
In the bush where Jeannie Brooks must hide
Cast the hex with your echo-plex
You don't ever want to have sex

Jimmy's fantasy of love and affection
Jimmy's fantasy of love and deception
Jimmy's fantasy of love and affection
Jimmy's fantasy of everything that is bad in this world

Jimmy's fantasy of love and affection
Jimmy's fantasy of hate with an erection
Jimmy's fantasy of love and deception
Jimmy's fantasy of everything that is bad in this world

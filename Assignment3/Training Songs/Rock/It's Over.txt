What you gonna do when I'm gone?
Who you gonna turn to when you just can't carry on?
Who you gonna run to when it's over?

Maybe you'll believe me when I'm gone
Maybe if I leave you'll realize where we went wrong
You shouldn't be surprised to know
It's over
It's over
It's over

Maybe in a day you'll change your mind
Maybe if I stay we'll work it out if there's still time
Cause baby if I leave you now
It's over
It's over
It's over

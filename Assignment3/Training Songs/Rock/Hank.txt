This crack head's tiny fingers
Accusing you of what he'll do
White fascists in the White House
More beetroot in your Russian stew

Blinds roll down in the ghetto
Power's out all over town
Jim Crow rules in the crack down
Bend your knee, stand your ground

Our weapon is a stand up
A jester prancing like a fool
In jest digest the monster
This president's a dangerous tool

Blinds roll down in the ghetto
Power's out all over town
Jim Crow rules in the crack down
Bend your knee, stand your ground

Democracy sells easy
NRA high fives
Orlando Sandy Hook Columbine
CCTV's grainy
His rapture's our decline
Hookers hotels showers dollar signs

Suppress the vote electoral lies
Black lives matter shoot on sight
We exist in multiple denials
He just says what they would hide
Rulers rule by divide
Why put your faith in facts when you can lie?
Now every possibility exists in everybody's mind

I'm in the story business
This Tower falls without a sound
Only our carbon footprint
Suggests an empire here unwound

Blinds roll down in the ghetto
Power's out all over town
Jim Crow rules in the crack down
Bend your knee, stand your ground

Wishing, hoping
How can I keep coping?
'Til I know your wish is to be with me

You go, I know
You were the one who told me so
I'm wishing you lying in my arms again

Sad, so sad
It's written across my face
My tears leave no trace
They fall and disappear

Mad, so mad
Leaving you on your own
Your right to disown me
Will always be so clear

Wishing, so long
How can I keep holding on?
While missing you, wishing you home again

Sad, so sad
It's written across my face
My tears leave no trace
They fall and disappear

Mad, so mad
Leaving you on your own
Your right to disown me
Will always be so clear

Wishing.....
Wishing, so long
How can I keep holding on?
When this song is wishing you home again

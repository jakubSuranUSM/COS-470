Hard case, musician mean, hey, hey, hey
It's kind of sad but that's what I'll be, hey, hey, hey
I don't have nothing but the clothes on my back, hey, hey, hey
Do my sleeping in an old brown sack, hey, hey, hey

(chorus)
I've had enough of getting shot in the head
I've had enough and I wish I was dead
I've had enough of getting shot in the head
I've had enough of getting shot in the head

I don't have money and I don't have class, hey, hey, hey
Need a couple of dollars just to fill my glass, hey, hey, hey
I've got so many friends to my name,
They're all bottles of whiskey, they're friends just the same
Never have to worry that's the name of the game, hey, hey, hey

(chorus)

I spent 22 years in a Rock and Roll band,
10,000 women on a one night stand
And all I've got to show is a hole in my hand,
Where my money has burned me through

(chorus)

Since I left, I've been gone so long and I can't turn back
I don't miss what I never had or what I lack
Hard to hit a shot from the hip hot steamin' lead
And I'm through getting fucked and giving head

Hell bound, gimme one more round
Well, I can take a stand
You know I'm damned
Like no other man

Well, I'm tired so sick, tired of breakin' down
Won't be no one here to greet you when you come around
And crossroads alleys and empty streets
Burn my feet on the glow, runnin' from the heat

Hell bound, gimme one more round
Well, I can take a stand
You know I'm damned
Like no other man

Like no other man

Can't turn around
You burned my bridges down
Road of empty cans
Lost in a devil's dance

I can't find no rest, keep on goin' and set my pace
Ain't no thing called home there ain't no such place
And I won't come around, won't come around no more
You know as well as I the whole thing's a bore

Hell bound, gimme one more round
Well, I can take a stand
You know I'm damned
Like no other man

Like no other man
Like no other man
Like no other man

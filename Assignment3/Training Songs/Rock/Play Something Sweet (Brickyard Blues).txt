Well, I tried to run my game
She said "Man, that's the same old thing I've heard before"
And I'm too tired to go for your show (again and again)

And she started to explain
She said "Man, I ain't saying what you're playing just can't make it
But I just can't take it anymore"

Play something sweet, play something mellow
Play something I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play something sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Well, I started to sweat
She said "Don't get upset 'cause you just might break a string
And that won't do a thing for your show

So I said to myself
I said "Self, do you see what is sailing through my soul?"
And I gotta have some more, don't ya know

Play something sweet, play something mellow
Play something I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play something sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

It's enough to make it light in the dark
It's enough to make a bite just a bark
It's enough to make a body move around
It's enough to make a rabbit hug a dog
Play something sweet

Well, I tried to run my game
She said "Man, that's the same old thing I've heard before"
And I'm too tired to go for your show (again and again)

And she started to explain
She said "Man, I ain't saying what you're playing just can't make it
But I just can't take it anymore"

Play something sweet, play something mellow
Play something I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play something sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play something sweet, play something mellow
Play something I can sink my teeth in like Jello
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

Play something sweet and make it funky
Just let me lay back and grin like a monkey
Play something I can understand
Play me some Brickyard Blues

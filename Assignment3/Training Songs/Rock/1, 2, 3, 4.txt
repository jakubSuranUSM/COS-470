One, two
One, two, three, four
Give me more lovin' than I've ever had.
Make it all better when I'm feelin' sad.
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not.
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad.
Barely gettin' mad,
I'm so glad I found you.
I love being around you.

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.
I love you.
(I love you)
There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.
I love you.
(I love you)

Give me more lovin' from the very start.
Piece me back together when I fall apart.
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends.
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad.
Best that I've had.
I'm so glad that I found you.
I love being around you.

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.
I love you.
(I love you)
There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.
I love you.
(I love you)

I love you
(I love you)

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.

There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four I love you.

I think I'm going to Katmandu
That's really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k Katmandu
I think that's really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu

I got no kick against the west coast
Warner brothers are such good hosts
I raise my whiskey glass and give them a toast
I'm sure they know it's true
I got no rap against the southern states
Every time I've been there it's been great
But now I'm leaving and I can't be late
And to myself be true

That's why I'm going to Katmandu
Up to the mountain's where I'm going to
And if I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
Aw, k-k-k-k-k-k Katmandu
Really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu

Oh
Take it away
I ain't got nothin' 'gainst the east coast
You want some people where they got the most
And New York City's like a friendly ghost
You seem to pass right through
I know I'm gonna miss the USA
I guess I'll miss it every single day
But no one loves me here anyway
I know my plane is due

The one that's going to Katmandu
Up to the mountain's where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do
K-k-k-k-k-k Katmandu
Really, really, really, going to
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu, oh
Ooh huh huh
Ooh huh huh ooh yeah

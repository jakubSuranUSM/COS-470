There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
You could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first

Well the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall

Well a years went by since .....that's the truth
Well a years gone (them mean bastards ain't they?)
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
Never made that wall

Well there's never been a man ever shook this can
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide

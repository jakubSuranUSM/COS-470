My Girl's got a really big forehead
My girl's only got four toes
She knows I'm as good as she'll get
She always knows
My girl's got a shiny tuxedo
She frowns every time I smile
She knows that she'll always be there though
She always knows
(chorus)
She's got a motor car
She knows it can go fast
It drives remote control
She's too slow
My friends say she's got a great hairpiece
He says she's a waste of time
She says that her name is Clarice
I don't mind
(chorus)
My girl says that I should get out more
I spend too much time alone
I've marred her precious ego
Half of which is silicone
(chorus)
My life's got a bad sense of humour
My girl's got a mouth full of teeth
She smiles every time I go near her
My name is Keith
My name is Keith
My name is Keith
My name is Keith

I've been stuffed in your pocket for the last hundred days
When I don't get my bath I take it out on the slaves
So grease up your baby for the ball on the hill
Polish them rockets now and swallow those pills
And say ohSpace Lord mother mother 

There's a car in the field now in a column of flame
With two doors to choose but only one bears your name
You been drinkin' my blood while I been lickin' your wounds
Well I'll shave off the pitch now and the scope of your tune
You'll sing oh, Space Lord mother mother

I left my throne a million miles away
I drink from your tit and sing the blues every day
Give me the strength to split the world in two now
Yeah
I ate all the rest and now I've gotta eat you
 
Milking my nightmares and using my name
You're stabbing my cortex when you know I'm insane
I'm squeezed out in hump-drive and I'm drowning in love
Encompass immortal position above
And say oh, Space Lord mother mother

Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother
 
I lost my soul when I fell to earth
My planets call me to the void of my birth
The time has come for me to kill this game
Now open wide and say my name

Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother
Space Lord mother mother

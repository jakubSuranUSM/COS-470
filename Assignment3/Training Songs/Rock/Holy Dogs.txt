I want to see another summer, not a year-long rain
I'll leave my door wide open
I want the freaks to be happy again
 
When the dogs come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
Yeah, the dogs will come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
Goodbye for a lifetime
Don't want to say goodbye for a while
 
I want to swim in the water and watch all the faces swim by
I want to be the solution
But everyone is just the same as I
 
When the dogs come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
Yeah, the dogs will come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
Goodbye for a lifetime
I never want to say goodbye for a while
Goodbye for a lifetime
Don't want to say goodbye for a while
 
I cross the finish line; it's over
And take a ride on my machine
And everyone is free to follow me
But my direction will never be seen
 
When the dogs come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
I know those dogs will come with their mouths wide open
To take me away
Goodbye for a lifetime
Don't want to say goodbye for a while
Goodbye for a lifetime
I don't want to say goodbye for a while
 
And then I'll sail my sinking ship into the sun
I'll hear the screams and feel the waves from everyone
In the end when all is done, I'll start anew
Maybe I'll come back for you

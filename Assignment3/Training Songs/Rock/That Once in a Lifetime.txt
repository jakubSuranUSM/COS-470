True love had found us and vowed to be around us
Till the end of the time (baby baby)
And we were the lovers who once could show the others
How a poem should rhyme (oh didn't we baby)
That love has faded from your touch somehow
It seems one-sided to me now, I beg you

Babe lets bring back that once in a lifetime
When we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
And kissed in the sun
Lets try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, lets fly
Don't say goodbye
Don't let our love just die

And though I'm so near you I'm living in the fear 
You will leave soon (baby baby)
And we sang the chorus that love had written for us
But we fell out of tune (oh didn't we baby)
No doubt this broken heart will never mend
You know Ill love you to the end, I beg you

Babe lets bring back that once in a lifetime
When we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
And kissed in the sun
Lets try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, lets fly
Don't say goodbye
Don't let our love just die
Bring back the love of yesterday
That somehow got away
'Cause baby I love you
You know that I love you

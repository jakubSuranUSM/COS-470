I didn't think that I can get too much higher than this
I'm out of my head, I'm in total state of bliss
Moves me baby when she moves around
I'm in heaven and I just can't come down
No I won't be being lazy when she comes to town
No I won't be being lazy when she comes to town

Here she comes
Here she comes

Here she comes
Puts one foot in front of the other
She just moves me, she just move me
Like no other
I'm on the ceiling, I'm climbing the walls
Things just get better baby, when she call me
I'm in heaven and I just can't come down
No I won't be being lazy when she comes to town

Here she comes

Directly to my helmet, directly to my heart
Directly to my hairline, where do I start?
It''s not like art is just value, just try not to argue

Your work looks good, your look works great
How can I state the point of view you create
It''s not too late to resolve it and if I can't solve it

I''ll look at the object and that's what I'll call it
How can I respect the opinions of none?
Directly enhancing the sum

Directly to my helmet, indirectly to my soul
If I said, I loved it, oh, cheese ball [Unverified], I''m not that tall
So, the impact was more than deserving
The plastic champagne was the least of unnerving

How can I respect the opinions of none?
Directly enhancing the sum
Above all, work songs [Unverified]
I''ll tell you it never gets old
I''ll tell you it never gets old

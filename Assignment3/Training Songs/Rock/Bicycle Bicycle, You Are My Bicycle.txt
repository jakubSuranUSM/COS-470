We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

We will come to your town
Burn your house down
Turn the sky brown
All because, all because, all because

We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

Change the eye color of every lady
We're fast, we're fast
We're fast we're having a blast
All because

We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

Change the color of your make up
All the sleepyheads won't wear some
All because, all because, all because
Because, because, because, because
Because, because, because

[Incomprehensible]

Have fun and be safe with it
Just do it, mosh me up
We ride bikes, cars are for idiots
All because, all because

We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby
We're on two wheels baby

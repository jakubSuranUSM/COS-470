I can see the unthinkable beyond visions and dreams. 
Some interpret the signs it's all a mystery to me 
But my faith sees the invisible, 
Looks into the soul that come across the unseen 
Am I blind or do I see for the first time 
In a world of hate where love's denied 
But my faith believes the impossible 
Here for the taking so I'm ready to go 

Higher, a place I've only imagined 
Higher, farther than I've ever gone 
Higher, it'll all make sense when I get there 
All the things I know and the things I don't 
I'm standing on my own 

This unparalleled life is a gift and not my own 
So I keep on walking through the valley of the unknown 
My faith redeems the most despicable, 
Low life, no good man like me 
My life is sketched out on these pages like a map 
Been good, I've been bad but it shows you where I'm at 
Look real close, it'll show you how to find 
The treasure of your soul, one love divine 

Higher, a place I've only imagined 
Higher, farther than I've ever gone 
Higher, it'll all make sense when I get there 
All the things I know and the things I don't 
I'm standing on my own 

If that's all that you have to give (is that all you have to give) 
Take me higher, I want to go higher 
Go ahead, I wonâ€™t settle for less 
Take me higher, I want to go higher 
So you can do what you want 
And say what you want 
Live how you want 
And die how you want 
But this faith has put my mind at ease, 
Souls at peace and my spirit flies free! 

Higher, a place I've only imagined 
Higher, farther than I've ever gone 
Higher, it'll all make sense when I get there 
All the things I know and the things I don't 
I'm standing on my own

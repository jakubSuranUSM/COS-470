The rock-star trip. Some serious ship
White-knuckle journey blackened my
Eye & cut my lip
Better to be a doctor or a man who
Walks the earth
Hedonistic laughing boys
What's any of it worth?

Look at myself
Look at myself

Escaped to this car
Drove to a bar somewhere
The beautiful game
Such a thin line between love & hate

Look at myself
Look at myself

Mr Taurus ate a thesaurus
Made the girls cry & skipped straight
To the chorus
Mr Taurus had a great fall
All the King's horses were no good
At all
No good at all

Here's one I broke earlier
I broke earlier

Woke up in a spaceship of shimmer
Ing gold
Tutenkhamen sleeping
Should'a left him alone
Floating round in Orion
Arrow pointing to heaven
Between all the planets
Out in the cold

Everyone I love
Everyone I love
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
And I have time to look at myself
Look at myself
Look at myself

And I've seen enough
I've seen enough
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
Everyone I love lives somewhere else

Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else

Momma said "There's something weird 'bout Billy
I looked in his room, his bed wasn't slept in at all last night
But Papa said "Ah, now Momma don't you go talking silly
He's just a young boy, he's just sowing his wild oats and that's arightâ??
But momma said "No, something real strange 'bout my Billy
Farmer down the road said he lost a few of his sheep last night
I know he's my own flesh and blood but he makes my blood run chilly
'Cause I saw from my window and he was on the hill just screaming at the moonâ??

Is it any wonder
We hate to see the sun go down
And is it any wonder
We hate to see the full moon coming 'round

So Papa said "I guess there's only one thing to do 'bout Billy
Hand me down my gun son and bring along that silver dinner bellâ??
But Momma "Papa I beg you don't kill him
'Cause I just bear to think about my baby in hellâ??
He went down to the blacksmith got him out of bed and said
"Get your fire hot
Oh shut up your shutters close down your doors, we're gonna need all the heat you got
'Cause I want you to melt my silver bell down to a single shot
I got a job to do and I got to get it done before the sun comes upâ??

So is it any wonder
That we hate to see the sun go down

Then we heard a shot and I said "Papa got himâ??
Then we heard a scream and Momma smiled and said "Betcha Billy got himâ??
But when I opened up my eyes there was Papa standing in the doorway staring at the floor
And my big brother Billy never did come home no more

Now is it any wonder
We hate to see the sun go down
And is it any wonder
We to see the full moon coming 'round

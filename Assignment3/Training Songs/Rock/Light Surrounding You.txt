I see you by the water
Your toes dipped in the sand
I thought that it was over
I thought you'd understand
But the feeling is returning
Though time has made us change
And I understand if you don't
Wanna talk to me about it
Tonight
Oh, tonight

'cause I see the light surrounding you
So don't be afraid of something new

Time was overtaking me
And I guess I was confused
They were all inviting me
But I wish I had refused
'cause I'd been there before
And I've seen it all
And I believe in you

And if you never had my heart
I would've never called you back
At the start that night
And I want you to know

That I see the light surrounding you
So don't be afraid of something new
'cause I see the light surrounding you
So don't be afraid of what you're turning into

Blue-eyed sun shines on me
In the morning
Can't help but feel a little cold
Thinking of you

'cause I see the light surrounding you
So don't be afraid of something new
'cause I see the light surrounding you
So don't be afraid of what you're turning into
No, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
'cause I see the light
'cause I see the light
'cause I see the light surrounding you

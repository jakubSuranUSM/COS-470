What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
(But I do know)
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
I don't know what a slide rule is for
(But I do know)
But I do know "one and one is two"
And if this one could be with you
(A wonderful world)
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student,
But I'm tryin' to be
I think that maybe by bein' an 'A'-student, baby-baby
I could win your love for me

Don't know much about the Middle Ages
Looked at the pictures then I turned the pages
Don't know nothin' 'bout no "Rise and fall"
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' at all
(But I do know)
Girl it's you that I've been thinkin' of
And if I could only win your love (oh girl)
What a wonderful, (what a) wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be

What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

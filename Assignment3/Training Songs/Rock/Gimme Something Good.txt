I can't talk
My mind is so blank
So I'm going for a walk
I've got nothing left to say

I can't see
Some darkness on the rise
I'll be waiting here
'Til the end of time

All my life been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good

I was playing dead
It didn't make a sound
Holding my breath
Going underground
So I can't talk
I got nothing to say
It's like there's no tomorrow
Barely yesterday

All my life been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good oh now

All my life been shaking
Wanting something
Holding everybody back
Demanding ransom
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good oh now

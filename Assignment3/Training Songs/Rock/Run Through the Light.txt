I asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
Of all the moments spent together
That move like never ending streams

Run through the light
Now everything is alright
Run through the light of day
Run to the light of nights

And every movement made together
Till every thought was just the same
And all the pieces fit forever
In the game

The lights run through the lights
Now everything is alright
Run through the light of day
You run to the light of night

Run to the light
Run to the light
Run to the lights, to the lights

I asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
(Run through the lights)
Of all the moments spent together
(Run to the lights)
That move like never ending streams
(Run through the lights)
(Run to the lights)

Welcome to the light
Now everything is okay
You run through the light of night
You come to the light of day

I've been waiting for you to call me, been waiting for the time of my life?
I just know I'm so lonely here without you...
I've been needing the truth to enlight me, been waiting in vain or in lies?
I just know I'm so lonely here without you...

Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...
Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...

Now I won't be waiting for you to to call me, not waiting for the rest of my life
Now I must let go of these feelings and make it without you
Now I won't be leting the doubt in to stall me, I just have to get on with my life
And hopefully soon I won't be thinkin about you

Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...
Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...

Dying here without you...

Think I was looking for trouble
Think I was looking for home in a foreign land
Think I was caught in a bubble
Now I think it's time to reach the right hand

Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...
Cause I'm ready to play now, love strikes, calling me back again
I'm ready to play now...

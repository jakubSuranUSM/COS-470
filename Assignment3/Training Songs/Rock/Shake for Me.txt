Well it sho' look good but it
Don't mean a thang to me
Yes, it sho' look good but it
Don't mean a thang to me
I've got a cool shakin' baby
Shake like a wild wood tree

Yeah, you went away baby
You got back a little too late
Yeah, you went away baby
You got back a little too late
I've got a cool shakin' baby
Shake like jello on a plate

When my baby walks
You know she's fightin' below
Yeah, when my baby walks
You know she's fightin' below
Yes and when she stops
Her flesh, it shakes like jello

Well, now shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah, now shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah, now shake a little baby
Shake like a wild wood tree

Now let it shake, now let it shake
Now let it shake, now let it shake
Let it shake a little, baby
Shake like a wild wood tree

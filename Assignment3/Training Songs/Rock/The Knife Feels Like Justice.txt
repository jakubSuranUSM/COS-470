So you think that you have found a better life then you should live
And you are through giving it all away, wish there was something I could say
By the time you looked into the mirror and saw someone else looking back
I wish I could find the words but there's nothing that even comes close
Cause there ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me
And you can't go on when the knife feels like justice
When the sun dies down and the air grows cold
And the moon plays tricks through the night
But I low like a snake out of sight
All you got is no other life
You want to laugh say I'm insane
Don't ever since to come in from the rain
I don't know why I keep myself
To even try
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me
And you can't go on when the knife feels like justice
Slip away
Slip away
Slip away
So you think that you won me over
By setting me on fire
When the sound of your beating heart
And your burning heart desire
By the time I looked at your reflection and saw someone else lookin back
It's a shame things happened that way cause there's no one that even comes close
And there ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me
And you can't go on when the knife feels like justice
I said you can't go on when the blade tears inside you
You can't go on when the knife feels like justice

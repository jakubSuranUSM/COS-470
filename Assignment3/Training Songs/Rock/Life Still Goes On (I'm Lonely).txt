Standin' in the street, shaved, I'm washed and neat
And the time is mine
But I don't even know where I'm goin'
Been too long in town, just workin' right tied down
But I got my pay
And I'm willin' to spend what I'm earnin'
Maybe over town, where the say love can be found anytime of day
I'll be lookin' you know I've been wishin'
Need a lovin' face, nice hair, some fancy lace
Someone soft and warm
Then those nights spent alone won't seem wasted

Get me on down, get me into the place
Where the beat of the street, and the people that meet
Take the blues far away 
'Cause I'm lonely, ya baby I'm lonely
And life still goes on where I'm goin'

Listen
Can you hear me now 
Can you hear me I'm callin' for lovin'
Hear me
Won't you listen now
Can you hear me I'm callin' for lovin'

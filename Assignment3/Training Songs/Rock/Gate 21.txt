You came to me within a dream
Not everyone is who they seem,
All these words we can't redeem,
Like the great magic of our world,
Corroborated by your words,
Splitting planets into thirds.

Baby oh baby,
Baby my baby,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you, lalala,
Baby oh baby,
Baby my babe,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you

To all the leaves that fall in vain,
While god and goddess go insane
All these words in your domain,
The watches kill time as the books read,
Inadvertently we bleed
Fighting for what we deceive, 

Baby oh baby,
Baby my baby,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you, lalala,
Baby oh baby,
Baby my babe,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you

Leave me alone,
Leave me alone,
Now why can't you see that you always
Perturb me so
Nearing the end of the world, just leave me
Alone
Leave me alone
Why can't you see that you always perturb me 
So
Nearing the end of the world, leave me alone,
Leave me alone.

Baby oh baby,
Baby my baby,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you, lalala,
Baby oh baby,
Baby my babe,
Baby ooh babe
I miss you

Give me a reason tell me what you know
Burning in the limelight, dim the after cloud
Is it all in vain, it never had a face
I´m forgetting better, the future is taking shape
Traces that moves, clouding my view
Strap a rim boy, I was sending you
Back to oblivion
Back to oblivion
Back to oblivion
Send my message home
I fell it in my bones, I hear it in the air
Shadow reign the brainwaves holding me here
Seven years of madness for most must stain
Separate the universe as I´m heading
Back to oblivion
Back to oblivion
Back to oblivion
Send my message home
I think we are caving in
I think we are caving in
I think we are caving in

The stars will dwarf me
And the winds will scatter me
And the earth will have me at last 
I weep upon my own grave
(will) cry for grief
(will) cry for love
I will cry from guilt 
And so I must ask the unanswerable
Why? 
And I must ask the unanswerable 
It's in the hand that heals
It's in the hand that blesses
It's in the hand that kills
It's in the hand that seeks redemption
By gently stroking the bruises of it's fury's crimes
This is the search for a god
This is the horror of mortality
This is the shadow of death tormenting me 
This is the yearning for more
The yearning for more than this 
I yearn 
I yearn 
I yearn

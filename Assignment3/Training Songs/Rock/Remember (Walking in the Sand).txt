Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh, lemme think, lemme think, what shall I do?
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no...

(Remember) Walking in the sand
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
(Remember) The night was so exciting
(Remember) Her smile was so inviting
(Remember) Then she touched my cheek
(Remember) With her fingertips
(Remember) Softly, softly we met with a kiss

Whatever happened to
That girl that I once knew
The girl that said she'd be true
Oh, whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you
What will you do with it now

It was a dream, dream I had last night
I dreamed I went to the UN
And set the whole nation right
I dreamed of callin' old Castro
To the morning flo'
Looked him right in the eye and said, "Boy,
You got to go!
I'm tired of your foolishness
And if you don't behave,
I'm goin' grab you by your beard, 
Give you a Georgia shave!"
It was a dream, a dream I had last night
I dreamed I went to the UN
And set the whole nation right
Then I told old Khrushchev
Sittin' there looking bad,
"Get that junk outta Cuba
â€˜Fore you make me mad.
Dig up them missile bases
Take them planes and all
Or I'll grab me a bat
With your head for the ball!"
It was a dream, dream I had last night
I dreamed I went to the UN
And set the whole nation right
Then into Washington they call me
An' I went
Hadda be the guest
Of the President
He said, "Red, I'm glad to see you,
So glad you come down here
To help me run the Russians
From the western hemisphere!"
I said, "You can run the country
I'm goin' to run the Senate
Oughtta make a few changes
With a few soul brothers in it.
Ray Charles and Lightnin' Hopkins
And a guy like Jimmy Reed
Bo Diddley and Big Mabel
Be all I need!"
It was a dream, a dream I had last night
I dreamed I went to the UN
And set the whole nation right

So fine, got everything I need
You got me down, on my bended knees
You know to lay me down
When I'm feelin slow
C'mon

So fine, you're everything I want
You got me hummin, oh that song
You know to lay me back, and you know that's true
My baby gives me, much more than I can use
You know to lay me back, when I'm feelin slow
C'mon

The river cools, I believe
I want to step into the breeze
C'mon

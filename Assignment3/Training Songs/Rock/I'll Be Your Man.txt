Too many voices, too many noises
Invisible wires keeping us apart
So many choices, but they're all disappointments
And they only seal me away from you

Climb into our own private bubble
Let's get into all kinds of trouble

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over from the end of the sofa
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

So many faces, staring at their shoelaces
When all anyone wants is to be seen
So tonight let's be honest
We only want to be wanted
And darling you got me wanting you

Everything that I'm trying to say
Just sounds like a worn out cliche

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over from the end of the sofa
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

What are we all looking for?
Someone we just can't ignore it's
Real love dripping from my heart
You've got me tripping
What are we all looking for?

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man

(Slide over here)
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
(Slide over here)
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over from the end of the sofa
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I'll be your man, I'll be your man
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

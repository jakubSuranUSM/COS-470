Don't you know I love you
Don't you know I care
Don't you know I love you
Don't you know I care
Yeah the love I have for you
I take you anywhere
I like to take you for a walk
Or take you for a ride
I like to take you for a walk
Or take you for a ride
I like to do everything
That your 'lil heart desires

Don't you know don't you know
Don't you know don't you know

Yes I want you to believe me
'Cause IÂ´m the one who know
I like to take you for a walk
Or take you for a ride
I like to take you for a walk
Or take you for a ride
I like to do everything
That your little heart desires

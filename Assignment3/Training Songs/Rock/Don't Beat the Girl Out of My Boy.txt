Don't beat the girl out of my boy
Don't beat the girl out of my boy
Stare in the light, pale green eyes
Don't beat the girl out of my boy

You're so fine
With your heavy diamond eyes
You're so fine
Keep me steady as we rise

Don't beat the girl out of my boy
Don't beat the girl out of my boy
Stare in the light, pale green eyes
Don't beat the girl out of my boy

So fine
In our wanderlust we ride
So wild
Like the darkest waves at night

So fine
There's no words, just you and I
So wild
Like the darkest waves at night
I shout out
Let us, be us

A-wouldn't it be nice to get on with me neighbours?
But they make it very clear, yhey've got no room for ravers
They stop me from groovin', they bang on me wall
They doing me crust in, it's no good at all, ah
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
I close my eyes and drift away-a
Here we all are sittin' in a rainbow
Gor blimey, hello Mrs. Jones, how's old Bert's lumbago? (he mustn't grumble)
(Tweedle-dee) I'll sing you a song with no words and no tune (twiddly-dee)
To sing in your party while you souse at the moon (oh yeah)
Lazy Sunday afternoon, I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away-a

Root-de-doo-de-doo, a-root-de-doot-de-doy-di
A-root-de-doot-de-dum, a-ree-de-dee-de-doo-dee (doo-doo, doo-doo)
There's no one to hear me, there's nothing to say
And no one can stop me from feeling this way, yeah
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift a-
Close my mind and drift away, close my eyes and drift away

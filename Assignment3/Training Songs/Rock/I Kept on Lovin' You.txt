I ran away from you
And left you crying
And though I'm back to stay
You think I'm lying
But I've changed
My ways
And my wandering days are through
Through it all
I kept on loving you

(*) Don't worry baby
Please don't cry
I'm home for good
And I will never leave you

(**) Don't worry baby
Please don't cry
You must believe me
And I will never leave you
Never leave you

You've heard this song before
I can't deny it
The road is long and wide
I had to try it
Though I love
You girl
These were things
I had to do
Through it all
I kept on loving you

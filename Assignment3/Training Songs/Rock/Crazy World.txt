Why does a missile look like a cock
Why is the world so fucked up
Why can't love turn out to be true
Show me a man who's not just a stooge

Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in
It's a crazy crazy world we live in
Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in
It's a crazy crazy world we live in

How come the blind never see the light
How come the voices are always on time
Why can't love turn out to be true
Show me a woman who's not just a stooge

Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in
It's a crazy crazy world we live in
Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in
It's a crazy crazy world we live in

How come a missile never ever stops
How come the world so messed up
Why can't love turn out to be true
Show me a man who's not just a stooge

Well it's a crazy world we live in
Crazy crazy world we live in
It's a crazy crazy world we live in
Crazy crazy world we live in

It's a crazy crazy world we live in
Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in, yeah
Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in
Well it's a crazy crazy world we live in

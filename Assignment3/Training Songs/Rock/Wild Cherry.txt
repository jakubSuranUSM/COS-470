Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry - talkin' 'bout Cherry, Wild Wild Cherry,
She make love like a wildcat - roll like a wire-chrome wheel,
She tastes so good, Wild Cherry - ooh, she makes me feel!
Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry.

Dressed like Raggedy Annie - red-headed baby doll,
Spends her time drinkin' wine - diggin' that rock and roll.
Cherry, Wild Wild Cherry.

She make love like a wildcat - roll like a wire-chrome wheel,
She tastes so good, Wild Cherry - ooh she makes me feel,
Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry. Whoa!

Rock on!

You've heard about 8-ball Sally - you've heard of Kneetrembler Jane,
Well I got a girl, crazy little momma - 'bout to drive me insane,
Wild Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry.

She make love like a wildcat - roll like a wire-chrome wheel,
She tastes so good, uh-ooh Wild Cherry - yeah, she makes me feel!
Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry.
Yea! Woo!

She loves with a natural feelin' - moves like a lovin' machine,
When she gets down and starts messin' around - fast lovin', speedy and lean.
Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry.

I told you, she makes love like a wildcat - roll like a wire-chrome wheel,
She tastes so good, ah, Wild Cherry - how she makes me feel!
Cherry, Wild, Wild Cherry, yeah.
Woo!

You know she tastes so good - You know she tastes so good,
You know she tastes so good - You know she tastes so good,

I'm talkin' about Cherry - I'm talkin' about Cherry,
I said Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild Cherry,
I said Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild Cherry,
Ah, the way she moves - I love the way she gets down,
Oh Cherry, Cherry, Cherry...

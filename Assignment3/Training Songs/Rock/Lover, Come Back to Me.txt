Little lover won't you come back to me
The sky was blue in high above the moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing lover where can you be
You came at last love had its day that day is past you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing lover come back to me
I remember every little thing you used to do I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along I walk along with you no wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue the night is cold the moon is new but love is old
And while I wait this heart of mine is singing lover come on home to me

But while I'm waiting here this heart of mine is singing lover bring yourself on home

But while I'm waiting here this heart of mine is singing lover come on home to me yeah
I remember every little thing

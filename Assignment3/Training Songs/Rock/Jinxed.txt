My heart's in trouble, my soul's on fire
My mind is aching for my one desire
This heavy weather, will it never seem to end?
I start to wonder, will my poor heart ever mend?

I don't know what I'm supposed to think
This must be some kind of jinx

My line's been tapped, my mail's been screened 
I could be wrong but that's the way I feel
Everything I try just crumbles before I start
Feel like a lost child, searching in the dark

Will I swim or will I sink?
This must be some kind of jinx

You've got your heart locked up 
And you've thrown away the key
Feel like I'm sinking down 
Into the endless sea

My heart's uneasy, my soul's on fire
You're the ice - please, put out this fire
This crazy weather, will it never seem to end?
It's getting harder with all the bad news that

I don't know what I'm supposed to think
This must be some kind of jinx
I don't care what anybody thinks
'Cause this must be some kind of jinx
Will I swim or will I sink?
This must be some kind of jinx

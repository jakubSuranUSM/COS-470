Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly
Please don't go rushing by
Stay and make my heart fly

'Cause I never seem to notice time
When you're with me
You can tell it to the birds

I'll tell the bees
I can't do any more
To got inside your door
I can't do any more
Please let me inside your door.

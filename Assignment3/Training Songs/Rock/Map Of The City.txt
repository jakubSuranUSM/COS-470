She had a face like a cook
I'd seen in the kitchen of the Anchor Hotel
See her in the city virgin
She's friendly and you know her well
A thousand-odd broken stallions
Still very quick on the beat
Full-size, the buffet begs before them All you can eat

I'm drawing up a plan for the city
Filled with ten thousand crooked stairs
Some lead up to heaven
Some look through you like you're not even there

Could it be that I'll see her
When I cut across the park
Walking along with her hound?
When I look at myself in the shower
I wonder if she'll see what I see
And will she like what she has found
I rolled out from under the engine
And I saw her standing there
I knew right then that I could love her forever
Even when her breasts are rotted with cancer

I wonder where she went when she said go
A sailor has to masturbate until the ship lands
A lot of things happen out on the open sea 
I'm gonna sell Arizona to Japan

I'm drawing up a plan for the city
Filled with ten thousand crooked stares
Some lead up to heaven
Some look through you like you're not even there

Oh Vanessa, I learned my lessons
And I quit that messing around
So won't you come back to me?
I'll be good to you sweetheart, I'm begging for a new start
Vanessa, it ain't necessary for you to keep on hurting me?

Now I know I've been wrong but you ain't been right
Treat me like another man, never had a thing
I come by your house and you turn off the light
I call you on the phone and it just rings, rings, rings

Vanessa, I learned my lessons
I quit all that messing around
So won't you come back to me?
I'll stay home with you sweetheart, I'm begging for a new start
Vanessa, it ain't necessary for you to keep on hurting me?

Tell me baby, sort of maybe
You've been turning and coming back
Don't you be so foolish
Don't you treat me foolish like that
I hate that, Vanessa

I spoke to your mom and I talk to your dad
They just sympathized with all other guys
My friends say they see ya and ya not doing bad
That makes me wanna go home and cry, cry, cry

Oh Vanessa, I learned my lessons
I quit that messing around
So won't you come back to me
I'll be good to you sweetheart, I'm asking for a new start
Vanessa, it ain't necessary for you to keep on hurting me?

And no Vanessa, no Vanessa, got no Vanessa
No Vanessa, no Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa
Vanessa, Vanessa
Oh no, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa
Oh, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa
Oh, Vanessa, oh Vanessa, oh Vanessa, oh Vanessa
Got no Vanessa, no Vanessa, no Vanessa

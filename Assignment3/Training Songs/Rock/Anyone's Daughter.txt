Well, I stood under your bedroom window, throwing up a brick
No one came, I threw one more, that really did the trick
Your daddy came and banged my head, he said "what kind of man
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl?" and threw me in the car
You're a farmer's daughter, you're a farmer's daughter
Why do I always get the kinda girl I didn't oughta get?
I won't get no more eggs and water, now I've laid the farmer's daughter

Imagine I was a full-grown man and I could talk just right
Could I come and see you here and do this every night?
Wham, the door comes crashing down, your daddy's face all pale
Says "come with me you hairy bum, I'll put you in my jail"
You're a judge's daughter, you're a judge's daughter
Why do I always get the kinda girl I didn't oughta get?
Now I'm getting jail and torture, 'cause I made the judge's daughter

Seems they're screaming law and order
When I go with anyone's daughter

Woman I should like some peace and daddy hold your tongue
I think you're gonna die of fright when I tell you what I've done
I can hear your tales and lies, you say I'm dumb and scraggy
But man this dumb and scraggy is your daughter's baby's daddy
She's a lucky daughter, such a lucky daughter
Why did I always get the kinda girl I didn't want to get?
Now I've got what I always fought for 'cause I've married a rich man's daughter

Whaddaya think of that?

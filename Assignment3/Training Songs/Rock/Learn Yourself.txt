Everybody thinks we'll fall apart.
Everybody's quick to point their fingers at what,
They think is causing the problem.
And what they don't see is what they won't see my friend.

And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.
And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.

Just like the holy scripture talks,
Of a road to redemption in amongst the thorns.
The path is beset by ego and greed,
And if we don't see then we won't ever be free.

And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.
And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.
Yes we will.

And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.
And we've all got to learn ourselves
Before we can judge some one else.

Along the path we walk we've only got to find.
Along the path we walk we've only got to find.
Along the path we walk we've only got to find.
Our own heart own mind, our own heart own mind
Our own heart own mind, our own heart own mind.

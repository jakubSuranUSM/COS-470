We're all walking a fine line and I'm
Walking towards you, and I
Hope that I'm right in thinking, I'll never walk alone
I'm always running from something
Now I'm running towards you
It may not be the right thing, but it's what I want to do

And in a different time, in a different place
I could see myself with you
And in a different time and a different place
I believe you could see yourself too

I'll be biding my time, and I'll be
Watching my step, 'cause I don't want to
Be starting something here that I might live to regret
'cause I have learnt my lesson
And I have learnt it well
There are some things in this life best left for time to tell

In a different time, in a different place
I could see myself with you
And in a different time and a different place
I believe you could see yourself too
In a different time, in a different place

I believe I could safely lay my life down in your hands
I believe that's what I'd do if you gave me half the chance
Oh I believe, oh I believe, oh I believe

In a different time, in a different place
I could see myself with you
And in a different time and a different place
I believe you could see yourself there too

In a different time, in a different place
I could see myself with you
And in a different time and a different place
Oh I believe you could see yourself there too

Different time, different place

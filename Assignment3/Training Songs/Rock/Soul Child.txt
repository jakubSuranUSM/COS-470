Seems like a dream, in some old silent movie scene
You come to me like in a mirror...
Held out my hand, finally I would understand
But you slipped away...
What did I say?

Over the years, through all the laughter and the tears
Time after time, I try to find you...
Then in some place, suddenly I will see your face
But when I get near, you disappear...

Still I feel you everywhere...
Soul child, are you waiting for me to find you?
Soul child, do you belong in my life?
Do I still keep building my world around you?
Dreams of you in my life forever.
Soul child, my sweet soul child
My sweet soul child

Right from the start, you said that we would never part.
If I believed that you you really loved me.

Sometimes it's true, I didn't think I needed you.
But now that you're gone, I know I was wrong.

Still I feel you everywhere...
Soul child, are you waiting for me to find you?
Soul child, do you belong in my life?
Do I still keep building my world around you?
Dreams of you in my life forever.
Soul child, my sweet soul child
My sweet soul child

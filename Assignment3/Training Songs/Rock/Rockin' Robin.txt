He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birds on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet-tweet-tweet

Rockin' robin (tweet-tweet-tweet)
Rock-rock-rockin' robin' (tweet-tweedilly-tweet)
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight (tweet-tweedilly-tweet)
Yeah

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin', "Go, bird, go"

Rockin' robin (tweet-tweet-tweet)

A pretty little raven at the bird bandstand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetop all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birds on Jaybird Street

Alright

Well, the pretty little raven at the bird bandstand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetop all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song

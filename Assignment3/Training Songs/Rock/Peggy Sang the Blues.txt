Peggy came to me in my sleep
In the middle of the night
On a Friday night last week
She whispered: "Hush and don't be scared"
Got me a few words of wisdom
That I came back to share

And she said
It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
No one gets remembered
For the things they didn't do

I said, "Peggy won't you stay here for awhile?"
We can drink whiskey
We can play cards
And we can get wild
She said: "We can play poker and we'll play for keeps"
"I only play angels lately and they never let me cheat"

It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
No one gets remembered
In this listless life
For the things they didn't do

And you can say I had a good start
And you could say I had class
And you could say I was born beneath the ceiling made of glass
But I always kept an open house
And yeah I always did right by my friends
And when it comes to Saint Peter's gate
I told the people remember one who needs to make amends

'Cause better times are coming
Better times ahead
And no one gets remembered
My deathless child
Don't waste too long in bed

And Peggy said:
It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
And no one gets remembered
In this listless, loveless life
For the things they didn't do
Now, now, now, now, now

Well Peggy sang the blues
I've been drifting off
Well Peggy sang the blues
And I've drifted off
Well Peggy sang the blues
And I've drifted off
Well Peggy sang the blues
Peggy sang the blues

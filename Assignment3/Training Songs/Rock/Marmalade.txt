Marmalade, sunny days, drugs make me wanna sit next to you
Doctors floating to and fro silverfish is on the go
I'm in rapture, I'm in deep, all I want to do is sleep
The sky enclose me, I'm going down
Marmalade marmalade, don't try to find me, don't try to pull me out, my marmalade
Marmalade marmalade, make me so happy, make me forget my name, my marmalade
My marmalade
Duck pond memories pass me by, paddle boats and cherry pie
Wet eyelashes look inside... droplets gather in your eye
Day and hours melt away, Dolly says I'm here to stay
It's hard to care, the mist comes down
Marmalade marmalade
Tell me a story
Help me forget 
I'm gone
My marmalade
Marmalade marmalade
Hide me somewhere
Carry me somewhere 
My marmalade
Marmalade marmalade
You're the devil
You're half empty now
My marmalade
My marmalade

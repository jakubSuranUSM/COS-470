Devil came to me 
And he said: I Know what you need 
Devil came to me 
And he said you just follow me 

This is the end but I'm not surprised
You will burn in hell 
Do you know why? 

Devil came to me 
And he said: I Know what you need
Devil came to me 
And he said: you belong to me 

This is the end but I'm not surprised 
You will burn in hell 
Do you know why? 

I lied for you, I lied for you
I lied for you, I lied for you 

The moon was red and night became my friend 
But the stars were evil 
And they said: like you were 
The moon was red and night became my friend 
But the stars were evil 
And they said: hey, like you were 
This is just the end 
You will burn in hell tell us if you're scared

The moon was red and night became my friend 
But the stars were evil 
And they said: hey, like you were 
This is just the end 
You will burn in hell tell us if you're scared 

Everybody say now I will take the lessons 
That I forgot to learn at school 
And they go like: everybody say you deserve 
What you get 
But oh! no, I didn't mean to hurt 

I lied for you, I lied for you 
I lied for you, I lied for you 

The moon was red and night became my friend 
But the stars were evil
And they said: like you were 
The moon was red and night became my friend 
But the stars were evil 
And they said: hey, like you were  this is just the end

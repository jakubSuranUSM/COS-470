When I come home alone late at night 
I watch TV and drink whiskey 
I put a suit on and fix my hair 
And everything's okay

[Chorus:]
I don't want to pass out in the street 
I just want to get home on my feet 
I have got an ego I can?t feed 
I wish I was okay (I wish I was okay) 
Oh yeah

I fall asleep sometimes, on the floor 
Fully dressed but still funky 
I wake up thinking 
'Oh what went wrong?
I wish I was okay 

[Chorus]

And I don?t want to pass out in the streets 
I just want to get home on my feet 
I have got an ego I can't feed 
I wish I was okay 

[Chorus]

Yeah yeah

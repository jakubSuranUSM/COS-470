Well Be Bop A Lula she's my baby 
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe 
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby 
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe 
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll. 
Well, she's the gal in the red blue jeans 
She's the queen of all the teens 
She's the woman that I know 
She's the woman that loves me so.
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby 
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll. (Let's rock) 
She's the woman that's got that beat 
She's the woman with the flyin' feet 
She's the woman walks around the store 
She's the woman that more, more, more, 
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby 
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll. (Let's rock again)
Ch: Be bop a lula...

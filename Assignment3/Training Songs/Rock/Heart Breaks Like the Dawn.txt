The day walks by and the night stands still
We run like kids at our first fire drill
Minding my manners, all I do is hurt
I cleaned my plate, tell me what's for dessert

The day walks by and the night stands still
And the heart breaks just like the dawn

When I close my eyes will I find you there
With a look on your face like a trespasser's prayer
If we don't chase our dreams, they'll chase us away
The sky breaks blue, but blue turns to grey

The day walks by and the night stands still
And the heart breaks just like the dawn

It's so much for our bodies to lie and discuss
There's love and there's light and there's dark and there's lust
Trust your own fears, do what you must
But decide what to do about us

I've got a fragile heart, seized by desire
For one taste of your mouth I would cake-walk through fire
You look twice as good as the law should allow
You've got my attention baby, what happens now

The day walks by and the night stands still
And the heart breaks just like the dawn

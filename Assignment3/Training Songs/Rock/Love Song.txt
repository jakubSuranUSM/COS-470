Make believe for hours and hours
You've got me surrendered to powers
That patently proceed to devour
Past the time prisoner to your fine wine

Gracefully you've captured my fallen
Faithfully I've come to recall them
Breathe you deep as you seep into my life line
All the pain has gone away

And all the words I love to say
Fall so easy to the page
And slip on the glaze
All the rules are thrown away
From the games we love to play

Kiss the lips from which we're made
In my masquerade
Make believe for hours and hours
You and me, lovers like fireworks
It's the only light I can see for miles

Let's go

I been walkin'.

I been talkin' – I been all up around the world and I been burned to the ground
I been high.
I been low – I been rode hard, put away wet, and I aint got nothing left but all my scars to show

Get up and walk, get up and run, get up young phoenix, and fly, fly, fly
Get up and walk, get up and run, get up young phoenix, and rise above, my son…

You might be right, you might be wrong.
But that don't mean a damn thing, when I'm all alone
Cause I'm gonna fly.
So high.
Cause Imma raise my wings up and I'm gonna leave this world far far behind.

Get up and walk, get up and run, get up young phoenix, and fly, fly, fly
Get up and walk, get up and run, get up young phoenix, and rise above, my son…

I know the tide gon' turn, I know the wind it gon' blow.
And I know the chains they wanna break me, I know I know
I know the tide gonna turn., I know the wind, it's gonna blow.
And I know the chains they won't break me, I know I know I know I know I know I know

And I know the tide gon' turn, and I know the wind gon' blow.
And I know the chains won't break me, Lord, and… I know I know, I don't need it no more.
I don't need it no more

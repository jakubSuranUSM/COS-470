One more morning is on the way,
It felt like the night was here to stay,
Meanwhile morning is on the way.

Daylight opening up the skies,
Grey light opening up your eyes,
Meanwhile morning is on the rise.

One more morning is on the way,
It felt like the night was here to stay,
Meanwhile morning is on the way.

Together we have this love
Even so it's not enough
Bruised and burned we won't lose heart
And just because life gets hard

Writing lying e-mails to our friends back home
Feeling guilty if we sometimes wanna be alone

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love

And a love like this makes us strong
We laugh it off if things go wrong
It's not you, forgive me if I find I need more space
Cause trust means we don't have to be together everyday

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love

Hand cannot erase this love
Hand cannot erase this love

The lights go down the band prepares 
The scene is set we're here to sell our wares
And we know that truth is an ever guiding light
So we sing our songs each and every night

Do you know can you feel it do you understand
What it's like to be living in a rock 'n roll band
Up and down the land on a one night stand

Well I've sworn that I'd been in this place before
Yes I wrote my name on the dressing room wall
It was another band on a one night stand

And it's all for the music
Love is in the band
And freedom we command
On a one night stand

(One night stand)
(One night stand)

And it's all for the music
Love is in the band
Freedom (freedom) we command
On a one night stand

The lights go down the band prepares 
The scene is set we're here to sell our wares
And we know that truth is an ever guiding light
So we sing our songs each and every night

Do you know can you feel it do you understand
What it's like to be living in a rock 'n roll band
Up and down the land on a one night stand

Well I've sworn that I'd been in this place before
Yes I wrote my name on the dressing room wall
It was another band on a one night stand
(Up and down the land on a one night stand)
(Up and down the land on a one night stand)

Yes it's all for the music (up and down the land on a one night stand)
Love is in the band (up and down the land on a one night stand)
(Up and down the land on a one night stand)
It's all for the music (up and down the land on a one night stand)
Love is in the band (up and down the land on a one night stand)

Streets are empty and the parks are dark
And the shadows in the doorway seem to shout at me
Its after midnight and I'm walking aling
I'm hearing footsteps down every alley I see
Make it past the factories, gotta get through the trees-
Night opens up on me
I'm only half home, headed on the path
To a night attack

Standing in a cold sweat, no escape
I wish I had an atom bomb, I'd even settle for a gun.
Feeling like a blind man running from a mad dog
Odds in his favour are 1,000 to one
Something moved-someones there
Night opens up on me
I'm only half home, headed on the path
To a night attack

Drifting apart, getting harder to hold you
Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?

Swept out of sight, rolling out on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then they might
Send us back to the sun

And I know, I know we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor, like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire

Head down, heading underground, feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up

The streets are alive now and everything's racing
You're on my mind, running in my veins
Fuelling the flame
Let's start it again (start it agaain)

Now I know, I know we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor, like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire

Oh oh oh 
Now don't tell me, no, that we're burning down (oh oh oh)
And don't tell me, no, that we're burning now (oh oh oh)

'Cause I know, I know we're losing light and our love is dying
Take, take me home, back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire

Now I know, I know we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor, like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire

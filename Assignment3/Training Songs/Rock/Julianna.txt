Do you think your gonna make it alright
Do you think your gonna come on home
I think about you every night
Ain't no way for leaving you alone
Do you think your gonna make it alright
Do you think your gonna come on home
Oh Julianna you better come home girl were did you run too
Oh Julianna you better run home well you still got a man to run too
Can't you hear me calling your name now
I'm calling just as loud as I can
Ain't nothing going to be the same no
Till I hold you in my arms again
Do you think your gonna make it alright
Do you think your gonna come on home

Oh Julianna you better come home girl where did you run too
Oh Julianna you better run home well you still got a man to run too
I had a dream last night that you called my name
And I held at my hands to greet you
The man in the bright red rain coat said
Better stay right here while I go out to teach her
I said no no she belongs to me
And the wind in the city blew colder
I saw a women in the pet shop window cry
With all the troubles of the world on his shoulder
Oh Julianna you better come home girl where did you run too
Oh Julianna you better run home well you still got a man to run too
Julianna baby
Julianna baby

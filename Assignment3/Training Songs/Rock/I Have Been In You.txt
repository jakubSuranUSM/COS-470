Na, na-na-na-na
Ooh-ooh, na, na-na-na-na
Ooh-ooh, na, na-na-na-na
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Well, I have been in you, baby
You have been in me
And we have been so intimately
Entwined
And it sure was fine

I have been in you, baby
You have been in me
And so you see
We have be so together
I thought that we would never
Return from forever
(Return from forever)
(Return from forever)

You have been in me
And understandably
I have been in and outta you (in and outta you, in and outta you)
And everywhere
You want me to (in and outta you)
Yes, you know it's true

And while (I was inside)
I mighta been (undignified)
And that is maybe (why you cried)
I don't know
Maybe so, but what's the difference now?

(I have been in you, baby)
(You have been in me)
Aw, little girl, there ain't no time to wash yer stinky hand
Go 'head and roll over, I'm goin' in you again
In you again
In you again
In you again

I'm goin' in you again, aah! (in you again, aah!)
I'm goin' in you again, aah! (in you again, aah!)
I'm goin' in you again, aah! (in you again, aah!)
I'm goin' in you again, aah! (in you again, aah!)

I'm goin' in you again, baby
You can go in me too, it's true
I'm goin' in you again, baby
And later, when we get through

I'm goin' in you again, aah! (in you again, aah!)
In you again (I'm goin' in you again, aah!)
In you again (I'm goin' in you again, aah!)
In you again (I'm goin' in you again, aah!)

The Preacher says to all his men: I hear Godly laughter
Can it be the end?
With eyes on fire, couldn't be so cold
I hear Godly laughter, let it be the end

Let it be the end 

Well I hate your conscience, Let's skip this world
I hate your Gods people who breed on earth {I hate your God he put me/
Over to the other side, I'm caught stepping out greed on earth}
Over to the other side, Save your brothers now

Let it be the end

Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes {Possibly: Ice!}

Honest men, These worthy men
In all my dreams, I hear Godly laughter
Unleash your souls, The Faceless knows
I'm disclosed, It's not the God I'm after

Let it be the end, let it be the end
Let it be the end believe us Chord of Souls
Let it be the end, let it be the end
Let it be the end between us Chord of Souls

Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

And I hate your country, And I hate your world
I hate your Gods people who breed on earth {...who breathe on...}
Over to the other side, I'm caught stepping out 
Over to the other side
I'm gonna recreate a religious experience to tear my fucking heart out

The End!- Believe us
Let it be the end
May the End believe us
Lord of Souls
May the End believe us
Let it be the end, let it be the end between us chord of souls

Let it end, let it end, let it end

Eyes, eyes

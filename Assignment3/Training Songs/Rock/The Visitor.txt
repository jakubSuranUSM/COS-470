Did it really make a difference? 
Was there strength enough to set me free? 
Am I even sure I'm living now? 
Or is this some kind of dream? 
Is it really that important? 
Did I really need to find this way? 
Have I never looked inside before? 
Have I always been afraid? 

The vampire waits on the corner of the street 
Past the clown and the words of the preacher 
Try to run, but you'll never beat the thief 
Are these the faces of The Visitor? 

It was there in a desperate breath 
It was born from a moment of death 
It was held in the weakest of faith 
But it seemed to last forever 

It was over in a moment of sight 
It was gone in a flash of a light 
It was lost in the heart of the night 
But it seemed to last forever 

You're never alone 
Take it from me 
You're never alone 
Just take it from me 
Take it from me 

Did it really make a difference? 
Am I really what I seem to be? 
Did I ever truly breathe again? 
Or is this some kind of dream?

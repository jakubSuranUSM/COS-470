Riding on a lucky wheel of seventeen
I think I'm gonna live to be 103
Feel like wild card -- what you say
A slice of the night's gonna come my way

Walking through the city
I'm a king of surprise
My midnight champagne's ready on ice
It's Saturday night, I got nerves of steel
I can roll all night on a roulette wheel

Let the night roll on
I'm looking for hell
Let the night roll on
I'm making a kill
It's Saturday night
I waited so long
Let the night roll on

Playing along with the rest of the world
Saxophone women...satisfied girls
I'm a wound-up string on a violin
The future's gonna take me where I've never been
I could be naked Sunday with nothing to wear
I wouldn't know it, I wouldn't care
It's Saturday night, I got nerves of steel
I can roll all night on a roulette wheel

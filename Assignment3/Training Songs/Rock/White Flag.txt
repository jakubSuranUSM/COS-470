Your yelling's getting loud
Keep it down now, keep it down now
There's talk going 'round this town
Keep it down now, keep it down now

Noises closing in from all sides
Warning all the ways to die
They say "you'd better give up, you'd better give up"

I'll be an army, no you're
Not gonna stop me gettin' through, ooh
I'll sing a marching song and
Stomp through the halls louder than you, ooh

I could surrender but I'd
Just be pretending, no I'd
Rather be dead than live a lie
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag

Whisper, move the air
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me?
Sometimes it's all I've got to spare
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me?

Noises closing in from all sides
Warning all the ways to die
They say "you'd better give up
You'd better give up" 
I say "I'll never give up, I'll never give up"

I'll be an army, no you're
Not gonna stop me gettin' through, ooh
I'll sing a marching song and
Stomp through the halls louder than you, ooh

I could surrender but I'd
Just be pretending, no I'd
Rather be dead than live a lie
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag

I'll be an army, no you're
Not gonna stop me gettin' through, ooh
I'll sing a marching song and
Stomp through the halls louder than you, ooh

I could surrender but I'd
Just be pretending, no I'd
Rather be dead than live a lie
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag
Burn the white flag

I'm sorry I didn't have more to say
Maybe I coulda changed your fate
You were so misunderstood
You coulda been anything you wanted to

It's a sad vacation
What can I say?
It's a sad vacation
Oh, you knew how to play

Flowers of romance
Hey, wasn't that you?
Belsen was a gas
Oh, just like you

Oh, you were so real
That's why they offed you
Singin' from your grave
It's so very hard to do

Because it's a sad vacation
What can I say?
It's a sad vacation
Oh, you knew how to play

Well, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

Well, it's a sad vacation
What can I say?

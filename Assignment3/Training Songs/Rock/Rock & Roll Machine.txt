Tonight's the night everybody's at the show
The girls and boys come to
Hear the rocket blow
You can't stop when the Rocket's playin'
Everybody jump and shout
Let's rock and reel it anyway you feel it
That's what this is all about
CHORUS:
Rock and Roll Machine
Faster than you ever seen
Rock and Roll Machine
All those eyes just lookin' at you
Ooh baby you're crazy
If you try to steal the show
Get set, get ready time to watch the Rocket go
Rock and Roll Machine plays faster
East as ringin' a bell
A fireball steamer, heavy metal screamer
Playin' licks hotter than hell

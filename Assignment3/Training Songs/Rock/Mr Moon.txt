Mr Moon, Mr Moon, maybe your time is coming
Mr Moon, Mr Moon, what's happening in that room
Well search your heart, before you die, before your time fades away
It was given as a promise to each and every man

I want to love you but I'm growing old
ten little soldiers screaming in my soul
Will she come over when it's time to go
Come on and show me little drummer boy, Mr. Moon

Sad but true, sad but true, you're telling me what to do
I've learned my lesson, that stupid question, now it hurts my pride
And you're a girl, a serious girl, showing me the world
Oh my love, you're so tired, but you must think quiet

I want to love you

I want to love you but I'm growing old
ten little soldiers screaming in my soul
The day is using up its final breath
I've never been so sure I've never doubted you, Mr Moon

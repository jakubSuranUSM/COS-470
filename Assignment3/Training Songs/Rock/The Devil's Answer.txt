People are looking but they don't know what to do 
It's the time of the season for the people like you 
Come back tomorrow, show the scars on your face 
It's a clue to the answer we all chase 

Three, five and seven lift the heaviest load 
reach the top of the heaven that's fallen below 
Devil may care but you wish for the best 

Can't you see there's an answer that lies there 
Come all you sinners and keep with the time 
can we see all the faces that have fallen behind 
Don't make the reason it's a secret for you 

There's a clue to the answer we all know 
There's no clue to the answer we all know 
People are looking but they don't know what to do 

It's the time of the season for the people like you
Come back tomorrow, show the scars on your face 
It's a clue to the answer we all chase 
It's a clue to the answer we all chase

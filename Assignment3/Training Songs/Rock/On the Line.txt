I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror
I'm a be feeling fine
Trying to get there is
All that's on my mind
When I'm on the line

Even though I run my race
With a smile on my face
It ain't easy, naw it ain't easy
Feel like the life of the party
But its all in your mind
On the line

I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror
I'm a be felling fine
Even when you falling
Just pretend your flying
When ya on the line

I'm with everybody but I'm still alone
Just look down that's my line your standing on
Lets keep it friendly and well be just fine
But don't cross that line

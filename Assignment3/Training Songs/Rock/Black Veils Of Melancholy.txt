If I see you hiding in the night by a peppercorn tree 
the tree it moves ,lets me see what I wanna see 
a poison gaze´f your mind is all that´s worrying me 

The pictures that I see are seen by no one else but me 
to cause the night to be in sight ,a little point of me 
I imagine nearly anything I want to see 

Black veils of melancholy falling on me 
black veils keep shadowing my mind 
black veils that make my mind seem small 

Black veils of melancholy falling on me 
black veils keep shadowing my mind 
black veils that make my mind seem small 

I see you with my eyes closed getting closer and closer to me 
I open my eye up and you´re not there ,it´s all in my mind 

Black veils of melancholy falling on me 
black veils keep shadowing my mind 
black veils that make my mind seem small 

Black veils of melancholy falling on me 
black veils keep shadowing my mind 
black veils that make my mind seem small ........

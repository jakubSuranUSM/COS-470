Ah la la, Ah la la
Gimme Three wishes
I wanna be that
Dirtyfinger and his six bitches

Ah la la, Ah la la
Gimme
More too
I wanna be in that crazy band or meuku

Ah la la, Ah la la
Would you be kind
Gimme one little more
And I'll be superfine

Ah la la, Ah la la
You're so cool
Can I be your friend?
I'lldrive you till the end

'cause you know but you don't wanna
'cause you want but you can't have it
'cause you know but you don't wanna
'cause you want but you can't have it

Ah la la, Ah la la
I'm so
Worried
I bought that posh clothing
But it still looks ugly

Ah la la, Ah la la
Am I stupid?
I'm doing the talking
But I don't get nothing

Ah la la, Ah la la
Alguém me avisa
Quando é bom parar
Defazer a íntima

Ah la la, Ah la la
You're so cool
Can I be your friend?
I'll drive you till the end

'cause you know but you don't wanna
'cause you want but you can't have it
'cause you know but you don't wanna
'cause you want but you can't have it

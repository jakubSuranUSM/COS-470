When I get home I found you sleeping
I said the words you know are true
And I'm stoned, stone cold in love with you

You don't have to turn the light on
Ain't had more than just a few
And I'm stoned, I'm stone cold in love with you
You don't have to wonder why now
Look at all the things you've been to me
I'll build my whole life on the sweet foundation
You've given, baby you know what I mean

I left my friends back in the poolroom
They'll still be drowning out the blues
I'm stoned, I'm stone cold in love with you

You don't have to wonder why
Look at all the things you've been
My heart lies on the sweet foundation
You've given, baby you know what I mean

I see your face below the window
I see the moonlight coming through
And I'm stoned, I'm stone cold in love with you
Yes I'm stoned, I'm stone cold in love with you

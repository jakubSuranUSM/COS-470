Energy, apathy, becoming one thing controlling and numbing the minds of the 
Poor things. The struggle becoming a battle you've already lost to discover 
Yourself, as a pillar a structure, but what have you got? To defend to repel 
To begin the resistance that never has ended. We live in a world in a nation 
That can't even fly it's own flag. We hang on to the past, with its 
Brutality and division. Why cant you just make a decision? The future is 
Yours. It's not theirs. It's not gods. It's not anyone's who presumes to own 
You or the thoughts that make an original, shift all the subliminal brain 
Massage from the rich man's poet who's bright lights will lure your weakness. 
Just keep the guns locked out of reach of the Children. Keep the guns locked 
Out of reach!

Can't you see you're breaking me
Can't you see you're faking me

Feel It
Can't You Feel It
Can't You Feel It
Can't You Feel That They've Failed You?

You're slowing the drugs in your veins are numbing every pain, every twinge, 
Every singe from the fire of globalization, you're warming your hands on the 
Bodies of children that learn so that MacDonald's can jack their yearly gross 
Earnings if it wasn't real it would seem to absurd. The fear grows, the fuse 
Blows on just one more bomb set by extremists that could have been me or 
Been you. A push or a shove when a smile or some love would have helped out 
That kid off his face on his dexies, his parents shove down his throat so 
They don't have to divert their attention from making their quota or buying 
That sofa that's just oh so comfy. As all the porn pours in vein the Nike 
Channel, just keep your guns locked so very far out of reach!

They've Failed You
Breaking Me Down With Their Holy Water

Fight back!

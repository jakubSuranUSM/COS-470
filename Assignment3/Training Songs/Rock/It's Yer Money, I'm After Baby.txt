Don''t give me love, oh no none of that stuff
cos it''s yer money I''m after, baby.
Your love and your kisses they''re
just not enough, it''s just yer
money I''m after, baby.

Well I know that it''s hard
and I know that it''s tuff
when each thing you''re giving me
is just not enough.
Forget your heart, it''s your bank
I wanna break, it''s just
yer money I''m after, baby.

Heaven''s above, no I''m not in love
it''s just yer money I''m after baby.
I''m sticking with you and, oh,
that''s just because
it''s yer money I''m after, baby.

I''m in love with myself
and nobody else

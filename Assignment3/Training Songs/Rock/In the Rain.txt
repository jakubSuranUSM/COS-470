I don't like you 
Wicked! 
I don't like you 
Not a little thing about you. 
There's a flower all around you 
In the rain 
Images of peace 
And now your pretty face 
Things that give me grins 
In the rain 
Tropical decision 
It was a mystical incision 
Thought you were in prison 
In the rain 
As you wander with the kid 
With a presage and a snip 
All the way to Memphis 
In the rain

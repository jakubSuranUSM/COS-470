No one really knows who's house you haunted
Places that you go best with me
Every time, every year
I'll keep it quiet

These things that you are for me
'Cause if it's all spinning up the wall
And if it goes for you, crack a skull
Maybe if you leave this time, tonight's show

Should've taken the high road
Now it's such a long way back
Instead I take the long road
Figured I would simply be getting back

Should've taken the high road
Now my days have all turned back
Instead I take the long road
Figured I would simply be getting back

No one really knows who's watching over here
Brought another man, these things I'm afraid
Thinking about home weighing on you
We bought our way, places to be

Well if it's all spinning up the wall
And if it works for you, crack a skull
Maybe you can beat this show
Tonight's show

And if it's too late to get in the car
And if it's already setting it all
Maybe you can practice it
Let's go

Should've taken the high road
Now it's such a long way back
Instead I take the long road
Figured I would simply be getting back

Should've taken the high road
Now my days have all turned back
Instead I take the long road
Figured I would simply be getting back

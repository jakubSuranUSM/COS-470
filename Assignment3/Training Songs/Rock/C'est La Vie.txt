Yeah you believe you’re the king of the jungle
You got the t-shirt, do you know how the song goes
You’re looking good but the fact is you’re lazy
But people love you ‘cause you’re funny and crazy

7-11, buy a six pack of beer,
If there’s a party you’re the last one to leave it
It’s not too late, we can stop all the dreamin’
Get out this town, look around, we don’t need it

Hell and heaven, they can wait for you,
So go and do all the things that you want to do

(We don’t belong anywhere)
So set me free, c’est la vie
I said, come on pretty baby, take a chance on me
It’s a shame on me 'cause I didn’t see
That you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel

I know you’re cool but you think that you’re chocolate
Get off my nerves, 'cause I still got a soft spot
You look at me, you think I got all the answers
Maybe I do, but I’m scared takin’ chances

Floating our bottle, but we ain't sailing nowhere
Rip out the cork, get the wind into our hair
Get off the train in the rain at the station
Knock back the drink, 'cause we think the boat’s sinkin’

Hell and heaven, they can wait for you
So go and do all the things that you want to do

(We don’t belong anywhere)
So set me free, c’est la vie
I said, come on pretty baby, take a dance with me
I said, a shame on me 'cause I didn’t see
That you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel

I said a stand by me, stick around with me
'Cause it’s a long walk back to where we’ve just been
I said, a hey there baby so you’re banking on me
I just I wish I never found her but hey
C’est la vie

I said they’re playing our song on the radio
And we’re singing out loud, all the words that we know
And it’s a long tongue Sally pissing off Peggy Sue
Oh it’s about me and you 'cause it’s time that we grew
And you said yeah yeah yeah come along with me
And then you think all the things that you want to see
I said a woah pretty baby come and take my hand
I’m gonna shake you all night, baby yes I can, woah!

Such as life in the rear view mirror
The open road up ahead is the future
Time came round and wrecked our place
But when I look back now I got a smile on my face

(We don’t belong anywhere)
Come on baby take a chance with me
Stick around on the town if you wanna see
We don’t belong anywhere is what she said to me
So come on, take a dance and spin around with me

She said shout now baby, set me free, c’est la vie
I said I’ll stand by me, stick around with me
And when the street lights fall, you can buy my beer
'Cause when the morning light comes, I’ll be gone
C’est la vie

Yeah yeah,
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere

Set me free!
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere

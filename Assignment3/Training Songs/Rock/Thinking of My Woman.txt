Thinking of my woman
I'm sitting in my hotel room
Hoping that she loves me
Wishing I could see her soon

When I left my woman
Was it only yesterday?
Seems like so much longer
Since I had to go away

Parting at all airports
Make me feel I want to cry
When I left my woman
It hurt to have to say goodbye

Somewhere across the country
I wonder what she's doing now
I'm lonely for my woman
I must get her back somehow

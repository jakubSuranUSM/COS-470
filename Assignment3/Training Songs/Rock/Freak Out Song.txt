Yeah one half a billion miles away
The luminary men escape
What planetary cooked and freed
To lemon shaped galaxy
Let's get out tonight yeah
You brought me from another life
Of work and pain to analyse
You take one two and three
To lemon shaped galaxy
I gather the sign
Ooh one half a billion miles away
The luminary men escape
What planetary cooked and freed
To lemon shaped galaxy
Let's get out tonight yeah
You brought me from another life
Of work and pain to analyse
You take one two and three
To lemon shaped galaxy
I gather the sign
But don't lose you mind
Let's get out tonight yeah

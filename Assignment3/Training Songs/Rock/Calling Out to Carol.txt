Calling out to carol
She could really twist the screws
What'cha doin' monday
And are you back on the booze? 
Now, I've been dooin' some thinkin'
About colorado springs
A dirty denim jacket
And a seven-dollar ring

Well, I've been keepin' busy
I've got lots of pots boiling on the stove
Who's that in the background
I'm sorry that I askedÂ¨cÂ¨ci guess I should have known

[Chorus]
Callin' out to carol on the telephone call
Message on a wire comin' through a wall
Talk about old times but not too long ago
Carol was the girl that everybody got to know

When'd you change your number? hey, carol!
It's different than you had
Have you got protection? 
I know some police are bad
But that's not why I called you up, now
You know I quit that scene
I told ya 'bout your pictures
I guess I'll buy that magazine

And I still remember
All those days we spent alone
You went one way while I went the other
Sometimes, I guess, that's the way things go

[Chorus: x2]
When they called me in the morning
And told me that she'd gone
I didn't want to hear it
So I just hung up the phone

Callin' outÂ¨cÂ¨ccallin' out to carol
Callin' outÂ¨cÂ¨ccallin' out to carol
Callin' outÂ¨cÂ¨ccallin' out to carol
Callin' out to carol
Callin' out to carol on a telephone call
Message on a wire comin' through a wall
Is this line in serviceÂ¨cÂ¨coperator says no
But carol was a girl that everybody got to know

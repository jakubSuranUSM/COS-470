Here it comes and then it goes 
And that feeling takes me home 
And I don't know where I'm goin' 
Let it flow 
All I wanted was a taste 
Just enough to waste the day 
Just enough to make me sick 
Let it flow 

And it takes up all my time 
And it lays me back a while 
Makes me feel like I'm a child 
Let it flow 
Let it flow 

Here it comes an then it goes 
And it hits me, takes me home 
I don't know where I'm goin' 
And I don't know where I've been 
But I'd do it all again 
All I wanted was a taste 
Enough to waste a day 
Just enough to make me sick 
I can't get too much of it

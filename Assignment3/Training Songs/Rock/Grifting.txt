Bogus hunches, justice
Touches, clutches, touches
Pushing, pulling punches
Rackets, bluffing, lunches
Pulling off a fast one
Riffing off the last one
Reeling in the big one
Fished in, fished in
Grifting, grifting, grifting

Faking it to make it
Never give, but take it
Building trust through kindness
To exploit the finest
Walls and bridges burning
Time and table turning
Double-dipping, earning
Lifted, lifted
Grifting, grifting, grifting

White of the eye, salt of the earth
It's easy money for what it's worth
You're the grandchild, gifted at birth

Wasted poker faces
Smoke in mirrored places
Sleight of hand, then weightless
Vanished, gone and traceless
Pilfering a nation
Dazzling the patron
Milking fascination
Pitching, pinching
Grifting, grifting, grifting

Keeping off the radar
Ripping off what they are
House of guilded swindlers
Brick by brick, unbuild them
Grift the true believer
Grift the great achiever
Grift the Great Deceiver
Grifting, grifting
Grifting, grifting, grifting

White of the eye, salt of the earth
It's easy money for what it's worth
You're the grandchild, gifted at birth

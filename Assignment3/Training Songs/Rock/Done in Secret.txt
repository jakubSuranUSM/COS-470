All these things were done in secret
But you can find out if you come around
It doesn't last long but we can repeat it
And keep out heads buried deep in the sand

You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside

What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for

Things just seem to go in circles
But things are finally coming round
All isn't lost cause I hear you say so
Suppose I'll just set back into town
You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for

All these things were done in secret
All these things were done in secret

You can put my back against the wall
But you won't take me outside
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for

All these things were done in secret
All these things were done in secret

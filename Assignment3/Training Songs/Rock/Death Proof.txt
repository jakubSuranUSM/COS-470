You can spend your life biting down on one thing
You can waste all your time on one idea
You can get your little brain into one big mess

And what you’re gonna do now baby, when your all cash spent?

Burn burn, burn my heart breaking
Take a piece and I don’t need all of it down
Have time to walk away
And I ain't wonderin’ ‘bout number of days, good

I don’t have time to die

Doctor, doctor, my temperature is rising
My heart is beating right out of my chest
Tell me, tell me doctor
That you can get rid of it
Let me keep what I need
Then we can burn the rest, good
Yes, I made a deal with death

Burn burn, burn my heart breaking
Take a piece and I don’t need all of it down
Have time to walk away
And I ain't wonderin’ ‘bout number of days, good

I ain’t got time to die

Burn burn, burn my heart breaking
Take a piece and I don’t need all of it down
Have time to walk away
And I ain't wonderin’ ‘bout number of days, good

I don’t have time to die
I don’t have time to die
I don’t have time to die

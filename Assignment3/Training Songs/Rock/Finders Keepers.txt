You've got a nerve giving me the cold shoulder
Giving me the twice over, that's not deserved
And we'll talk again when you're sober
You said that I've got cold and our heat has gone

I wanna be your eyes
So you can see what you've done
I wanna be your ears
So you can hear everything that's been missing

Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind?
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

I guess it's a mess if you make your bed
So why are we still laying in it?
And I could barely sleep, I could barely eat
And it's been three whole weeks
Since I heard you speak

So hard to take
That eighteen months was built to break
Oh, I love mistakes
Especially ones you've made
I bet you're sorry

Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind?
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
Take my advice and boy, run a mile

And have another drink
And then think this one over
You dig yourself a grave everyday you're sober
Do you see what I mean?
Have your best interest written all over me
I could never be what you need

Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind?
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
Take my advice and boy, run a mile

And I bet you guess me right
(You guess me yes, you guessed me right)
I bet you guess me right

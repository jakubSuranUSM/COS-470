After all the times you've been turned around
Will you never be ready now?
After all the times that we stood your ground
Will you never be steady now?

Everybody makes mistakes
Some do most of all
I just don't have what it takes
They're singing as they fall

Everybody makes mistakes
Some more than the rest
Yeah, that's what some do best
But you won't be distressed

And of course we'll send the check
You can just write in the amount
Just let us know the house and town
So if you're going to wreck
You can still be safe and sound
And just let us know and we'll come down

Everybody makes mistakes
The phone lines are shot through
Causing everybody pain
Sitting in for us and you

Everybody makes mistakes
Some more than the rest
Yeah, that's what some do best
But you won't be distressed

You say, "I'll break all the way down
And then all these pieces will be easy to sort out"
Well, we can't wait
We can't wait

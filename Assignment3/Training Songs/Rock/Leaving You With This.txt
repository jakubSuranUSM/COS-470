Deep inside I don't feel alright
It burns like fire
It's twined around by barbed wire
It pricks, it bites
You'll need a life to cut it out of my mind
I'm too shy, I'm too dumb
Unable to talk
About the things that are hurting me

It's so sad, I can't turn my inside out
Well, it's so sad, there are so many things to share
God, it's so sad, maybe I can't show my love
Well, it's so sad, now I'm leaving you with this

Deep inside I hide a secret
It burns like fire
It's twined around by barbed wire
It pricks, it bites
You'll need a life to cut it out of my mind
I'm too shy, I'm too dumb
Unable to talk
About the things that are hurting me

It's so sad, I can't turn my inside out
Well, it's so sad, there are so many things to share
God, it's so sad, maybe I can't show my love
Well, it's so sad, now I'm leaving you...

God, it's so sad, maybe I can't show my love
Well, it's so sad, now I'm leaving you with this

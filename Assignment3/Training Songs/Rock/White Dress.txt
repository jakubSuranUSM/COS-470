Feel how the wind blows, December despair
Bring me a ribbon to tie up my hair
I'll be your bride, go where you go
All of my life, you'll be my beau

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

The night's in your face, sky's in your eyes
The day's in my arms when you're by my side
Whenever you're weary, I'll sing you a song
Whenever you're lonely, I'll show you, you're wrong

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

Come from the window, let's climb the stairs
All of my sorrows are none of your cares
While life is in us, let's love all we can
I'll be your woman if you'll be my man

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

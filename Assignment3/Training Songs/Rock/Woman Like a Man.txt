I need a piss
Wanna hate
F*ck it up
Come

My love
Eat your meat
Keep your teeth
Run

You lost me
You cost me
You thought me of me, yeah

We're bad
What we do
Stupid fools

You wanna get boned
You wanna get stoned
You wanna get a room like no-one else

You wanna be rich
You wanna be kitsch
You wanna be the bastard of yourself

You wanna get burned
You wanna get turned
You wanna get fucked inside out

You wanna be ruled
You wanna be fooled
You wanna be a woman like a man
Like a, like a, like a

Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, treat you like a man
Woman like a man, woman like a man
Like a woman like a man, woman like a man

Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, woman like a man
Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, like a man

I need a hit
Want to wait
Suck it up
Cum

My love
Eat your meat
Itchy feet
Run

You reach me
You bleach me
You teach me of me, how familiar

We're bad
What we do
Stupid fools

You wanna get boned
You wanna get stoned
You wanna get a room like no-one else

You wanna be rich
You wanna be kitsch
You wanna be the bastard of yourself

You wanna get burned
You wanna get turned
You wanna get fucked inside out

You wanna be ruled
You wanna be fooled
You wanna be a woman like a man
Like a woman, like a

Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, woman like a man
Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, treat you like a man

Like a man, like a woman like a man
Like a woman like a man, treat you like a man
Woman like a man, woman like a man
Like a woman like a man, like a man

You wanna get boned
You wanna get stoned
You wanna get a room like no-one else

You wanna be rich
You wanna be kitsch
You wanna be the bastard of yourself

You wanna get burned
You wanna get turned
You wanna get fucked inside out

You wanna be ruled
You wanna be fooled
You wanna be a woman like a man
Like a woman, like a, like a man

Treat you like a man
Like a man, man, man, man, man
Like a man, man, man, man
Treat you like a man, man, man, man, man, man
Like a man

Woman like a man, like a man
Treat you like a man, woman like a man
Woman like a man, like a man
Like a woman like a man, treat you like a man

Woman like a man, treat you like a man
Treat you like a man, woman like a man
Woman like a man, like a man, like a man, oh

A long, long time ago I had a dream
Somehow things work out much different than they seem
All the things that I tried to find
Given me no piece of mind
So now I leave it all as memories behind

My time come at last
My day is coming fast
My love is gonna last
When it comes I feel a whole lot better

Your love within your mind if nothing is said
Your love within heart if you don
There
That you can never hide
And though you shine you
It can

Your time will come at last
Your day is coming fast
Your love is gonna last
When it comes you

Just let yourself run free
Be what you wanna be
And when we finally meet
I know you

Our time will come at last
Our day is coming fast
Our love is gonna last
When it comes we

When it comes
Now, when it comes
When it comes
Now, now
When it comes
Now, when it comes
Now, when it comes
Now, when it comes
Now, when it comes

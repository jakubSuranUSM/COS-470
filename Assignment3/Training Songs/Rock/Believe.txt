You say that I am just a dreamer
So kill me if I believe
Maybe I don't need a savior
'Cause only I can save myself

Because if you don't believe
It will not come around
If you walk with your head down
You won't be able to see the sun

You say that I am acting crazy
So kill me for having fun
Maybe I like it hazy
Maybe I just don't mind

Because if you don't believe
It will not come around
If you walk with your head down
You won't be able to see the sun

If you don't believe
It won't come around

Because if you don't believe
It will not come around
If you walk with your head down
You won't be able to see the sun

If you don't believe
It won't come around

Everyone, anyone who want to hear
Move in a little closer, let me tell you about
A love natural, oh that love actual
Love that you just can't help feeling
When feelings with meanings keep on appearing

And it's almost midnight, the time is coming up
The time is getting closer, the time is almost here
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now

When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special

Let me tell you something, oh
Something you may not believe, yeah
Let me talk about this feeling
Inside that's happening to me, oh

Oh yeah it's almost our time, the feeling's coming up
The moment to get closer, the moment's almost here
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now

When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special

All the way, yeah we're moving, oh
Gonna find our love today
The love go on and on
And we're climbin' all the way to the top of the highest mountain
Flyin' through the skies we've never seen before
And we're divin' to the depths of the deepest ocean
Sailin' all the seas we've never seen before

Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special

Vanessa Simmons, funny kind of name
Young and yet wise, only a child
Wake up in the morning, frown across your face
I know your name, but not your place

Wish I could show you how to live your life
But I'm not sure which one of us is right
God only knows the tears I've cried 
Vanessa Simmons, funny kind of name

Have you got life wrong, is it just a game?
Wake up in the morning, find a friend at night
Friends are hard to find, especially at night
Wish I could show you how to live your life

But I'm not sure which one of us is right
God only knows, and He's the one that shows, the tears I've cried 

And if I asked you for the sun, would you not say
"Light's not the only way to be"?
And if I asked you for your love, would you not say
"Love is not what you want from me"?
And would I not be right
To sit alone and wonder every night?

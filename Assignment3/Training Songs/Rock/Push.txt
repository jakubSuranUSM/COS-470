Cause I just
Cause I just
Could you be holding out for something more?
Maybe I'm not what you're looking for
But I'll be waiting if you change your mind
Everybody tells me it's just a waste of time
And if I give up hope
Well then I might as well lay down and die
And that's why I'm askin'

Why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you
So I'm askin why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you

Seems like I've known you forever
But still you don't know I'm alive (know that I'm alive)
Why can't we just be together?
Cause it seems the world is made for you and I
And if I give up hope
Well then I might as well lay down and die
And that's why I'm askin'

Why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you
So I'm askin why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you

I just called 'cause I was thinkin' about you
I just called 'cause I was thinkin' about you
You got to let me know if I'm gettin' through
And you know that I'm only just a step away from crazy
This is what you do to me

Why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you
So I'm askin why you always push me away?
Cause I try to do my best I can for you

(Cuz you're the reason why)
Why you always push me away?
(You are the one that makes my world go round)
Cause I try to do my best I can for you
(And baby I just can't take it)
So I'm askin' why you always push me away?
(No, no, no)
Cause I try to do my best I can for you

Why you always push me away?
(Why you always push me?)
Cause I try to do my best I can for you
(Cuz I try to do my best I can)
So I'm askin' why you always push me away?
(You push me away)
Cause I try to do my best I can for you

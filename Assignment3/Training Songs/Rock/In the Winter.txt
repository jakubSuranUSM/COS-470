I feel cold and lonely it just doesn't mean a thing
Speak to me slowly it just doesn't mean a thing
Cause no-one ever goes out in the winter
Spirit never grows out in the winter
Everyone knows the sun never shows until the end of winter
Frozen water fountains it just doesn't mean a thing
Snow-covered mountains it just doesn't mean a thing
In December I remember you never get too old
To want to see the stars come down

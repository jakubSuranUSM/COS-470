Underneath the sun there is a light
I'm feeling light, but I can't move
My heart's still in a crescent veil
A watchful haze in the rushing night

A silver studded torn and tattered gown
She ruled the room and I just stared
A warning roaring miles above
Hanging over a worn-out night

And though the words we spoke were few
We were feeling something strange
I swear I thought you knew
You said "Darling, how could you?"

Remember back when we first met
It don't mean much
All those things you said, you never meant
How could I forgive and just forget?
And all that time we spent I swear we wasted
It don't mean much

And all at once it's not important
What fell in place just falls apart
Again, I guess
Not having, I can only hope
It's only time and you know I'll wait

'Cause then it's like when we first met
It don't mean much
All those things I said, I never meant
But how could you forgive and just forget?
And all that time we spent we said we wasted
It don't mean much

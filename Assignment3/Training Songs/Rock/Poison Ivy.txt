Mmm, she comes on like a rose
But everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch

Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a-creepin all around
She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man, she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison Ivy comes a-creepin all around
Measles make you mumpy, and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll fool ya, and whoopin' cough'll cool ya
A-Poison Ivy's love'll make you itch 

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison Ivy comes a-creepin all around
Itchy!
Ooh, scratch my back for me
Ha-ha
That Poison Ivy sure'll make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison Ivy, Poison Ivy
Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison Ivy comes a-creepin all around
Ooh, ooh, that's itching so bad
Scratch my back for me, please
Ah, that's better
Pass the calamine

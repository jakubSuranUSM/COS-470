What kind of love is this that makes me want to jump and shout?
I want to know what kind of love is this that turns my heart inside out?
It's that itchy-twitchy feelin' that I have inside
Something overwhelming that I just can't hide
I want to know (oh, yeah) whoa, yeah (oh, yeah) whoa, tell me (oh, yeah)
(What kind of love is this?)
What kind of love is this?
What kind of love is this that haunts me every day?
I want to know what kind of love is this that makes me say the things I say?
Well, I'm walkin' around and grinnin' with my head in the air
The people think I'm crazy but I just don't care
I want to know (oh, yeah) whoa, yeah (oh, yeah) whoa, tell me (oh, yeah)
(What kind of love is this?)
What kind of love is this?
Well, I feel like a man in outer space
I'm actin' like a psycho case
Hey, girl, stop this feelin'
Look at me, you've got me rockin' and a-reelin'!
Yeah, what kind of love is this, aw, that shakes me up so bad?
I want to know what kind of love is this?, yeah, my situation is sad
Well, I just can't understand it, it just ain't real
I know no one has ever felt the way I feel
I want to know (oh, yeah) whoa, yeah (oh, yeah) whoa, tell me (oh, yeah)

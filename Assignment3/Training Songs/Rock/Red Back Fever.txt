(Brewster-Eccles-Spencer-Morley-Neeson)
Why'got a whiplash body
Why'got a space age mind
Why'are a wildcat honey
On a straight ace ride
You can count me in
On anything
Why'made a deal with the devil
With why'are rag doll eyes
Why'got a switchblade ready
For the sacrifice
Just touch me once (break that fever)
Touch me once (red back fever)
Listen to why'are heartbeat
Touch me now
Why'got a silent number
For a special price
Why'hear the backdoor rumble
Get why'are loaded dice
You can count me in
On anything
Just touch me once (red back fever)
Listen to your heartbeat

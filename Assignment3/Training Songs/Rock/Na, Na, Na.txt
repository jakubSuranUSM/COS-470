Your script it was perfect, perfect seduction line, 
Lines like I will back
You up - up to when I needed you I really believed in you
It hurt when you had no time, 
No time to spare for me and me
I've been there before.
Done it, got the t-shirt, read the book and seen the movie

Na na na na na na, don't need this no more
Na na na na na na, I could change the score 
Na na na na na na, don't need this no more 
Na na na na na na, I could change my thoughts

And the past has no power, no power over me, 
'Cause I'm changing
'Cause I'm willing to - willing to learn 
And I am willing to be free

Na na na na na na, don't need this no more
Na na na na na na, I could change the score 
Na na na na na na, don't need this no more 
Na na na na na na, I could change my thoughts

Like I'm thrilled to find I am going through 
This great adventure
'Cause this time I know I will never have to go through
The same experience again

Words come cheap and easy, it ain't what you say 
It's what you do that
Matters, and it matters that I have been deceived, 
Deceived and I have
The strength to forgive you when I leave

Na na na na na na, don't need this no more
Na na na na na na, I could change the score 
Na na na na na na, don't need this no more 
Na na na na na na, I could change my thoughts

Like I'm thrilled to find I am going through this great adventure
'Cause this time I know I will never have to go through
The same experience... again

I'm ugly, I'm lazy
I'm always there to take the blame
I'm a drag but you'll never find out
Just push me around and I?ll walk away, walk away

I'm a genius, I can't get straight
There's supernatural in my hair
Space invaders all around me
Freak me out when I get down there

I'm getting lost before I get found out
I'm getting old before my time and it?s too late

So shut up, I?ll give up when I want to
Just shut up, I'm not listening to you
Say anything ?cause it don't mean nothing
I've had enough of you today
I've had enough of you today

Now don't try me, I'm so turned on
I'm in the game to break some eggs
I'm not a loser, I'm a time bomb
A superstar that always gets his way

I'm getting lost before I get found out
I'm getting old before my time and it?s too late

So shut up, I?ll give up when I want to
Just shut up, I'm not listening to you
Say anything ?cause it don't mean nothing
I've had enough of you today
I've had enough of you today

So long, so long
So long, [Incomprehensible]

I'm getting lost before I get found out
I'm getting old before my time and it?s too late

So shut up, I?ll give up when I want to
Just shut up, I'm not listening to you
Say anything ?cause it don't mean nothing
I've had enough of you today

So shut up, I?ll give up when I want to
Just shut up, I'm not listening to you
Say anything ?cause it don't mean nothing
I've had enough of you today
I've had enough of you today
I've had enough of you today

They found sixth-form poetry scrawled on the walls 
in your old bedroom 
And Friday night is going to free-fall, 
it's Club Rust, angel dust and sweet perfume 
And you remind me of some art-house black and white I saw 
they coloured it with chalk 
And are you wise? Wise beyond your years or, 
or are you all talk? 

Now, don't you think something's gonna happen soon? 
It's been so long now since they changed that tune. 
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind 

Well there is something so beautifully chic 
about burning out so young 
When you accessorise with bruises on your cheek 
and cool tricks of the tongue 
You're spending Saturday alone drowning heartache out 
with cheap red wine 
I know you want to make the news but lately all you do 
is memorise the headlines 

Now, don't you think something's gonna happen soon? 
It's been so long now since they changed that tune. 
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind 

Sometimes we count the days 
And sometimes you'll just slip away 
There are watches to unwind 
And ladders still to climb 

Now, don't you think something's gonna happen soon? 
It's been so long now since they changed that tune. 
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind 
Don't you think something's gonna happen soon? 
It's been so long now since they changed that tune. 
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind 
Keep that in mind 
Keep that in mind 
Juliet 
Juliet

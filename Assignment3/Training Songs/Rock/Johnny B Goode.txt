Deep down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny be Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go go Johnny go go Johnny be Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
He sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passin' by they would stop and say
Oh my how that little country boy can play
Go go go Johnny go go...
[ guitar - piano ]
His mother told him someday you gonna be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comen from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go Johnny go go...

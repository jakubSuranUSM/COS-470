She's got a phony ID but it's plain to see
She's not quite seventeen goin' on twenty-three
The boys in her school all leave her alone
A night with Loretta means you won't make it home

Loretta
Makes me feel ten feet tall
Little Loretta
Makes me feel good

She says she's got a secret, says she'll never grow old
As long as she keeps dancin' to that good old rock and roll
Talk about the future and she just don't want to hear
She'll love you for a minute or leave ya for a year

Loretta
Makes me feel ten feet tall
Little Loretta
Makes me feel good

Well, she's got a phony ID but it's plain to see
She's not quite seventeen goin' on twenty-three
The boys in her school all leave her alone
A night with Loretta means you won't make it home

Loretta
Makes me feel ten feet tall
Little Loretta
Makes me feel good

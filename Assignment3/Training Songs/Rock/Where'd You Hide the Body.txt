You look across the table with those guilty eyes
So many mornings now I shouldn't be surprised
When you lash out at me and you scream out in the night
What could you have done to get in such an awful fright
Is it all that bad that you think I shouldn't see
Well who you gonna talk to if you can't tell me

(chorus)
Where'd you hide the body
Where'd you stash the loot
Just keep your hands where I can see them
So I don't have to shoot
There's a smoking pistol at your side
But you swear it's not the one
Where'd you hide the body
Where'd you get the gun
Where'd you hide the body
Where'd you get the gun

When cornered you complain about the state of your career
And you look intently straight ahead pretending I'm not here
And you look me in the eye and tell me it's not about us
Then you tell me I'm so silly to be making such a fuss
So everything's OK but your nervous as a cat
What's that say about me that you think I'd fall for that

(chorus) 

Where'd you hide the body
Where'd you ditch the gun
Keep your hands where I can see 'em
Make no attempt to run

You used to always throw me off the trail
I guess those days are through
Where'd you hide the body
What's consuming you
Where'd you hide the body
What's consuming you

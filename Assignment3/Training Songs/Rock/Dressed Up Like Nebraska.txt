Trying to tell me something here
In this place
All of your demons rest
In my space 
I dreamed last night
You and I were there
Old and gray
Holding tight
You were always so cold

But I can't touch you where you are
There you stood dressed up like Nebraska
Plain as day

It's being in the dark that makes me so
Paranoid
It's the feeling of a sort that just won't
Stay inclined enough

I could see your eyes tonight
Somehow try to set it right
I could change your mind to see things

I can't touch you where you are
There you stood dressed up like Nebraska
Plain as day

I can't touch you where you are
There you stood dressed up like Nebraska

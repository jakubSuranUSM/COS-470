It's a great big world
There's a million other guys
I feel so lucky when I look
In those green eyes

Is it the sun
That makes them so green
Those are the prettiest eyes
I have ever seen

Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes

What makes them sparkle
What makes them shine
What makes those eyes of yours
Look into mine

Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes

Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes

It's a great big world
There's a million other guys
I feel so lucky when I look
In those green eyes

Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes

Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes
Blue green eyes

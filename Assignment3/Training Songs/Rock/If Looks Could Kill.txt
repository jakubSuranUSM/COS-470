Maybe I can make it better
Tell me where it all went wrong
Cause you know that you really upset her
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill then you'd be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go

Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate?
A breakdown at my very sight
I promise hidden words of tenderness in every single line that I write
Still you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill then you'd be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go

Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I can make it better

Cause you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill then you'd be the first to make me mad
Cause you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill then you'd be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go

If it's true, if looks could kill
If it's true, if looks could kill
Is it true, looks could kill?
Yeah, it's true, looks could kill

They looked into each other's eyes and saw an answer 
Some call it fate, some call it destiny 
But they believed that it was more than just a chance they had to 
take, they only knew that it was meant to be 
He looked into the night to try to find a place to hide 
She made excuses to the ones who said they cared 
They fell into each other's arms, they knew the passion 
This is the night they knew, one only lovers dared 
They go two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Two lovers tryin' to make it as one 
Two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Tonight, they're gonna do what must be done 
What must be done 
The night is filled with every kind of new emotion 
With every moment comes a chance they might delay 
Congratulations to the ones who said they loved her 
No consolation to the ones who stayed away 
Why must young lovers always hide what should be natural? 
Why must they always do what others tell them to? 
They'll find a place to hide, a place to take their passion 
They'll find a way to do what only lovers do 
They got two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Two lovers tryin' to make it as one 
Two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Tonight they're gonna do what must be done 
(repeat) 
I love you 
Yes, I do 
Love me, too 
They got two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Two lovers tryin' to make it as one 
Two hearts beatin' louder than thunder 
Two lovers trying to makes as one 
Tonight they're gonna do what must be done 
They got two hearts, two hearts 
Two hearts, two hearts 
They got two hearts, baby 
They're beatin louder, louder, louder 
They're beatin' louder, louder, louder

Lady, Lady says I'm almost there,
I don't care,
I'm not sure what I've done wrong,

Lady, Lady says I'm not quite home,
I don't know,
I'm not sure what I've done,
I'm not sure what I've done,
I'm not sure what I've done wrong,

Lady, Lady says I'm underground,
I'm so proud,
I'm not sure what I've done wrong,

Lady, Lady says I'm not that strong,
God she's wrong,
I'm not sure what I've done,
I'm not sure what I've done,
I'm not sure what I've done wrong,

Help me out of here,
Help me out of here,
Today, Today,
Need to be in here,
Need to be in here,
Today, Today,

Lady Lady says I'm underground,
I'm so proud,
I'm not sure what I've done wrong

Lady Lady says I'm not that strong,
God she's wrong,
I'm not sure what I've done
I'm not sure what I've done
I'm not sure what I've done wrong

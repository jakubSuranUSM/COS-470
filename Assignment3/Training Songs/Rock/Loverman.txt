You wanna dance but you don't know how to
She's gonna teach you one-and-a-one-two

She's gonna teach you all she can
You're gonna be her lover man
You're gonna be her lover man

She's got a boyfriend, she didn't tell you
He found out, couldn't help to smell you

He's gonna hit you all he can
You're gonna be a bleeding man
You're gonna be a bleeding man

Oh no!

You wanna dance but you don't know how to
She's gonna teach you one-and-a-one-two
He's gonna hit you one-and-a-one-two-three
But you're gonna get her one-and-a-one-two, three, four, five, six

She's gonna give you all she can
You're gonna be her lover man
You're gonna be her lover man

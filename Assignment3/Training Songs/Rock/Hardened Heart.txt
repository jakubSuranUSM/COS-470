It's such a beautiful world
So why do I feel so down?
I should be heading for somewhere
Instead of spinning around, round, round
I'm flying out of control
Headlong into the ground
And all the people that love me
They never know if I'm up, down or round

Everything I've got
Iâ€™m gonna lose the lot
How I wish that I was not

Hurting everyone I know
Bringing everybody down so low
Stuck along a road of sadness with nowhere to go

But it's a beautiful world
And so I'm joining the crowd
It's way too hard on my own
I really need a way out, out, out

Taking what I've got
Happy with my lot
Now I know that I am not

Hurting everyone I know
Bringing everybody down so low
Stuck along a road of sadness with nowhere to go
Here's hoping that the signs are real
And tomorrow with a spring in my heel
Somewhere on the road of sadness lies a better deal

Oh, I know that my hardened heart is beating still
I drove it to the point of madness just to feel
Something real
Something real

Hurting everyone I know
Bringing everybody down so low
Stuck along a road of sadness with nowhere to go
Here's hoping that the signs are real
And tomorrow with a spring in my heel
Somewhere on the road of sadness lies a better deal

Oh, I know that my hardened heart is beating still
I drove it to the point of madness just to feel
Oh, I know that my hardened heart is beating still
I drove it to the point of madness just to feel something

La la la la

Now when school is over
And the weekend's come
My mind's made up
To have some fun

I call my baby
And I tell her the news
Hurry up and put on
Your rocking shoes

I'm gonna rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
I call her again
And I tell her the news

We'll rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
Oh, we're gonna dance
Away the blues

Oh, well, I open my wallet
And I count my loot
I comb my hair and
I brush my suit

I'm not worried
Gonna lose my blues
Swing my baby in
My rocking shoes

I'm gonna rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
I call her again
And I tell her the news

We'll rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
Oh, we're gonna dance
Away the blues

La la la la

Well, as soon as I get
To the sugar shop
I'm gonna grab my baby
And start a hop

Dancing and a jumping
And a carrying on
When the music stops
I'll still be gone

When the hop is over
To the house, I go
I love my baby
And I tell her so

We kiss goodnight
And my head, I lose
And I bound away
In my rocking shoes

I'm gonna rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
I call her again
And I tell her the news
We'll rock
(Rock in rocking shoes)
Oh, we're gonna dance away
Oh, we're gonna dance away
Oh, we're gonna dance away
The blues

I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see,
And I won't be much when you get through with me.
Well, I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale,
And it looks like I have got a tiger by the tail.

Well, I thought the day that I met you, you were meek as a lamb,
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans.
And now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails,
And it looks like I have got a tiger by the tail.

I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see,
And I won't be much when you get through with me.
Well, I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale,
And it looks like I have got a tiger by the tail.

Well, every night you drag me where the bright lights are found,
There ain't no way for me to slow you down.
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale,
And it looks like I have got a tiger by the tail.

I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see,
And I won't be much when you get through with me.
Well, I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale,
And it looks like I have got a tiger,
It looks like I have got a tiger,
It looks like I have got a tiger by the tail.

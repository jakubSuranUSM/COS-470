I'd like to understand just why
I feel like I have been through hell
But you tell me I haven't even started yet
To live here you've got to give more than you get
That I know
But they said it's all right

I'd like to understand today
Then maybe I would know who I was
When I was when it was yesterday
The seasons and the reasons are on display
And I know
Oh
Oh
Oh
So many people
They just seem to clutter up my mind
And if it's mine throw it away
Throw it again once for my girl friend

So many voices
Don't let them stop between my ears
But it appears that there they are
Though they are wrong ten thousand strong, oh, yeah

I'm lockin' my heart in the closet
I don't need anyone, oh no no no
You find me behind the door
And all of the far-out faces
From long ago, I can't erase this

Go away I'm afraid with you there could be no escape I have no faith,
I've seen truth and reason down the drain
But I cling to you for survival and I know that you are my bible
Get out I'm scared, for the moment but I know you'll be there

Well I'm scared for the moment but I know you'll be there
By the way things you say freak me out,
I go out of my head I feel no shame when I turn my back
And I walk away but I cling to you for survival and I know that you are my bible

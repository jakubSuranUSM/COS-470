Let’s play it loud 
So everyone can hear us
Let’s play it loud
There’s so much interference
Keep it turned up all of the way
We won’t have to listen
There’s so much in this room to explain
That the verses are missing

Oh I’m just 14 every body tries to jump up
On my band wagon
You can’t explain me
And I can’t contain me
So I’m gonna be your star

Here we go ‘round like a song
Who with a dime turned us on
Here we go ‘round like a song
Who with a dime turned us on
To see who could hold on

Here we go ‘round like a song

Let’s play it loud 
So everyone can hear what we do
Let’s play it loud
I could never talk my way through
Keep it turned up all of the way
We’ll all sit and listen
There’s so much in this room I can’t bear
When the music is missing

Oh I’m just 14 every body tries to jump up
On my band wagon
You can’t explain me
And I can’t contain me
So I’m gonna be your star

Here we go ‘round like a song
Who with a dime turned us on

Here we go ‘round like a song
Who with a dime turned us on
To see who could hold on

Here we go ‘round like a song

Here we go ‘round like a song
Who with a dime turned us on
Here we go ‘round like a song
Here we go ‘round like a song

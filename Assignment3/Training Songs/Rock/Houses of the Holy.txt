Let me take you to the movies
Can I take you to the show 
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow 

From the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go 
From the door comes satan's daughter, and it only goes to show, you know 

There's an angel on my shoulder, in my hand a sword of gold 
Let me wander in your garden and the seeds of love I'll sow you know 

So the world is spinning faster are you dizzy when you're stoned 
Let the music be your master will you heed the master's call 
Oh Satan and man 

Said there ain't no use in crying 'cause it will only, only drive you mad 
Does it hurt to hear them lying? 
Was this the only world you had? oh oh

So let me take you, take you to the movie 
Can I take you, baby, to the show 
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly 
Can I make your garden grow, you know

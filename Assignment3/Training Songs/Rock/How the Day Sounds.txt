Oh who would have ever known this?
Could be this easy
I was a long, long way off
Then just like that it was over
Everything I knew of love
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song

Thank you for opening the window
The sky is clear as my mind is now
I was a long, long way off
Join me in welcoming the sun in
It's much brighter than the night I hid in
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song
And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song

From a long way down.

Yeah, it's well worth the time that its taken to get here now
Yeah, it's well worth the time that its taken to get here now

Ba da dum

So go ahead and bang a gong
Nothing can drown out the sound and the whisper of my love

And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song
And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song
Through this new song
Through this new song

And the lines have all been drawn
I know where I belong, where I belong, 
Where I belong
And the lines have all been drawn
I know where I belong
Where I belong

And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song
And I think I like how the day sounds
Like how the day sounds through this new song

Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love won't you sing along
Oh, won't you sing along
Oh, my love won't you sing along

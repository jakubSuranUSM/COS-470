Well it's a minor altercation, despite your hesitation
By all degrees that you will see we are causing quite a sensation
So publication of needing motivation 
Your mother says its OK outside the subway station 

You're taking off your stripes
Even your knees are nice
I'll tease you with a knife until you're screaming for your life
I think so too
And you surrender, can I spend you up?
You're my illegally illegal tender

It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that will love me like no other
It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that knows I love her like no other

Well it's a minor altercation, despite your hesitation
And apart the contrary and appending accusation
Cinematography, that you're willing but happy to see 
A scene that stars you and a girl, you're both on top of me 

I looked into your eyes
And pushed your buttons and levers
You said you'd see until we agree and kindly said whatever
And you like my loving better
Cause' you said so in a letter, that said return to sender
My illegally illegal tender

It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that will love me like no other
It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that knows I love her like no other
It takes a lover

Two in the pocket is better than three
Two in the pocket is better than three
It's better than three
Two in the pocket is better than three
And three in the pocket is better than four
and five in the pocket is better than six
And put them together then pick up the sticks 

It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that will love me like no other
It takes a lover, it takes a lover
It takes a lover that knows I love her like no other

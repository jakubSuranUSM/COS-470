The whole kit and caboodle is in disrepair
There's no where to go that's not here
Little captains and cuckoos from here to Timbuktu
Are counting their dough in the mirror

[Chorus]
Singing rooty toot toot for the moon
It's the biggest star I've ever seen
It's a pearl of wisdom, a slice of green cheese
Burning just like kerosene, burning just like kerosene

He was just some young white kid trying to sing tough and black
With gravel and spit in his voice
He laughed at the things we do, the radio laughed too
I held up my arms to rejoice

[Chorus]

So God bless motorcycles and far out heavy trifles
You know you can't memorize them
Hang your hat on your nose, don't hide in your clothes
Smile at someone, begin to begin

[Chorus]

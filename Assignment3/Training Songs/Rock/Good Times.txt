You told me goodbye and I believed you.
Felt like I would die - I didn't need to
'Cause you came back to me
And everything's like it used to be.
All the good times we had we'll have again.

If your love is mine it will stand up
To the test of time. It will stand up.
It looked like we were through,
But in our heart of hearts we knew
The good times we had we'll have again.

And again.
Now I know you'll always be my friend
Til the end.
That means more to me than anything,
It's everything.

Who needs yesterday - that's far behind us
And memories only may serve to remind us
That what felt good before
Today we'll treasure so much more.
All the good times we had we'll have again.

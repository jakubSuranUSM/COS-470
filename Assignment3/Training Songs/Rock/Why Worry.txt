Baby, I see this world has made you sad,
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say.
But, baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears.
I'll chase away those restless fears
That turn your blue skies into gray.
Why Worry?
There should be laughter after pain,
There should be sunshine after rain,
These things have always been the same,
So Why Worry, now?
Why Worry, now?
Baby, when I get down I turn to you,
And you make sense of what I do
And, no, it isn't hard to say.
But, baby, just when this world
Seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way.
Why Worry?
There should be laughter after pain,
There should be sunshine after rain,
These things have always been the same,
So Why Worry, now?
Why Worry, now?
Why Worry?
There should be laughter after pain,
There should be sunshine after rain,
These things have always been the same,
So Why Worry, now?
There should be laughter after pain,
There should be sunshine after rain,
These things have always been the same,
So Why Worry, now?
Why Worry, now?
(Why Worry? Why Worry, now?)

Her head is in a bitter way
Her brain's on fire
She's just looking for the perfect wave
It's her brain's desire
I'll think of her when i walk the strand
On this true hormos a night

Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
She's just rotting in stupid bliss
With music on her bars uh
Her face burning in the l.a. sun
She got no got no fear of cars
I better kick my strand cruiser
To the friendlier oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is, yeah Ed is
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
Ed is dead
E-I-D
E-I-D
E-I-D

No, no, no, no, no

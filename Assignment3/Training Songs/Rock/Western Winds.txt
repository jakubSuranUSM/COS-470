Lothe verd, you know it’s been a long, hard summer
It’s probably gonna be a longer winter, too
I know a lot of people been sayin’ that I just must be crazy
To get up here and play the way I do
(I tell ‘em this)

Rollin’ on
Rollin’ on
Rollin’ on
Rollin’ on
Rollin’ on down the rivers
Rollin’ on across the broad highways
Rollin’ on
Rollin’ on, lord let yourselves get happy if you can
(If you can)
Rollin’ on, and let the western winds blow you all away

Sometimes I feel like I just can’t make it
Sometimes I feel like I can’t go on
But you know, sometimes I feel like I got myself an answer
Every time
Every time I play this western winds song
(Like this)

Lord, I gotta go
Lord, I gotta go
Lord, I gotta be movin’ on
And I gotta sing my songs

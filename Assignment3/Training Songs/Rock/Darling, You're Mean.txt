Right now behind my eyes 
It's early morning 
I'm trying to get you but you don't understand 
I'm so cheap  
Right now behind your eyes 
A dragon's tongue lashing out 
I'm trying to get you but you don't realize 
I'm a nightmare  
	
Oh, I know, it's coming back 
And I say oh, oh lord, yeah it's driving me mad 
	
Right then behind my lies
Some scratch lashing out 
I'm trying to hold you but you don't want to know I'm so cheap 	
You're trying to hurt me 
But I won't let you go 
I'm so cheap  
	
Oh, I know, it's coming back 	
And I say oh, lord, yeah it's driving me mad

Oh no, please, don't leave, don't go 	

Oh, I know, it's coming back 	
Darling, darling...you're mean 
Mean to me  

Oh, I know, it's coming back 	
Oh no 
Hold back 	
Oh, oh lord, yeah it's coming back 	
And I say ooo, Jesus Christ, yeah it's driving me mad  
I said it's driving me mad 	
It's driving me mad 
Yeah it's driving me mad 
Yeah it's driving me mad  
But no more no more no more no more 
No more no more no more 
I said, higher higher higher higher 	
I'm coming up to meet you 	
Higher higher higher higher 	
I'm coming up to meet you, yeah 
I'm coming up to meet you, yeah

Lover mine
Get your coat and come outside
I want to take you for a ride
On into town

Lover fair
We'll be looking sharp, I swear
I want them all to stop and stare
When we take 'em down

Go to town, burn it down, turn around
And get your stroll on, baby
I'll get the car
You get the match

And gasoline
And as we ride
Away into the countryside
I feel as though I must confide

There is a cost
When you say 
Now we got Hell to pay
Don't worry, baby, that's okay

I know the boss

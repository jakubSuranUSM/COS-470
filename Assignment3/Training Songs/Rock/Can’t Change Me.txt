She can do anything at all
Have anything she pleases
The power to change what she thinks is wrong
What could she want with me yeah

Wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to read me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world 
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

She has the daylight at her command
She gives the night its dreams   yeah
She can uncover your darkest fears
Make you forget you feel them

Wait just one minute more
I can see that she's trying to free me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world 
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

Suddenly I can see everything that's wrong
With me yeah
What can I do I'm the only thing I really have
At all

Wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to need me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world 
But she can't change me
No she can't change me

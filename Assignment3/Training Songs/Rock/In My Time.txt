In my day I was young and crazy
Sure I didn't know shit but now I'm lazy
One day I won't even know what was better
Then again, I won't know much of nothing anyway
Two worlds, one on each shoulder
I'm trying to tell ya
Pullin' over on the shoulder
I'm driving
I know when I get older
I'm dying
But I got everything I need anyway, that's fine now
That's fine now
That's fine

In my time I was whack and wild
I was just being myself, damn
But then I sat there trying on faces
One that erase my discreet disgraces
Pullin'  over on the shoulder
Ain't trying
But it's two worlds, one on each shoulder
I'm trying to turn
I know when we get older
I'm dying
But I got everything I need anyway, that's fine now
That's fine now
That's fine

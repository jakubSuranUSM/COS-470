Don't try to beat 'em up
Just call them all aboard
'cause when your bark is gone
You're gonna take 'em all head on

Your faith is running low
It's too bad you'll never know
But don't be a fool again
'cause they're just hooligans
Don't try and save them all
Just try and break their fall
You want to live among
So don't try and right their wrongs

Bad news is twice around the world
When good is found
So don't be a fool again
They're just a bunch of hooligans

Don't try and lead the race
Like it's a life you saved
'cause you're all in my face
Like you're from outer space

And though you make 'em laugh
It won't beat the smile you have
So don't be a fool again
They're just a bunch of hooligans

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

So don't be a fool again
Don't be a hooligan
You've tried your best to win
Now get on board your wings

Don't think of paying back
Just keep your soul intact
Don't be a fool again
They're just a bunch of hooligans
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Don't be a fool again, They're just a bunch of hooligans
Don't be a fool again, They're just a bunch of hooligans

Goin' upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk
I ain't seen no whiskey - woman make me sloppy
Ain't seen no whisky - woman made me drunk
Goin' back home - where I had much better luck
Look here darling - want me to be your king
Said you're kiddin' darling - gotta keep it hid
Don't let your main man - your husband catch me here
Don't let your main man - your husband catch me here

The kids of the Coca-Cola nation
Are too doped up to realize
That time is running out
Nagasaki's crying out

The doomwatch says it's time
To give back what you took away
Oh Uncle Sam meets the reaper
Wounded knee over again

Kasota, kasota

Kasota, kasota
Kasota, kasota
Now annihilation of a nation, of our nation
Of a world population

Kasota
Kasota, kasota

The kids of the Coca-Cola nation
Are too doped up to realize
That time is running out
Nagasaki's crying out

The doomwatch says it's time
To give back what you took away
Oh Uncle Sam meets the reaper
Wounded knee over again

Kasota, kasota

Kasota, kasota
Kasota, kasota
Now annihilation of a nation, of our nation
Of the Indian nation

Kasota
Kasota, kasota

Kasota
Kasota

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

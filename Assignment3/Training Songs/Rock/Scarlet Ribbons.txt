I peeked in to say good-night,
When i heard my child in prayer.
And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair.

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
All the streets were dark and bare.
In our town no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.

through the night my heart was aching,
Just before the dawn was breaking.
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

If i live to be a hundred,
I will never know from where.
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

Scarlet ribbons- there's magic in the air,
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.

I was standing on a corner, I thought I heard a bulldog bark
It was Stacker Lee and Billy, arguing in the dark
Stacker Lee told Billy, "You killed my best friend Jack"
If you want to go on living, don't be here when I get back

Billy asked Stacker Lee not to take his life
He got three little children and a poor little helpless wife
Stacker Lee told Billy "I'll let you go with that
But give me back my money and my brand new Stetson hat"

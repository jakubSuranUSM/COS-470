Living for the past cause the future's gone
Praying in the dark that you won't go home
I should have said it better
I should have set fire to her letter
Forayed by our own
Playing the dark, where we bore it all
It all makes sense in the center
All makes sense where I sent her

But I could
Run to your apartment
Hope to get it started better than before
I could write it in a poem
Pretend I used to know you
Better than before

Why is it I want to change for you?
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Maybe I'm better off that way
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings

Love from the west
Grinning mad, light blue and golden
Found at my best
I'm a sucker for your glowing
Love from the west
Grinning mad, light blue and golden
Found at my best
I'm a sucker for your glowing

Why is it I want to change for you?
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Maybe I'm better off that way
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Why is it I want to change for you?
(Love from the west)
Why is it I want to see this through?
Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
(Grinning mad, light blue and golden)
Maybe I'm better off that way
(Found at my best)
Maybe I don't want to see you stay
But I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
(I'm a sucker for your glowing)
Sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings

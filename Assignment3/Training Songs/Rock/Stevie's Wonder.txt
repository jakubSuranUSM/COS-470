You've got heaven on your shoulder
I've been told you got a special in with Him or Her
They say you've got heaven on your shoulder
I've been told
You know how energy begins on earth

Oh my god, how you move me
And I know for sure
I'm not the first
You've got the purpose of direction
Flowing on through the universe
Rock me down with your power
Let me know where you're coming from
You are the source of a million years
Giving the power to everyone

You've got heaven on your shoulder
I've been told you got a special in with Him or Her
Connecting with heaven on your shoulder
I've been told
You know how energies begin on earth

Spirit, come and enter my night
Guide me
I want to know inner light
I want to be your pretty mama
I wonder what it's like making love to a genius

Oh my, my inspiration
Now I can deliver what I'm put here for
You are the magic of creation
And I want to thank you, I want to thank you more

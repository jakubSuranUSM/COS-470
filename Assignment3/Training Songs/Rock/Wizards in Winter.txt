Now every moment the angel spent listening
His time on earth diminished
But the angel found himself waiting there
Until each story was finished

He had only several hours left
For the quest he had been assigned
But angels like small children
Have trouble keeping track of time

But in the end it seemed this delay
Had turned out for the best
For now there were grownups all around
Listening with the rest

For as they listened to his stories
Each one till the very end
Those adults remembered their own childhoods
And a time when faith was not pretend

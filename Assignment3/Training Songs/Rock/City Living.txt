It’s been almost 15 years
I’ve been walking these streets
The City is a jealous lover
She likes to turn up the heat 
I give her what I think she needs
But she just keeps taking
I try to love her like a man should
But my heart keeps breaking 
 
City living isn’t all fun and games
But it sure is worth it in the end 
It will try to steal your dream
But like De la Vega said, “don’t let it.”
 
I’ve been on Delancey
In my head again
John Moreland at the Bowery Ballroom
That music, medicine
It’s been a magical six months
But the lows really got me down
I try to get up when it hits me
That darlin’ I’m a man, now
 
City living isn’t all fun and games
But it sure is worth it in the end
It’ll try to steal your dream
But like De la Vega said, “don’t let it.”
 
My heart was broken on Houston 
The City wrapped me in her arms
She was there when my mind wasn’t
The City is my passion
I was singing at Vagabond
Til they put that place on ice
I quit smoking to stay living here
It’s where I want to spend my life
 
City living isn’t all fun and games
But it sure is worth it in the end
It’ll try to steal your dream
But like De la Vega said, “don’t let it.”

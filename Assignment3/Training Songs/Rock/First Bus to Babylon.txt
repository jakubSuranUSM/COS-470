God it takes so long
You have to be so strong
When they try to prove you wrong
Get the first bus to Babylon
You wanna be alone
You try to disconnect the phone
Try to bury every bone
Get the first bus to Babylon
How can it be when you want to be free
There's a conspiracy working around you
Children can tell what we know very well
They believe in the spell they're on the bus
When we're dead and gone
When we get where we belong
And we've sung the final song
Get the first bus to Babylon

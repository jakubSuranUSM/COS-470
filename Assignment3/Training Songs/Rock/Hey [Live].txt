Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey
Must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at my door
Whores in my bed
But hey
Where have you been?
If you go, i will surely die
We're chained

'Uh' said the man to the lady
'Uh' said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir
Go 'uh' all night
And mary ain't you tired of this?
Uh
Is
The
Sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks
We're chained

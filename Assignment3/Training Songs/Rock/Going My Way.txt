Into your heart
Into your heart, I'm running away
I wanna stay with you

You following me, am I following you?
I don't care anyway
As long as you stay with me

Many hearts were broke on the way
It gets hard to say
Smile a while at our lives yet unseen
It's the world at play

As if by chance, they could tell our fate
These tea leaf-traces on empty plates

Sparkle and shine
Bird on the wing
Are you going my way?
Going my way with me

Play by my side
Stay with the beat
Are you going my way?
Going my way with me
With me

Many hearts were broke on the way
It gets hard to say
Smile a while at our lives yet unseen
It's the world at play

Wonder, oh, wonder
Where will we go next?

Time slipping by
Time on the wind
Are you going my way?
Going my way with me

Am I following you, you following me?
I don't care anyway
As long as you stay with me
With me

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
I'm so glad I found you now
Flying through the universe
Floatin' on the sound around
Gone today but never gone

Flying through the universe
I'm so glad I found you now
Floatin' on the sound around
Flying through the universe

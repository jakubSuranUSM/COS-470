Wasn't looking for a mountain
There was the mountain
It was a big fucking mountain
So I climbed the mountain
It was no ordinary mountain
It was a strange-looking mountain
But when I got to the top it was two foot tall
It was oh so small

But coming down from my mountain
There was nothing to stop me
Prepared for the future
Accomplished back left behind me
With a tentpole
I move on gradually
My ship was leaking
"No danger," I said, "you can use my compass instead"

From a ring-o-ring-o-roses
As we had through history
From a
Here comes the cavalry
Even
Detached from reality
And when the time comes you will know what I mean
When we all fall down

I wasn't looking for a mountain
There was the mountain
It was a big fucking mountain
So I climbed the mountain
It was no ordinary mountain
It was a strange-looking mountain
But when I got to the top it was two foot tall
It was oh so small

My mind was scrambling
For a thought that was happening
Do we need more than the
To get us through tragedy
One thing is for sure
You can't beat solidarity
So on my return it was clear as day, it was all okay

I looked for the mountain
There's always a mountain
So make a molehill from the mountain
And banish all mountains
Now there's no more mountains
What else can there be?
And as sunset falls, the told me
No matter where you go, there you are

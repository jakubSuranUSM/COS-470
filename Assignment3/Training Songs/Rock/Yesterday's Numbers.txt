Have you ever been alone?
So long you couldn't cry
Did you ever have a home
Did you ever tell a lie
I want to know you well
Know you're heaven baby, know your hell
Aw baby don't you show me, all things you got to sell

Have you ever been alone?
So long you couldn't end
Did you ever break a heart baby
Did you ever lose a friend

Baby, I want your love tonight
To make my head feel light
Oh baby won't you tell me now
Tell me it's all right
Tell me it's all right

Have you ever been alone?
So long you couldn't cry
Did you ever have a home
Where you could lay down and die
I want your love tonight
To make my head feel light
Oh baby won't you tell me now
Tell me it's all right,
Tell me it's all right,

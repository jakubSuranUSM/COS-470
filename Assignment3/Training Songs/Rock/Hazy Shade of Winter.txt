Time, time, time
See what's become of me

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

"Hang on to your hopes, my friend"
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again

Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground

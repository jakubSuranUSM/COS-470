Gimme flowers and birds in the trees
Gimme cute, the spice and the sweet
Gimme righteous but not too much
And a tender touch

Gimme god and the holy ghost
Peanut butter and jelly on toast
Gimme the blood of my enemies
Just give it to me

Bring it on home
Gimme truth gimme nice and polite
Gimme honest, patient and right
A brand new car and some hope
Get rid of all the dope

Gimme sunshine, blue skies and green
Gimme unleaded gasoline
Gimme friends who never deceive
Just give it to me

Bring it on home

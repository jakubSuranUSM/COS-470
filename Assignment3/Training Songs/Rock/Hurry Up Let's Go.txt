You're a lie I don't believe a thing
Has she been asking for me

So hurry up let's go don't want to miss a thing
C'mon love is all we've got and everything in the bottle is gone
So hurry up let's go don't want to miss a thing
So slow down my heart can break in two yes a heart can break in two

So c'mon let's go let's break this heart in two
And everyone is all dressed up 
You came to me and I said yeah yeah yeah

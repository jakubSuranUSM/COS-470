I saw you walkin' down on the street
I called out from my window but you didn't hear me
I lay down and I tried to sleep
I waited for you to walk on by again
I don't need you to set me free
I don't want you to set me free

Well every time I see you, I get sick
And every time I think of you, well I get sick
And every time I dream of you, well I get sick
And every time I cry for you, well I get sick
I don't want you to set me free
I don't need you to set me free

I don't want you to set me free
I just need you to set me free
I don't want you to set me free
I just need you to set me free
Alright come on Grinderman!
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

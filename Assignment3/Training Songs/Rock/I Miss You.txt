Still in my heart after all these years
Separated by time now by distance
I couldn't allow myself to feel
The loss that I feel right now
As I put this song down

You're far away
And happy I know
And it's a little bit late
Twenty years or so
And it's a little bit cold
For all those concerned
But I'd sell my soul and your souls for a song
So I'll pour my heart out

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I'm sorry but I do
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I'm sorry but it's true

I want to thank you for the good years
And apologize for the rough ones
You must be laughing yourself sick
Up there in Idaho
But I wanted to write you one
Before I quit
And this one's it

I miss you
I miss you
And I wanted you to know
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
And I still love you so

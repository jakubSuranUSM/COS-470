This story ends
In Bloodshed
The face I love
The city I'm from
The persons I've met
The persons I've let down
But a hero never turns around

It's nice to see you're moving on
I know it's hard to carry on
But it's just never what it was
In the beginning
In the beginning

How did this start?
And where did we begin
In a ball of fire
And stars and suns
And that brings me here, now
Where my heart's caving in
A tornado whips in around
The poles
And it's raining 

It's nice to see you're moving on
I know it's hard to carry on
But it's just never what it was
In the beginning
In the beginning

In a ball of fire

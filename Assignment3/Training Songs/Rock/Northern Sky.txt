On an island off the southern sea
Overlooking a memory you once had
There's a light in a northern sky
And a picture of you that never dies

Pass the time and make it til Friday
I'm hypnotized living in a photograph life
You're still on my mind
All the homes and places I let go
I don't belong, California rides in my heart
A new place to start

Oh dawn is coming
There's something out there I'll find a way
Oh dawn is here

Watch out for the lonely people, they're hypnotized
Waiting for the end of the world to wake them back up
It's the same as talking to my baby
But those words I've lost
Surrendered to the daydream inside and come back alive

Oh dawn is coming
There's something out there I'll find a way
Oh dawn is here

What am I waiting for
There is no other way
I'm sure I won't remember
As the life I love washes away
(repeat)

On an island off the southern sea
Overlooking a memory you once had

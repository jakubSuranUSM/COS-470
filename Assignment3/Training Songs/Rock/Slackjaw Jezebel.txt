Babies were crying when you got here
I believe they're crying still
The world as we know it keeps right on turning
I guess it always will

Still, something's changed, I hate to admit it
I ain't been the same since you came around
My mind is swollen from the weariness
Wish you'd never flagged me down

Twisted angel, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here to pull me out of my shell
You show up on my doorstep, honey dripping from your mouth
Like some slack jaw Jezebel

Flesh and bones is all I'm made of
I couldn't have stopped you if I tried
The spell you were casting, way too heavy
Now I can't be satisfied

But you think you're going to save me, you better think again
I've had saviors galore
And although you are a vision, an angel wrapped in sin
I've seen it all before

Twisted angel, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here, landed on my window sill
Now you're walking through my back door, honey dripping from your mouth
Like some slack jaw Jezebel

You've got your bag of dust and your divining rod
I wonder how I got myself here
Wheel's spinning faster and I know I have to jump off
Guess I'm weighing the fire against the fear

You spoon-fed my ego, made me feel so young
Kissed me 'til my lips were sore
But I know you're just a Jezebel with a poisonous tongue
I've been down this road before

It's full of twisted angels, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here to put me through Hell
You show up on my doorstep, honey dripping from your mouth
Like some slack jaw Jezebel
Oh like some slack jaw Jezebel

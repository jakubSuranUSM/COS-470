Keeping my eyes on the road I see you,
Keeping my hands on the wheel I hold you,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A.
I kiss you, I miss you, 
Please be there.
 
Passing a white sandy beach we're sailing, 
Turning the radio on we're dancing,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A.
I want you, I need you,
Please be there.
 
The windshield is covered with rain, I'm crying,
Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flying.
Counting the telephone poles, I phone you,
Reading the signs on the road, I write you,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A. we're laughing, we're loving,
Please be there.
We're laughing, we're loving,
Please be there.

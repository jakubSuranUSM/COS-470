When I'm all grown up, ain't no baby no more 
I can do the things I couldn't do before 
No more pony tails, I'll wear my hair up high 
Because I'm 17, & that's the reason why 

[Chorus]
 
Now I'm all grown up & I'll go where I want to go 
See who I want to see, stay out late 
I'm all grown up & I'll do what I want to do 
Be what I want to be, gee I can hardly wait 

Well I'm goin' on dates every Saturday night 
And if he wants a kiss, I might say "All right" 
I gotta have me fun & I'll be ready to go 
I'm gonna go downtown, I'm gonna fill the floor 

[Chorus] 

[Chorus]

Gee, I can hardly wait 
(scat singing, fading out)

Quit my drinkin’, started thinkin’
Drink, think, funny
How they don’t go together
It’s true, whoa, honey, it’s true
You know I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do

Tired of losin’, started boozin’
Booze, lose, funny
How they do go together
It’s true, honey, it’s so true
You know I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do

You know I can’t do the pony
Can’t do the jerk, can’t Watusi
Too much like work
And it’s true, it’s true, yeah
You know I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do

Ya know I can’t do the pony
Can’t do the jerk, can’t Watusi
Too much like work
And it’s true, sweet, sweet mama, it’s true
You know I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do

Says I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do
You know I’m in love with you, honey
Funny what a love can do

He had 3 whole dollars,
A worn out car
And a wife who was leaving for good

Life's made of trouble,
Worry, pain and struggle
She wrote 'good bye' in the dust on the hood 

They found a map of Missouri
Lipstick on the glass
They must of left in the middle of the night

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know
How's it going to end?

Behind a smoke colored curtain, 
The girl disappeared
They found out that the ring was a fake

A tree born crooked,
Will never grow straight
She sunk like a hammer into the lake

A long lost letter and 
And old leaky boat
Promises are never meant to keep

And I want to know the same thing
I want to know
How's it going to end?

The barn leaned over, 
The vultures dried their wings
The moon climbed up an empty sky

The sun sank down,
Behind the tree on the hill
There's a killer and he's coming through the rye

But maybe he's the father, 
Of that lost little girl
It's hard to tell in this light

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know
How's it going to end?

Drag your wagon and your plow, 
Over the bones of the dead
Out among the roses and the weeds

You can never go back,
And the answer is 'no'
And wishing for it only makes it bleed

Joel Tornabene,
Was broken on the wheel
Shane and Bum Mahoney on the lamb

The grain was as gold,
As Sheila's hair
All the way from Liverpool, with all we could steal

He was robbed of twenty dollars
His body found stripped
Cast into the harbour there and drowned

And I want to know the same thing
We all want to know
How's it going to end?

The sirens are snaking,
Their way up the hill
It's last call somewhere in the world

The reptiles blend in, 
With the color of the street
Life is sweet at the edge of a razor

And down in the first row,
Of an old picture show
The old man is asleep, as the credits start to roll

And I want to know the same thing
We all want to know
How's it going to end?

And I want to know the same thing
We all want to know
How's it going to end?

And I just want to know the same thing
I want to know
How's it going to end?

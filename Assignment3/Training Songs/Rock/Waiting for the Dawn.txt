Lately I’ve been so lonely
Don’t know why, but I think that it’s cause of you
It’s true
I chase the time. I remember the old days
I pretend that I can still be who I am and not be excommunicated
(By society that is.)
I told you twice, I love you. I still do
Time don’t lie, he says that Love it ain't easy
The road is long and arduous

But oh, I think you know why we came here and what we are fighting for
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

Sometimes I go a wanderin’
It seems like I always get stuck in my head
I become the hermit
Waiting for the dawn to come now
Waiting for the light to get me high and guide me home
Oh oh oh

Singing Oh, I think you know why we came here and what we are fighting for
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

Lately I’m not so lonely
I know why. I think that it’s cause of you
It's true

Hi Hey There Hello

Oh well Hi, Hey there, Hello
Have you got some place to go?
I’ve got some time and I would love to take you out
I’ve got two nickels to my name
Well hey, my story sounds the same but I’ll find some way to show you what life’s all about
Oh we could take a walk downtown
No, lets search for higher ground
We’ll count the stars, and clouds and howl at the moon
I hear the rich folks come here too, cause’ it’s such a lovely view and when the sun decides to rise it’ll be too soon

Oh, oh my blood may run red but the thoughts in my head, they are blue
They are purple, they are gold.
And though there may come a day where my hair it turns grey, 
but my soul, oh, my soul, will never grow old
See I’m not skin and bones
I am sunshine and snow on this ever‐changing earth that we know
I’ll melt into a stream. I will glisten and gleam
I’ll float on but I’ll never grow old
I’ll float on but I’ll never grow old

Oh, oh well Hi, Hey there, Hello
Have you got some place to go?
I’ve got some time and I would love to take you out
I’ve got two nickels to my name
Well hey, my story sounds the same but I’ll find some way to show you what life’s all about
Oh, oh well Hi, Hey there, Hello
Have you got some place to go?
I’ve got some time and I would love to take you out

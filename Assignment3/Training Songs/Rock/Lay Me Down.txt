I've played your game and I've played it well
I'll be another fool to hang upon your wall
I laid my heart out like an open book
And it's a simple thing and don't take much
To crack it open and bleed, so

Lay me down
Lay me down when you're through with me
Lay me down
Let me bleed when you're through with me

Don't let me think you're wrong
Just let me fall down I'll pick myself up again
And it's the kindest thing you can do for me
So, woman, won't you lay me down, yeah

Well I lied to myself tried to believe in you
But it's hard to rely on the ghost of someone I hardly even knew
You see you bring things out just to bring me down
Then you twist them about and shove 'em in my face
Till my eyes can't see any good

Oh lay me down
Lay me down when you're through with me
Come on lay me down
Let me bleed when you're through with me

Don't let me think you're wrong
Just let me fall down I'll pick myself up again
And it's the kindest thing you can do for me
So, woman, won't you lay me down, come on

Oh lay me down
Lay me down when you're through with me
Come on lay me down
Let me bleed when you're through with me

Don't let me think you're wrong
Just let me fall down I'll pick myself up again

Oh baby lay me down
Lay me down when you're through with me
Oh lay me down
Let me bleed when you're through with me

Don't let me think you're wrong
Just let me fall down I'll pick myself up again
It's the kindest thing you can do for me
Woman, won't you lay me down

Got nowhere to go, you got nothin' to do,
Just killin' time, but it's killin' me too,
Too much sorrow and too many tears,
You've been lonely for too many years.

Step outside, take a ride,
Step outside, take a ride, whoa.

Lost all your money, now where are your friends?
You burned all your candles at too many ends.
Wasted your days, now they ain't worth a dime,
It's easy to see why you're blue all the time.

Step outside, take a ride,
Step outside, take a ride, yea.

Woo!

Look out the window, what do you see?
People are living like you ought to be.
Forget the past girl, it's hard but it's right,
Loosen up baby, 'cause time's getting tight.

Step outside, take a ride,
Step outside, take a ride,
Step outside, take a ride,
You gotta step, you gotta step outside,

Step outside, take a ride, Loosen up baby,
Step outside, take a ride, You got, you gotta,
Step outside, take a ride, Take a ride,
Step outside, take a ride, I'm killin' time,
Step outside, Loosen up baby,
Take a ride...

Step outside, take a ride - Step outside, take a ride
Step outside, take a ride - Step outside, take a ride

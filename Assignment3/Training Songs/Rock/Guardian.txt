These walls are stained, engraved with pain
You will find them under shadows
Casting shame

Some it's all they'll ever know
Angels of the fortunate sons come and go
You may not

Entities pass in the night
Guardians and the reaper's fight
The will to live shall win

Mares of hope ride through their dreams
Blinding light awakens sleepin' dawn it seems
It was all a dream, endless dream

I will wish upon a star, I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you, will you remember me?

I the one you sentenced, penance unabsolved
Answer me, save my will
Have you forgotten me?

Pace the hallway blind man
For a million miles of stars
His mind has seen

Think you may he lives in darkness
We're the dark
He's seen the light of dream

Karen's been asleep forever
I know she hears me
She has so much to say

Machine tools sparks through her egg shell mind
Tears stream from her face
Unto my hand, unto my heart

I will wish upon a star, I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you, will you remember me?

I the one you sentenced
Penance unabsolved
Answer me, save my will

I'm a fire without a flame
Helpless child without a name
With broken wings, catch me I'm fallin'

I'm a question with no answer who are
You that takes my life away from me
Unveil the boundaries of the black

I had a dream I was you
Strong as the fire in my veins
And when I called out your name

I would remain to witness the pain
I am beyond silent black
I will be back as your guardian

Angels in white you have sacrificed
You witness and bury the pain
Walk hand and hand with the fear stricken child
Strengthen the weak and the lame

Have you seen beyond the unborn?
Pillar of penance and lore
Perpetual journey into the realm
The sovereign servitor

I will wish upon a star, I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar
I remembered you, will you remember me?

I the one you sentenced, penance unabsolved
Answer me, save my will
Have you forgotten me?

Answer me, save my will
Have you forgotten me?
Answer me, save my will
Have you forgotten me?
Answer me, save my will
Have you forgotten me?

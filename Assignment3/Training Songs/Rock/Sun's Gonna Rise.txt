You know I've seen that face before
I'm not sure if I want it to be
That old face I used to see
'Cause that's the one that left me all alone
Took my feelings and hung them out to dry
Never gave a reason why
Yes, I know I fell from grace before
But all that's gonna end

Sun's gonna rise again
I'll be listenin' to those lies again
Sun's gonna rise

'Cause I went back for more
Guess I never learned my lesson well
I went straight back into hell
But when the lightnin' hits the stormy sky
No one cares about who'll be left to cry
And there ain't no reason why
Yes I know I led the chase before
The chase is gonna end

Sun's gonna rise again
I'll be listenin' to those lies again
Sun's gonna rise again

You feelin' sorry for yourself
Don't affect my mental health, no more
I've had enough and it's over

Sun's gonna rise again
I'll be listenin' to those lies again, yea
Sun's gonna rise
(Sun will arise)
(Sun will arise again)

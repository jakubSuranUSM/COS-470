Well we come with what was on our backs 
Yeah, when the leaves had died and all turned black 
Back when the wind was cold and blew them 'round 
When we laid our blankets on the ground 
Yeah and I woke up feelin' hungry 
Lookin' straight into the sun, and left a cold night on the ground 
Like a dog on the run 

I fell overboard and washed up on the beach 
Yes, let the waves and sand roll over me 
I was helped to the home of a young bleached blond 
Who said 'honey I discovered early in life there's ways of getting 
Anything I want , some of us are different 
It's just something in our blood, there's no need for explanations 
We're just dogs on the run' 

The room was painted blue and gray 
All my meals were served on a silver tray 
Oh she would laugh, and light m why cigarettes 
She said 'honey, ain't it funny how a crowd gathers around 
Anyone living life without a net? 
And how they'll beg you for the answers 
But it won't ever be enough, there's no way you could ever tell 'em 
It's just dogs on the run'

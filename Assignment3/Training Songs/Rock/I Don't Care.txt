I try to make it through my life, in my way, there's you
I try to make it through these lies, and that's all I do

Just don't deny it,
Don't try to fight this, and deal with it
And that's just part of it

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear) I don't care

I try to make you see my side
I always try to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do

I'm getting buried in this place
I got no room, your in my face
Don't say anything just go away

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear) I don't care

Love changing everything, you won't be left for me
Love changing everything, you won't be left for me

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
'Cause I swear (I swear) I don't care

If you were dead or still alive
I don't care (I don't care) I don't care (I don't care)
Just go and leave this all behind
I don't care (I swear) I don't care
At all

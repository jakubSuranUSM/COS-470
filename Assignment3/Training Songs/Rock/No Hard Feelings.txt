No hard feelings, no tears, no pain.
No hard feelings, no fears remain.
I could see you slowly drifting away,
Like a vision into the wall.
But I've got no hard feelings,
I've got no feelings at all.
No hard feelings, no cold goodbyes.
No hard feelings, too old and wise.
"And what happened to forever?", they say,
"A lifetime seems so small".
But I've got no hard feelings,
I've got no feelings at all. 
If only you could try
To see my point of view.
We wait, our time goes by
And we won't make it through.
No hard feelings, no tears, no pain.
No hard feelings, no fears remain.
I could see you slowly drifting away,
Like a vision into the wall.
But I've got no hard feelings,
I've got no feelings at all.
I've got no hard feelings,
I've got no feelings at all.

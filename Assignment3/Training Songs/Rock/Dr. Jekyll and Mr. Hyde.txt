I'm normal outside
He's evil inside
I'm Dr Jekyll and
He's Mr Hyde
I try to be true
He tries to be cruel
I'll hold you gently but
He'll smother you

My clothes will impress you
And my claws will undress you

I'm normal outside
He's evil inside
I'm Dr Jekyll and
He's Mr Hyde
I want what's right
He walks in the night
Searching for sin in his
Decadent life

My charms will beguile you
And my arms will defile you

Me I'm on the side of the angels
But the devil's my best friend
Sin is a way of life
Saints are for suckers
Welcome to the underworld
I start where nightmares end
Two for the price of one
Two for the price of, one?

I'm normal outside
He's evil inside
I'm Dr Jekyll and
He's Mr Hyde
I try to be true
He tries to be cruel
I'll hold you gently but
He'll smother you

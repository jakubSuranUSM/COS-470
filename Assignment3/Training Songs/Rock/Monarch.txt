The Queen had a faint and had a fall
Don't give me ether or open my vein
I'm sane, I know I'm sane

I don't give a care for the crown or the shield
I will not protect you
Happily yield to the one who makes me come undone

Who was born and in what way of the fields
And poppies lay
Who was born and in what way of the fields

The Queen is walking away with only her stockings on
Raven hair and forbidden pairs of song
Valiant tune, the colors ott to gold
Colors of the morning old

Who was born and in what way of the fields
And poppies lay
Who was born and in what way of the fields

Monarch, now lay your jeweled head
Monarch, now lay your jeweled head
Monarch, now lay your jewels

Monarch, now lay your jeweled head
Monarch, now lay your jeweled head
Monarch, now lay your jeweled head

The Queen saw the beast in the ribs of the guard
And has been dear, you are nearer to the eye
You're thrown places you wouldn't hold me pardon
So weigh the hand of God

Weigh the hand of God, through you is so cruel
Who was born, in what way
Who was born, in what way

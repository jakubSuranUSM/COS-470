It's not worth anything more
Than it is at all
I live as I choose
Or I will not live at all
So return to where to where you came from
Return to where you dwell
Because harassment's not my forte
But you do it bloody well
And I'm free to decide
I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all
You must have nothing more
With your time to do
There's a war in Russia and Sarajevo too
So to hell with all your thinking
And to hell with your narrow mind
You're so distracted from the real thing
You should leave your life behind
'Cause I'm free to decide
Free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all
I'm free to decide.

I'm gonna take a stab at this
Sure you will be alright
Make a decision with a kiss
Baby I have false spite

And when I trek alone back home
I make sure that I trek in the snow
Would it fall?

Tissue and bones, it was a trick
This isn't a gunfight
Checking it off my list
Unable to rewrite

Five years cast once and far alone
Hope I'm ready, able to make my own
Goodbye

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did

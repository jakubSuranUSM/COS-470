You can run again
And all you've gotta do, is find the time
Didn't it make you feel just fine
When all the time you can
You can make it every day, and you can run again

I feel ten again
And all I've gotta do is change my shoes
Ruffle up my hair and wear a pair of 7-2's
And I'll be there in minutes flat, and I'll feel 10 again

All I want is one more go
And you can take me to the next big show
And you can tell me when it's time to go
And you can
Oohh

You can win again
All I gotta do is cross the line
Didn't it make you feel just fine
When all the time you can
You can make it every day and you can win again

All I want is one more go
And you can take me to the next big show
And you can tell me when it's time to go
And you can
Oohh

And you can
All I want is one more go
And you can take me to the next big show
And you can tell me when it's time to go
And you can ooooh
And you can ooooh
And you can ooooh

Talking bout Jumping Jim, 
Talking bout Mud Slide Slim.
Don't you know that a fish got to swim, 
Don't a goose got to fly high?
Little dog got to die and I'm going home.
Woah, don't you know. 
Woah, don't you know.

Talking bout a life on the street, 
Gonna think about an itch in my feet.
Can't you hand me down them highway shoes?
Lord knows I'm talking 'bout the walking blues,
Got the rocking pneumonia blues 
And I'm headed home, bye-bye.
Woah, don't you know. 
Woah, don't you know

Listen here now, don't you come round 
Talking bout over yonder, listen,
Bound to wake up the walking man in me 
And I'm bound to wandering, hey now,
Talking all about spooning into bone, 
Looking just like Sherlock Holmes.
Looking for a needle in a haystack, 
Seeing and eating lots of fatback,
Hey, talking bout a railroad track 
And I'm going home, bye-bye.

Woah, don't you know. 
Woah, don't you know.
Woah, who, don't you know. 
You outta know, you oughta know, you oughta know.
You outta know like a fish in the stream, 
Outta know like a leaf on the tree.
Outta know like a boat in the sea.

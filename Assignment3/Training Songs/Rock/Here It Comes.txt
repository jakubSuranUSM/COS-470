This is a call
a call to all
it goes out to those who've been bad
and I should know
cos I have been
maybe once a week on mondays
you should've seen
what I've seen
she doubles up and comes back sundays
and she will come 
into your heart
it goes on and on and on

here it comes
here comes my 
day in the sun
here it comes
here comes my time
in the sun

this is the day
this is the time
to stare at the world in wonder
we live a lie
you'll never find
never in a month of sundays

you should've seen
what I've seen
he doubles up and comes back mondays
and he will come
into your heart
it goes on and on and on...

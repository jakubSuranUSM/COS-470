Pre>intro riff the high notes are f# g be f# g see

The chords appear to be em cmaj7 e see then em cmaj7 3 times

Em cmaj7 d em
Every street is a crowded place every crowd is too much to face
Em cmaj7 d
Every shoulder is something hard don't want to lean on
Em cmaj7 d em
Every day we are running out our caps to catch in the pouring rain
Em cmaj7 d
Feel the loneliness and the doubt I have to shout for

Chorus
Em cmaj7 d
Hey no more excuses I made them enough
Em cmaj7 d
I said hey no more excuses it's time to get tough

Every step is another chance every moment slips through our hands
Every kiss is another flame I don't want to put out
Every night when I fall asleep I know I never want to wake up
Into a world where you're not around can't let you down

Chorus

Bridge
Em cmaj7 em cmaj7
Don't break down in this cold town where the people live in fear
Em cmaj7
There's a wheel in my hand but I can't steer

I never noticed you always win I never thought about how to live
I only took it for granted and like a fool let it all slip by
But if you forgive me of my mistakes I will try to find what it takes
In this soul there's a heart that aches to give me my lesson

Chorus

(then) using em cmaj7

Oh oh oh (then) bridge I can't steer then intro again

(then) bridge I can't steer I can't steer

Hey no more hey no more hey no more

Repeats and fades /pre>

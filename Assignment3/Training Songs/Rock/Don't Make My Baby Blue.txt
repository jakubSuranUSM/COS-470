I know that I can't keep her
Now she's in love with you
But I just wanna say
I won't be far away 

So don't make my baby blue
Don't make my baby blue
That little girl's an angel
And it hurts to set her free
So you better take good care of her
'Cause she still means the world to me
I'm gonna step aside now
Just like she wants me to
But even tho' I'm gone
I'll still be lookin' on
So don't make my baby cry

I know your reputation
They say you can't be true
But I'll be standin' by
So you just better try and 
Don't make my baby blue
Don't make my baby blue
That little girl's an angel
And it hurts to set her free
So you better take good care of her
'Cause she still means the world to me
I'm gonna step aside now
Just like she wants me to
But even tho' I'm gone
I'll still be lookin' on
So don't make my baby cry

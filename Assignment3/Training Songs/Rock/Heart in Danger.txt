All of my life, all of my life
I stood outside the circle, right outside the circle
Being so wrong, somehow felt right
Who needs to belong, that feeling was so strong
Wearing me down, turning me round
The strongest of intentions fade into convention
I'm not sure if my heart still knows
The place where I wanted to go
(Chorus)
 Making me change direction
 Taking my life every day
 I feel my heart in danger
 And I need to hideaway
 Watching my best intentions
 Fading away every day
 I feel my heart in danger
 And I need to hide away

Living alone, is always a fight
Why stand out in the storm
It's so easy to conform
The highest of hopes slowlyc ome down
Fearful of rejection satisfied with imperfection
And what I thought was truly mine
Is somehow slipping away
(Repeat Chorus)

(Middle 16)
 Hideaway from what the world can do
 Changing everyone
 Hideaway from the thief of time
 Stealing what is mine

(Chorus on acoustic)
(Chorus to fade)

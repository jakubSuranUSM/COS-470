Oh baby, now let's get down tonight

Baby, I'm hot just like your oven
Oh, I need your lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
Now it's getting stronger and stronger
And when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing, sexual healing

It makes me feel so fine
It helps to relieve the mind
Sexual healing, is good for me
Sexual healing is something
That is so very good for me

Whenever these blue teardrops are falling
Oh no, and my emotional stability is leaving me
But there is something I can do
Oh, I can get on the telephone or call you up, baby
Darling, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me

So if you don't know the things you're dealing
Oh, I can tell you darling, oh, it's sexual healing
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right

Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling

Baby, you know I got sick this morning
A sea was storming up inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
Oh, the waves are rising
And when I get this feeling
I want sexual healing, sexual healing

It makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
It helps to relieve the mind, Lord, it's good for us
Sexual healing is good for me
Sexual healing is something so so good for me

Oh, it's so good for us, oh, it's so good to me, my baby
Just grab a hold, come take control
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making love, honey
Hope we do it fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Oh darling, darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

Heal me, my darling
I can't wait for you to operate
Heal me, my darling
I can't wait for you to operate

Heal me, my darling
I can't wait for you to heal me
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling

Heal me, my darling
I can't wait for you to
Heal me, my darling
Oh baby, whenever these blue teardrops are falling
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling

Good night
It's summer time
Let's get paralyzed down both sides
Sneaking to red sleeping kiss 
And your black eyes
Over
Midnight organ fight
Yours gets into mine
It's all right
And the fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away with her fire heads
This is the longest kiss
Good night

Oh,

And now I, I tremble,
Because this stumble
Has become miracle
I feel like I just died twice
Was reborn again
For all our dirty sins
And the fast blood, fast blood, fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away with her fire heads
This is the longest kiss
Good night
Good night
And then I fall down
I stumble
And she said, good night

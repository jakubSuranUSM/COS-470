Take me far away
And make me lose control
For now I need to pray
Think of forgotten souls

Disappear from every sphere
Watch them high
Then slowly die
Then slowly die

If you shut your eyes
You'll float through the blackest hole
So sure in night time sky
You see forgotten souls

Disappear from every sphere
Watch them high
Then slowly die
Then slowly die

Then slowly die
Then slowly die
Then slowly die

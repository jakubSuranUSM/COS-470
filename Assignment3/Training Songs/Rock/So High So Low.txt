Once you know you can never
You can never turn back
But I understand
Cause we all fear what we lack
Being with you
Makes me tired as hell
And it's so high so low

Now if I was strong
And you were male
You'd be dead
And I would be in jail
Being with you
Makes me tired as hell
And it's so high so low

Don't go making promises
You know you won't keep
Weddings turn to funerals
Both with songs that make you weep
Being with you
Makes me tired as hell
And it's so high so low

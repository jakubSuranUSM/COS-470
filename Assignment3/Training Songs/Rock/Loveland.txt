I'm gonna find me a plot of ground 
That nobody else has ever found 
In the middle of the desert or the deep blue sea 
It doesn't make any difference to me 

It'll be my newfound home 
A country all of its own 
It'll even go down in history 

[Chorus] 
Oh oh oh 
I'll build a Love Land for you & me 
A Love Land for the world to see 
No strings attached, no normalities 
No cost in money, you can get it free 
So pack your heart & hurry up 
& see what I'm talkin' about 
You'd better hurry up & get here soon 
Before I'm all sold out
 
A true true love & honesty 
That's gonna be my policy 
We'll be members of the United Nations 
Oh what we'll do to foreign relations 

Everybody's gonna say 
"Hip hip hip hooray 
For Lovey-Lovey-Love, Love Land, USA!" 

[Chorus]
 
You'd better hurry up & get here soon 
Before I'm all sold out

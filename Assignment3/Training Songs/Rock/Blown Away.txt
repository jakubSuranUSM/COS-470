It's raining again, here in my hotel
I guess I'm a little lonely and I don't feel very well
Maybe this time I'm really dying, now wouldn't that be swell
I deserve it for taking a good love, taking a good love and blowing it all to hell

There's another good love blown away again
Another sweet love just scattered with the wind
Another letter added to the letters that I will never send
I've blown away a good love once again

This was gonna be the big one, my precious saving grace
This was gonna be different, this time I'd play it straight
But like a fool, I played my same old hand and made my same mistakes
There I was taking a good love, taking a good love and turnin' into hate

There's another good love blown away again
Another sweet love just scattered with the wind
Another letter added to the letters that I will never send
I've blown away a good love once again

There's another good love blown away again
Another sweet love just scattered with the wind
Another letter added to the letters that I will never send
I've blown away a good love once again

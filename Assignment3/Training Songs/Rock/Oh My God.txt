Time on your side it'll never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
All I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

It don't matter to me
All I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

[Chorus]
Oh my God I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh my God I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh my God I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh my God I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

Bright ruins lit for a greater glory
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down I'll get right back up again
Come back stronger than a powered-up Pacman

It don't matter to me
All I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

[Chorus: x2]

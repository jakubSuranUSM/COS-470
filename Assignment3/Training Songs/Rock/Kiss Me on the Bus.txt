On the bus, that's where we're ridin'
On the bus, okay, don't say hi, then
Your tongue, your transfer,
Your hand, your answer

On the bus, everyone's lookin' forward
On the bus, I am lookin' forward
And everything ain't okay
I might die 'fore Monday
They're all watchin' us

Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
If you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
Hurry, hurry, here comes my stop

On the bus, watch our reflection
On the bus, I can't stand no rejection
C'mon, let's make a scene
Oh, baby, don't be so mean
They're all watchin' us
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
If you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
Hurry, hurry, here comes my stop

If you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
They're all watchin' us
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus

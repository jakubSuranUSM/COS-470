You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand 
Oh oh oh oh
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Oh oh oh oh
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around 
Oh
And she said, don't you want to?  
Don't you want to cook it, cook it, cook it? 
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah

Ooh, heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned 
In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground  
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to, did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 

You want to do it, you want to 
You want to do it when you want to 
You want to do it, do it when you want to 

When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might 
When you fake it, mama 
Please fake it right (for yourself babe)

When you fake it baby
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you want to 
Do it, do it, do it 
Do it when you want to 

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal 
Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it (fryin') 
For your life 
For your life

I can't make up my mind
Someone has to help me
I never seem to know what to do
I just can't decide for myself
She has told me in so many words that she's still in love with me
And she wants me back, 
She wants me back with her again

She said, "Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I need you here
Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I want you by my side."

Someone show me which way to go
I need guiding in my choice
Of what to do
Someone has to help me

She said, "Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I need you here
Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back, come back where you belong?
I want you by my side."

Someone show me which way to go
I need guiding in my choice
Of what to do
Someone has to help me

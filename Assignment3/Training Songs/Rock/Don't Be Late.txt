Look at him running there's so far to go,
He's very short of breath
And he'd said don't be late
Just don't be late
With his parcel tucked tight under his arm
He's sure he's passed half way
And he'd said don't be late
Just don't be late.
DID YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU'RE TOLD
THE INSTRUCTION YOU HAD WAS OLD
I wasn't sure if I'd hear you
I'm glad you're still allright
IT'S ALL BEEN ARRANGED FOR TEN
THE STREETS SHOULD BE CLEAR BY THEN
I've done all that you told me
I'm sure that they will wait
THEIR TIMING WAS MADE QUITE CLEAR
IF WE'RE LATE THEY WILL NOT APPEAR
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know how far we've had to go
CAN YOU PICK UP THIS SLOWING PACE
YOU'RE RUNNING A LOSING RACE
No ! Soon we'll see them
Then you'll know
That I have not delayed, he said
[Chorus]
Hurry and don't be late
You'd better hurry you might be late
Just hurry and don't be late
You'd better hurry you may be late
IF WE'RE LATE I WILL NOT SURVIVE
THEY WILL KEEP ME ALIVE
It's not too far now
And I can only wish you luck friend
I'M SORRY I GO ALONE
THIS METAL IS A COLD HOME
I can see they're waiting
A few more steps and you'll be there, he said
[Chorus]
Just hurry and don't be late
You'd better hurry you may be late

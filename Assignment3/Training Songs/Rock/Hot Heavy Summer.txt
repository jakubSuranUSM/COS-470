Baby wants to dance
Past the flat footed charterhouse boys
From towns where the mothers can't stand
The sight of each other
Baby wants to last
In the hearts of the wild and free
She knows that time takes all of us
Through every long hot heavy summer

And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Of chance encounters

Baby wants to dance
Past the Tuesday morning supermarket crowd
She knows we'll all sleep through the days
And be two-step drip fed our laughter
Says she wants to last
Last how you want to
She's a light in the young boy's eyes
Through every long hot heavy summer

And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Yeah all of them, shuffling down that lonely street
One last gasp
Against a long hot heavy summer

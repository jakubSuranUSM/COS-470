We're giving each other a hard time,
While we're not supposed to do so
I've been crying like a girl,
You've been smashing up the lamps and the stereo
You're a fine brunette,
You make the kings of the jungle roar
You're the finest that I have met this year or any year before 

Now I can't live with you 
Whether, times are high or low
And I can't live with you
Not telling me where it is you wanna go
Either way I can't stand it now
So baby stay away and please
Let me know 

Our hands that hold one another,
Do squeeze too hard sometimes
Provoking thoughts that would perfectly fit
Into a gallery of famous crimes
But when your lips are near and you're giving me 
One of your juicy grins
Provoking physics that would perfectly fit
Into a gallery of famous sins 

Now I can't live with you 
Whether, times are high or low
And I can't live with you
Not telling me where it is you wanna go
Either way I can't stand it now
So baby stay away and please
Let me know

We're in a movie about madness and about defeat 
With a soundtrack of a jazzed up heartbeat 
I don't know what we can do I have no idea
I don't care if you're someone else 
As long as you're here with me 

Now I can't live with you 
Whether, times are high or low
And I can't live with you
Not telling me where it is you wanna go
Either way I can't stand it now
So baby stay away and please
Let me know

Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know

One two one two three four

Yeah I step outta my little country
I traveled seasons, took a longboat
And now I find my self in a small town
It's so remote I couldn't trawl

So I kissed my mommy, oh on her sweet cheeks
And I told my dad I'm real glad that we're friends
Said to my brother I'll surely miss him
I'm coming back just don't know when

Waited enough to find the truth, 
The pain, again then say oh well
Don't say oh well
Don't say oh well

And I told my band mates, they are my soul mates
And I hope we can understand
That this year has been a big one, yeah
We following what we don't plan

So do you got that sweet devotion
Oh will you follow your heart's plan
Oh why not jump in to that ocean
And run your fingers through your hair

Waited enough to find the truth, 
The pain, again then say oh well
Don't say oh well 
Don't say oh well
Don't say oh well

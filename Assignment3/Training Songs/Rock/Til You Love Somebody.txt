Up on the east side
To the west side
Across the city
The great divide
Nights are long if you
Ain't got the money
The streets are empty as an exit sign
You paint by numbers tonight
But it ain't worth the fight

[Chorus]
You're just half of a heart
Until you love somebody
You don't know who you are
Until you love somebody
Until you love someone

Is that a torch baby
Or just a candle
The lights are burning
But there's no-one there
Is it fire that you
You just can't handle
Could it be that you just might care
You've got my name on your lips
See man and let it slip

[Chorus]

Throw a line and I'll pull you in
Oh yeah cause it's sink or swim
Give it up baby
See man give me your heart, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

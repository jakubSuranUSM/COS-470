I never really had a broken heart
I always played it kinda close to my chest
Love for me's just been a walk in the park
It doesn't really matter
It never really mattered

I never really had a broken heart
It's always such a shock to me
What looks to me like people going through the motions
But when it's over their hearts are broken.
I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no
I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no

Freedom from love
Freedom from the heartache

Freedom from love
Freedom from the heartache

Freedom from love
Freedom from the heartache

Freedom from love
Freedom from the heartache

I never really had a broken heart
You don't believe me, just look at my chest
The way some people like to run and hide
I never really, really
I never really

I never really had a broken heart
I've never really ever been undone
It's just playing house
If two can do it, you can do it too

I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no
I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no

I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no
I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no

I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no
I'm fine on the shelf
She really loved him, I couldn't see it though
He really loved her, but I don't believe it oh no

Pained and intense, man
They were inquiring.
They were curious orange...
They rode over peasants like you, they rode over peasants like you,
And their horses loved them too, and their horses loved them too.
They Were Kurious Orange. They Were Curious Orange.
They built the world as we know it, all the systems you traverse.
Rode slipshod over all dumbshits.
They were curious orange...

They freed the Blacks too.
They built church in one day, man,
Amish
They were curious orange...
Their clothes were cool.
Paved way for atom bomb--didn't know.
They made the Jews go to school.
They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They sent missionary girls to Arab states, and the sun-baked men
did drool.
They were curious orange...

They made Hitler laugh in pain.
They turned Napoleon over and didn't know.
They invented birth control
They were invulnerable to cool.
They were curious orange

They were beyond Ooobenblief
They were primo efficient to a man.
They were Stuyvestant smoking.
They were the Reformation spring
And everybody in the world turned Reformation blue.
They were invulnerable to cool
And everybody in the world...
And they were inquiring.
They were positively deranged and they were curious orange.
They were curious orange...

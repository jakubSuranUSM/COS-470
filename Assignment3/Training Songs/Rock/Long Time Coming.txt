Tore it up and walked away 
Why'd you wanna go do that for? 
Threw your Lego in the lake 
Why'd you wanna go do that for? 

And your a long time coming 
A long time coming home. 
Do you see me reeling 
Off the lines I've seen your 
I've seen your eyes. 

How can you grow old you were my triumph 
How can you grow old you were my triumph 

Turn your face into the squall. 
Why'd you wanna go do that for? 
You carved your name into the wall 
Why'd you wanna go do that for? 

And your a long time coming 
A long time coming home. 
Do you see me reeling 
Off the lines I've seen your 
I've seen your eyes. 

How can you grow old you were my triumph 
How can you grow old you were my triumph 

But your a long time coming 
A long time coming home. 
Do you see me reeling 
Off the lines I've seen your 
I've seen your eyes. 

How can you grow old you were my triumph 
How can you grow old you were my triumph 

But your a long time coming 
A long time coming home. 

Been a long time coming

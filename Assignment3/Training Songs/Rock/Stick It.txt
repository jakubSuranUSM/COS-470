The old man told me "Hey you! Make a choice.
You can the music and stop all the noise,
Or you can get out and find your own way!"
I told him "Stick it." My rock's here to stay.
No. No. I can't live without it
No. No. It just ain't the same
No. No. Ain't no doubt about it
So rock me again!
I want to roll it and burn it all night
Me and my Chevy don't stop for no lights
Crankin' the metal, blastin' the plant
They want to catch me, betcha they can't!
I'm out on the road, and I'm rockin'!
Stick it!
I'm out on the road, there's no stoppin'
I'm out on the road and I'm rockin'
I'm out on the road and I'm gone.

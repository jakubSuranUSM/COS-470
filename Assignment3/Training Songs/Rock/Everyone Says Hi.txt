Said you'd took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly, they say

Should've took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame, something cheap
For you
Everyone says hi

Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say

I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good and it's not too hot
For you

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says

Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
(Doo wap wap wha oo)
We can do all the bad things
(Doo wap wap)
If the food gets too eerie
You can always phone home
We could do all the good things
(Doo wap wap wha oo)
We could do it, we could do it, we could do it
(Doo wap wap oooo)

Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
(Everyone says hi)
And the girl next door
(Everyone says hi)
And the guy upstairs
(Everyone says hi)
Everyone says hi
(Everyone says hi)
And your mum and dad
(Everyone says hi)
Everyone says hi
(Everyone says hi)
And your big fat dog
(Everyone says hi)
Everyone says hi
(Everyone says hi)
Everyone says

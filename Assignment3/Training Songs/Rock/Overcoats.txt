Well I wandered in 
To the house of mirrors 
With a camera and an old shotgun 
I was taking some pictures 
Of me and my fears 
And exploding them one by one 
When all of a sudden 
Much to my surprise 
A lady with a fine tooth comb 
Struck a match up to my face 
And said, "Get out of this place 
You better leave the ugly truth alone" 

[Chorus] 
Overcoats 
Overcoats 
I ain't never heard you sing 
Overcoats 
Overcoats 
Take off that silly thing 

Well, I looked her in the eye 
With a slave-like stare 
And said, "I'm here to talk about the rent" 
Well, she did a double flip 
Then she buttoned up her lip 
Went and hid in the oxygen tent 
Well the image shriveled up 
And the air got thin 
As she smiled from behind her mask 
She said, "You can stay here all night 
But it's gonna cost you your life 
If I was you, I would be leaving fast." 

[Chorus]

I didn't come for information 
No I've read the daily news 
It's carved on everybody's face 

But I'm without illumination 
Yes, I think we blew a fuse 
And I'd be much obliged 
If you could help me locate the place 

Well at this, she seemed quite baffled 
And like a little girl 
She took off her wedding gown 
Then she stood before the mirror 
And it all came clear 
She was married to the lost and found 

So I left her there sleeping 
In her honeymoon 
And I made it through the antidote 
Well the procedure is brief 
If you want to see what's underneath 
You gotta take off that overcoat 

Overcoats 
Overcoats 
I ain't never heard you sing

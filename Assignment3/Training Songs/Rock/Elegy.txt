Long evenings full on longing
Low-spirited my mornings
Full of longing too my nights
And all times the bitterest
'Tis my lovely I long for
It is my darling I miss
My black-browed one I grieve for

Beneath the grass my treasure
Under the sand my sweet one
Beneath the grass my treasure
Under the sand my sweet one

There's no hearing my treasure
No seeing my marten-breat
No hearing her in the lane
Driving below the window
Chopping the wood by the stack
Clinking outside the cook-house
In the earth my berry lies

Beneath the grass my treasure
Under the sand my sweet one
Beneath the grass my treasure
Under the sand my sweet one

Long
Evenings full on longing
Low
Spirited my mornings
Full of longing 
Too my nights
And all times 
The bitterest

There's 
No hearing my treasure
No seeing 
My marten-breat
No hearing 
Her in the lane
Driving below 
The window
Chopping the wood 
By the stack
Clinking outside 
The cook-house
In the earth 
My berry lies

In the soil 
She's moldering
Under the sand 
My sweet one
Beneath the grass
My treasure
The one 
I grieve for

Words and music by John Kay and Michael Wilk
It used to be when things weren't right
I do my share and join the fight
And would surely stand and speak my mind
Then I got lost along the way
I spent my time chasing my own tail
But I am here to say: I'm back to stay
For I've been searching for the man I used to be
I found him waiting, alive and well
And he was screaming back at me

"Rise and Shine, show your color
Now's the time, raise your hand
Rise and Shine, join your brother
Draw the line, take a stand"

I told my friend my change of heart
He wished me well with my new start
But then he turned away and slowly said:
"You know this world is such a mess
I'm tired of trying to help, I guess"
I said: "well, what you give is what you'll get
Somewhere inside you, lives the fighter I once knew
The battle's raging, it's never over
It's calling me, it's calling you"

"Rise and Shine, show your color
Now's the time, raise your hand
Rise and Shine, join your brother
Draw the line, take a stand"

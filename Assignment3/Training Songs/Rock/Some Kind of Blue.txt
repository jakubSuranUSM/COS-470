Sunny day, two people walking 
On and on, the way lovers do 
Looking back, I see them talking 
So many things remind me of you 

I always thought we'd be together 
I never dreamed we'd drift apart 
Here I am, driving home to no one 
To spend the night with my broken heart 

I'm some kind of blue without you 
Don't know what to do about you 
From the minute you said we were through 
I've been some kind of blue 

I lay in bed, and stare at the ceiling 
I think of you walking out the door 
I can't describe the sadness I'm feeling 
I guess your love don't live here no more 

I'm some kind of blue without you 
Don't know what to do about you 
It's out of my hands, you made other plans 
But, I'm still in love with you 

And, I'm some kind of blue 
Sunny day, two people walking 
On and on, the way lovers do 
Hand in hand, I find them talking 
So many things, remind me of you 
[Repeat 1st chorus]

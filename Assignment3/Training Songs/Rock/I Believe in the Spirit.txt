I believe in the spirit,
I believe in the holy ghost,
I believe in the message,
The message isn't a media,

I believe in all a stand and fall,
I believe in get up for the poor,
No emotions, no voices for the choir,
I know my faith will turn the flame into the fire,

I believe in the city,
I believe in the west coast,
I believe in no limit,
I still believe in miracles,

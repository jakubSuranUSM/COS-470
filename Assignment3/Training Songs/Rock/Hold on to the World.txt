So I've been waiting for the fall,
I've been waiting for the crash,
Wait a minute Mr. Man,
Can't you see this is the end,
But this is no goodbye. (No way man, no no)

And I've been calling out your name,
Oh at least a million times.
So wait a minute Mr. Vain,
You got caught up in the game,
But I am still around, I will stay around.

Until you see me, you hear me,
Till you reach out and feel me.
I can't discover why my love was never healing,
I can't discover why all you do is suffer,
You've got to keep holding on,
You see the worst, but I want the best.

[Chorus]
Hold the line,
For every single ray of light.
You've got to hold on,
You've got to hold on.
Read the signs,
In every truth, in every lie,
You've got to hold on.

I'd like to thank you very much,
You overrated little prick.
And I'd like to tell you this much baby,
I want you to be here another day.
For I'll be calling out your name.
So wait a minute Mr. Saint,
For we are heading for the end,
So this will be goodbye. (This gonna be goodbye right? Goodbye!)

Until you trust me, you hear me.
Till you learn not to fear me,
I can't believe the fact that you're only out to hurt me.
I can't discover why all you do is suffer,
You've got to keep holding on,
You see the worst, but I need the best.

[Chorus]

To the world.

"Martin Luther King speak, Dinand"

[Chorus]

You've got to hold on to the world.
You've got to hold on to the world.
Have mercy, mercy, mercy,
And everything's gonna be alright
And everything's gonna be alright

You seem to circle miles above me 
Never hearing any word that I say 
Eyes reeling from deadly pleasure 
The last second don't count anyway 
Without the safety net you're freed 
To find serene pleasure of speed 

A blur of beauty, intoxicating
Existence outstripped, outshined 
Head clear cold chassis shaking 
Encounter of body and mind 
Erupting violent machine 
Precise exultance so serene 

Poised between risk and calculation 
In a kind of wide-awake alert daze 
Pretty pirouette accelerating 
Beyond living in so many ways 
Without the safety net you're freed 
To find serene pleasure of speed 
Erupting violent machine 
Precise exultance so serene

It's not enough to hear me say you've won,
You only wanted me for havin' fun.
But now I think you've gone and had your way,
And left me with a pile of bills to pay.
I can't even rewind the tape machine,
To listen to your drunken reasoning.

So here it is, your final lullaby:

So goodnight, goodnight.
You're embarrassing me,
You're embarrassing you.
So goodnight, goodnight.
Walk away from the door,
Walk away from my life.
So goodnight.

I've given up on social niceties,
I threw 'em out when I threw out your keys.
Along with all your records I can't stand;
You never even listened to any one of them.
You're never gonna drag me out again,
With all the people that were never ever even your friends.

So here it is, your final lullaby:

So goodnight, goodnight.
You're embarrassing me,
You're embarrassing you.
So goodnight, goodnight.
Walk away from the door,
Walk away from my life.

A little bit of rain I'd say is fair,
But when it starts a thundering I'm scared.
This isn't goodnight, this is goodbye

So goodnight, goodnight.
You're embarrassing me,
You're embarrassing you.
So goodnight, goodnight.
Walk away from the door,
Walk away from my life.

So goodnight, goodnight.
You're embarrassing me,
You're embarrassing you.
So goodnight, goodnight.
Walk away from the door,
Walk away from my life.
So goodnight.

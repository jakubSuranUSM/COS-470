You're on a break and need a space
Is that the story
You see the world to go at late
Not to worry

You always know your home 
We are one, madly
Whatever we do hoo hoo
This much is true
We are one, so madly
Whatever comes to you
This much is true

The ways we are that keeps me up
Wikes in white noise
Sas the door I watch the clock
And how it all

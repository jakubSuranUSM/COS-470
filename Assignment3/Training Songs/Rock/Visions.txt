Visions of you in shades of blue  Smoking, drifting, lazely drifting  My darling, I miss you so     Time goes by, no wonder my  Senses go reeling, your eyes appealing  I see the whole night through     When will we meet again  When, when, when  When will we meet again  When, when, when     I remember the days, beautiful days  Tenderly gleaming, my whole life seeming  To start and end with you     (Visions of you in shades of blue)  (Smoking) Smoking (Shifting) Shifting  (Lazely drifting)  Mmm, my darling, I miss you so     When will we meet again  When, when, when  When will we meet again  When, when, when     I remember the days, beautiful days  Tenderly gleaming, my whole life seeming  To start and end with you  To start and end with yousd

I had to leave you and go away
But I think about you everyday
And in the morning and the afternoon
I wish that I could see you soon

And when I held you I felt so fine
It was like there was nothing left on my mind
It was like Rockaway Beach in the month of June
I wish that I could see you soon

I had no plans to meet you baby
I had a million things to do baby
But you hit my heart with a harpoon
I wish that I could see you soon

The angels go "how long 'til you can see her?"
And I'm like "the sooner the better"
"Do you really think she will wait for you?"
"Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do
Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go!

Now listen, now that I am across the sea
I wonder if you're gonna wait for me
Or if you're gonna find a new boy to spoon
I wish that I could see you soon

And if you wait a little my pretty friend
Until I come back to hold your hand
We'll be like bugs when they break through a cocoon
You know, I wish that I could see you soon

It's been a while since I felt like this
Now I found someone I really miss
Under the sun, under the moon
I wish that I could see you soon

Angels "how long 'til you can see her?"
And I'm like "the sooner the better"
Angels "do you really think she will wait for you?"
And I'm like "there's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go!

Angels again "how long 'til you can see her?"
I'm like "well, the sooner the better"
"Do you really think she will wait for you?"
And I'm like "there's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
No way to say and there's nothing I can do
Well, no way to say and there's nothing I can do
No way to say and there's nothying I can do"

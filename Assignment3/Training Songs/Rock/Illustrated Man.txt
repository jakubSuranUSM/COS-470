He's the illustrated man, baby
He's got tattoos everywhere
People love his decorations
They just have to stop & stare

Got the Mona Lisa on his cheek
the Van Gogh on his nose
Got naked women all over him
From his head down to his toes

Got a screamin' demon on his chest
Cat face on his thigh
He's a walkin' wonder box
Until the day he dies

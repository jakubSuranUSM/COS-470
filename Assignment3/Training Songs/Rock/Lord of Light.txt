The elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Of lines that match across the world
For travel which no man has ever heard

The moon that shines its beam so bright
Of stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year

A day shall come, we shall be as one
Perhaps the dying has begun
From the realms beyond the sun
Here our lifetime has begun

The elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Of lines that match across the world
For travel which no man has ever heard

The moon that shines its beam so bright
Of stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year

The elements that gather here
Upon this hill shall cast no fear
Of lines that match across the world
For travel which no man has ever heard

The moon that shines its beam so bright
Of stones that measure the silvery light
Of energy that travels here
It happens on the seventh year

A day shall come, we shall be as one
Perhaps the dying has begun
From the realms beyond the sun
Here our lifetime has begun

I don't know where
I'm gonna live
Don't know if I'll find a place
I'd have to think about it some
Amd that I do not wish to face
I guess that I'm counting on his
Divine intervention

I cannot understand my god
I don't know why it gets to me
One day my life
Is filled with joy
And then we find we disagree
All depending on his
Divine intervention

Alright
We're all counting on his...

Does he love us?
Does he love us?
Does he love us?
Does he love us?
Hmm now he love us?
I look around
And all I see is destruction
We're all counting on his
Divine intervention

When he comes the sun shine
When he comes the sun shine
Sunshine, the sunshine
Here it comes...

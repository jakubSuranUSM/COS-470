Hey little one, you look so sad
Are you here tonight alone?
Well, I'm the one who'll make you glad
So won't you come along

Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby, cry
Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby
(Don't cry, baby)

It really doesn't matter what's your name
I can see myself in you
Maybe together we'll start to aim
This could be a dream come true

Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby, cry
Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby
(Don't cry, baby)

I overheard you talking in the corner
Something's gotten under your skin
Well, I don't care what it is
I wanna be your friend

We don't have to stay here any longer
Anyway there's nothing here to do
So dry your eyes I'll be good to you
What have you to lose

Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby, cry
Don't cry, baby, cry
Don't cry my baby
(Don't cry, baby)
(Don't cry, baby)

I overheard you talking in the corner
Something's gotten under your skin
Well, I don't care what it is
I wanna be your friend

Don't cry my baby, cry
Cry my baby
Don't cry my baby, cry
Cry my baby, cry

Cry my baby
Don't cry my baby
Don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

If I was a cradle then you'd let me rock 
If I was a pony then you'd let me trot 
If I was the atom then you'd split me into three 
But when I want to see you, baby 
How come you lock your door on me?

If I was a baby you wouldn't let me fall 
If I was an outlaw you wouldn't have me caught 
If I was a tiger you wouldn't have me caged 
If I was somebody else you would act your age

You'll miss out if you leave me out of your day and night 
I will try to make you see and hear what I got to say 
It's all about me and you, alright

If I was a blind man then you'd make me see 
If I was a deaf man you'd give me hears to hear 
If I was a lame man you'd give me legs to walk 
But if you were true to me, baby 
You would listen when I talk

If I was a cradle then you'd let me rock 
If I was a pony then you'd let me trot 
If I was the atom then you'd split me into three 
But when I want to see you, baby 
How come you lock your door on me?

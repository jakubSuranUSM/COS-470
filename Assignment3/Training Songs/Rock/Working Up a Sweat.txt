Aw, when you touch there, honey
Makes my blood perspire
You got my body flaming
Like a California fire
Pulsing, pounding, pushing
No longer in control
Heatwave in my brain
Smolder in my soul

You got me workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
I've been playing all night long
Time I was gettin' home
But I've got no place to get

Spontaneous combustion
Scientific fact
But your approach to friction
An unnatural act
Bells I hear ain't fire drills
I hope you understand
It's a bona fide five alarmer
Melting in my hand

You got me workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
I've been playing all night long
Time I was gettin' home
But I've got no place to get

Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Yeah, yeah

I've been playing all night long
'Bout time I was gettin' home
But I've, oh...

Dante's famed inferno
Was a trip to hell and back
But you, and a bottle, in a cheap hotel
Screams pyromaniac
Bandages came off today
Really feeling sick
The hardest part's explainin'
All those blisters on my nose!

Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
I've been playing all night long
Time I was gettin' home
But I've got no place to get

Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat

I've been playing all night long
'Bout time I was gettin' home
But I've, oh...

Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat
Workin' up a sweat

You said enough, you said too much.
You focus solely on her touch, and halcyon.
In arguments set in stone
In promises of what was once, you come undone.

If you take this away, I'll fade to black and disappear.
If it's all a state of mind.

Give me something I can believe in
What you say doesn't say that you mean it
If I'm wrong well at least I know better
Give me something I can believe in
It's in your hands.

No more, no causes and effects
No looking back and then regret
Of halcyon.

And I know I know I tried too much
All the time I waste, yeah I'm losing touch,
All the time

If you take this away, I'll fade to black and disappear.
If it's all a state of mind.

Give me something I can believe in
What you say doesn't say that you mean it
If I'm wrong well at least I know better
Give me something I can believe in
It's in your hands.

Give me something I can believe in
What you say doesn't say that you mean it
If I'm wrong yeah at least I know better
Give me something I can believe in
It's in your hands.

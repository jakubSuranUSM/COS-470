Have you seen her smile ? 
Doesn't it just make you want to cry ?
And inside it's breaking me for you someday.

In her eyes
I've seen a life that's went before
But those past tears
Don't matter much when we're alone

We were stood on gold
Just weren't told
We grow old

All in time
And all in time I've seen before
I just can't hold her
And now I know her deep black eyes

I need your sweet, sweet love
I need it in my heart
I know I've taken
And to give to you I can find so hard

We were stood on gold
Just weren't told
We grow old

And now I realize you've gone away
I'm hoping you'll come back to me someday
A light's been shining on for you
This light's been shining on for you

Ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, ooh

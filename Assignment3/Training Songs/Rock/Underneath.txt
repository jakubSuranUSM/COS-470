Even in my darkest times
Overcome with worry
Find the comfort in the storm
No reason to be sorry
Look inside for a place to hide
All around the faithless wait full of expectations
They will never see the beauty in the imperfections
The more I show
The less they know

Out of reach
Underneath
Learned to breath
Underneath
Something inside of me
Invisible turning the fragile
Unbreakable
But they cannot take away
They cannot take away
What I believe
You cannot take away
Cannot take away
What's underneath

Every little cut runs deep
Masked in my tomorrow
Bringing wisdom that I need for all the time I borrow
My other side is left behind

Out of reach
Underneath
Learned to breath
Underneath
Something inside of me
Invisible turning the fragile
Unbreakable
But they cannot take away
They cannot take away
What I believe
You cannot take away
Cannot take away
What's underneath

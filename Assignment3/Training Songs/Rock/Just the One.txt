Do you fancy a drink,
Just the one,
To clear your head,
We won't be long.
It's a beautiful day,
To waste away,
There's plenty of time,
For another one.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

Make mine a short,
I'm getting there,
But where that is,
I couldn't care.
There must be something I haven't tried,
Perhaps that bottle before my eyes.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why, 
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

Through the haze,
The sun goes down,
It's getting late,
Let's hit the town.
Call some friends, 
To paint it red,
And feed the animal,
In your head.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

They throw you out,
You hit the night,
You go to a club,
You feel alright.
You get a pill,
You take just half,
Then take the rest of it,
For a laugh.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

Across the floor,
You think you see,
The one in your dreams,
Your fantasy.
But that last drink,
Has made you blind,
You need the bar,
But it's hard to find.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

There's a brand new game,
You want to try,
You line them up,
And it's the first to die.
You think you've won,
But it's time to leave,
And back to yours,
For a cup of tea.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

When you find your keys,
And you all fall in,
You spend an hour,
In search of skins.
When all seems lost,
And it's looking grim,
You find the bottle,
Of Christmas gin.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why, 
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

The rest is blank,
And that's the worst,
An empty head,
For an empty purse.
You had a laugh,
So you think,
But in the morning,
You just stink.

You know you shouldn't do it,
But you see no reason why,
So you blow your mind,
Yeah, yeah,
Uh-ha.

So you fancy a drink,
Just the one,
To clear your head,
We won't be long

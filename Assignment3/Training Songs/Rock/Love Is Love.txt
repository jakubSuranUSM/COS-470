Checkin' out the sand streets
Of this island town
Got my cold Dos Equis
Watchin' women brown
They call it Paradiso
It looks like paradise
And it's looking better all the time

Now I'm dancin' in the moonlight
The party's everywhere
It's all a sweet seduction
To the rhythm in the air
Local girls are talkin'
I hear their bodies say 
This boy won't be leavin' lonely

It's je t'aime, it's amore
Te quiero, mi chica
If it's good you'll get the message
It's je t'aime, it's amore
Eu te amo
Love is love in any language

She caught my intention
When I caught her eye
We just started movin'
Never askin' why
Faded into passion
That girl and I
Love is love in any language

Let your heart talk to the girl
Love can take you 'round the world

Aloha wau in oe
If it's good you get the message
Love is love in any language

Nakupenda mno sana sana
When it's good you get the message
Aku chinta kamu
Love is love in any language

Ich liebe dich, mein fraulein
If it's good you get the message
Love is love in any language

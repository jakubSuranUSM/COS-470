Great Dane's cheekbones,
Teenage hormones,
Young complexion,
Non-physical affection.
You're a god send;
Do you want a boyfriend?
Crazy crazy, easy tiger!

Her mind's made up, she don't wanna go steady,
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready.
A-M-A-N-D-A Norgaard,
I saw you on a cover on Cross Bay Boulevard.

Smaller tits
And skinny framework,
Tall, sharp hips
And you're all in the same work.
Giving me the sweet talk,
Walking down the catwalk.
I want a mannequin!
But she won't let me in

Her mind's made up, she don't wanna go steady,
She's only seventeen so she's probably not ready.

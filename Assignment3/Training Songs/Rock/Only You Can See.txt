Tell me what to say and I'll write a book today
About our love dear, oh
People try to talk to me and they tell me who I ought to be
Today dear, ooh, ooh
Only you can see
That I love you
That I love you, ooh
Tell me what to think, and I'll fix myself a drink
To drink to you dear, oh no, no
Why am I so ill at ease--don't people get down on their knees
For me, dear
Girl, only you understand
Hold my hand
Hold my hand
Oh, only you can see
That I love you
Yeah, that I love you

Oh Hallelujah, what I said to the stars
Every night that I thought you might have crashed your car
Oh Hallelujah, what I said to myself 
Every day that I thought you might have fucked someone else

And how I love when you smile at me 
With those fangs that you show for teeth
You said I was full of shit but what's wrong with that?
Shopping malls and mothballs
Two figure eights and a couple of dates
Broken dreams, broken knees

Love is forever
But sometimes death seems better
Cigarettes and regrets
Late night drives and the rest of our lives
Simple plans made romance
Death is forever
Sometimes love is better

Leave the TV on, to fill the empty air
Loneliness sinks in, like ink into my skin
I should have seen it all, the climb before the fall
I held to what we shared, but now it's disappearedâ?¦

By now, I guess you don't need me anymore
Alright, you know, you don't fool me anymore
Tonight, you're burning another fire

Now we've run out of time, out of luck, out of everything
Now you're gone, gone to find what you need, what I don't provide
And if it comes down, between win or lose
If it comes down, you know I'd have to choose

By now, I guess you don't need me anymore
Alright, you know, you don't fool me anymore
Tonight, you're burning another fire

My life, my dreams, out love has come to nothingâ?¦

It's come to nothing

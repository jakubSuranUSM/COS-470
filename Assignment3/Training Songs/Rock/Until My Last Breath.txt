Cannot cry it loud enough, I'm giving up this ghost
How can I still justify, when you deny my voice?
In this nothing I am not allowed, I just follow alone
Words as weapons without a sound, echoes dying unborn

Until my last breath you'll never know
Until you feel the silence when I am gone
Now is vanishing, everything
What we might have been
only now you praise, call my name that you won't see again

Who can change this memory, inside it needs to burn
Worship by the enemy, the guilty take their turns
Watching as it's disappearing, shadows all that remain
Wishes slowly crossing over in this parade of pain

Until my last breath you'll never know
Until you feel the silence when I am gone
Now is vanishing, everything
What we might have been
only now you praise, call my name that you won't see again

Come dance with me
Out of our heads
Escaping the coffin
We're waking up the dead

Come dance with me
Birth through the mud
I'm dying to get you
These bones are all that's left.
Bone, bone, bones

Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Make a boy out of me!
Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Make a boy out of me!

Come dance with me
The dead don't breathe
Kiss of life freely given
How long was I asleep?
Lift up your dress,
Give me your lips,
Dance the dead into living
Your love is killing me

Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Make a boy out of me!
Emily come to bed,
Emily come to bed,
Make a boy out of me!

La petite mort pour toujours!
La petite mort pour toujours!
La petite mort pour toujours!
La petite mort
Come, come, dance, come, dance with me!
Come, come, come, come, come, come dance!
Make a boy, make a boy, Emily, Emily!

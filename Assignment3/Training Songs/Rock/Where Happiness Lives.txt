Well it was last October, on a Tuesday night
When she said, (f*ck you it's over) you and me are over if you're getting high tonight

So he went straight down the white line, & let a good thing down
It wasn't driving her crazy, it drove her right out of town

But there's a million miles to go,
To where happiness lives

He'll put his mind in detention, & let his heart decide
To try & catch her attention, he's got to catch a ride,
Use the last of the powder that lets him push ahead,
Move at the speed of lightning, & leave the miles for dead

But there's a million miles to go,
To where happiness lives

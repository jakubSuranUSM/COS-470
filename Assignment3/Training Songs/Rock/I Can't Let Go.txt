I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
Feel so bad baby, ooh, it hurts me 
When I think of how you love and desert me
I'm the broken hearted toy you play with, baby
 
I can't let go, baby
I'm . . . I'm hung on you
Baby, I . . . I can't let go
Though I'm just one of your lovers
And I know there are so many others
You do something strange to me, baby, baby
 
You got me goin', I need you baby
I can't let go, and I want you baby
I gotta have you you know
And I can't let go
Though I'm just one of your lovers
And I know there are so many others
You do something strange to me, baby, baby
I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on
 
You got me goin', I need you baby
I can't let go, and I want you baby
I gotta have you, you know
And I can't let go
Though I'm just one of your lovers
And I know there are so many others
You do something strange to me, baby, baby
I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on

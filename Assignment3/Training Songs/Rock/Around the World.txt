My corner, you'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
Gonna tag along, I'll set the way
And tried to get high
What price you gonna pay

Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)

Keep dancing, like it's your last time
We're so thin ice, swimming in delight
When the curtain falls, I'm on your scene
"What sweet surprise" she shared to me

Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
Take it all the way, take it all the way
All the way
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)

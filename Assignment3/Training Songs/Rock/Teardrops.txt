Teardrops will fall because of you
Teardrops will fall for only you.
I want you so

You'll never know how much I need you.
Teardrops will fall if you don't need me
Teardrops will fall

Please believe me.
I want you so

You'll never know how much I need you.
As long as there's a moon above
There will be the two of us.
If you and I were meant to be
Tell me you love me and I'll be your only.
Teardrops will fall
Don't run and hide
Teardrops will fall
Stay by my side.
I want you so

You'll never know how much I need you.
As long as there's a moon above

Teardrops will fall
Teardrops will fall.
Oh yeah
Teardrops will fall
Teardrops will fall.
Tear
Tear will fall
Teardrops will fall.

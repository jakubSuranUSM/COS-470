Maybe it's just a feeling, every time we meet
But you hit me right out of the blue from all those people out on the streets
And if one time you told me that you loved me - heaven knows
I would feel that I could ski right off the bridge of your pretty nose
This could be my destination
This could be my destination

And if one time you told me that you cared for me
You would renovate my soul

This could be my destination
This could be my destination
Play some guitar now

You could be my
You might be my
You must be my
Final destination

This could be my destination
You must be my destination
Know what I mean
In the day time
In the night time
In the summertime
In the wintertime

About any time
For all time
Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine
Till the end of time

You know I've tried to cool it
I've been trying to settle down
But when I think I'm made it
It drives me crazy
Well, I'm staying on the wild side
Always hit the higher ground
Nothing I do
Could amaze me

I'm so restless, so restless
You know it's too late now
Too late now, too late now
Too late now...

Well I've always been outrageous
But a change has gotta come
Making up my mind
Was never easy
I was born to late to love you
The day will never come
It's love that I need
So don't tease me

I'm so restless, so restless
You know it's too late now
Too late now, too late now
Too late now...

I'm so restless, so restless
I gotta say it's too late now
Too late now, too late now
Too late now...
I gotta say ya too late now
Too late now, too late now
Too late now...

Call me when you want me, babe
Call me when you need me, any time at all
I've got nothing but time and I'm here

Time in my heart for you
Nothing but time in my heart for you

Call me if you're feeling blue
Call me and I'll come to you, any time
I've got nothing but time and I'm here

Time in my heart for you
Nothing but time in my heart for you

Babe, all of the places I go
People I see, things that I do
You know it gets lonely at times

But I love being here
And it's so much more with you

Call me in my daytime, babe
Call me in my night time, any time at all
I've got nothing but time and I'm here

I've got time in my heart for you
Nothing but time in my heart for you

Call me if you want me, babe
Call me if you need me, any time at all
I've got nothing but time and I'm here

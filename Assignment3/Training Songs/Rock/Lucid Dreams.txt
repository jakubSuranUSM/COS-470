Sweep slides on my stereo
Short wave 'round my rodeo
Became from that of Savalon
But I'm flying to Istanbul

Oh so why don't you meet me, there?

There is no nation of you
There is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in Lucid Dreams
Lucid Dreams I'm living in Lucid Dreams
I'm living on short based dreams tonight

I'll dial Alexandria
If you dial into Ithaca
South fisher, German bite
I skate on the world tonight

Oh so why don't you come along?
There is no nation of you
There is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in Lucid Dreams
Lucid Dreams
I'm living in Lucid Dreams
I'm living on short based dreams tonight

I'm gonna give my aimless love
My angry heart
My desire
I woke with wings from Lucid Dreams
I knew the reason I felt hollow
Was it I may never know
If there is some great truth or not

There is no nation of you
There is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in Lucid Dreams
Lucid Dreams
I'm living in Lucid Dreams

I'm living in a short wave stream tonight
Lucid dreams
I'm living on lucid dreams
Now there is just plain myster

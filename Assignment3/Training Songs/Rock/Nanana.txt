In this grey grey world where nobody sings
I saw the face of a human doll
Her eyes were glass and her hair was gold
From her sweet soft lips you could hear that song go

Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana

In a place where hell is around the corner
I touched her hand it was baby sweet
She kissed me there I could feel the song going down my throat
She was singing to me

Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana

My daddy said if you wanna live you'd better not touched it's not a toy
The truth is boy I'm a bloody fool I left the one that I loved behind singing

Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana

Tell me what it is 
That brings me back to you
Tell me what it is 
I can't stop loving you

Tell me what it is 
That brings me back to you
Tell me what it is 
I can't stop loving you 

So take me back to the land of yours 
Where the black swan loves the one I lost
My generation sings with the radio on
The melody of the human doll

Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana

Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana
Nanana-nana nanana-nana nanana-nana nana nana

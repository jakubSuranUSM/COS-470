You don't have to
Tell me what to do
I've seen you, oh my love
With ladies on both sides
You don't have to 
Excuse yourself
Oh you don't have to 
Explain yourself

No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah
No lies
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah

One foot on the right
Other on the left
You soon have to deside
What about my life
I've got a thousand friends inside my heart
But I'm not to play around
Singin' like a doll

No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah
No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah

It's lonely tonight
You're not here to talk to
You're not, you're not around
You're not here to talk to

No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah
No lies
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah

No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah
No lies!
I want no lies from you-ooh-ooh yeah yeah

No lies!
I want no lies from you yeah yeah
Not from you

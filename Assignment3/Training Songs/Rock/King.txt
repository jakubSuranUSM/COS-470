Follow your heart
Follow your feet, your soul
Follow your dreams wherever they go
And never slow down
And find someone to share within
And then never let them go

Hold me close, closer than ever before
Just love me like you won't let go
With all that I know, and all that I am
Just love me like you won't let go

We light up the dark
You light up my streets with gold
Follow your dreams wherever they go
And never slow down
And find someone to share within
And then never let them go

Hold me close, closer than ever before
Just love me like you won't let go
With all that I know, and all that I am
Just love me like you won't let go

And if you take away everything
Just you in my arms, I feel like a king
When I am holding you close
I love you like I won't let go

And if you strip away everything
Just you in my arms, I feel like a king
Holding you close
I love you like I won't let go

Hold me close, closer than ever before
Just love me like you won't let go
With all that I know, and all that I am
Baby just love me like you won't let go

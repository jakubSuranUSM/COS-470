Feeling better
Since I surrendered
You can't climb
'Til you're ready to fall
Your not a land mine
Your not a gold mine
No you're not mine at all

So tell me baby
Can you hear me?
I sent a message out into the dark
It's a mystery
When your near me
I've gotta find my way to your heart

I learned my lesson
First impressions
More often right than wrong
It's not a slow dance
This modern romance
Feels like we've already waited to long

Don't worry baby
That how is should be
I sent a message out into the dark
I'd rather talk to you
About how it could be
I've gotta find my way to your heart

I was one of those
Breathing tornadoes
But now i live at the eye of the storm
And it's all faded
Then since the separation
Since I let your love keep me warm

You tell me baby
That you can feel me
I sent a message out into the dark
When I kiss you
That's the real me
I've gotta find my way to your heart

So tell me baby
Can you hear me
I sent a message out into the dark
It's a mystery
When your near me
I've gotta find my way to your heart [Repeat: x3]

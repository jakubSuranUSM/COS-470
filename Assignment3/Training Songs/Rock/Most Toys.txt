But he who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

You have to be cool
You have to be hip
You have to be chic
You have to be rich
You have to be young
Whatever that is
You have to listen to what's in & what's happenin'

But
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

You have to keep up
Take the right drugs
Know when to be cagey
Know when to shut up
You have to talk fast
Know who to thank
Drive the right car to the right bank

But
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

Poison your life
As you turn the knife

He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

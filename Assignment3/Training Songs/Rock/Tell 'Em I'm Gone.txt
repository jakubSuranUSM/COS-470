Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Tell 'em I'm gone
Tell 'em I'm gone

If he asks you was I runnin'
If he asks you was I runnin
If he asks you was I runnin'
Tell 'em I was flyin'
Tell 'em I was flyin'

If he asks you was I laughin'
If he asks you was I laughin'
If he asks you was I laughin'
Tell 'em I was cryin'
Tell 'em I was cryin'

I don't want no cornbread and molasses
I don't want no cornbread and molasses
I don't want no cornbread and molasses
Hurts my pride
Hurts my pride

Take this hammer, and carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, and carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, and carry it to the captain
Tell 'em I'm gone
You tell 'em I'm gone

Well it came from the water with a black heart, oh my god
And fell like a sunset sinking in a fever
Well it held my hand, no, it had me by the throat
We were coming down as the sun was just coming up

I went walking on the devil's time
With nothing but shadow from the other side

Now don't save my soul
I'll take my chances on these winding roads
I'll go wherever the wild wind blows
'Cause if I'm gonna die, I wanna die an old ghost

When they found by the water, I was sick and shivering
It was howling in the hills, you could hear it in the wind
Well it held my hand, no it had me by the throat
We were coming down as the stars were just coming up

I went walking on the devil's time
Oh, with nothing but shadow from the other side

Now don't save my soul
I'll take my chances on these winding roads
I'll go wherever the wild wind blows
'Cause if I'm gonna die, I wanna die an old ghost

Now don't save my soul
I'll take my chances on these winding roads
I'll go wherever the wild wind blows
'Cause if I'm gonna die, I wanna die an old ghost

I went walking on the devil's time
With nothing but shadow from the other side

Now don't save my soul
I'll take my chances on these winding roads
I'll go wherever the wild wind blows
'Cause if I'm gonna die, I wanna die an old ghost

Now don't save my soul
I'll take my chances on these winding roads
I'll go wherever the wild wind blows
'Cause if I'm gonna die, I wanna die an old ghost

I went walking on the devil's time
With nothing but a warm breeze blowing by and by

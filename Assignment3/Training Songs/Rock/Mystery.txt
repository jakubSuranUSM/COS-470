Come and sing a song
Something that belongs here
Come and calm your soul
Mystery is born here

Alive, alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive-o
Alive-o

Come and rest your bones
You look awful tired
Fall soft upon the thought
Mystery is born

Alive, alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive-o
Alive-o
And a good day is nothing that we thought
Finding out brings nothing that we sought
Oh please don’t stand a mood apart
You don’t need to break your heart

One day will teach us all a year will never know

Alive, alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive-o
Alive-o

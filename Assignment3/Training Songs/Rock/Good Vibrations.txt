I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And she's already workin' on my brain
I, I only look in her eyes
But I picked up somethin' I just can't explain
And I'm pickin' up

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations

Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)
Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)

I, I bet I know what she's like
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
It's weird how she can seem so strong
And I wonder what she's pickin' up from me
And I'm pickin' up

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations

Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)
Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)

I don't know where but she sends me there
What a sensation
What elation

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a happenin'

Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh

Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
(Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations are happenin' with her)
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh
(Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations are happenin' with her)
Hum dee daa, hum dee daa, ohh, ohh

Good, good, good, good vibrations
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me excitations)
Good good good, good vibrations
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)

Naa, naa, naa, naa, naa, naa, naa, naa

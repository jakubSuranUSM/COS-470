Took a boat over Lake Geneva
It was raining all night long
We were lucky and we saw no enemy
And came from Switzerland, poor refugees
Far from the guns of war
We said goodbye to it all

They brought us into a nurse's station
Half a mile behind the lines
Oh Lord, how my heart was breaking
To see the children, and the walking wounded
Hoping for a ticket home
And say goodbye to it all

I woke up on a cold blue morning
To see her there, standing right beside me
Long years since I left her at the borderline
And how she found me I'll never know
But we decided there and then
To say goodbye to it all

To it all
Say goodbye to it all
Say goodbye to it all

Took a train from Paris to the ocean
Found a small hotel by the coast
As we walked along the beaches of Normandy
We came to Juno, Omaha and Gold
And whispered a prayer for the boys
Who said goodbye to it all

Now we've got our own place by the water
And I have a job in the old hotel
She is ready and she's hoping for a daughter
Well I don't mind, we've made our choice
We've got all the time in the world
We said goodbye to it all
We said goodbye to it all

Bye to it all
Say goodbye to it all
Say goodbye to it all
Say goodbye to it all
Say goodbye to it all

Say goodbye

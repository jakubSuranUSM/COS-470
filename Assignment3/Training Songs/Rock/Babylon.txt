Now that the thrill of the massacre is over
Isn't it sweet when she sucks on your veins
I've waited so long

I roll back the stone just to see
What I'm missing
Glimpses of grandeur now faced with defeat
I've waited so long

Now that your kingdom of Babylon's fading
Where will you turn when you can't find
Your soul
I've waited so long

Salvation's at hand
It's a matter of taste dear
Lost in ideals that you found in the trash
I've waited so long

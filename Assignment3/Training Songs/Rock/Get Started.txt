We're running pretty fast, and we don't suffer fools
We can't get what we're looking for unless we break some rules
Time to change the view, exit same old scene
I'm going to take my money, play it all on red
I'm just getting started

I'm just getting started, just getting warmed up
Life's too short for slowing down, you ain't seen nothing yet

It's twenty years on and you still look good to me
The lines on our faces remind me of places we've been and the good times we've seen
I'm so in love with you, we're just picking up speed
Here's my promise, I'll be a better man, I'm just getting started
I'm just getting started here, I'm just getting going

Life's too short for slowing down, you ain't seen nothing
I'm just getting started here, I'm just getting warmed up
Yeah, got my motor revved and she's rolling, rolling, you ain't seen nothing

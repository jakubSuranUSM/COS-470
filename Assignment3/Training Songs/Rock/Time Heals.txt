If you're bleeding,
Then everyone can see you're bleeding
They can call for the doctor,
Who'll provide what the diagnosis says you're needing

Then he'll take away your pain
But if your heart,
Your heart has been broken
And you don't wear it on your sleeve

No one can tell,
Your hell goes unspoken
But there's one thing you must believe
Time heals the wounds no one can see
Time heals the wounds that no one can see

If you're crying
Then everyone can see you crying
And they all sympathize
But it just doesn't matter

Though they may be trying,
They can't feel the hurt inside
You can't go on,
You've gone to the limit

And your life seems to slip away
You're on your own
Alone you must face it
And tomorrow's so far away

You got to hold on baby
Got to give it time to heal
Time heals the wounds that no one can see
You must believe what they say is true
It do's wonders for ya, yeah, yeah

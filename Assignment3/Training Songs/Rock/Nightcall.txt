I'm giving you a nightcall
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dumped
But have no fear

There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
There's something inside you boy
But you're still the same

I'm giving you a nightcall
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dumped
But have no fear

There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
You're talking about you boy, but
You're still the same

Eh, yeah yeah
Tell you how
Tell you how
Tell you how, oh

I'm giving you a nightcall
To tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night
Down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something
You don't want to hear
I'm giving you a nightcall
To tell you how I feel and how I feel

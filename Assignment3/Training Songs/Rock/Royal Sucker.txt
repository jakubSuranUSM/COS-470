You don't tell me, you don't dare
Saying you lost time
You won't tell me, I know ifs hard
To keep your dream alive

Keep on talking about precious stones
About your navel in gold
Keep on fucking in beds of diamonds
Drinking 12 year's old

Keep on swallowing silver tongues
For your royal breakdowns
Keep on buying some brand new friends
Some like beautiful snow

No you ain't, no you ain't, no you ain't what you own
No you ain't, no you ain't, no you ain't what you own

Keep on killing your sweet innocence
Keep on sinking your hopes
Keep on turning blood into wine
Keep on keeping your smile

Keep on talking about precious stones
About your navel in gold
Keep on fucking in beds 0f diamonds
Drinking 12 year's old

No you ain't, no you ain't, no you ain't what you own
No you ain't, no you ain't, no you ain't what you own

what you own, what you own...

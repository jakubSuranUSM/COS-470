Have you ever felt like everybody’s watching
Waiting for you to lose
Have you ever felt like you’re living in a spot light
Searching for the real you
Tell me have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes
Getting hard to find a friend in a city like this
Where you can’t even trust a smile

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you’re feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don’t kick the chair
It’s gonna get better
Don’t kick the chair
It can only get better

Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You’re gonna have to say goodbye

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you’re feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don’t kick the chair
It’s gonna get better
Don’t kick the chair
It can only get better

Yep yep you know
If I can make it through then you can to
Yep yep I’m good focus like always
Feels like I’ve been hit hit hit by ten brick walls
Some people like just sit sit around and wait for you to fall
Then bounceback way quicker than you fell down
Laugh in their face like what
See nothing can break me
No no no no listen

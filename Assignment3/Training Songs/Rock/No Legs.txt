There's no wrong way to f*** a girl with no legs
Just tell her you love her as she's crawlin' away
There's no wrong way to f*** a bitch with no faith
Now you'll never be sad again

Lovin' you are the two best things in a world that's skipping town
Reaching blind into the deepest mouth in the brownest place around

There's something I miss in her cum stained lips
So I get the first kiss before she takes the last bite
Genital outlaws in a positive way, and in everything bagel too

Getting strangeld by the junkie priest as the boys get stoned in school
There's a knock at the door and your parents come in
They thought you were a different girl

So if you're alone when you're parents aren't home
And no one can see your incestuous tree
No need to contain what the sparrows can say
Now you'll never be sad again

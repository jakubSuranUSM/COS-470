I've got a picture lying face down on the table top that I haven't seen in years. The frame and glass were once a part of me that have slowly disappeared.  And I have been waiting for a long time, now don't keep me waiting. I've got a rough idea what this whole things all about, but I’m biting on my tongue so I don't turn into a bitter old man 'cos of things I’ve never done.  'Cos I have been waiting for a long time, don't keep me waiting. Take me back to the days I didn't know, I never ever agreed to let 'em go. Over my head, in the thick of it, smack bang in the middle of all of it.  Now I’ve got a picture lying face down on the table top that I haven't seen in years.  The frame and glass were once a part of me, but they slowly disappeared.  'Cos I have been waiting for a long time, don't keep me waiting. Take me back to the days I didn't know, I never ever agreed to let 'em go. Over my head, in the thick of it, smack bang in the middle of all of it. I tear myself away.  Feels alright in a teenage wasteland, never better. There's no point sending a letter. Take me back to the days I didn't know, I never ever agreed to let 'em go. Over my head, in the thick of it, smack bang in the middle of all of it. I have been waiting. I have been waiting. Don’t keep me waiting, don't keep me waiting. I've had a picture lying face down on the table top that I hadn't seen in years. The frame and glass were once a part of me, I won't let that disappear.

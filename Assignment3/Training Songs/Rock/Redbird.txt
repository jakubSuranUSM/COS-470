I saw the redbird fly
Bright flame against the sky
Burning against the sun,
Am I the only one?

I watched the rose unfold
Secrets we left untold
The rose, the red red rose,
Still nobody knows

I split the pomegranate
Restless until you've had it
Sweet against the tongue, am I the only one?

The blood red rubies of
Our sexuality

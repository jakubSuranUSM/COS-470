Well Johnny Mae And William J 
 Hitched a ride from sunny L.A. 
 With a soldier who'd gone AWOL Stockade bound 
 And they got off in the Texas rain 
 And they hopped a southern diesel train 
 Headed to Atlanta 
 My hometown 
 Where she danced all night 
 In a go-go bar 
 And he tried his best 
 To play bass guitar 
 In the absolute worst punk bar ever heard 
 Yeah, but she got tired of that Georgia clay 
 And a drunk musician 
 Who couldn't even play 
 So she took a bus to Boston 
 Without a word 
 He never got to say goodbye 
 And he has to wonder why 
 It keeps him up all night 
 The way she wore her hair 
 It keeps him up all night 
 Her voice is everywhere 
 It keeps him up all night 
 She's out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of her own 
 Well old Will kept makin' bad music worse 
 But the whiskey and the pills 
 Wouldn't quench his thirst no more 
 So he stuck a needle in his arm 
 Then he lost his band 
 He started liftin' shops 
 It didn't take long 
 To get cuffed by the cops 
 And right about now 
 He's workin' on the county farm 
 It's never easier to say goodbye 
 And she has to wonder why 
 It keeps her up all night 
 The way he held her hand 
 It keeps her up all night 
 He was her only man 
 It keeps her up all night 
 She's out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of her own 
 To get where you need to be 
 You'll go through anything 
 Yes, you will 
 And on your way to be free 
 You know, love is everything 
 Baby, love is everything 
 It keeps us up all night 
 Yes, love is everything 
 It keeps us up all night 
 Yes, love is everything 
 It keeps us up all night 
 We're out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of our own 
 It keeps us up all night 
 We're out there 
 Searchin' somewhere 
 For somethin' of our own 
 Yeah, keep on searchin you

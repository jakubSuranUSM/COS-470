Here she comes again 
It's funny how she keeps you hangin' around 
Acting out a scene that she has seen the night before 
To help her understand 
She keeps a picture in her hand 
Here she comes again 
Wearing all the wares she cares to hold 
She's at the open window with a blanket for a coat 
And laughing at your jokes 
But her words they only sound like shields, yeah 
I wonder what she's doing now 
Since I have seen her it's been so long 
Ah you've seen the way she is 
It's hard to keep a hold 
When she keeps you waiting in the road 
Here she comes again 
Mopping off the fever from your brow 
If only she'd believe you when you say that you're the one 
To keep her satisfied 
She just says you're making to much noise, yeah 
Constantly turning yourself in her circles 
And rolling yourself into a tight little ball 
You were thinking she could maybe reach a hand out to find you 
But someones got to hold up these walls 
Here she comes again 
Showing you the corner of a note 
Looking like a woman in the spotlight on the floor 
But when the day returns 
You see shes just a little girl 
Here she comes again 
Here she comes again 
Here she comes again

Hey big boss man
You're stuck in a groove
You're on a roller coaster
You'd better stop
You're gonna burn, burn, burn
You'll do it again

Pretty ballerina
Dance across the floor
She's got a head full of snow
What'd you do it for

She's gonna burn, burn, burn
She'll do it again
She's gonna burn, burn, burn
She'll do it again

Silver surfer
Do the belly flop
Check out Goldilocks
Listen to her cherry pop

She's gonna burn, burn, burn
She'll do it again
She's gonna burn, burn, burn
She'll do it again

Twenty killer hurts
Hold it right there

Twenty killer hurts
Rushing 'round my brain
I see adrenalin'
I feel it just the same

I'm gonna burn, burn, burn
I'll do it again
I'm gonna burn, burn, burn
And I always will
Just like this

Burn, burn, burn
Twenty killer hurts
Burn, burn, burn
Pretty badly now
Burn, burn, burn
Twenty killer, killer, killer hurts

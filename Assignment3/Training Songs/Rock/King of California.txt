Well, I left my home and my one true love
East of the Ohio River
My father said we'd never wed
For I had me no gold nor silver

But my darling dear, please shed no tears
But I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

Over deserts hot and mountains cold
I traveled the Indian country
Whispering your name under lonesome skies
Remembering my only company

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

I went up from Sacramento town
To the Sierra gold fields
And I worked my stake on a riverbank?
Dreaming just how a rich man feels

Now my darling dear, listen here
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

Now the dead man's lying at my feet
Who tried to steal my earnings
Yet I still recall your tender kiss
Though this bullet in my chest is burning

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

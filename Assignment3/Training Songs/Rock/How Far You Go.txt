Something sweet
Every time we meet
There's no doubt about it
But I whish I know
What I'm suppose to do
With you Sirene

'Cause you pretend
To be more than a friend
This is the sweetest feeling
But I don't understand
If it's a part of a plan to be lying
To me Sirene

Still tonight I fall for the stars in your eyes
I apologize
But I want you to know
That my heart is broken
My high is low
That's how far you go

I can see
What you're doing to me
But I don't know the answer
And I just couldn't take
If I made the mistake
Of not trying

But easy come and easy go
I don't want to cry about it
Now that I've got it clear
That you only appear to be lying
To me Sirene

But tonight I fall for the stars in your eyes
I apologize
But I want you to know
That my heart is broken
My high is low
That's how far you go

Oh....

I apologize
But I want you to know
That my heart is broken
My high is low
That's how far you go

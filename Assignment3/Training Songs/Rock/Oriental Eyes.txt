Took my annual vacation
Improved my foreign relations
Well I got an education
And true love
True love

When I got back to my home town
Wearin' out my old stompin' ground
Don't you know that that's when I found
My heart was in those oriental eyes

Oriental eyes
You could see things I could not see
No matter how I try
You've come back to me
You've come back to me
You've come back to me
How you've come back to me

Oriental eyes
You showed how love's supposed to be
And sometimes in the night
You've come back to me
You've come back to me

She had her family tradition
I had a myriad of convictions
But there was no restriction
It was real love
True love

She was young and tender
She was ready to surrender
Oh and back home I realized
My heart's still in those oriental eyes

Oriental eyes
You could see things I could not see
No matter how I try
You've come back to me
Oh you've come back to me

Oriental eyes
You showed what love's supposed to be
And sometimes in the night
You've come back to me
You've come back to me
You've come back to me
How you've come back to me

Oriental eyes
You've come back to me
You've come back to me

Sometimes in the night
You've come back to me
You've come back to me

No matter how I try
You've come back to me
You've come back to me

Oriental eyes
You've come back to me
Yes you've come back to me

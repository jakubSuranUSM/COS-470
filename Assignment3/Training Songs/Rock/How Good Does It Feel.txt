There's light in your old house
Where you slept when you were young
It's cold out
The snow seems like it's hung, in the shadows
In-between the thin bruised air 
The low nights
Creepin' on your long blonde hair
Are you lonely, girl?
Is there anywhere to go
How good does it feel, sliding?
Your heart's on a tilt always sliding

It's emerging, a new version of you
In the wild, your animal is loose
It gets darker to abandon all you've had
The raw night holds a different kind of man

How good does it feel, sliding?
Your heart on a tilt always sliding
Your heart on a tilt always sliding
How good does it feel?
How good does it feel?

Oh I know, what it's like for you
As the one you'll slide into

Oh, how good does it feel, sliding?
Your heart's on a tilt, always sliding? 

How good does it feel
How good does it feel

Hey, hey, hey

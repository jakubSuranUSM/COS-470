It's not as if New York City burnt down to the ground
Once you drove away
It's not as if the sun won't shine
When clouds up above
Wash the blues away

[Chorus]
Are we breaking up?
(Breaking up)
Are we breaking up?
(Breaking up)
Is there trouble between you and I?
Did my heart break enough?
(Break enough)
Did it Break enough this time
(Break enough)

Here's to all the pretty words we will never speak
Here's to all the pretty girls you're gonna meet

[Chorus]

It feels good to be free
It feels good to be free
It feels good to be free

The trail is a thorny crown
You wear it well
Just like a king
Revenge is the saddest thing
Honey, I'm afraid to say
You deserve everything

[Chorus]

It feels good to be free
It feels good to be free
It feels good to be free
[x3]

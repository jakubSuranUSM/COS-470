You'll dance to anything
You'll dance to anything
You'll dance to anything
You'll dance to anything

Oh, baby, look at you
Don't you look like Siouxsie Sioux
How long'd it take to get that way?
What a terrible waste of energy

You wear black clothes say you're poetic
The sad truth is you're just pathetic
Get into the groove just get out of my way
I came here to drink not to get laid

So, "Why don't you just go on home?"
'Cause if you want to moan you'll have to moan alone
You'll dance to anything
You'll dance to anything

Don't try to tell me that you're an intellectual
'Cause you're just another boring bi-sexual
I met Andy Warhol at a really chic party
Blow it out your hairdo 'cause you work at Hardees
80 pounds of make up on your art school skin
80 points of I.Q. located within'

Know what you are? You're a bunch of
Artfags, Artfags, Artfags, Artfags
Choke on this you dance-a-teria types

You'll dance to anything by The Communards
You'll dance to anything by Book of Love
You'll dance to anything by The Smiths
You'll dance to anything by Depeche Commode

You'll dance to anything by Public Image Limited
You'll dance to anything by Naked Truth
You'll dance to anything by any bunch of stupid Europeans

Who come over here with their big hairdos
Intent on taking our money instead of giving your cash
Where it belongs, to a decent American artist like myself!
You'll dance to anything!

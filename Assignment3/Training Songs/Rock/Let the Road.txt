Let the road take you home and the sun catch your eye 
if you don't belong and the world feels too strong
And you're scared of the darkness to come
Oh, hold on, oh, hold on cause love will show all the ways

When the road seems long, let the voices drive you on
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you take on this battleground
The road will take you home

When it feels like you're climbing a mountain,
Gravity's pulling you down I know it's not easy
Oh, I know it's not easy
But just when you're ready to stop, think how it feels at the top
The sun disappears, you're the light even in the darkest night
Because the stars were meant to shine they shine

When the road seems long, let the voices drive you on
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you take on this battleground

The road will take you home
Know the road will take you home
The road will take you home

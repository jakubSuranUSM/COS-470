As the moon beats yellow, the clouds they settle
To this our favourite song
Well I'd love to see you, I'd love to be you
But all in all the time's gone

And, ooooooooooo
And in her eyes, I see sir
I hate the rules and laws

Well there's no talk of you in this town
'Cos the town ain't talking to me
Well there's tales of sadness, a little bit of madness
But all this means nothing to you or me

And, oooooooooooo
And in her eyes, I see sir
ooooooooooooo
And in the skies, I see sir
I'll make the rules and ?you?

But I hate this room and I hate this tune
And I hate what we're doing, what we're doing to me

As the moon beats yellow, the clouds they settle
To this our favourite song

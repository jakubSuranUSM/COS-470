Dottie, you're the girl for me

Dottie, can't you see
Dottie, you're for me
Dottie, you're the one I love

Dottie, hold me close
Dottie, you're the most
I swear by the stars above

I've dated so many chicks 
But I still get my kicks 
From the girl I love best 
Better than all the rest 
Always cool and smart 
Dottie, you're so sharp
Honey, you're the one I love (yeah)

I can see by the look in your eyes
You're searching your heart once again (Take a chance)
And you want me to be there, but I
I don't know if I can do it
We've already been through it
And now too many days have gone by
Too many nights, I've sat, wondering why
Don't you know that you're wasting your time
What you want is so hard to find

So how can I take a chance on you?
One more time
Why should I take a chance on you?
One more time
Every time I see you come around
You know a part of me can't turn you down
Now you want me to be there tonight
But I don't know if I can do it
I've already been through it

So how can I take a chance on you?
One more time
And why should I take a chance on you?
One more time
I want to know what makes you tick
I want to know
I want to know what makes you tick

One more time
So tell me how can I take a chance on you?
One more time
And why should I take a chance on you?
One more time
Now can I take a chance with you?
And why should I take a chance on you?
How can I take a chance on you?
One more time

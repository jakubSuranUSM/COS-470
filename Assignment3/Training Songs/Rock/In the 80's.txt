Tired of working, it's going too
Slow, you just had to be there,
But you hated to go, down
To the job, where it all feels the
Same, thousands of people
Looking for someone to blame.
You and me have got to decide.
We'll be lucky if we survive,
In the 80's, we must come alive.
You're part of the country,
So you put in your claim, they
Take your identity and they give
You a name. They hand you
A number and they tell you
To wait. They ask you to come
Inside while they're closing
The gate. You and me have got
To decide. 'Cause we'll be lucky
If we survive, in the 80's, we
Must come alive. You and me we've got
To decide. 'Cause we'll be lucky
If we survive, in the 80's, we
Must come alive. Tired of
Working, it's going too slow, you
Just had to be there, but you
Hated to go, down to the job,
Where it all feels the same,
Thousands of people who are
Playing their games. You and me have got
To decide. 'Cause we'll be lucky
If we survive, in the 80's, we
Must come alive. Come alive.
Come alive. (Woo woo) Come alive.
Come alive. Come alive. (Woo woo)
Come alive. Come alive.

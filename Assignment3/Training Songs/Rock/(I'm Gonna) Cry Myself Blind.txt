Nothin' last forever
It's so sad to lose your love
I've been crazy since you left me
I'm sorry for what I've done
Why did you go, Why did you go? 

Have you ever had a broken heart
Have you ever lost your mind
Have you ever woke up screamin'
Cause you're so lonely you could die
Why did you go, Why did you go?
I'm lonely baby

Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
I'm gonna cry myself blind
Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
I'm gonna cry myself blind

Good times don't come easy
Dreams don't always come true
The world looks like a prison
When you're stingin with the blues
Why did you go, Why did you go?
I'm lonely baby

Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
I'm gonna cry myself blind
Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
I'm gonna cry myself blind

Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry
Cry, cry cry

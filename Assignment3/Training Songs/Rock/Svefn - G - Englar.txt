I'm here again
Inside you
Its so good staying here
But I stay a short while
I float around in underwater hibernation
In a hotel connected to the electricity board and nourishing
Tyoowoohoo
But the wait makes me uneasy I kick the fragility away

And shout I have to go - help
Tyoowoohoo
I explode out and the peace is gone
Bathed in new light
I cry and I cry - disconnected
A ruined brain put on breasts
And fed by sleepwalkers

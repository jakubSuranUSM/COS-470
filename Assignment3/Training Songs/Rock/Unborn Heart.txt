When she told me
She was gonna have a baby
A part of me went weightless
For the first time in my life
There was nothing I could say
It's like a miracle from the stars above
Paralyzed with fear
I was overcome with love

She said soon you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

I said something stupid like, how are you feeling
She smiled the warmest smile I've ever seen
Oh, I guess that said it all
Now were a far cry from the storybook romance
Something in her eyes, made me crumble
I reached out for her hand

She said soon, you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

Now we all know how crazy
This world can be sometimes
And I lie awake at night and wonder
How a child survives
Beyond the danger in the strangers
And the inhumanity
Lord give us strength to someday find a world that lives in peace

Oh,

Soon, you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

Oh, I can almost hear the beating

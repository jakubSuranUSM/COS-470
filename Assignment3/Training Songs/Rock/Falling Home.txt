Fields of patience
Mountains of pain
Innocence fell from this runaway train
Planets of mercy
Great skies of hope
Send me an angel
With a holy rope

Daydreams and wishes
Tarnish and rust
Truth is here somewhere
Coughing up dust
Crawl through the madness
And climb up the cracks
Wisdom in speaking
From the zodiac

Pull back the lens on the earth's great design
And I'm summer rain gently falling home
Leap from a star into the great unknown
Forgiveness is a high jump
And we're falling home

Someone knows a lawyer
Someone's got a friend
Looks like we're human
To the mortal end
I'll take all the green trees
And you can have the sun
If this land is our land
There's some work to be done

Pull back the lens on the earth's great design
And I'm the autumn leaves, weightless, falling home
Race through the clouds past the gravity zone
Forgiveness is a swan dive

And we're falling home, we're falling home
We're falling home yeah, yeah
Falling home, we're falling home
We're falling home yeah, yeah

Pull back the lens on the earth's great design
And I'm Aristotle waiting by the phone
Count the years we held the hurt inside
Forgiveness is a back flip

And we're falling home, we're falling home
We're falling home yeah, yeah
Falling home, we're falling home
We're falling home yeah, yeah

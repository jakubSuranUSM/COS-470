I don't want to stop your milk train running,
I just want to ride it - some of the time.
I don't think you'd mind if I mention it -
Don't leave the cow juice behind, it'll cost you nothing

Now I've got the time to talk to you.
If you've got the time to laugh
I don't have to pay for your open mouth and
You don't have to buy it - I'll give you a free milk tongue bath.
It'll cost you nothing.

Some men just talk me dry
Some men are just liquid in the mind.
Some men are absolutely rigid
Some men are easy feeling but they're hard to find.
You've got most of my body - damn near all of my mind unwinding
Milk train comes by here everyday.

Run the seas and the quote that you already got
For the ones you chose to free and the ones that you forgot.
And the others that you already sold,
Did someone see you coming close?

When the numbers in your head is punished with every you can find
You better turn away, let it get you at the end of this day.

You are the last of the past and the stories that you never told
And the test of being part of the fun, thought that may be losing all the
lie.
I’ve got trouble on the line, believe in what I think it’s true.

All, all this time,
Break it through the lines,
All, all for one,
The sparkle brings you down.

‘cause every reason somebody got
And sometimes is hard to play alone.
It was a dream that they care,
But they cared of every way that they can.
So if you see it on the way, don’t pretend, just hide in the herd.
That’s the love of the gods and they show
Tell me just why I feel so old.
This is what is like when it’s always going hard and cold,
‘cause when you turn your head,
Let it show the end of your friend.

All, all this time,
Break it through the lines,
All, all for one,
The sparkle brings you down.
All, all this time,
Break it through the lines,
All, all for one,
The sparkle brings you down.

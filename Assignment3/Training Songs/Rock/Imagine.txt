Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
No hell below us, above us, only skies
Imagine all the people living for today, yah hey yeah
Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for, no
And no religion, too, oh
Imagine all the people living life in peace, yoo ooo

You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one, will be as one

Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man, oh
Imagine all the people sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one

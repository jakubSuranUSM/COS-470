I'm obsessed and deranged for I am destined to rule
And I just can't believe that you are such a fool
I don't need your sweet devotion, I don't want your cheap emotion
You will do as you are told 'til the rights to you are sold

Don't you blow your top
Are you hung up?

Give me your dirty love
Give me your dirty love

Think I'll go and start my car to have the real adventure
Like some tacky little creep, really dig her she's so creepy
Once you were my one and only, took my stash and left me lonely

Don't you blow your top
Are you hung up?

Give me your dirty love
Give me your dirty love
Give me your dirty love
Your dirty love, your dirty love

Give me your dirty love
Give me your dirty love
Give me

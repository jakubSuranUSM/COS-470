Friends, all ask me about you,
You're gone, and they want to know why,
I've stopped, even trying to tell them,
Tears fill my eyes I walk away,
What can I say where can I go
Without your love, what shall I tell them now that you've left me,
What shall I say, what can I do, I'm lost without you.

If I've made, you unhappy,
I'm sorry, for what I've done wrong,
You can't, really mean it's all over,
Give me a chance, don't walk away,
Hear what I say, where can I go

Without your love, what shall I tell them, now that you've left me,
What shall I say, what can I do, I'm lost without you.

If you turn and walk away, don?t come back now,
If you break my heart again, I'll just hate you,
Hate you with every beat, with every beat of my heart,
Oh, I'm lost without you [Repeat: x3]

Here are the books of look;
You need them to open the seed
To see what goes on in the world
Here in my mind
Catch the wind and hold on tight
To what we'll find
And hear what goes on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me 

If there's anything you'd like to say that could help me in any way
Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
Help me on that day
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you
Is there anything you think you should know
Is there anything before I go?

Dear Father [Repeat]
I'm hungry, I'm cold
Feeling terribly old
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

They're on their own, needing a face, a place,
Hope and mind, a home
To see what goes on in the world
They're who you need
To show them why they're wrong, oh why indeed
We need to go on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me.

If there's any complication that you'd like to talk over with me about
'Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
We can work it all out
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you
Is there anything you think you should know
Is there anything before I go?

Dear Father [Repeat]
You must be putting me on
'Cause most of their minds are gone
They run on T'understand me
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father [Repeat]
Can I give it a miss
'Cause I'm not ready for this
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father [Repeat]
Won't you leave me alone
Won't you let me go home
I don't think I could see
Lord, they'd crucify me
I just couldn't do that
'Cause that's not where it's at now.

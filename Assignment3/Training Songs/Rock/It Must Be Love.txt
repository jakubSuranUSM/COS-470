Baby won't you please go home
You've been gone away so long
Oh - I'm in love!

Baby let me hold you hand
I'm gonna squeeze it as tight as I can
Oh - I'm in love!

I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm a-saving my loving and bring it all to you
I'm gonna buy me a rocking chair
Gonna keep on rocking 'till you come back here

Then we'll go walking down Lover's Lane
We'll go walking hand in hand
Oh - it must be love!

I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm a-saving my loving and bring it all to you
I'm gonna buy me a rocking chair
Gonna keep on rocking 'till you come back here

Baby won't you please go home
You've been gone away so long
Oh - I'm in love!

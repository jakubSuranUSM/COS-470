Spin me round  roll me over  fuckin' circus 
Stab it down  one way needle  pulled so slowly 
Drains and spills  soaks the pages  fills their sponges 
It's my blood 

Paint Ed big, Turn Ed into, One of his enemies,  
It's my blood 

Stab it down  fill the pages  suck my life out 
Maker of my enemies,  
Take, my,  
F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck

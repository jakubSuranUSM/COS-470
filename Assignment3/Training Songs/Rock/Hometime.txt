Picture me in a boat on the sea
Five fingered leaves keep covering me
Don't you know that the big Ferris Wheel is eventually stalling

I see you I see the animals too
Especially those that are out at the zoo
They look just like me and a lot like everybody

And if we're lucky we might see the end of the day completely

Collect all your things cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things cause it's home time

People walkin' on top of the sea
But this time it doesn't matter to me
Because I've got these magical seeds and the trees are still growing

Stone throwing I've got nothing to do
Only hope I got the message to you
Because if we're lucky we might see the end of the world completely
And if we do than I hope that it's you waiting there to meet me

Collect all your things cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things cause it's home time

Collect all your things cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things cause it's home time

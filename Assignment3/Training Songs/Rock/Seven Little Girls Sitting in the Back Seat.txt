(Dee doody doom doom, dee doody doom doom) 
(Dee doody doom doom, DOOM) 

Seven little girls sittin' in the back seat 
Huggin and a'kissin with Fred 
I said "why don't one of you come up and sit beside me?" 
And this is what the seven girls said 

(All together now, one, two, three) 
(Keep you mind on your drivin') 
(Keep you hands on the wheel) 
(Keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead) 
(We're havin' fun sittin' in the back 
seat kissin' and a'huggin with Fred) 
(Dee doody doom doom, dee doody doom doom) 
(Dee doody doom doom, DOOM) 

Drove through the town, drove through the country 
Showed 'em how a motor could go 
I said "how do you like my triple carburetor?" 
And one of them whispered low 

Seven little girls smoochin' in the back seat 
Every one in love with Fred 
I said "you don't need me, I'll get off at my house" 
And this is what the seven girls said 

(All together now, one, two, three) 
(Keep you mind on your drivin') 
(Keep you hands on the wheel) 
(Keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead) 
(We're havin' fun sittin' in the back seat 
kissin' and a'huggin with Fred) 

All of them in love with Fred 
(Dee doody doom doom) 
Kissin' and a'huggin with Fred 
(Dee doody doom doom) 
Wish that I could be like Fred 
(Doom)

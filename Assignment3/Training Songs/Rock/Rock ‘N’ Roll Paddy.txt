I'm the lowest of the low
I'm the sickest of the sick
They let me out the funny farm
Just to put me in the nick
Then they let me outta the hole
Just to crush me on the dole
I'm the lowest of the low
A rockin boppin lunatic

Whack for me daddy
I'm a rock'n'roll paddy
Whack for me daddy
I'm a rock'n'roll queen
Whack for me daddy
I'm a rock'n'roll paddy
Stick another record
in the record machine

Here's to Geno, here's to Eddie
Here's to sad songs Big O sings
Here's a letter from Elvis Presley
Big Tom is still the King

I will stalk them in the back seats
I will stalk them in the bars
Rape their women and scare their children
Burn them in their brand new cars

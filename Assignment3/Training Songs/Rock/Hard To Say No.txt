Climbing over the back wall
Honey you keep falling over yourself
Babe you’re just like your mother
You didn’t pick it up off a shelf
Excuse me but girl you amuse me
So why don’t you lose the innocent face
Baby ain’t that amazing
That you can just save me from running the race

'Cause it’s so hard to say no to a girl with those little black pumps

Shake it you got to take it
Baby don’t break it, make me believe
It’s over give me the shoulder, give me it colder
I wanna reave
Heartbreak hit me with heartbreak
Girl I’ve been dreaming, dreaming of this
Disaster my menacing laughter
'Cause I’m only after your little kiss

'Cause it’s so hard to say no to a girl in those little black pumps
Baby it’s so hard to say no to a girl with those little black pumps

Climbing over the back wall
Honey you keep falling over yourself
Babe you’re just like your mother
You didn’t pick it up off the shelf

'Cause it’s so hard to say no to a girl with those little black pumps
Yeah it’s so hard to say no to a girl in those little black pumps
Said it’s so hard to say no to a girl with those little black pumps

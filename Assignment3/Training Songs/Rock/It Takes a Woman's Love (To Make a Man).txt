Late every night when I am all alone
I call my baby on the telephone
If she was here she'd treat me right
And love me love me through this lonely night

Oh I can remember how her love can be
And I can't forget the way she looks at me
If you got a girl I'm sure she understands
It takes a woman's love to make a man

We're on the road tryin' to sell a song
Been on this road for much too long
All day all night it's drivin' me insane
Cause I don't know when I'll see her face again
But it ain't no easy thing we've got to do
And I love her cause she knows it too

She surely made me understand
It takes a woman's love to make a man
It takes a woman's love to make a man

I give her love cause what else can it be?
I give to her just what she wants from me.
She loves me hard, she loves me right
She'll love me love me through this lonely night

Then happiness we'll surely know
Until again it will be time to go
Oh she loves me like nobody can
I know that women made me understand
It takes a woman's love to make a man.

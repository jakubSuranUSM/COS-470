Under blankets these hills cover neatly 
We'll take steps to make sure our failures are hidden 
But it's hard when our voices echo over ripples?
That form on the lakes and the edges they prey on we'll shine 

Swim around the lake 
Hoping like hell we'll find shelter in 
Coal mines incubating lies fathers and families, 
Hammers and ties brace for the winter 
Until that rumble leapt up to his jaws 

Spines of furrowed earth jut jagged as they rise 
Like welts up on our backs on our bellies 
Its cold as the lord in the bedroom 
Lord at your feet 
The lords shaking the headboard 
With nothing to eat 

Cold restless stumbles wanders towards the light 
That breaks out from the town little homes bearing sheriffs 
Playing across drifts to the back of the brain 
Where they flicker like fire speaking of times that they shined

I can tell by the way you walk
I can tell by the way you talk
I can tell by the way you smile
You're a rock 'n' roll woman
A rock 'n' roll woman
(Rock 'n' roll)

I can tell by the way you sing
I can tell by the way you swing
I can tell by the way you move
You're a rock 'n' roll woman
A rock 'n' roll woman
(Rock 'n' roll)

You're a rock 'n' roll
You're a rock 'n' roll woman
You're a rock 'n' roll
You're a rock 'n' roll woman

I can see by the way you move
I can see by the way you groove
I can see by the way you smile
You're a rock 'n' roll woman
A rock 'n' roll woman
(Rock 'n' roll)

You're a rock 'n' roll
You're a rock 'n' roll woman
You're a rock 'n' roll
You're a rock 'n' roll woman

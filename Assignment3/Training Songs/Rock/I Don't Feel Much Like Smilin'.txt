I don't feel much like smilin' today
If nobody minds, I'm gonna let my mind slip away
'Cause I don't feel much like feelin' your way
All my dollar bills are turning into nickels and dimes
If things got worse I couldn't get more behind
So it don't matter anyway

It's one of them old days, you know the kind
It feels like my neck's hung on a clothes line
And someone's hanging me out to dry
And I don't feel much like smilin' today
Ain't takin' no chances
Of givin' no answers away

I was feeling alright when I went to bed last night
I woke up at ten and when it began was ready to fight
I've been thinking about drinking about a pint and I just might
'Cause I don't feel much like smilin' today
If nobody minds, I'm gonna let my mind slip away
If nobody minds, I'm gonna let my mind slip away

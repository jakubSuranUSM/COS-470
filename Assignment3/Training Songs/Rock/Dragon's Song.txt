Make your way to the beat of the drum
Make your way to the beat of the drum
Pray this day may be best as one
Make your way to the beat of the drum

Hold me tight in the light of the running sun
Oh oh oh
The running sun
Oh oh oh
The running sun, my love
Yeah

Make your way to the crack of the guns
Up through the heat of the running suns

Treetops sway as they pray for the wind and the rain
Oh oh oh
Just what the earth can contain
Oh oh oh
Can we take the best as one

Hands raised high through the gathering haze
Let the sun burn through to the ancient debates
You are half my heart set apart till the end of the age
Oh oh oh oh

Make your way to the beat of the drum
Pray this day may be best as one

High winds race to the place of the dragon's song
Oh oh oh
The dragon's song
Oh oh oh
The dragon's song, my love

Hands raised high through the gathering haze
Let the sun burn through to the ancient debates
You are half my heart set apart till the end of the age
Oh oh oh oh

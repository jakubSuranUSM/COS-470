First time I heard you felt like I heard me,
My mom called said I'm in magazines,
Thinking how the hell did he beat me
Now he's gone and I'm no Jimmy Lee,

So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
Goodnight

Met you twice and you kinda seemed mean,
But I'd punch dudes who mess with my machines,
Stayed up all night high the night you dreamed,
I'm not missing Hammer but I know now what you mean,

So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
Goodnight

I love fucked up chords with melody,
Phoned in drumming helps my self esteem,
Hope they're rioting in Tennessee,
Set this sweaty bloody retard free,

So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
Goodnight
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
So goodnight Jimmy Lee
Goodnight

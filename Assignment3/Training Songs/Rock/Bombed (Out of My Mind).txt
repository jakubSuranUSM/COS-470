I donÂ´t care what you say 'cause IÂ´m born to lose
And I donÂ´t give a damn if IÂ´m a fool for you
Uh! Look out!

All messed up this time 'cause IÂ´ve been walking round with myself
IÂ´m just a dead end cruiser didnÂ´t mind to use it
Now itÂ´s happened to me all over again

Somewhere deep inside thereÂ´s a neon sign
Tells me where to ride, man
When IÂ´m bombed out of my mind

I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette
I found love in the nick of time
And that is something that I really donÂ´t have
I donÂ´t care if I live or die, man

You want to come with me
You want to ride with me
You want to blow this town
'Cause I ain't got time to show you

All my secrets are buried down here
And I will show them if you want me to
A white night space rocket in sight
ItÂ´s so beautiful with valleys and heights

Somewhere deep inside thereÂ´s a neon sign
Tells me where to ride, man
When IÂ´m bombed out of my mind

I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette
I found love in the nick of time

I was desperate for a place to put out my cigarette
I found love in the nick of time
And that is something that I really donÂ´t have
I donÂ´t care if I live or die, man

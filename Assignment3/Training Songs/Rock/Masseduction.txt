Black saints and a lady
Playin’ knockoff soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor
Nuns in stress position
Smokin’ Marlboros
Lolita is weeping
The bride is beautiful
(Masseduction)

(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I hold you like a weapon
(Mass destruction)
I don’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I hold you like a weapon
(Mass destruction)
I don’t turn off what turns me on

Smilin' now you're less mad
Angry glass half full
Drinkin’ manic panic
Singin’ Boatman's Call
Teenage, Christian virgins
Holdin’ out their tongues
Paranoid secretions
Fallin’ on basement rugs

(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I hold you like a weapon
(Mass destruction)
I don’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I hold you like a weapon
(Mass destruction)
I don’t turn off what turns me on

Oh, what a bore to be so adored
Oh, what a bore to be so adored

(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I can’t turn off what turns me on
(Masseduction)
I hold you like a weapon
(Mass destruction)
I don’t turn off what turns me on

(Mass destruction)
(Mass destruction)
(Mass destruction)
(Mass destruction)
(I don't turn off what turns me on)
(Mass destruction)
(Mass destruction)
(Mass destruction)

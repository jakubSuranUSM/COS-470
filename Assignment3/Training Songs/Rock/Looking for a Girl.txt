You stepped outside of me again
Did you think that I could just get up and let you back in?
You change your mind on me again
Safety is so boring when you have so many friends

You said, "I'm looking for a girl
Someone who won't mind if I go out"
You said, "I'm looking for a girl
Someone who won't care"

If I shout, I'm looking for a girl
You made a fool of me again
I waited at the club until half past ten
You're playing games on me again

While girls around the world
Are waiting for their men

You said, "I'm looking for a girl
Someone who will listen to the things I say"
You said, "I'm looking for a girl
Someone who'll be good while I'm away"

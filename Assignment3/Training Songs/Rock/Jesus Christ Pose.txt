And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me
You don't want to be my slave

But you're staring at me
Like I, like I need to be saved
Saved, like I need to be saved
Saved

In your Jesus Christ pose
In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out, in your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
And I swear to you
That I would never feed you pain

But your staring at me
Like I, like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails

In the Jesus Christ pose
In the Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord

Would it pain you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns?
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor

In the Jesus Christ pose
(Poor) in the Jesus Christ pose

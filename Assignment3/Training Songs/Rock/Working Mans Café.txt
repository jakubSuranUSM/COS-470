Looking for the working man's café
In the shopping center of the town
Looking for somewhere to fit in
In among the retail outlets

Bought a pair of new designer pants
Where the fruit and veg man used to stand
I always used to see him there
Selling old apples and pears

Chatting up the pretty girls
With knocked off goods in the van

Don't you know he was a working man
Long ago he was a working man
And we sat in the working man's café
The working man's café

Everything around me seems unreal
Everywhere I go it looks and feels like America
We've really come a long way down this road
Improving our surroundings as we go
Changing our roots and culture
But don't you know

Long ago there was a working man
Don't you know we were all working men
And we'd sit and pass the time of day
At the working man's café

I thought I knew you then but will I know you now?
There's gotta be a place for us to meet
I'll call you when I've found it
I only hope that life has made us a little more grounded
Hey man, I see you now.

Oh oh, we were all working men
And here we are at the working man's café

It's really good to see us come so far
But haven't we forgotten who we are
Taking out a larger loan
Equity relief and mortgages

We all seem to pass the time of day
Online at the internet cafe
And if you forget my face
In case you've forgotten just who I am
I'm the kid with the greasy spoon
Firmly held in my hand

Don't you know I was a working man
Long ago we were all working men
And we sat and spent the time of day
At the working man's café
Yeah, at the working man's café

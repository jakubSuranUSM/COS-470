I see you shivering from the cold
You slip in front of me, in the queue
The people behind us staring

You get the privilege of being with me
Like I get the poetry in motion
Of your body next to mine

I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you move

My mind is in the gutter 
But I'm looking up the skirts of the stars
You wouldn't get it

Why does it matter how I treat you 
When TV says the world is crushing down around us

The sadness that comes in the mornings will be washed away
You'll see to that, but how long will it last

I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you've touched me somehow
I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you move

The sadness that comes in the night times will fade away
You'll see to that, but how long will it last

Is it worse to smile falsely or to frown
I could've guessed but now I'm finding out
From the pleasures we define
Well, I'm sure we'll be fine

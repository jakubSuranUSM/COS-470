She came back to me
At least for a while
She brought with her some tests
She said as she smiled

She just got back for me
I've started to get used
Knowing that she's been
So loving and so true

I'm jealous of you
And the love that you feel
So early in this year

So suddenly with you

I just got back for you
Now the tests are concluded
I am the first to know
There's nothing inside of you

Leaving me forever
Again, good luck to you too
Now I dream of me
And what's happening to you

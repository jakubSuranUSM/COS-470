Oh no! 
It's such a sad and grey day, oh! 
When will I love again?
Oh no! 
It's such a sad and gray day, oh! 
When will I love again?
When will I love again, when will I love again, when will
I love again?

Oh no! 
I can feel the world grow cold
When will I love again
Oh no! 
I can feel the world grow cold
When will I love again?
When will I love again, when will I love again, when will
I love again?

Oh no! 
We are turning as we go
Into a world of stone
Oh no! 
We are turning as we go
Into a world of bone
When will I love again?
When will I love again, when will I love again, when will
I love again?

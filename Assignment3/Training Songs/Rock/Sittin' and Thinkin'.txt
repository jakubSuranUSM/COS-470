(Please baby wait for me)
(Wait for me)
(Wait for me)

I got loaded last night on a bottle of gin
And I had a fight with my best girl friend
But when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
But, please baby wait for me until they let me out again

I know the same thing has happened before.
And every time it does
I hate it more and more.
But when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
But, please baby wait for me until they let me out again

(Spend a whole lot of time)
Spend a whole lot of time,
(Spend a whole lot of time)
Sittin' and thinkin'?
(Spend a whole lot of time)
Sittin' and just thinkin' bout you

If I didn't spend so much time sittin' and drinkin'
We'd still have a love that we once knew
Oh, I won't promise the same thing won't happen again
But I can promise, it'll be a long, long time till then
'Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
But, please baby wait for me until they let me out again

Please baby wait for me until they let me out again

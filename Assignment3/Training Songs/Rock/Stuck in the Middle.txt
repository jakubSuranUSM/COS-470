True love won't pass you by
Must you eye every boy that passes
Why can't you be satisfied?
You hurt my pride running between classes

'Cause you're stuck in the middle
Yeah, stuck in the middle
My baby's stuck in the middle again

I never thought I'd find a better love
She had plenty of all the love was in her eyes, boy
But blessings come from up above
You wanna be loved but you're better off a wise boy

'Cause she's stuck in the middle
Yeah, stuck in the middle
My baby's stuck in the middle again

Boy, she's stuck in the middle
Yeah, stuck in the middle
My baby's stuck in the middle again

My baby's stuck in the middle

Ah, stuck in the middle
Yeah, stuck in the middle
My baby's stuck in the middle again

My baby's stuck in the middle

Ah, stuck in the middle
Yeah, stuck in the middle
My baby's stuck in the middle again

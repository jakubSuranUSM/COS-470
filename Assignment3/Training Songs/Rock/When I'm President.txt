Mother I,m a stranger in a strange land
I feel like an alien
Like I'm on the outside looking in
I don't seem to fit in

Maybe I'm aladdin with a rusty lamp
A genie never stood a chance
To make all my wishes come true
But here’s what I want to do

I'm gonna lean on the 1%
When I'm president
I want a 20th amendment
When I'm president

They're like thieves on a holy host
Digging up the mother lode
Like pirates on the open sea
Like highway robbery

Still whining about your bonus
Man up, you’re ridiculous
Hell you can't take it with ya
So, give a little extra

I'm gonna lean on the 1%
When i’m president
No more bargains, in the basement
When I'm president

Washington, Jefferson
Watch out baby cause here I come
Abraham, Theodore
You know you'll see my ugly mug
Up on mount Rushmore, yeah
You go in with the right intent
When you become president
You hold those truths to be self-evident
When you become president

Cause somethin’ happens to you up on the hill
It's business as usual
How do you want to buck the system?
Welcome to the pit and the pendulum

I'm gonna lean on the 1%
When I'm president
No more 20th amendment
When I'm president

No more bargains in the basement
When I'm president
Everything's gonna be different
When I'm president

Veto this yeah
Veto that yeah
When I'm president
I'll stick it to the first class

Cross my heart
Hope to die 
When I'm president
Pigs are gonna fly

Look at ‘em

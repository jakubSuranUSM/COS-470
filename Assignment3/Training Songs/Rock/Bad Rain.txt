Blood lust tonight, bite my tongue and hold it in
From deep inside she hates the every part of him
In the rupture of the midnight sun
She is longing for immortal love
You who hangs high, tell me will it ever end?
Oh, oh, whoa, oh

Here’s comes the bad rain
Falling from an aching high
Here’s comes the bad rain
Don’t when it’s gonna stop

She’s somewhere else, should be lying next to me
Under the spell, tangled in the ecstasy
From a day she gave a streaming life
Let them pray on her like a sacrifice
Since you deny everything so brazenly
Oh, oh, whoa, oho

Here’s comes the bad rain
Falling from an aching high
Here comes the bad rain
Don’t know when it’s gonna stop

Hanging in the madness of this love
she wants to run the tell is sun
And so I’m lost away, can this love last forever
And so it ends, kisses me and kills the lights
The living dead always be the satisfied

Here’s comes the bad rain
Falling from an aching high
Here comes the bad rain
Don’t when it’s gonna stop

Here’s comes the bad rain
Falling from an aching high
Here’s comes the bad rain
Don’t when it’s gonna stop

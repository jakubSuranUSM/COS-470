One day in your life,
Shouldn't be a problem
One day in your life,
Shouldn't cause you pain
Because it's one day that you might,
Never be around here
And I'll never ever see you again

One day in your life,
you don't have to worry
One day in your life,
you don't have to cry

Because it's one day that you might
Never be around here
And I'll never ever see you alive
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day

One day in your life,
You feel something in you
One day in your life,
Your heart will fill with fear

One day in your life,
You feel something in you
One day in your life,
Your heart will fill with fear

One day in your life,
You feel something in you
One day in your life,
Your heart will fill with fear

One day in your life,
You feel something in you
One day in your life,
Your heart will fill with fear

Because it's one day that you might,
Never be around here
And I'll never ever see you alive
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day

Get back there's nothing you can do about that, go back 
The only one talking talk's back, goes back inside you much so inside you

Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day

Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day
Ohh, ahh, day

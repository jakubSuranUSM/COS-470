Lay it down, little honey child
Got somethin' I wanna take
Got my self a hatchet
Lay these words to waste
When my work is through
Gonna bring my cash to you
Go down and see my sugar girl
She knows just what to do

Sugar girl, wanna piece of that stuff
Goin' out of my skin, and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl, knocks me off of my feet
Yeah, the price is high but the candy's sweet

Working so hard, baby
Workin' all night and day
Sometimes I feel like gettin' blind
And jumpin' in the Bay
If you feel like I do too
You know what you gotta do
Go down and see the sugar girl
And she'll take care of you

Sugar girl, wanna piece of that stuff
Goin' out of my skin, and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl, knocks me off of my feet
Yeah, the price is high but the candy's sweet
Sugar girl, wanna piece of that stuff
Goin' out of my skin, and I'm down on my luck
Sugar girl, knocks me off of my feet
Yeah, the price is high but the candy's sweet

Feeling good, feeling strong
Holding out, holding on
There's a lot to do, lot to say
Just so you can have today

Party here, party here
No one ever really cares 
If you're holding out, feeling strong
Tell yourself there's nothing wrong

There's nothing wrong, there's nothing wrong
It's a wicked place, full of lies
Go along - no surprise
Never much to do with me

Someone else - someone see
Feeling fine, feel OK
Nothing's standing in my way
If you're holding out, feeling strong

Tell yourself there's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong 
Nothing wrong, there's nothing wrong you see

The world around is dragging down on me
If you're feeling sad, full of shame
You better find someone to blame
Feeling good, feeling strong

Maybe I'll just carry on
Maybe I've got stubborn ways
Have to do for today
I'm holding out, feeling strong 

Tell myself there's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong

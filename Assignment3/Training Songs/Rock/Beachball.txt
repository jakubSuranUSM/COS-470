Tonight's alive 
The beach ball's set to fly 
Those well tequila'd guys 
Who smile at strangers 

A tes souhaits 
A tes amours ch√©ri 
You give a little sneeze 
And dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba 

This life is sweet 
We're dancin' in the street 
Who knows who you might meet? 
You'll do fine. 

The little weekend's here 
Thursday has an ear 
Her coffee klatch career 
She talks to strangers. 

And kissing by the sea 
Particular to me 
'Ti punch, mojito, sling and 
Dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba. 

This life is sweet 
We're dancin' in the street 
Who knows who you might meet? 
You'll do fine. 

We flash the seaside sky 
With starfish butterflies 
To cast a spell and welcome locals, 
Weekenders and strangers. 

You'll do fine 
You'll do fine 
You'll do fine

I went down last night with a tattoo madam
To a nude dagger fantasy domain
Wrapped in hell, I lost my breath
Chest to stimulating Chinese breast

Grisly smiles, that don't flake off
Corny-colored demons leering
Vampire photos, sucking the skin

Seeding the night at the inker's parlor
Flash permabrand pricked for a dollar
Her wrist surreal a heart and flying skull
Lettered "Life and love pass swiftly"

Grisly smiles, that don't flake off
Corny-colored demons leering
Vampire photos, sucking the skin

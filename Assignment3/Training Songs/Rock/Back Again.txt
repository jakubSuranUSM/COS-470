Close to madness
So demanding, I can't breathe anymore
I'll never be the same again
Please forgive me, and forget me
'Cause it's calling my name
I'll never go back again, back again, back again, back again

Can I find some more misery?
If it can't be you, then it must be me, and
Can i find some more for me?
I'll never know, I'll never go back again, back again, back again

Cold September, I remember
Wishing I was away
I'll never be the same again
Please forgive me and forget me
Cause it's calling my name, it's calling, it's calling it's calling, it's calling, it's calling

Can I find some more misery?
If it can't be you, then it must be me and
Can i find some hope for me?
I'll never go ill never go back again

Time to time it gets easier
Time to time it gets easier again, again, again, again...

Can I find some more misery?
If it can't be you, then it must be me and
Can i find some more for me?
I'll never go ill never go back again...

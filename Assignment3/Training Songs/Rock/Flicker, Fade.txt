If you should change your name
I'll love you just the same
And if you should run away
I would save your place
So you can go, go, go
If you want to
I wouldn't try and stop you
I couldn't say I blame you

Flicker flicker fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
You wonder why it always ends the same

When I said, "I hate that song
About fire and sex you love"
I couldn't tell you why
Why I did it, why I lied
I know it's wrong, wrong, wrong
It's evil but true
It's what I want to make you
(So I can say I blame you)
So I can say I blame you

Flicker flicker fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
Flicker flicker fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
You wonder why it always ends
You wonder why it always ends the same

You live your life, like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role.
You live your life, like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role (convince me)
You wonder why it always ends the same (convince me)
You wonder why it always ends
(destroy what you create)
Wonder why it always ends, it always ends the same

You live your life like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role

You live your life like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role

You live your life like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role

Flicker flicker fade,
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same

I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
When I cry, you don't laugh
'Cause you know me

I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me

'Cause you gave me the love
The love that I never had
Yes you gave me the love
The love that I never had

You and I, don't pretend
We make love
I can't feel any word
That I'm singing

I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
'Cause you gave me the love
The love that I never had
You gave me the love
Love that I never had

Come so far, when we think
Of last fall
You can't find what we made
You and I
Ohhh

I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
'Cause you gave me the love
Love that I never had
Yes, you gave me the love
Love that I never had
You gave me the love
Love that I never had

I don't care where I go
When I'm with...

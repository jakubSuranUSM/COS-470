Have you seen the saucers? 
Have you seen the saucers? 
Do you know the people out there 
Who aren't happy with the way that we care 
For the Earth Mother
Have you seen the saucers
Tranquility Base 
There goes the neighborhood 
American garbage dumped in space and no room left for brotherhood 

Have you seen our saucers? 
See our lights in your western skies, California? 
The rainbow skies 
The government tells you another missile is flying 
Have you any idea why they're lying to you? 
To your faces 
Did they tell you? 
Have you seen our saucers? 

Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
Your mother needs you, now she's getting old 
Her face was pretty, but you let her go 
Have you seen our saucers? 
Star children on the back road to salvation 
Children of the forest, and child of the woodstock nation 
You gotta' care for the needs of your planet 
Catch the dawn that once was there 
First-born atomic generation 
Open the door, don't you know that's what it's for 
Hey, come and join us on the other side of the sun

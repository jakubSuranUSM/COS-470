When the time gets right
I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way from trouble my love
Under big ol' sky
Out in the field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe

[Chorus]
Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

No you can't hide out
In a six gun town
We wanna hold our heads up, but we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up
In room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone that I don't even know

[Chorus]

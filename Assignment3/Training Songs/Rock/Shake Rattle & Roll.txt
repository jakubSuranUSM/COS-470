Well get out from that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out from that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well roll my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man

when you wear those dresses the sun comes shinin' through
When you wear those dresses the sun comes shinin' through
I can't believe my eyes, all of this belongs to you

I said shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Well you never do nothin' to save your doggone soul

way over the hill and wigged out underneath
Way over the hill and wigged out underneath
You make me roll my eyes baby make me grit my teeth

I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I can look at you tell you don't love me no more

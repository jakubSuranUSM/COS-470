When you wake up and she's next to you
You can't stand what she's putting you through
Can't take no more so I'm going away
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more

Every day I feel a different man
Caught adrift and there's no sight of land
Hey baby do I come back to you
No I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more

Every woman made a fool out of me
My mama told me when she set me free
She said, "Son, son you just have got to find
Find a girl who will treat you like I do."

I can't stand it no more
I'm goin' away
I can't stand it no more
Don't ask me to stay
I can't stand it no more
'Cause there's nothin' left to say
I can't stand it no more

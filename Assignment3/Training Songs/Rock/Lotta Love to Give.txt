I'm watching the rain clouds in the sky roll in
I'm sick of these red pills, sick of the dealer's grin
Daniel, Daniel by the bonfires
On the telephone wire she's callin' you sayin'
Hey I got a lotta love to give

You walked up to me and said did I make a mistake
I feel so naked I could use a twist of fate
There's a sermon that I heard the other day,
Confused me so I looked the other way
I'm watchin' you now with a whole lotta love to give

I'm half crazy, eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it, could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head

Oh, I'm half crazy, eyes are heavy
If I can't be with you I would much rather be very dead
Please don't break it, ah could you make it
Into something that fits into your very pretty head

Just tryin' to write it down while I still remember
The winds are cold, but not yet, it's not yet December
Fireballs bursting in the sky, Wasaga Beach, first of July,
You said to me, hey I gotta whole lotta love to give

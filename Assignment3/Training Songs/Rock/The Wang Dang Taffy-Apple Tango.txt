(Ooh)
They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango
They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Heel and toe?) I don't know

Last night at Papa Joe's my buddy met a lovely dove
She was the kind you never find but keep on dreamin' of
She did a dance we never saw before but sure did love
It was the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Fast or slow?) I don't know (ooh)

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

The crowd was tappin' and a-clappin' as the music played
His heart was right in time with every little move she made
Though he was shy she took his hand and said "Don't be afraid"
"Let's do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Nice and slow?) I don't know

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

He did a spin and shook his shoulder
To get the zing of it, the sway and swing of it
But every time he tried to hold her
She'd shake and shout "Olé", (Olé) then go the other way

Now all night long he did it wrong but still it ended right
My buddy walked her home and got a kiss and held her tight
So you can bet he'll be at Papa Joe's tomorrow night
To do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(To and fro?) I don't know

Ooh la la la la la la la


Now all night long?he did it wrong ?it ended right?.they kissed goodnight
So you can bet he'll be at Papa Joe's tomorrow night
To do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(How's it go?) I'm a no gonna say!!

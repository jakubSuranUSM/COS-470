We were walking, walking in two worlds
In the gardens of sunlight home
Bad children on the phone
Withheld me to withhold you
Said I'd kiss you if you want
You've got things back to front
I got a letter, I sent it back
I didn't like It, what you had

Jack names the planets after you

When I turned you had gone away
So I didn't skip upon that day
Morose feeling, small mind
Don't touch it's face you might like its kind
Said I'd kiss you if you want
You've got things back to front
Don't mind your spelling, it ain't so bad
Things like that they never 
made me quite so mad as you

Jack names the planets after you

I wish you'd come back everything's ready for you
You are welcome if you plan to
You can come walking and you know where
You've got understand that you got to care
Said I'd kiss you if you want
You've got things back to front
My mother's dying I've got to go home
But there's more you won't be solely on your own

Jack names the planets after you

I'm walkin' all around the town
Singin' all the people down
Talkin' around, talkin' around.
Me and my cat named Dog
Are walkin' high against the fog
Singin' the sun
Singin' the sun
Happy, sad and crazy wonder
Chokin' up my mind with perpetual dreamin'...
I'm driftin' up and down the street
Searchin' for the sound of people
Swingin' their feet, swingin' their feet
Dog is a good old cat
People what you think of that?
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at.
Happy, sad and crazy wonder
Chokin' up my mind with perpetual dreamin'...
Dog is a good old cat
People what you think of that?
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at, that's where I'm at.

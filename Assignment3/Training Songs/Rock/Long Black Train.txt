Look a yonder coming
Coming down that railroad track
I said, "Look a yonder coming
Coming down that long railroad track"
Well, it's that long black train
Gonna bring my baby back

Well, she loved me in the winter
Lord, I almost froze to death
She didn't even warm me
She's a fact of frozen lips

My baby hit the road a running
Looking for that long black train
(That long black train)
Lord, and I began to wonder
Will I see that girl again?
(If I see my girl again)

Well, I don't know why she left me
But I do know that she's gone
But look a yonder coming, Lord
My baby's coming home

I said, "Now look a yonder coming
Coming down that long railroad track"
(That long railroad track)
Well, it's that long black train
Gonna bring my baby back
(Gonna bring my baby back)

Well, ain't asking her no questions
'Cause I don't care where she's been
And when I get that woman back
She'll never leave again

I said, "Now look a yonder coming
Coming down that long railroad track"
(That long railroad track)
Well, it's that long black train
Gonna bring my baby back
(Gonna bring my baby back)

Well, I can see her black smoke rolling
I can hear her whistle whine
She's just around the curve
She's moving fast that line on down

I said, "Now look a yonder coming
Coming down that long railroad track"
(That long railroad track)
Yes, it's that long black train
Gonna bring my baby back
(Gonna bring my baby back)

Gonna bring my baby back
That long black train, Lord
That long black train, Lord
That long black train, Lord
That long black train, Lord [unverified]

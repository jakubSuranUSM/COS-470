Always heavy on my mind
Blue eyes
I've just got to make you mine
Her eyes

Gemini
Oh, how I'd like to get to know you
Gemini
Oh, how I'd love to get near you

Always there but far away
Blue eyes
Dreaming half the day away
But wise

Gemini
Oh, how I'd like to understand you
Gemini
Oh, how I'd love to be around you

Seems extreme with all of her
Flirtations
Always seems to get out of any situation

She's got persuasion

Always knowing, not quite sure
Blue eyes
Never selfish but wants more
Blue eyes

Gemini
Oh, how I've got to get near you
Gemini
Oh, how I've got to get to you
Gemini
Gemini

Da-da-da-da
Gemini
Da-da-da-da
Gemini
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Blue eyes
Da-da-da-da

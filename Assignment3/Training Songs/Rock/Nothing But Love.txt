Nothing but love gives the world some meaning
Nothing but love is the drug of Healing
Lover be soft, lover be bold 
Earthquake, avalanche, volcano

Nothing but love
I've got nothing but love

Nothing but love stops the mind from grinding
Nothing but love flushes hearts from hiding
Deeper we dive, nowhere to hide 
Earthquake, avalanche and goodbye

Nothing but love fills the hole I'm hiding
Nothing but love from the well we're drinking 
Into the highs deal with the lows
Earthquake avalanche volcano

For all, there's no answers only dancers
For all, love me now, I'll pay the cost

Nothing but love
I've got nothing but love
Nothing but, nothing but love
I've got nothing but love
I've got nothing but love
Nothing but, nothing but love
Nothing but love!

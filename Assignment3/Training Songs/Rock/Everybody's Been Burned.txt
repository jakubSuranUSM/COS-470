Everybody has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Anyone in this place
Can tell you to your face
Why you shouldn't try to love someone
Everybody know it never works
Everybody knows, and me
I know that door
That shuts just before
You get to the dream you see

I know all too well
How to turn, how to run
How to hide behind a bitter wall of blue
But you die inside if you choose to hide
So I guess instead I'll love you

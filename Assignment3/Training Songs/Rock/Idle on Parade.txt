This is a camp that is a-mighty tough
Were the marchin' men are made
But I am a guy who doesn't dig that stuff
And I'm idle on parade

There is a man, a Sergeant-Major Lush
And he has got to be obeyed (Yeah!)
And in a voice just like a little thrush
He says I'm idle on parade

Now, when they gave me a rifle, well they went too far
I'm much better off when I got a guitar
I told the C.O. that I wanna be sent
He sent me to a place where I could repent

When I was a-free, I was a crazy pup
Rock-a-boogie was my trade
Now Captain Burton-Bassett says I'm all shook up
And I'm idle on parade

When they gave me a rifle, well they went too far
I'm much better off when I got a guitar
I told the C.O. that I wanna be sent
He sent me to a place where I could repent

When I was a-free, I was a crazy pup
Rock-a-boogie was my trade
Now Captain Burton-Bassett says I'm all shook up
And I'm idle on para-a-a-a-a-ade
(Idle on paraa-a-a-ade)

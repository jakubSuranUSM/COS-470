Escaping the twilight, drinking till sunrise
I never thought a head like this would persist
I could be dead at 33 like Belushi
Drain myself away like Hancock in Sydney

Who knows? Who cares?
Who'll remember anyway?

Welcome to hell
Spend your time in hell
I could try to change it but it suits me too well
A not so private hell

You feed my hunger but drown all my senses
In the satisfaction stakes, it's like sitting on the number nine bus
I can't stop me, you can't stop me, I can't stop me, you can't stop me
One's too many, ten's not enough

Welcome to hell
Spend your time in hell
I could try to change it but it suits me too well
A not so private hell, welcome to hell

Feels good to be back with Charlie and Hattie and my memory lapse
Welcome to hell, welcome to hell, welcome to hell

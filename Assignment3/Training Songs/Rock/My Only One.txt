Do you remember still the night
When you left me cryin'
Do you know that you broke my heart
When you left me cryin'
'Cause you were my only one
Yeah-eah, my only one
Oh-oh, my only one
Please, come back to me

Do you know what you've done to me
When you hurt me so
All the time I still dream of you
'Cause you've got my love
'Cause you were my only one
Yeah-eah, my only one
Oh-oh, my only one
Please, come back to me

(2x solo)

'Cause you were my only one
Yeah-eah, my only one
Oh-oh, my only one
Please, come back to me

Do you know what you've done to me
When you hurt me so
All the time I still dream of you
'Cause you got my love
'Cause you were my only one
Yeah-eah, my only one
Oh-oh, my only one
Please, come back to me

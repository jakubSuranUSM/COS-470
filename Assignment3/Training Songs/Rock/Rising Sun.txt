Come on down the road before the sun 
Get high in your heart and have some fun 
Hey, cravin' like the way you look 
You're open like a child's first book 

Oh, when you speak it's just like a symphony 
Oh, your fingers touch me with poetry 
Don't underestimate what you mean to me 

You're like a constant glimpse of the rising sun 
You're like a constant glimpse of the rising sun 

Come on baby, jump inside my truck 
Don't worry, you know you got good luck 
All you do is put your right foot out 
That move'll show you what's all about

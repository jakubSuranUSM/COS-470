On the edge of town
I will wait for you

Breaking up a lonely world
I'll be satisfied
Making up another world
With you at my side

On the edge of town
I will wait for you
Breaking up is what we do
We're hurting too much
Making up is what we do
When we're needing to touch

I got ties-so do you
But I can't help myself
Whenever I see you

[Chorus]
Running to me with your burning love
Like a wildfire
I'm caught in the flame of your burning love
It grows higher and higher

Breaking up you say goodbye
And shakin' your heart
Making up another lie
Can't keep us apart

I got ties-so do you
To somebody else
I got ties-so do you
But I can't help myself
Whenever I see you

[Chorus]

Ooh...how it burns me up
To my very soul
Ooh...I can't get enough
When it's burning out of control

[Chorus]

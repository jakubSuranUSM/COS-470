Say what you believe

Woke up this morning, I was laid out flat on the dark side
With the moon and the room on the wrong side 
I took a needle, sewn myself right back at the seams
I saw my universal gleam
I see the wonder of life and look for the wall
Just taking a walk in the sun
In time
In just a second like the ghost of a bad idea
I feel myself getting the fear
C'mon
Have we decided if we like being part of the plan?
The sands are shifting and thereâ€™s nowhere to land
It's on
It doesn't matter if all the best tickets are sold
And all the old stories are told 
I know
You're gonna tell me that you hear every word I say
But the future gets written today 
Yeah the future gets written today

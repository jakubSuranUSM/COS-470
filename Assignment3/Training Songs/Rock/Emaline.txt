I wish it was last September
When we could lose ourselves in crowds everyday.
'Cause Emaline, she'll walk in time.
She's not the same, that's all you can say.

When I've heard enough I tell myself
That we've learned our lesson
But I don't want to walk away from Emaline.
They're talking now.

Does she know what they're saying?
She's go the air to float above it.
I'm sinking into someone should pay.
She's dear to me and so expensive.
Now I'm not talking about money.
When money talks, I hate to listen,
But lately it's been screaming in my ear.
When I've heard enough I tell myself
That we've learned our lesson
But I don't want to walk away from Emaline.
It only took me one look to understand Emaline.

Sometimes I don't know what she's saying.
Sometimes I do,
Sometimes I don't know what she's saying,
But I know, I know,
I know what she wants to believe.

I wish it was last September.
Don't let me walk away from Emaline
For stupid reasons.
Now I'm talking about money.

When money talks, I hate to listen,
But lately it's been screaming in my ear.
My one advice, girls need attention,
Or are you different than all mine?

For what it's worth, she's got attention
From people like a.c. black and white.
When I've heard enough, I tell you what.
I really shouldn't sit here and whine,
I'll take you down to see my Emaline.

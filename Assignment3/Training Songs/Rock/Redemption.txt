We made it to a strange town
Going down the wrong road
Like any story retold
Couldn't find a common ending

We're way gone, be gone,
Looking for our own way
We needed a distraction
You said you were redemption

We knew it as a wrong turn
We couldn't know the thing we'd gain
When we reach the other border
We look out way down past the road
We come from
We're looking at redemption

It was hidden in the landscape
Of loss and love and fire and rain
Never would have come this way
Looking for redemption

We were looking out past the road we came from
Looking at redemption
It was hidden in the landscape
Of loss and love and fire and rain
Never would have come this way
Looking for redemption

In the eyes of sorry, eyes of rage
What a sordid histories they played
The drama of redemption
Redemption

Left abandoned and abused . maybe I'm so confused.
Take my chance and do my best . better than the whole rest.
Never change itÂ´s just too late . we canÂ´t be friends well think again now.
I will realize my plan doing what I can .
Never gonna change never gonna change . Fix me right and then .
we'll see what's coming now . take a little bit of this and that .
Take a little bit of supersonic banners ...make me so sad .
Supermega Tony Vega like a beggar like on an easy chair I like it when you're so aware .
Supersonic games supersonic games.
who's to blame who's to b...b...b...b...blame:

Chorus: 

BIG BOY DOUBLEDECKER, MAKIN' MY HEART GO QUICKER.
IT'S A BAD GAME, DREADFUL LIKE MIGRAINE.

To the ladies ...I feel I'm slippin' through the cracks . two times rhymin' on this track .
Laughin' 'bout the thing we did . another day so uninspired .
Never gonna change never gonna change . Fix me right and then .
we'll see what's coming now .
take a little bit of this and that .
Take a little bit of supersonic banners ...make me so sad .
Supermega Tony Vega like a beggar like on an easy chair I like it when you're so aware .
Supersonic games supersonic games ..
whoÂ´s to blame who's to b...b...b...b...blame:

Chorus: 

BIG BOY DOUBLEDECKER, MAKIN' MY HEART GO QUICKER.
IT'S A BAD GAME, DREADFUL LIKE MIGRAINE.

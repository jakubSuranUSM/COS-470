Hello, Jim, what do you say?
Remember my love
That I lost her yesterday

Hey, tell me, Jim, what's new with you?
You found another girl
Well, I hope she'll be true

Jim, you can't trust them
And don't even try
Or you'll lose her like I did
To some other guy

Keep one eye on her
And the other on him
I speak as a buddy
I'm telling you, Jim

Tell me, pal, what's your girl's name?
That's very funny
'Cause my girl's was the same

Is her last name Jones?
From the West end of town?

Yeah, thanks a lot, Jim
See you around, Good bye Jim
Goodbye, Jim

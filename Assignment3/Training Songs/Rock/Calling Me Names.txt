You should blame yourself
You and no one else
You can say you’re not 
But you were guilty as well
Instead of making sense
And talking like we’re friends
You think it’s a better idea
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s ever gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling me names

And I should talk about
I always forget
Something I did or I something I should not have said
When I think we're good
It happens again
You think its a better idea
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s ever gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling me names

You should blame yourself
You and no one else
You can say you’re not 
But you were guilty as well
Instead of making sense
And talking like we’re friends
You think it’s a better idea
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s ever gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling

Calling me names
Don’t think it’s gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling, calling me names
Don’t think it’s ever gonna change me
Calling me names
Calling, calling me names

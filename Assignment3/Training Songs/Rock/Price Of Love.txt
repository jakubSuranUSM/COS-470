Wine is sweet and gin is bitter
You drink all you can but you won't forget her
You kiss one girl, you kiss another
You kiss them all but you won't recover

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
Costs you more when you're to blame

You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast
You're happy now but that won't last
You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
Costs you more when you're to blame

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
Costs you more when you're to blame
That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
Costs you more when you're to blame

That's the price of love, that's the price of love
That's the price of love
That's the price of love
That's the price of love
That's the price of love

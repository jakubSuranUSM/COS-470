No-one ever promised anything, 
No-one every promised you anything 
So keep your eyes wide open, 
And your heart well-guarded 
And you mouth firmly closed, 
No it's just not supposed to be 
Simple or fair... simple or fair...
No-one gets something for nothing, 
No-one is something for nothing 
So keep yourself intact, 
Your emotions in check 
And your feelings well-pent, 
No it's just never meant to be 
Easy or true... easy or true...
And trust is earned not bought 
And love isn't burned it's sought 
But no-one speaks the truth anymore 
No-one speaks the truth...
So keep your eyes wide open, 
And your heart well-guarded 
And your mouth firmly closed, no it's just not supposed to be 
Simple or fair... simple or fair...
And trust is earned not bought 
And love isn't burned it's sought 
But no-one speaks the truth anymore 
No-one speaks the truth... anymore...

When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand

Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home

Lost am I in this world of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorways through which I must go
Is the key to this plane too much for me to
Try to gain
Is the passport to this world my astral soul
7 signs rode on 7 stars, 7 ways to find the
Long lost bards

7 days became 7 years, while Pocus laughed
And called foul jeers
7 times he cursed the 7 tears, each one
Became their 7 fears
What is lost is never gained again, I've cast the
Spell that eternity chained
No more to cry o' mortal soul, the astral
Path is now your fortuitous role.

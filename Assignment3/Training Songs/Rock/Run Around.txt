I'm sick and tired of your lies
Telling me that you're good
When you're going out with guys
From your old neighborhood

I've got news for you
And I'm not kidding round
Pack up your bags and
Get out of town

Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Bom bom bom

Well, I gave you love and kisses
And I bought you a ring
But what a love this is
You're ruining everything

I used to have a job
Took me from town to town
But everywhere I went
This is what I found

Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Bom bom bom

Ahh, yeah, bom
Bom bom bom

Well, I gave you love and kisses
And I bought you a ring
But what a love this is
You're ruining everything

I used to have a job
Took me from town to town
But everywhere I went
This is what I found

Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Bom bom bom

Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Runaround, runaround
Run de, run de, run de
Bom bom bom

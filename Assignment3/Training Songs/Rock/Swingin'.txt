Well, she was standing by the highway 
 In her boots and silver spurs 
 Gonna hitchhike to the yellow moon 
 When a Cadillac stopped for her 
 And she said, "Hey, nice to meet you, are you goin' my way?" 
 Yeah, that's when it happened 
 The world caught fire that day 

 And she went down swingin' 
 Yeah, she went down swingin' 

 Well, she was over twenty-one 
 In trouble with the law 
 And it didn't faze her none 
 She called her mother-in-law 
 And said I need a little money 
 I knew I could count on you 
 After that night in Vegas 
 And the hell that we went through 

 We went down swingin' 
 Like Benny Goodman 
 Yeah, we went down swingin' 

 Moonlight on the interstate 
 She was 'cross the Georgia line 
 Looked out the window feeling great 
 Yeah, it had to come in time 
 And she said I'm never goin' back 
 She said at last I'm free 
 I wish ma could see me now, she'd be so proud of me 

 She went down swingin' 
 Like Glenn Miller 
 Yeah, she went down swingin' 
 Like Tommy Dorsey 
 Yeah, she went down swingin' 
 Like Sammy Davis 
 She went down swingin' 
 Like Sonny Liston

All this pressure is building up
And there's a chance it's gonna explode
And I can't promise how when the weather
I can tell you it will happen for sure

Its a crazy world that's spining fast 
Round and round and round we go
Just keep your eyes on me now love
Never stay never let go (No)

[Chorus:]
Shit is out of control 
It's out of control
And I don't care what is happening
No getting frustrated
I wanna be sedated
So I don't care love come with me
Yeah it's doing my head in
You're doing my head in
And I can't change the state of emotion

Bang Bang Boom
And energy's in the air
And the universe is speaking to me
And it's telling me telling you to get closer
Love lay it on me

It's the same old feeling 
That I've been holding in 
It's a feeling that's gotta hold
I need your love anarchy
So let me in and never let go (No) 

[Chorus]

It's insane how it feels
It's insane how this feels
And I'm in and out of
And I'm losing my mind
It's insane how it feels
It's insane how it feels
And I'm feelin pressure
And it's buildin up inside

It's insane how it feels
It's insane how it feels
And I'm losing my head 
Yeah I'm losing my mind
It's insane how it feels
It's insane how it feels
And I'm feel the pressure
And it's ready to blow 

Shit is out of control 
It's out of control
And I don't care what is happening
No getting fustrated
I wanna be sedated

So I don't care love come with me
Yeah it's doing my head in
You're doing my head in
And I can't change (hey)

Shit is out of control 
It's out of control
And I don't care what is happening (Hey)

Shit is out of control 
It's out of control
And I don't care what is happening (hey)

Shit is out of control
Out of control

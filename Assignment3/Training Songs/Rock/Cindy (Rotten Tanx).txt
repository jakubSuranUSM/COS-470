peddle light - I see it's on
I'm drivin by - in my fat mobile
now I know - what it's like
to be a germ - it's shot down deer
oh buy again - it's buy again
fun is me - yeah it never ends
pick it up - and push it in
rub it out - it's a soldier

cinema goes down again
Clint does not move an inch
ESP will work it out
open yr windows give a cindy shout - to me

rock and roll - it's a shame
that you did - all you did bored plain (?)
seek it out - on the grass
fun is me - it's Sashi fresh
purple jack - purple crap
look at me - and sip your sap
pin up boy - pitty the hoar
that rocks a bath - on a cold dish
soon behave
I wanna be
not today
but some time real soon
lock me up
in your bathroom
come and shout
and latch the backdoor - for me

sipping wine - sipping lies
to be sure - it's a worthy cause
fun and games - running things (?)
I can't stay - his share is hot
hotter than hell - sets right style
burnin rubber - on the A.M. dial
with me up - another time
and now I know - I'm blazed out
soon behave
I wanna be
not today
but some time real soon
fox on the run
foxxy light world
roll another one
and burn the light girl - for me

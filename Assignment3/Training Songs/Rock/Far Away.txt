All is done that may be done, I stand across the main
I'll bet all my money thereÂ´s no way back again
A chance as good as any, IÂ´m glad for what IÂ´ve done
I stand across the water far away IÂ´m on the run

I rose up right and early and the lights are dim and low
The breeze could tell you my tales while all the rivers flow
The good time IÂ´ve had plenty in this race that I have run
I stand across the water far away IÂ´m on the run

The breath of air is howling catch the waves as they roll out
Come sing a song of freedom, come sing it clear and loud
A long long time to travel since this journey had begun
I stand across the water far away IÂ´m on the run

Far away the river flows forever on
The sun goes down and the waves roll back the tide
Yesterday is done and my time has come
Far away IÂ´m on the run

Far away the river flows forever on
The sun goes down and the waves roll back the tide
Yesterday is done and my time has come
Far away IÂ´m on the run

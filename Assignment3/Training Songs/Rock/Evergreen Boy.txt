On the turnpike again
Just to reach you, my friend
Just to find you and see
If you still care for me

Oh, the times I've been burned
Don't it seem like I'd learn?
With my heart on my sleeve
If I could would I leave?

Call me--
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy

I'm an old soul with plans
I'm a dreamhead that can
Make a new start, I guess
If the landscape says "yes"

Call me--
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy

In the phone booth with change
It's the same town, but strange
And the road signs are wrong
And the old times are gone

Call me--
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy
Evergreen Boy, Evergreen Boy

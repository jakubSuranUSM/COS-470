Panic in the first beat of the morning
Even what I’ve got isn’t worth offering
If I can’t cross the sheets and hold your beat

Talking in the street with who is listening
Nothing that I say is worth remembering
Even faces change my heart stays the same

Engine in the sky won’t let the moment go
Following behind always a second slow
If I’m far away, am I hearing straight 
I’m no voice you want to know?

You’ve been a forest burning no direction
Caught me sleeping smoke in my protection
Your blackened branches drifting through my water 
Are you wrapped up in his arms? I’m rushing faster and faster

Panic in the taste of all that could have been
Even what I thought wasn’t worth giving
At least my mind has changed

I’ve been a forest burning no direction
I tried to hold you, I tried everything but running
My heart is panicking are you kissing him?
Are you reaching through all your days with him?
Your blackened branches drifting through my water 
Are you over me? Are you? Are? You are

I will not hold you. I will not feel your sway
I will not miss you. I will not think each day
Of summer twilight, your eyes rushing through me deep
I saw my own waters rushing right back to me 
You sitting shotgun, the lost coast calling me
Umpqua Forest, your face just like in my dream

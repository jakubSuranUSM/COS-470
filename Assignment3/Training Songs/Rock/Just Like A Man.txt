I still don't believe it, how much we lied
Last night you made it with him
Now I'm supposed to be dignified
Just like a man

Well I spend my night times drinking
And you spend your days in bed
And I guess it's up to us to choose
The methods by which we forget

And just like a man he holds you gently
And just like a man he strokes your hair
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
Immune to the whole affair

But I want to die, I want to cry,
I want to tell you I was wrong
Yeah I want to die, I want to cry but it's too late
So I soldier on just like a man

I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now
I do my best to relieve it the only way I know how
Just like a man

And I don't want to possess you,
I don't want to take his place
But I don't want to see my last few pleasures
Written all over his face

And just like a man he holds you gently
And just like a man he strokes your hair
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
Immune to the whole affair

But I want to die, I want to cry,
I want to tell you I was wrong
Yeah I want to die, I want to cry but it's too late
So I soldier on just like a man

And I have something to tell you
But it doesn't matter now
I'll stick to small talk
And leave the little bits of flattery to him
And I could call you but why would I bother to
You might not be in or he might misunderstand
Just like a man

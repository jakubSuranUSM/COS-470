We-a-he-a-hell, the little things you say and do
Make me want to be with you-ah-ou

Rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and
I know it's got me reelin' 
I'm so glad that you're revealin' 
Your love for me

Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me not to be lonely
Tell me you love me only
Rave on for me

Rave on, it's a crazy feelin' and
I know it's got me reelin' 
I'm so glad that you're revealin' 
Your love for me

Rave on, rave on and tell me
Tell me not to be lonely
Tell me you love me only
Rave on for me

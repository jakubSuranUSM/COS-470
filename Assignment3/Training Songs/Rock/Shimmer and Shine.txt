It takes a hundred miles of love
To heal a mile of pain
I never say goodbye to the sea
I never blow out a flame
And I've got white lies for dark times
And I don't need your crutch
I'm kicking out the stained glass windows
And I'm tender to the touch

Shimmer and shine
We leave it all behind
Shimmer and shine
When you tell me that you're mine
Shimmer and shine, shimmer and shine

Bring me the music for the revolution
It puts my mind at ease to know
We're the problem, we're the solution
The cure and the disease
But life is trying to force me, force me to trust
I've done all I can, I'll do what I must

Shimmer and shine
We leave it all behind
Shimmer and shine
When you tell me that you're mine
We shimmer and shine
Shimmer and shine

You tell me that you love me baby, then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over, then you say you won't
You love me like a hurricane, then you start to freeze
I'll give it to you straight right now, please don't tease

You come right out and tell me, you're out with someone new
You play it oh so doggon cool, I don't know what to do
You never seem to answer me, you just don't here my pleas
I'll give it to you one more time, please don't tease

Oh please don't tease me, you know it hurts so much
Come on and squeeze me, you know I need your tender touch

But you tell me that you love me baby, then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over, then you say you won't
You love me like a hurricane, then you start to freeze
I'll give it to you straight right now, please don't tease

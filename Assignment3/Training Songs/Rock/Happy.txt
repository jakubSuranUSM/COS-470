I remember watchin' 
All the once upon a times 
Remember thinkin' 
Who's content and who's for rent 

And you said don't you want to be like that man!? 
Oh No  No  No! 
But then he cracks that smile 
And that don't look so bad to me..... 

[Chorus]
Happy  I'm Happy 
But that ain't good enough for you 
Happy  I'm Happy...

I remember thinkin' 
How they thought that we should be 
Remember feelin' 
That might be you but that ain't me 

And you said don't you want to be like that man!? 
Oh No--No--No! 
But then he cracks a smile 
And that don't look so bad to me..... 

[Chorus: x2]

The suns that rise 
A young girls sighs 
A baby cries 
An old mans eyes 

[Chorus]

I remember watchin' 

All the once upon a times 

Remember thinkin' 

Who's content and who's for rent 

And you said don't you want to be like that man!? 

Oh No--No--No! 

Then he cracks that smile 

And that don't look so bad to me..... 

(Chorus-Chorus)

So many words
A-buzzon' round my head
So many words
Are still waiting to be said
I keep a-trying to tell you I'm sorry
I keep a-trying but my mouth can't talk
I keep a-trying to tell you I'm sorry
It's on the tip of my tongue

It's on the tip of my tongue baby
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the tip of my tongue
The words they don't run-un-un-un

Each time you see me
You may be thinking “here comes a bad seed”
But if you could just see me'
And you know what I mean
But I keep trying to tell you I'm sorry
But I keep hoping it's not over and done
But I keep trying to tell you I'm sorry
It's on the tip of my tongue

It's on the tip of my tongue baby
It's on the tip of my
It's on the tip of my tongue
The words they don't run-un-un-un

What is it you don't want me to do
Do I have to come out and spell it for you
It might hurt you too
Going on this way
Wanting two new words that I just can't say

It's on the tip of my tongue baby
It's on the tip of my
It's on the tip of my tongue
The words they don't run-un-un-un

It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the tip of my tongue

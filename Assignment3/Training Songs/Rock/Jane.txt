Jane was the one 
Who would always have her fun
When she's lying on her bed
Making visions in her head
When she stays at home
When she's really alone
When she doesn't use her mouth
When she's sitting in her house

Cause she likes to sit in silence 
And just see the big ole sky
And she always sees the lightning 
When it zaps her in her eyes
And we all get captured for a while
And we all get lost

Jane sang a song
It was pretty
It was long
It was all about a man 
Who went by the name of Dan
In a bubble he would float
Over Jane just like a ghost
And she'd wave to him each night
As he slowly passed her by

Cause she likes to sit in silence 
And just see the big ole sky
And she always sees the lightning 
When it zaps her in her eyes
And we all get captured for a while
And we all get lost

The bubble is not even tired
It's always on the rise
It's an amazing ride
Once you step inside
And leave these streets behind

Jane went to sleep
She was weary
She was weak
And she dreamt about the light 
That washed over her that night
And then suddenly she flew
Through a halo round the moon
Dropping packages of gold
To the bubble down below

Cause she likes to sit in silence 
And just see the big ole sky
And she always sees the lightning 
When it zaps her in her eyes
And we all get captured for a while
And we all get lost

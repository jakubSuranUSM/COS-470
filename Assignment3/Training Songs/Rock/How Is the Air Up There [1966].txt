Father is a V.I.P
He thinks he's always right
Your mother watches her TV
Won't talk to you all night

Couldn't help sitting up so high
He's got a bloody nerve
He's never seen a flower tree
Or anything that's close

Oh, everyday I'll pass and say
Hey

How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
According to you I just don't care
I'm falling on the ground

The first time that I saw you
Said you'd hope I never change
Your folks took one look at me
And they sure acted strange

Haven't seen you in a month
And you wonder what it's all about
Next time I'm in prison, love
Come and, bring me out

Oh, everyday I'll pass and say
Hey

How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
According to you I just don't care
I'm happy with what I found

You tried to put the blame on me
You've got a lot of nerve
You say you feel so lonely
Well, it's just what you deserve

When you get tired
Of your lonely life in high society
Well, get some kicks and take a trip
And come on down with me

Oh, everyday I'll pass and say
Hey

How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?
According to you I just don't care
I'm happy with what I found

How is the air up there?
How is the air up there?

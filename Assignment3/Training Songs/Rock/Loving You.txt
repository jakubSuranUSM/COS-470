I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, loving you
Winter, summer, springtime, too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I do
You know that I'll always be loving you
If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't be blue
I'll be faithful I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me
And you know who
You know that I'll always be
Loving you

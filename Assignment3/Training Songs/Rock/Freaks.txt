If the mother goes to sleep with you 
Will you run and tell Geraldo 
If the mother bears your children without tears 
Without the usual costs of labor 
If the mother goes to bed with you 
Will you run and tell the neighbors 
Will you hide behind that get up that you wear 
Or will take the first ear that comes into contact with you blade 
Like peter did on the hill 
Will you call her a freak? 
Will you call them freaks? 
If the mother goes to bed with you 
Will you run and tell the papers 
How she picked you from a line up in downtown Philadelphia 
With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and Henry Miller in your 
Back pocket 
You little fucker 
If the mother goes to bed with you 
In the bowels of the cathedral 
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs 
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about 
Finding yourself in your mother's arms 
Will you call her a freak 
Will you call them freaks 
Or will you call the gods 
Will you call them freaks 
You know your sperm is weak 
You never looked, so high 
To ever find her, so low 
You did not have to go, that far 
To show her that you were holy 
Now you know they're gonna come for you 
And drag your silly name into the mud 
If the mother bears your children without tears 
And the usual cost of labor

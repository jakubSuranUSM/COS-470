Here's to the lone and wayward sun,
For to love is to leave
For to run like a rolling stone
I fell in with men who were wicked in the end
As we roam by and by so these crimes multiply

See this wayward sun, boy
May you live to run another day
Dark is the heart
And dreams will come
To the swift and the dead
To the ? and the wayward sun
My love can't you see what is happening to me
All I touch turns to sand
Sifting out through my hand

I can see the future in your eyes
Shining like a million skies,
Over all, over all my petty crimes,
I've a built a dream
I know you should hate me,
But you celebrate me every time I'm on your side,
My eyes open wide,
You just winging like a bird out over the void
And all my petty crimes and curses,
They are destroyed

I know you should hate me,
But you elevate me up into the stratosphere,
I no longer care that I am terrified, alright,
But you are the cure,
Because all my petty crimes and curses,
They disappear.

I can feel the future in your skin,
Edge the spirits as they spin,
All around, all around my petty crimes
I've built a tree
I know you should hate me,
But you rearrange me
Coming off the starting line,
All hammer and twine,
The future is winging like a bird
Out over the void
And all my petty crimes and curses they are destroyed.

Now then a serpent spoke to me,
It was hanging from a pale and nameless tree,
On the bed, with a ? on its head,
It's voice was like the wind that blows,
Like a thousand crows rising into flight
?, alright.

So now I left him in his tree,
To score some horses,
To the road that runs in circle to the sea,
But the snake he followed me,
So I hopped a ship,
A silver sea,
Past galaxies and stars with speed,
To end this planets ?

Where will you go,
When our love's gone?
When this world of ours is nothing more than a long lost song?
This road that we're on is where we both belong?
As the years disappear will you wait for me here?
See this wayward sun, boy
May you live to run another day

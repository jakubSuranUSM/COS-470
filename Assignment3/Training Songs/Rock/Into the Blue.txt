On a day like today
Nothing gets better, come what may
I could just disappear
Into the blue, into the blue

On a day like today
In tune I am, what can I say
I could just disappear
Into the blue, into the blue

Blue, blue I see you and feel you too
Can't you show me what to do?
Can't you? Won't you? Oh...

On a night like tonight
I tried all I could, I'm loving despite
I could just disappear
Into the blue, into the blue

Blue, blue I see you and feel you too
Can't you show me what to do?
Can't you? Won't you? Oh...

Into the blue, into the blue
Into the blue, oh-oh, blue, oh

On a day like today
Nothing gets better, come what may
I could just disappear
Into the blue, into the blue, oh

Blue, blue I see you and feel you too
Can't you show me what to do?
Can't you? Won't you?

Blue, blue I see you and feel you too
Can't you show me what to do?
Can't you? Won't you?

Darkness light, better hold me tight
Take me away to you, into the blue 
Into the blue, into the blue

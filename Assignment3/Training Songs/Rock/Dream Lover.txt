Dream they call desire
Like it matters
It doesn't matter much to me
If I seem begrudging or on another planet
Actually

With a hollow embrace, let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover you cannot replace

When I shut my eyes, I've got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark, I've got another dream lover

When you're on my mind, I kinda like it
Asleep at the wheel
Think outside the box
And anybody could have their appeal

With a hollow embrace, let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover you cannot replace

When I shut my eyes, I've got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark, I've got another dream lover

Dreaming, dreaming, you're everywhere
Dream lover

With a hollow embrace, let's go back to your place
Uncover the lover you cannot replace

When I shut my eyes, I've got another dream lover
Somewhere in the dark, I've got another dream lover

Dreaming, dreaming, who could compare?
Dream lover
Dreaming, dreaming, you're everywhere
Dream lover

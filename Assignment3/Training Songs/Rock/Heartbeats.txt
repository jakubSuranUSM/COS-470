One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine scent
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands from above to lean on
Would that be good enough for me?

One night of magic rush
The start: a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands from above to lean on
Would that be good enough for me?

To call for hands from above to lean on
Would that be good enough?

And you
You knew the hand of the devil
And you
Kept us awake with wolves teeth
Sharing different heartbeats in one night

To call for hands from above to lean on
Would that be good enough for me now?

To call for hands from above to lean on
Would that be good enough?

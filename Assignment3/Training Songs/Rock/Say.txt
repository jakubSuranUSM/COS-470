Say, have you ever been down, wished you had just a fin?
Say, have you seen the ground, wonder where you've been?
Say, I betcha don't know, I can tell your kind.
Say, you wouldn't try to go, 'fraid to blow your mind.

You ride a little, hide a little, close your eyes and sigh a little.
Guard your mind and hide a little. Say, can'tcha hear me say?
Say, can you see the light bleedin' through the shade?
Say, are you readin' me right, or are you too afraid?

Say, take a bit of a look, tell me what you think you see.
Say, have you ever been took? You're lookin' like you ought to be.
You ride a little, hide a little, close your eyes and sigh a little.
Guard your mind and hide a little. Say, can'tcha hear me say?

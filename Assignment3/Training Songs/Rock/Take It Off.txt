I'm on my second drink
But I've had a few before
I'm tryin' hard to think
And I think that I want you on the floor
Uh huh, yeah on the floor!

[Chorus]
Go on and take it off
Take it off!
Shake it off baby, for me
C'mon and break me off
Break me off!
Cause I get what I want and I like what I see

Need your love one, two, three
Stop starin' at my D cup
Don't waste time, just give it to me
C'mon baby, just feel me up
C'mon, just give it up

[Chorus]

Forget the application
You're the right guy for the task
Let me take you on vacation
Just do it, you don't have to ask!

Go on and take it off
Take it off!
Shake it off baby, for me
C'mon and break me off
Break me off!
Cause I get what I want and I like what I see
Take it off
Take it off!
Take it off baby, for me
Take it off
Take it off!
Take it off baby, for me.

In the Wee wee hours, I used to play Maybellene
And the days whizzed Together, until someone came between
I didnæ?° lay No money down, cause she caught it Downbound train.
Too much monkey business and on with Brown eyed handsome man
Roll over Beethoven, try to catch me if you can
So long, Havana Moon, I have a Drifting Heart again.

Oh yeah!

Have the Deep Feeling, my head is going Around and around
No one would let me, Oh baby doll, comin?by.
Rock and roll music, slowly 79

Sweet little sixteen, and you will soon be 21
No more reelin?and rockin? School Days will be done.
Go Johnny B. Goode, play your guitar, and have some fun.

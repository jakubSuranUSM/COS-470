The preacher bowed and turned to go
He threw some dirt into a hole
He wasn't needed anymore, oh oh

He shrugged and cast away the cold
He rearranged his preachers clothes
The word of God is all he knows

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

(Message from Heaven)
Sun in the sky
(Message from Heaven)
News from on high

God bless the solder and his gun
Small sacrifice then justice done
He's every broken mothers son

Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

(Message from Heaven)
Sun in the sky
(Message from Heaven)
News from on High

(Message from Heaven)
Oh the sun in the sky
(Message from Heaven)
Oh yeah

Message from Heaven
Message from Heaven
Message from Heaven

He threw some words into the air
He spoke the pain we all must share
How we will meet again out there

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

I have had my share of fights,
And some lonely, lonely nights
Lord, that didn't feel too right
Gonna reach a higher height
The sun is sinking like a stone
And it hurts to be alone
And you're the finest thing I know
So won't you wake me up when you get home?

Turn the lights on baby,
Before you lie down
Turn the lights on,
Turn the lights on baby,
Before you lie down
Turn the lights on,
Turn the lights on baby,
Let them shine
Oh baby turn the lights on,
Turn the lights on baby
Let them shine
Oh baby turn the lights on

And if I'm sleeping like a log
Just wake me up and I'll be your dog

Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on baby
Let them shine
Oh baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the light on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on mama
Let Ã¢??em shine
Oh mama turn the lights on
Yeah
Turn the lights on
Turn them on good baby
I want to see you right now
I want to see you real good
Really good
Why are you so good to me?

Wake me up when you get home
Wake me up when you get home
Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on baby
Before you lie down
Baby turn the lights on
Turn the lights on mama
Let them shine
Oh mama turn the lights on

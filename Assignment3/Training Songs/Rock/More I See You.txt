Each time I look at you 
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me 
The thrill is new
And there is nothing 
That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight 
Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me 
Can only be you
My arms won't free you, 
My heart won't try

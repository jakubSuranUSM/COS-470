Let me read those things for which I am thankful
My father, my mother, my family essential
The fact that there's water on top of this planet
The opportunity for me to walk in it
[Unverified]
And the ability to tell you what I want to

Find me a gift that's through my closest acquaintance
That kid has so many new things
They know who this one is and I wish that they do
So I could stay with them

Did I tell you I don't think this will work out
That I love you but I'm wanting something else
Something close to me that I cannot forgive
Something far away that I?d like to end with

I?d like to end it with a music clich√©
Saying [Unverified], it?s not you, it?s me
Then I could hang up and just put you away
In some music box that the Swiss army plays

Since it?s a holiday, I?ll leave you alone
Dial these numbers and then hang up the phone
A good excuse for me to waste my [Unverified]
Because you kept me here by [Unverified]

And I don't wish that you could be
So that it would stop me from asking
But lend me your ear, dear

Did I tell you I don't think this will work out
That I love you but I'm wanting something else
Something close to me that I cannot forgive
Something far away that I?d like to end with
End with, end with, end with

[Unverified] maybe, if we had met
Under different circumstances, I?d forget
Let me tell you that you got me to work [Unverified]

Did I tell you I don't think this will work out
That I love you but I'm wanting something else
Something close to me that I cannot forgive
Something far away that I?d like to end with
End with, end with

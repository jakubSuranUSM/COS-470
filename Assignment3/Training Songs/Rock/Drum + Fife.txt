Away, away foul dream
You're gonna listen now to me
No rules or in betweens
You're gonna listen now to me
Waste all your time
Find another kind of boy, whoa
A face upon the line
Offensive I don't care to hold

Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along, you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, you're mine
Mine

Inside
The drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

In my affection, too
You're gonna listen now to me
But stop what's left as rule
You're gonna listen now to me

Come on along on an eastern shore
Come on along, you're mine
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, you're mine
Mine

Inside
The drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
To remedy this waiting
'Cause I will bang to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

Don't you ever be afraid
No more, no more, no more

'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
Don't you ever be afraid
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying
I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum

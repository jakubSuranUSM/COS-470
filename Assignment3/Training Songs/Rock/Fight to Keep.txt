I left my heart on the top of a window sill 
Fell apart when the winds pulled it down
On the ground where sun drove the colors deep
In the summer heat the colors seem to drown (X2)

But you pulled up the colors with a simple tune
You breath a song and you dusted off the sand
You put the pieces on your sleeve 
Oh you gave my heart to me 
You look so pretty that I fell upon my knees (X2)

The ground I saw your face
You spoke of love oh you sang of grace
But come the night when the light is gone
It's in the dark that my deeds are done

What I've done in darkness I must turn away
This mended heart is meant for so much more
Though the wind it's telling me that it's ok
I'll stand my ground till I hear the kingdom come (X2)

So I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night
For I found words to keep me still
Oh I'm prone to go and make the same mistakes
I hear your voice calling out my name

From the ground I saw your face
You spoke of love oh you sang of grace
But come the night when the light is gone
It's in the dark that my deeds are done (X2)

I will fight to keep the fire burning in the night (X15)

Fight to keep the fire burning (X6)

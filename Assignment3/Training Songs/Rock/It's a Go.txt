No time like the first time
Guess it's a go
Bite down
Before it all goes up in smoke
When you don't know
How it's gonna feel
When it finally hits all too real
there's no time like the first time
That's no Joke
Don't want to talk about it
No need to think about it
Just step up to the edge
Then move on

Because you get nowhere
With that caution flashing in your head
Toss and turn
It got you wrapped up safely in bed
If you don't know how its gonna feel
You got a life with truth that's concealed
Take a dive into the unknown
See who floats

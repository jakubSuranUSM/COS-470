I got me a complication
And it's an only child
Concern my reputation
As something more than wild
I know it serves me right
But I can't sleep at night
I have to hide my face
Or go some other place

No!
I won't cry out for justice
Admit that I was wrong
Stay in hibernation
'Til the talk subsides and gone
My social life's a dud
My name is really mud
I'm up to here in lies
I guess I'm down to size
To size

I can't seem to talk about
The things that bother me
Seems to be what everybody has
Against me! (ooh! ooh! ooh! yeah!)

Now here's my situation
And how it really stands
I'm out of circulation
I've all but washed my hands
My social life's a dud
My name is really mud
I'm up to here in lies
I guess I'm down to size
To size

Talk, talk
Talk, talk
Talk, talk
Talk, talk

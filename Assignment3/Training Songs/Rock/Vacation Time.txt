Vacation time

Picnics, beaches, and ball rooms,
Just me and my honey bun;
Home-work they shout,
Is over and out,
Vacation's just begun.

Far from the city, beneath a shade-tree,
We'll spread a basket for two;
Then we'll discuss the future for us,
And I'll whisper love words to you.

Just can't wait for that swimmin' date,
To see your new bathing suit.
It must be a â??gasâ?? 'cause one you had last,
Gee! Was' it cute!

So we will dance and bypass romance,
Right now they say we're too young;
But I shall (will) marry you my love
As soon as you (we) reach twenty one.

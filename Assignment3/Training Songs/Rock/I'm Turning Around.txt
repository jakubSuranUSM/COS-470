Where's the love that you once promised. Where's the pride, was it all lies? 
Taking all, but giving nothing. Did you want a compromise?

All these years we spent together. It was me who sold my time
Now I've made my life's decision. I'll take yours so please take mine

I'm turning around, there was no other way
I'm turning around, taking you come what may

How long did you think we'd make it. How could this affair survive? 
Making mine a new direction. Could we keep us both alive?

All I am I have to offer. Someone new but still the same
Life for us an empty shelter. Now I'll play a different game

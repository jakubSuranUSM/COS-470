I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you

She told me you're going away
I said how can I make you stay
ï¿½I love you and I say
Oh and god bless you

If I call out your name
Could you hear me calling
If I said that it's wrong
Would you say I'm falling
If I told you the truth would you
Stay
Say ya say ya

I love you and all that you do
I need you to see me through
I want you and I say
Oh and god bless you

I could wait a lifetime to see
The sunrise but I would never
Wait so long to see you all right
And make you knay won't you just
Stay
Say ya say ya

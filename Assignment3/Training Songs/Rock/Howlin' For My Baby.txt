She's hot like red pepper,
Sweet like cherry wine
I'm so glad she love me,
Love me all the time
She's my little baby,
Sweet as she can be
All this love she's got,
It belong to me
If you hear me howlin',
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh-hoo-hoo-hooee

Every time she kiss me,
She make the lights go out
Up early in the morning,
She make me jump and shout
This bad love I've got,
Make me laugh and cry
Makes me really look,
That I'm too young to die
If you hear me howlin',
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh-hoo-hoo-hooee

Every time she kiss me,
She make the lights go out
Up early in the morning,
She make me jump and shout
She my little baby,
Sweet as she can be
All this love she's got,
It belong to me
If you hear me howlin',
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' 

She's hot like red pepper,
Sweet like cherry wine
I'm so glad she love me,
Love me all the time
This bad love I've got,
Make me laugh and cry
Makes me really look,
That I'm too young to die
If you hear me howlin',
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin'

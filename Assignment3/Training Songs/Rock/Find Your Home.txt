Have you seen the red girl
On the way to your home?
On the way to your home
On the way to your home

Did you give her the book ?
Wipe the paint from her eye?
And her hands are cold now to me
I thought the paint was dry

We were just on the bus for the fun
And we shouldn't be late
And all the children speak to me now
And I just can't wait

I said hey hey hey now love
Find your home
Oh, now love find your home
Oh love won't you find your home

Hey hey 
Did you see the red girl,
On the way to your home?
On the way to your home

'Cause I don't think that you're home 
We were just on the bus for the fun
And we shouldn't be late
And all the children speak to me now

And I just can't wait
I said hey hey hey now love
Find your home
Oh now love find your home

Oh love won't you find your home 
Hey hey... Oh now lover won't you find your home. . .Well I don't think that you're home (x2) Hey Hey

Listen to the briskly whistling winter evergreen
Whispering through the frozen morning light
And tell me what's to come
Saying my time is near
Never fear
I close each year
I'm winter

Reminding me to trade my t-shirts for my woven wools
Trade my sandals for my skis
Whispered warnings in the wind
Saying soon come the dancing snowflakes
They're kissing every tree
They're kissing you and me
Please hurry

Falling
Dazzling dancing diamonds from the sky
Prisms
Rainbow sparkled flurries in our eyes
Whipping across the frozen crystal meadow
Pond of ice
Race the snow
We'll build a warming fire there
And cuddle close and wine and dine
The setting sun
The morning light will find us high

Shooting down the glistening mountain side
Screaming through the whispering pines
The freedom of each day
Will cleanse our minds
I can hardly wait for winter
I can hardly wait for the snow
I can hardly hardly wait for winter
I can hardly wait for the snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow
Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow

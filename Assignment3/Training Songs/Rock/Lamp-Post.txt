Yes I can't explain, the thunder in my brain
When I walk into the lamp-post
On the boulevard, thinking I'm a star
I always walk into the lamp-post

I was the best, long time ago
It was in school, got the best marks
Took the best tests, in the first row
Around me just fools, that hang round in bars

It's differend today, I hear my self say
And grab another whisky glas
And I feel no tears, cause after eight beers
I feel great in superclass, super-super-superclass

Yes I can't explain the thunder in my brain
When I walk into the lamp-post
On the boulevard, thinking I'm a star
I always walk into the lamp-post

Hey, I busted my head and I do not feel o.k. -i-ey-i-ey
I've noticed that my face is scratched and people laugh
about my way-i-ey-i-ey

When I look back, what have I done
Threw it away, the money is gone
But here is my beer, yeah I'm having fun
And in my own way, I am faithful

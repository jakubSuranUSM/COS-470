[Intro. (Acoustic Guitars)]
Four of us were having dinner
And I threw down the paper with a curse
And my wife said complaining doesn't get it
You got to do something or you can bet it will get worse
And my friend said you've been watching TV too much
And all that hippie hopefulness is just a crutch
But if thinkin' that way helps you
To make it through the night
Then who am I to say
What's wrong and right
But I think we're passing
Through here kind of fast
Did you think these tracks
In the dust would last
I think we're passing
Through here kind of fast
Did you think these tracks
In the dust would last
[Instrumental (Acoustic Guitars)]
So you think we should just sit here
And have another glass of wine
While the world goes to hell which you know damn well
It's going to do just down the line
His lady said I don't know how can you be so sure I mean
Some things seem to get better
You know the hero still saves the damsel in distress
The villain doesn't get her
And I said where have you been living
I mean they're selling death in the streets
Cheap
And the lying politicians are rolling in the profits they reap
And he said he's right honey
But I think it's always been that way
And he smiled kind of patiently
And I knew he was going to say
I think we're passing
Through here kind of fast
Did you think these tracks
In the dust would last
I think we're passing
Through here kind of fast
Did you think these tracks
In the dust would last

[Instrumental (Acoustic Guitars)]

I think we're passing
Through here kind of fast

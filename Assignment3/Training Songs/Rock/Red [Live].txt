I've read it all, it's black and white 
The spectrum made a shade I like
The crimson rays are ruby bright 
Technicolor light
Red! I want red, there's no substitute for red 
Red! Paint it red, green ain't mean compared to red
You don't know what it does to me
My crimson intensity 
I'm haunted by the mystery
The mystery of red
Red knocks 'em dead 
Some like it hot, I like it red
Red is my lover, got it covered 
Red is my number, sure as a coma 
Red is my drummer, and I hear red thunder 
Move over brother 
Red's a motherfucker) 
(Red! Red!) 
that's' what I said... 
(Red! Red!) 
Come on to bed 
(Red! Red!) 
Gimme' that expensive spread...

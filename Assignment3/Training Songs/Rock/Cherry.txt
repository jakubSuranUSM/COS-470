You smile, I desire
Lean on me, follow me
You smile, and it will be
That's the truth, answer
'Cause I am waiting
For the stars to change
It's only the talk of you
I've been patient
For the sun to change
It's only the need of you

I will be patient
For the sun to go down
'Cause I am waiting
For the stars to change

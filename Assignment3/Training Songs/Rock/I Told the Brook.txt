I told the brook
That runs down through the valley
A secret my best friend never knew
The brook told the trees
And the trees told the breeze
That I was in love with you
The breeze told the clouds
Hiding there by a hill top
The clouds told the moon
That shone above
So angry and blue 
When they found out
That you and and your god
Had another love
The brook became angry
And changed to a river
Rushing so madly along
A soft summer breeze 
That played tag with the trees
Became so wild and so strong
The bashful white clouds 
Hiding there by a hill top
Dark and the rain 
Came falling down
There hearts couldn't hide
All the tears that were cried
And he tossed them upon the ground
The storm passed on over
There's sunshine again
The change that held 
Me are now gone
The trees wave hello
As I stand here below
And the brook 
Sings the sweetest song
The bashful white clouds 
Are once again by the hilltop
The sun and the moon 
Are still my friends
I promise there will 
Be no more heartaches for me
Till I fall in love again

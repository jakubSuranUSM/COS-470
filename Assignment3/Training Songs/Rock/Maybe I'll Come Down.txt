Dumb bah did do dumb
I need time to scrounge the rent, need time to contemplate the accident
I got to drag my ass to now, how did I come to stop here?
And oh I knew the gas was gone but I had to rev the motor

Pull back the hand you might get it cut off in the motor
Maybe I'll come down
She's on Laureate's turf, she's on Laureate's side
She's in a better state, she feels a better fire

And oh I dreamed a great parade, shooting all the guns in Brooklyn
The man who had a spare held out two and then you and then you took one
Freeze or burn, all else is only icing

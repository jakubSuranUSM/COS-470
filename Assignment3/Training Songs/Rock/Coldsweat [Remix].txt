Meat meat blood blood
Sweat sweat meat! 
 
I close the door 
Shouldn't burn yet 
The wires get hotter 
Palms are glowing 

This is hot meat 
This is metallic blood 
This is hot meat 
This is open sweat 

I'll show you with my fingers 
Draw with the eye 
With your own breath 
I'll tear your lungs 

Here is hot meat 
This is metallic blood 
Here is hot meat 
This is open sweat 
 
This side of the blackest meadows 
I make my winter dwelling 
And crush my bones 
 
This is hot meat 
This is metallic blood 
This is ...hot meat! 

I'll sail out the window 
I'll walk down the edge 
I will not finish 
'Till I'm fully satisfied 

This is hot meat 
This is metallic blood 
This is hot meat 
This is open sweat

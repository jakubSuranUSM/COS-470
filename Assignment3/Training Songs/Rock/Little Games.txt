Little games are for little boys
I'm growin' up and changin' all my toys
Aeroplanes, motor cars, goldfish, and old jam jars
I just don't play these games no more

Little games are for little boys
Lovin' games are for bigger boys
Parties in Chelsea flats mixin' with kinky cats
Are games I wanna play some more

Ooh what they're doin' to me
Darlin' it's so plain to see
My temeprature's risin' but that's not surprisin' 
When you do what you do to me

Little games are for little boys
I've found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine, Susie and Katherine
They help me in my little games

Ooh, what they're doing to me
Darling it's so plain to see
My temperature's rising but that's not surprising
When you do what you do to me

Little games are for little boys
I found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine, Susie and Catherine
They help me in my little games

My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Play my little games
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Say I need you, I need you

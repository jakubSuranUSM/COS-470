Got no future and a great big past
Little bitty guy on the rim of my glass
Gotta meet the plane so I can get my monkey
Teach him to be cool but a little bit funky
Got no credit and I got no fear
Got about a buck, so I can buy a beer
Gotta see a doctor about the words that I said
Gotta get a bike and I gotta paint it red

Oh no, we gotta go
We're not goin' to live forever
Why, why, we gotta die
You know that we'll be together
Hey, hey, we gotta say
I could never be a saviour
You don't have to be there
'Cause I'm never, never, never coming home

Three feet deep in a slow motion wreck
I was walkin' the walk an' I was talkin' to the best
I was wrinkled an' shriveled an' steppin' out of line
Playin' the end against the middle an' losin' every time
I was veinious an' heinious an' cripple an' sad
Thought I was invincible, the baddest of the bad
Then I woke up one mornin' and stepped out of bed
Had to get a bike. Had to paint it red

Oh no, we gotta go
We're not goin' to live forever
Why, why, we gotta die
You know that we'll be together
Hey, hey, we gotta say
I could never be a saviour
An' I know that you'll miss me
'Coz I'm never, never, never coming home

Crazy (I'm crazed, I want to tell you about it) 
Crazy (I'm crazed, I want to tell you about it) 
Crazy (I'm crazed, I want to tell you about it) 
Crazy (I'm crazed, I want to tell you about it) 
Crazy (I'm crazed, I want to tell you about it) 

Oh no, we gotta go
We're not goin' to live forever
Why, why, we gotta die
You know that we'll be together
Hey, hey, we gotta say
I could never be a saviour
You don't have to be there
'Cause I'm never, never, never coming home

Staring at disbelief out at the gloom
I was forced with remorse to learn the bassoon
I got real good in about six years
Started playing around for a couple of beers
Then one day I was playing at the gig
An' in walked the monkey with a couple of funky friends
He came right over an' said "this is what you do"
"You're gonna get a bike. You're gonna paint it blue."

Ah

Oh no, we gotta go
We're not goin' to live forever
Why, why, we gotta die
You know that we'll be together
Hey, hey, we gotta say
I could never be a saviour
You don't have to be there
'Cause I'm never, never, never coming home

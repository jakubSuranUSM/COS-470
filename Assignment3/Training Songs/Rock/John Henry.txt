When John Henry was a little bitty boy
He picked up a hammer in his hand
Looked up at his mama and smilingly said
I want to be a steel drivin' man
Lord, Lord, I want to be a steel drivin' man

Soon John Henry grew up to be a man
And took a hammer in his hand
He could drive steel with either hand
He was a darn good steel drivin' man
Lord, Lord, he was a darn good steel drivin' man

Now John Henry drove an awful lot of steel
He was the best driver in the land
When he'd start in to drivin' down that steel
The sparks would fly to beat the band
Lord, Lord, the sparks would fly to beat the band

One day they brought a steam driver around
On John Henry's face was a smile
Just give me a twelve pound hammer Mister Boss
And I'll beat that driver by a mile
Lord, Lord, I'll beat that driver by a mile

Old John Henry started pounding down the steel
The steam drill was there by his side
They both drove steel for ten hours straight
Then John Henry fell and he died
Lord, Lord, then John Henry fell

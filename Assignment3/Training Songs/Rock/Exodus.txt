It's simple because it is the people
Fighting for and claiming what remains
And dreaming, this is not dreaming
This is the exodus from the game
Chorus
Dance beneath the stars
We the sound system
We the collective
With an open heart
We the solution
Should be respected
At midnight the pharises plant the poison
False evidence to bring all back in line
It's no method just dealing out bad justice
When no one here's committed any crime
Chorus
Well turn the dust to soil
Turn the rust of hate back into passion
It's not water into wine but it's here
And it's happening
Massive but passive to bring the peace back
Respect here, respect for all the people
Good copper (jah?) lawyer all good minds
Can see there is no evil
The only wrong is fighting changing times
Chorus

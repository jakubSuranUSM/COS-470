There are things in this life I,
Would rather not sacrifice
You girl I cannot live without
And you know there's no doubt that
All I mind's losing you

And I don't mind losing sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
I'll get plenty rest so when I'm dead but 'till, 
'Till then won't you share my bed 'cause,
All I mind's losing you
All I mind's losing you

And I don't mind losing money
There's nothing this life owes me
I've been given more than I can receive
But for, for you there's no receipt so,
All I mind's losing you
All I mind's losing you

And I don't mind growing old
Losing teeth and going bald
Not as handsome as I never was but,
You love me just because
All I mind's losing you
All I mind's losing you

And there are things in this life I,
Would rather not sacrifice
You girl I cannot live without
And you know there's no doubt that
All I mind's losing you
All I mind's losing you
All I mind's losing you

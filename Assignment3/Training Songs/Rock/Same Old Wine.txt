Well we give them the election
That keeps filling our heads full of lies
Can we trust in new directions
When their promises are in disquise
Well someday the truth will catch up
I just hope it don't catch us all by surprise

They preach this thing, religion
But we show no faith at all
Follow suit on Sunday
But on Monday forget it all
If the times should find us needing him
Then my friend, Lord have mercy on our soul

[Chorus:]
It's the same old wine
In a brand new bottle
It's the same old wine
In a brand new bottle

Teach our children virture
Then send'em off to war
Then we ask ourselves the question
What and the hell are we fighting for?
If you suddenly find a reason
Well don't be afraid to open the door
Well don't be afraid

[Chorus]

It's the same old wine
From a brand new bottle
It's the same old wine
From a brand new bottle
The same old wine
From a brand new wine

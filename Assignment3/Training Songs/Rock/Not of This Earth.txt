Well there's a place not on this earth
Where you can sell your soul for what it's worth
Laughing so loud fit to burst
'Cause you're a bargain hunter in the twilight zone 

You don't look no fool to me
You'd live in hell for free
You're not of this earth
You're an evil-heart 

You're a liar, you're a cheat, you're a snake in the grass
Cast in gold and top of the class
You wear the truth like a disease
There's no hole deep enough for you to please 

You don't look no fool to me
You'd live in hell for free
You're not of this earth
You're an evil-heart 

You're no good it's understood
Or you'd never leave the ones you love to bleed
You were born in fire, been a liar
You've lived a life of charm with such ease 

You don't look no fool to me
You'd live in hell for free
You're not of this earth
You're an evil-heart 

Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil

Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues

One little letter is all I can use
She wrote me only one sad line

Mr. Mailman, that'll do for some time
Told me she's no longer mine

Cry, like never before

So hard, couldn't cry no more
Shoo shoo mailman, stay away from my door

Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One little letter is all I can use

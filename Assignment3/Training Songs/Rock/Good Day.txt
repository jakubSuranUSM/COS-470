I said to myself:
Self,
Why are you awake again?
It's one a.m.
Standin' with the fridge wide open, starin'
Such a sight, fluorescent light
The stars are bright
Might make a wish
If I believed in that shit
But as it is I might watch T.V.
Cause it's nice to see
That people can be more messed up more me

I say to myself
As I smile at the wall
Just let myself fall

[Chorus] 
It's gonna be all right
No matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day
Just wait and see
It's gonna be all right
Cause I'm all right with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be
It's gotta be

I shiver, shut the door
Can't think standin' here no more
I'm alone, my mind's racing heart breaking
Can you be everything I need you to be?
Can you protect me like a daughter?
Love me like a father?
Can you drink me like water?
Say I'm like the desert
Just way hotter

The point of it all
Is that if I should fall
It's still your name I call

[Chorus] 

As long as we

Laugh out loud
Laugh like we are mad
Cause this crazy mixed up beauty is all that we have
Because what's love
But an itch we can't scratch,
A joke we can't scratch?
God, but we still laugh.

Get back in bed
Turn off the T.V.
You say it'll be all right, baby
Just wait and see

[Chorus] 

I'm awake again
It's one a.m.
Staring
Such a sight
Well, at least the stars are bright

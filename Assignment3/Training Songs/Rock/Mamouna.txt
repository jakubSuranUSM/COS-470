So you say
You're living just for fun
Isn't it enough?
So you say
You wait o will it come
Isn't it enough?
You a prisoner of loving
You're chained and bound
I could never be the one
In the moonlight and the sun

O Mamouna Mamouna run
You and me
We're just like night and day
The here and now
The ghost of yesterday
Hack and tear
We're prisoners of loving
We're chained and bound
There's a road I've got to take
A thread you got to break

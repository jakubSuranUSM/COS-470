I bought the CD, downloaded the mp3
I even bought the import from the Japanese
I read the bio to see what you're all about
Let's put it this way folks, this guy is no boy scout
I'm missing the point

CHORUS
What if I had a hero that I just could not believe in
A self indulgent model of an egotistic human being
Who boasts about his reckless life in every interview
Yeah, oh man, I can't believe in you

He plays the guitar so he gets his one night stands
He's always being watched by his adoring fans
A role model isn't what he ever asked to be
With fame there comes this thing: responsibility
I'm missing the point

REPEAT CHORUS

I guess I'm playing the game
I guess that I'm the one to blame
I put my faith in man
Though he'll turn to dust
I'll put my faith and all my trust
In the One who made me

REPEAT CHORUS

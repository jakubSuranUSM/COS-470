I'm old enough to know the score
I'm yound enough to want more more more
There's a demon deep inside of me
Some times I let the old boy run free
Don't think twice when the sun goes down
I'm troublebound
Try to make a living during the day
Deep in the night I throw it all away
There's a demon deep inside of me
Sometimes I let the old boy run free

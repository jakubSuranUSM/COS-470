Friday night, I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut and dreaming about the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should have got loaded, some reason I stayed

I started drifting to a different place
I realized I was falling off the face of the world
And there was nothing left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today

Took a ride, I went downtown
The streets were empty, there was no one around
To place that we used to know
Been all the places that we used to go

I'm at the wrong end of your looking glass
Just trying to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there was nothing left to bring me back

I was a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothing to bring me back today
Bring me back today, bring me back today

I started drifting to a different place
I realized, falling off the face of the world
And there was nothing left to bring me back

I was a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today
Bring me back today, bring me back today
Bring me back today

Well I'll just tell you what you wanna hear
I won't break your girlish fears
I try to get close, I couldn't get near
If I tell you too much, baby, I'll get smeared

Said red light, green light
You never stop
Always trying to word me out
Now I know, what youÃ¢??re bopping about
I'll just tell you what you wanna hear
If I tell you too much, baby, I'll get smeared

Seems like every time
I try to love somebody
It's that same old story
I try so hard
I give it everything I got
But in the end
I'm the one who's

I'm so all alone
I'm so alone
I'm so all alone
I'm so alone

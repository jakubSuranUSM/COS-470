If I should go, before you
When that long night comes
Well meet in the end; the after
Please dont follow me into the sun

If you should cross the white light
And find yourself in the black
I'll be right there behind you
You will have no need to look back

And when that night crawls itself away
Dying in the light of day
Our endless love will remain
Until we meet again

If I should go, before you
Into the great unknown
I'll leave my ghost right beside you
You won't have to wait alone

And when the night crawls itself away
Dying in the light of day
Our endless love will remain
Until we meet

Crying ourselves awake
Dying in the light of day
Our endless love will remain
Until we meet again

Oh, you can't say nothing to the pouring rain
And you can't say nothing till there's hope again
Say, oh my baby, you must never change
For we're only the ones we love

And I've stood stolen by the pauper's heart
Yes, I've stood stolen where the aching starts
But the way you watched it's a life apart

For we're only the ones we love
Only, only, you're the only one who could say
I could love this way, I could love this way

Oh, you can't get even with this kind of pain
But to see you steady brings the calm, again
Say, oh my baby, let them stay the same
For we're only the ones we love

And they've seen something which I'll never see
But I dreamed something when you fell for me
Yeah, I dreamed something which soars above

For we're only the ones we love, only the ones we love
Yes, love, love, this love, love

Oh, I get tired and I get old
But to see you steady brings a flood of gold
Say, oh, my baby, I've been taught and told

We're only the ones we love, only the ones we love
Love, love, this love

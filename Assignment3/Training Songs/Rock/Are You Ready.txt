Hey, Mr. Seeker Hold on to this advice
If you keep seeking you will find
Don't want to follow
Down roads been walked before

It's so hard to find unopened doors
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Hey, Mr. Hero Walking a thin, fine line
Under the microscope of life

Remember your roots, my friend
They're right down below
'Cause heroes come and heroes go
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Count down to the change in life that's soon to come
Your life has just begun

You can't see
Don't understand
You must be frightened
Or just stupid

You want everything?
Well, you must be joking

Grand Babylon
So much to answer for
Black and white
Corrosion of all

You want everything?
Well, you must be joking

Corrosion burning it down
Kerosene burning it down

You can't hear
Dialog of the deaf
Dumb and blind
But still in one mind

You kill what you fear
Well, you must be joking

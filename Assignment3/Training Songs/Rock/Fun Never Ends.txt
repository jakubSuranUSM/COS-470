back then
we wished that we were older
waiting for the summer
everything was new, when everything was fun
she would come over and slip into the water
i wonder if she knew that she was the one, everybody wanted,
every night she haunted us in our dreams then you wake up all alone 

all's fair in love and war, til it feels like you're dying alone
Tears turn to waterfalls but I I'd taste tears over nothing at all 

now, we wish that we were younger
that feeling of the hunger, to want to try everything and anything we want
frustration and the anger, never thinking of the danger or how we'd make it through
never thinking someone won't 

all's fair in love and war, til it feels like you're dying alone
tears turn to waterfalls but I'd taste tears over nothing at all 

the fun never ends
fun never ends,
the fun never ends
til you bury a friend, til you bury a friend, til you bury a friend

now, we wish that we were younger
that feeling of the hunger, to want to try everything and anything we want
frustration and the anger, never thinking of the danger,
or how we'd make it through
never thinking someone won't

all's fair in love and war, til it feels like you're dying alone
tears turn to waterfalls but I'd taste tears over nothing at all

fun never ends ... fun never ends ... fun never ends
til you bury a friend, bury a friend, bury a friend
til you bury a friend, bury a friend, bury a friend
til you bury a friend, bury a friend, bury a friend

My other half wants to run away with me
It's too hot and too fast
If you tell him once just let it be
We don't want love, no love

And if it's real like the ghost on the sea
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And if it's real like the ghost on the sea
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And is it real, and is it real
And is it real like the ghost on the sea?

If our emotions get to heavy to carry
All too hot and too fast
They won't know and we won't be sorry
We don't want love, no love

And is it real like the girls on TV?
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And is it real like those girls on TV?
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And is it real, and is it real
Is it real like those girls on TV?

Tick tick, do that trick trick
Tick tick, now you're sick
Hide in the closet, we kiss
Neither of us feeling this

And is it real like the girls on TV?
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And is it real like those girls on TV?
Shut up and smile 'cause you just cut into me
And this ain't real, and this ain't real
This ain't real like those girls on TV

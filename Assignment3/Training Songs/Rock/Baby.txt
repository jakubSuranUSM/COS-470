She left you standing in the hall
She said don't take it personal
Come on now b-b-b-baby carry on
It's time to sing a different song

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby!

You're entirely walking on your own
And that empty house just ain't a home
Come on now b-b-b-baby carry on
It's time to sing a different song
(Different song, different song, different song)

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby!

Wow!
One is one and two is three
It's time to live in ecstacy
Come on b-b-b-baby load your gun
From here on out it's hit and run

She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your ba-b-b-b-b-baby-ba-baby
She's not your baby!

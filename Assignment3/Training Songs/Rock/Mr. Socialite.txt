Late at night, things ain't right
A million thoughts, running 'round in my head
Closing the door, don't wanna hear no more
Made up my mind, everything has been said

You and me, we disagree, when I see white
Well then you see black, it's always the same
You'll never change your game, oh once you leave
There'll be no turning back, hey, hey

Spreading your name, with all your might
Your bridges don't burn, you're Mr. Socialite
When opportunity is right, if you are a name
He'll entertain you tonight

Better get used to it now baby
You know that time has come, it's calling you
Yes you chose to keep the distance
I'll tell you something, lately I don't know you at all

Hey, remember me?
We used to be two hungry hearts with one goal in mind
Gone are the days, we're living in a maze
How can the blind go on leading the blind, hey hey

Spreading your name, with all your might
Your bridges don't burn, you're Mr. Socialite
When opportunity is right, if you are a name
He'll entertain you tonight.

Saint Paul's is for soul salvage
9th Street for my fennel and leek
$10 is my lottery ticket and…
I get a haircut from the Vietnamese
(So come on)

Johnny's Market and Mario Lanza's
Jackie Wilson…Reet Petite
I been a prisoner to a white Mr. Coffee
Down here on Christian Street

So Come on
Come on
Come on…

The sun rises on a statue of Mary
The old ladies file into commune
A fat guy in a blue Members Only
Knocks and disappears into a private backroom
The corner payphone is for bettin' the numbers
The pizza joint is for peppers and eggs
The black boys all down in the schoolyard
Dance all crazy with the rubbery legs

So Come on
Come on
Come on…

Six AM up at the Golden Donut
In the evening they still ring the bells
Stop by the Smockey for a short amoretto
When the moon comes up a risin' like a giant pizelle
Raise a glass a red wine or whiskey
Toast Belle Vista and my landlord too
Where'd you go Mr. Rocky Balboa?
Angelo Bruno, what has happened to you?

So Come on
Come on
Come on…

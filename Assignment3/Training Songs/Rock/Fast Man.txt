Someone said, I should leave
Shook my head, no, no, no
Tangled web that we weave
So I said, I will go

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

I go a thousand miles 'fore I get me to sleep
You think I'm exaggerating, baby?
That ain't nothing to me
See me I'm gunning it just as fast as I can

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

Though I am such a fool
If I can, I'll be driving to the end
Here I am in Ullapool, I haven't a plan
Just to turn me 'round again

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

I go a thousand miles before I get me to sleep
You think I'm exaggerating baby?
That ain't nothing to me
See me, I'm gunning it just as fast as I can

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

Here I am, here I am
I'm just lost again, everyday
Here I am outside Cheyenne

Trying to get back to sleep
Under the stars, scenic view after dark
Full of fret as I weep
Listening to cars as they pull in for a park

In Cheyenne
In Cheyenne, oh, oh

I go a thousand miles 'fore I get me to sleep
You think I'm exaggerating, baby?
That ain't nothing to me
See me, I'm gunning it just as fast as I can

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

Here I am, here I am
I'm just lost again, everyday
Here I am outside Cheyenne

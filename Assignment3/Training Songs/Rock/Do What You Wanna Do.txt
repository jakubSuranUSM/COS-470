I’ve been heading home
I’ve been going wrong
It’s been this way for so long

Let me hear you say it
(I’ve been heading home)
Let me hear you say
(I’ve been going wrong)
It’s been this way for so long
(It’s been this way for so long)

You do what you wanna do 
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way 
And people speak I hear them saying
You won’t last another day

You keep me hanging on
I won’t ever be gone
We know that something is wrong

Let me hear you say it
(I’ve been heading home)
Let me hear you say
(I’ve been going wrong)
It’s been this way for so long
(It’s been this way for so long)

You do what you wanna do 
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way 
And people speak I hear them saying
You won’t last another day

You do what you wanna do 
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way 
And people speak I hear them saying
You won’t last another day
You won’t last another day

Glistening
Forget blindfolded deathbed promises
You've gotta dig too deep to ever find conviction
Forget blindfolded deathbed promises
'Cause it ain't easy to find the words
It ain't easy to find the words to slam the nails down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down
Hallow means there's nothing to hold it up
The substance loses definition
They fill these heads with thoughts to recite not to vision
So it ain't easy to find the words
It ain't easy to find the words to slam the nails down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down
Forget blindfolded death bed promises
You've gotta dig too deep to ever find conviction
Forget blindfolded death bed promises
'Cause it ain't easy to find the words
It ain't easy to find the words to slam the nails down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down
Commit yourself
Commit yourself
Get down

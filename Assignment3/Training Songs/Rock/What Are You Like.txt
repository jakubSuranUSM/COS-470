Today my mind is drawing a blank
I canvas you to color this in
There?s no gas left in the tank
You?ve always got your engines running

You?ve got no whip when the beast lays down
And feeds upon the rest has finally found

What are you like?
My open door revolver
What are you like?
My go to problem solver
You shine a light in the darkest corners of my mind
What are you like?
You?re that kind

I cover mirrors with the clocks (cover mirrors with the clocks)
I?m getting superstitious lately (you don?t ever brush it off)
But you don?t ever brush it off (you won?t cover me to safety)
You won?t cover me to safety

While I?m sitting on this couch
You?re up and figuring it out

What are you like?
My open door revolver
What are you like?
My go to problem solver
You shine a light in the darkest corners of my mind
What are you like?

The Greek chorus of our little play
You?ll explain me when I act this way
And as we go along
The unwritten song breaks through
And it?s all about you

What are you like? (You?re an open door)
What are you like? (You?re the best and more)
What are you like? (You?re a sacred text)
What are you like? (You?re what?s coming next)
What are you like? (You?re my open door (X3))

Words and Music: Mike Connell
Sometimes I get the feeling things won't fall apart.
Sometimes I think it's gone too far.
Sometimes I get the feeling things seems pretty nice.
Then again sometimes I'd like to leave you twice.
Once we decide upon it
We won't fall apart.
This time I think it's gone too far.
And you get where you can't decide --
Don't ask any other.
And you get where you can't decide.
Didn't I say "sorry."
Didn't I say "dear."
Didn't I consider.
Didn't I stand clear.
Didn't you say "new boy get down on your knees."
Did I say "trying, I'm trying, I'm trying."

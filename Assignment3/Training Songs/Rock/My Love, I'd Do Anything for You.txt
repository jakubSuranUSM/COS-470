Teach your kids to recognize and despise all the propaganda
Filtered down by the dead echelons mainstream media
Hey hey hey hey

You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you

Weren't we all born to mourn and to yawn at the occupations
That control everyday of our lives we can't live as we wish
Live as we wish
Live as we wish

Hey hey, you know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society is hell
You need me just like I need you, oh

You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you, oh

We all go our own wasy separately in the same direction
And here am I every night of my life always missing someone

Oh hey

I'd like to be rotted out just before I become aware of the pain
The more I wish, in my heart for someone the less likely they come
Oh hey, oh hey, oh hey, oh hey
Aw well

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
A mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
Whoo, see my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

Well, I went to see my doctor just the other day
And I've got to tell you what the man had to say
Well, he said, "hey, boy, you just gotta slow down
You can't keep a-traipsin' all over town
After givin' you a physical check
I've come to the conclusion you're a total wreck"

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
A mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
Whoo, see my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

I've made up my mind, I'd better change my ways
My shattered nerves have seen better days
Well, there's no more girls for a week or two 
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew
No more movies or stayin' out late
My baby have to find herself another date

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
Mmm, a mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
Hoo-wee, see my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

Gazing on the seaweed skies
Falling down before your eyes
He can show you (show you)

Have you met my Uncle Jack 
Have you met my Uncle Jack 
Wonder what you're all about
He can bring the inside out
He can show you (show you)

'So many lives to live' - I heard him say
'But some people live to give themselves away'
'To find peace of mind, waiting where they can't get it'

Standing there, he's so deceiving
Has he been or is he leaving
Looking in his sea green eyes
Uncle Jack will tell no lies
Can you see it 

'So many lives to live' - I heard him say
'But some people live to give themselves away'
'To find peace of mind, waiting where they can't get it'

Have you met my Uncle Jack 
I want to take you in hand
Let you see and you will understand
I can show you

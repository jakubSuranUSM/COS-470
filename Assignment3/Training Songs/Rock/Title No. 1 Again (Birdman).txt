Straight from my home 
Late at night 
By the back door

Search for a light 
That might show me the way

Shotgun in hand
I left a three time loser

A face that was seen 
But not going to see

Unchain my hands
Now I've got my freedom

Highways I've roamed 
Looking for the distant faces
Gold on the border
And silver in my hands

Meantime I stay
Alone and never changing
And if I did
No one got in my way

Unchain my hands
Now I've got my freedom

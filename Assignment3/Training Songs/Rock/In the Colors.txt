When your whole world is shaken
From all the risks we have taken
Dance with me, dance with me
Into the colours of the dusk

When you have woken
From all the dreams broken
Come and dance with me, dance with me
Into the colours of the dusk
Dance with me
Into the colours of the dusk

The paths we're walking on
They crumble behind us
But if we leave now, they will never
They will never find us

If this crazy world
Spins itself dawn to dusk
I wanna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, colour

When you again start hopin'
With your arms wide open
Come on, dance with me, oh, dance with me
Into the colours of the dusk

And all will be right, will be right
That sing in like water with the light
Oh, dance with me, won't you dance with me
Into the colours of the dusk
Oh, dance with me into the colours of the dusk
Dance with me to the colours of the dusk

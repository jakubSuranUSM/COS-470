I would like to tell you, I would like to say
That I knew that this would happen
That things would go this way
But I cannot deceive you, this was never planned
I know that you're the right girl but do you think that I am the right man?

1...2...3...4,5,6,7,
Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run cause
(but I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna)

You say it's not a problem, You say it's meant to be
But love is not an option, our love is never free
And things are not so easy, so cold and we've been burned
I know that I'll have regrets but that's the price of one more lesson learned

1..2..3...4,5,6,7,
Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run cause
(but I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)

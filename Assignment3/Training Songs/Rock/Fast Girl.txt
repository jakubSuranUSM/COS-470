Always such a fast girl
Always such a fast girl
Always such a fast girl
Always such a...fast...girl
Are you this involved with everything?
Take back this, hey where do I begin?

Always such a fast girl
Always such a...fast...girl
Are you this involved with everything?

Knew it couldn't last well
I showed you
I can't breathe
I'll be home soon
Are you this involved in everything?
Are you this involved with everything?

As I said come back for me
The back burn kept us high and dry, dry
High and dry, dry

Nothing left for us to steal
My fast girl
I can't leave
I'll breathe more soon
Are you this involved in everything?
Are you this involved with everything?

When I said get back to me
The back burn kept us high and dry, dry
High and dry, dry
High and..

Break apart
Break her, break her
Break apart
Break her, break her

Always such a fast girl
Always such a...fast...girl
Are you this involved in everything?
Are you this involved with everything?

Are you this involved in everything?
Are you this involved with everything?
Always such a fast girl
Always such a...fast..girl

I've seen too much, best I should run
I can't escape from what I've done
This ship was never meant to sink
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy

As I stare hard into the sun
I can't believe just what I'd done
Did you put something in my drink?
Jealousy, jealousy

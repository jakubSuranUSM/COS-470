"I don't mind about the war, that's one of the things I like to watch, if it's a war going on, 'cause then I know if our side's winning, if our side's losing..."
(switch channels)
What God wants God gets God help us all
What God wants God gets (repeated)
The kid in the corner looked at the priest
And fingered his pale blue Japanese guitar
The priest said:

God wants goodness
God wants light
God wants mayhem
God wants a clean fight

What God wants God gets
Don't look so surprised
It's only dogma
The alien prophet cried
The beetle and the springbok
Took the Bible from its hook
The monkey in the corner
Wrote the lesson in his book
What God wants God gets God help us all

God wants peace
God wants war
God wants famine
God wants chain stores

What God wants God gets

God wants sedition
God wants sex
God wants freedom
God wants semtex

What God wants God gets
Don't ok so surprised
I'm only joking
The alien comic cried
The jackass and hyena
Took the feather from its hook
The monkey in the corner
Wrote the joke down in his book
What God wants God gets

God wants borders
God wants crack
God wants rainfall
God wants wetbacks

What God wants God gets

God wants voodoo
God wants shrines
God wants law
God wants organised crime
God wants crusade
God wants jihad
God wants good
God wants bad

What God wants God Gets

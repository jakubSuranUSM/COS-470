I still see the two of us together 
When the winter wind blows cold 
You can't get lost as long as you remember 
If you know where the highway goes 

I may never find out where it is 
But I might reach you with a drive-by kiss 

And its wrong to think about forever 
When you know it doesn't last 
But if you try to run away from your memory 
You can't ever drive too fast 

You may never find out who it is 
But I might reach you with a drive-by kiss 

And it's a sad way 
To say hello 
But if you sleep it off, 
Will you let me know? 

Say good-bye
But don't let me go 

I may never find out where it is 
But I might reach you with a drive-by kiss 
Say good-bye to part of me I miss 
With a drive-by kiss 

I didn't know it would come to this 
I hope I can say what I never did 
With a drive-by kiss

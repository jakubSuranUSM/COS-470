D'na: 

I'm calling you
I'm calling you now
And now won't wait
And now won't change now
Or rearrange
it might get strange now
it might get strange now

Tricky and D'na: 

Just fallin' free
Just fall in me
And i'm your coffin
And I'm your coffin
For endless sleep now
For endless sleep now

Little sunbeam
I hear you scream
I feel your heat now
I feel your heat now
Here's to one way sleep now
I hear trees scream
Ain't the people mean?
What do they mean?
It's time to sleep now
It's time to go now

I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you

Little sunbeam
I can hear you scream
I can feel your heat now
I can feel your heat now
Here's to one way sleep now
I hear trees scream
Ain't the people mean?
What do they mean?
It's time to sleep now
It's time to go now

I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I wait for you, i hate for you
I wait for you, i hate for you
I wait for you, i hate for you
I wait for you, i hate for you
I wait for you, i hate for you

Hate for you

I wait for you, I wait for you
I wait for you, I hate for you
I hate for you
Hate for you
I hate for you
I can feel your heat now
It's time to go now

Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off, walked off, walked off, to look for America

Kathy, I said, as we boarded the greyhound in Pittsburg
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
Took me four days to from Saginaw
They've all gone to look for amer-America
All gone to look for amer-America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with faces
She said the man in the garberdian suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bowtie is really a camera

Kathy I'm lost, I said
Though I knew she was sleeping
Well, I'm empty and aching and I don't know why I'm
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
And they've all gone to look for amer-America
All gone to look for amer-America

Kathy I'm lost, I said
Although I knew she was sleeping
Well, I'm empty & aching & I don't know why I'm
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
And they've all gone to look for amer-America
All gone to look for amer-America
All gone to look for amer-America

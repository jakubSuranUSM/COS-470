Kneel down
Close your eyes
Hit the ground
I want you to, to kneel all day
Alone in this desolate cave
So I said
Scream if you want to
Cause no one is around
I want you to
To scream all day
'Cause there's eleven words that I've rehearsed to say

And I say
How I love to hate you! (repeat)

You're
Not so brave
When I'm the snake
And you're my prey
Let me tell you I'll eat all day
Alone in this desolate cave
So I say
Squeal if you want to
Cause no
No one is around
I want you to
To squeal all day
'Cause there's eleven words that I've rehearsed to say

And I say
How I love to hate you! (repeat)
James, how I love to hate you
Oh, how I love
How I love to hate you

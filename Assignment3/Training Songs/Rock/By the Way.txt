OK and by the way
I wanna say that I think you're great
And I know what people say
I'm on my breaker it's just my way
But you know how those rumors last
Always judged by what's in your past
But their not true
That wasn't you

I want you
Could it be that simple? 
I tried to only ask before 
I was thinking this one 
This place
This dream
So sure 
And I often wonder
About this time of mine 
Oh I get your answer
Inside your shiny eyes 

It's you and by the way
I've never been this happy before 
You turning on my way
When I get out the words
I adore you

I look at you 
Your eyes are wet 
You tell me you're not ready yet
To give it all
Feel my heart fall

I want you
It truly is that simple
But you want to go back
It makes my whole world 
Crash down just feel so black
And I often wonder 
About this time of mine
But it seems your answers
Just a few behind 

Cause I want you
It truly is that simple 
But you want to go back
It makes my whole world 
Crash down just feel so black
And I often wonder 
About this time of mine
It seems my eyes just flew by
The lies behind your eyes

Hey, yeah, come on get in the car 
Hey, yeah, come on get in the car

This song goes out to no one but me
But I'll try just to sing a little harder
Hey, come on get in the car
Don't you wish that we could go for a ride, well
Hey, come on get in the car
Do you wanna bet

It's the same you're allergic and addicted I'm free
Another guess that you're gonna get smarter
This song goes out to no one but me
But I'll try just to sing a little harder
Yeah yeah

Hey, come on get in the car
Don't you wish that we could go for a ride, well
Hey, come on get in the car
Do you wanna bet
Hey, yeah, come on get in the car
Hey, yeah, come on get in the car

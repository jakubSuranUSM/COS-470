When the world is coming down on you
And your back's against the wall
Change the glass that you've been looking through

It's only half full after all
If you feel like giving up
If you feel you've had enough
Let it go, don't you know

You can come and kick the bottom out
Stomp your feet scream and shout
Let it go, let it go

It's never quite as bad as you think it is
'Cause every bad day turns around
Forgive yourself for all the things you did
The vertical man don't lay down
If you feel like giving up

If you feel you've had enough
Let it go, don't you know
Come on, kick the bottom out
Stomp your feet scream and shout
Let it go, let it go

And when the sun comes shining through for you
You'll discover even rainbows have the blues
Yes I know it's not news to you
Am I getting through  to you

If you feel like giving up
Don't you know life is tough
Let it go, Let it Go

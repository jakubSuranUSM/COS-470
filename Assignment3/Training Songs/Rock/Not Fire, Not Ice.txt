There is not a river wide
Not a mountain high
And neither sin nor evil
Could change how I feel inside
Could change how I feel inside
Not all the strength of the ocean
Not all the heat from the sun
From the sun
From the sun
The weathers dry I just can't deny
For me 
You are the one
For me you are the one
But true love is priceless
For true  love we pay the price
But there's nothing 
Can keep me from loving you
Not fire
No not ice
Not fire
No not ice
Like a hero
Or the champion
You are the best
You're the best
Like religion
Or superstition
With you I am blessed
With you I am blessed
Now the river may grow wider
The mountains may reach past the sky
And whether or not you feel the same
My love shall never die
My love shall never die
But true love is give and take
True love is sacrifice
And there's nothing can keep me from loving you
Not fire
No not ice
Not fire
No not ice
Not fire
No not ice

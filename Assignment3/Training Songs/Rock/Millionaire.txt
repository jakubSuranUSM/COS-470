Sweet can it guess to figure as a forty minute ride
You drive it and I'll spend it looking out my window
Sweet sound the door the shadows painted and the light he saw
The way I'm seeing now so clear, like diamonds on the water

A medal with me and you'll meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love them like a millionaire
Medals on your prominition rags
You just need to know yourself
And love them like a millionaire

Her faded glamour out of season as the ages pass
Desperate for inspiration as the months run down like rain
Sweet sound the door I stood outside your door
And saw the lights out shining in the summer the way the light shines out the water

A medal with me and you'll meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love them like a millionaire
Medals on your prominition rags
You just need to know yourself
And love them like a millionaire
Like a lover, like a lover, like a lover

A medal with me and you'll meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love them like a millionaire
Medals on your prominition rags
You just need to know yourself
And love them like a millionaire
Like a millionaire

Now here ya come baby 
With yer tail draggin` the gravy 
Y` know yer P`s `n Q`s 
What ya don`t know baby 

Is you givin` me the blues 
Ya got juice on your chin 
Eggs on the drain-board 
Pie on the wall 

Dirt on the rug 
I come home late 
`N I stumbled `n swore 
Ya won`t even give me a hug 

Ya had my things all laid out by the door 
I`m leavin` 
I`m gonna take up with ah mermaid 
`N leave you land lubbin` women alone 

`N leave you land-lubbin` women alone 
Ya said ya had it together once 
Now yer head`s around the bend 
I`m tellin` ya woman 

Ya better get it bach together again 
I`m gonna grow fins 
`N go back in the water again 
If ya don`t leave me alone 

I`m gonna take up with ah mermaid 
`N leave you land-lubbin` women alone 
`N leave you land-lubbin` women alone 
Now here ya come baby 

With yer tail draggin` the gravy 
Ya know yer P`s `n Q`s 
What ya don`t know woman 
Is yer givin` me the blues

All non-believers stand aside and fear
A new day's marching through the door
How could you ever think you'd make it here'
Did it bleed' Was it sore
Through the struggles you've endured'

You've come so far from innocence
Provided all the consequence
Only what does it matter now'

'Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be if you never owed them anything
And now you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
Spend your time well before you go, here in hell

Your living ends before the engineer
What was your motive in this fight'
(Did they play you for the weaker of them')
How could you ever think you'd make it here'
Was it greed that pushed your heart
Through the struggles you've endured'

You've come so far from innocence
Provided all the consequence
Only what does it matter now'

'Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be if you never owed them anything
And now you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
Spend your time well before you go, here in hell

(There's a hell in all of us)
Spend your time well before you go
(There's a hell in all of us)
You've lost, it's all your own

(There's a hell in all of us)
There are no secrets you can hide
(There's a hell in all of us)
From yourself, in your mind, leave the worst of all behind

'Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be if you never owed them anything
And now you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home

'Cause you're going home, you're running free
As only you would be if you never owed them anything
And now you've found your way out
In the trust you've seen your path on home
Spend your time well before you go, here in hell

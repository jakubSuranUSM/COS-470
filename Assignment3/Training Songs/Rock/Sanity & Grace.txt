I would have sworn I could have flown
There were some things I hadn't known
Stripped to the soul I'd reached the bone
In sanity and grace

You gave me wings but took the sky
I am caught in a world that's flying by
Right on course headed to the dawn
Where my heart has gone

I had a dream that we were free
Free to sail on just you and me
Far from the force of gravity
Flung to the brightest star
There is a dream beyond my dream
Wearing a face I'd seldom seen
I caught a glimpse within your eyes
I saw the shadow rise

Through miles of stars
A sea of light 
Bright as a beacon on the darkest night
Love finds a way
Through stars and stones 
To let us know we are already home
Already

Half of my heart wants you to stay
Laugh at the night and rue the day
Born on the wings of a night that burns
Loving to be unlearned

Better than nothing half a heart
Better to go than not to start
Who can I ask? Who knows the part
Of sanity and grace

It could have been a fantasy
Was I in truth already free
Could I pretend I did not see
Say there was not a trace
Where would I hide the truth of you
What would I do that I could do
Gone are the things I thought I knew
Of sanity and grace

Through miles of stars
A sea of light 
Bright as a beacon on the darkest night
Love finds a way
Through stars and stones 
To let us know we are already home
Already

I am a fool but I am real
Caught in a wheel within a wheel
Taught by the jewel and the seal
Burned in the fire and lace
Leave me before the sun can rise
Go while the moon is in the skies
Casting their diamonds on the lake
Waters and hearts can break

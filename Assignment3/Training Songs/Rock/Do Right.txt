Won't make the bed up straight
I always stay out late
I never take you out
Ask what you're all about

I always smell like smoke
Everything's just a joke
I never look at you
When you come hear me sing 

These are not all of the
Many simple things
You can find wrong with me
Once would you tell me please

What do I do What do I do right
I never talk to you
Be who you want me to
My music's way too loud

My friends are all so proud
Say I'm just wasted hope
I could not thread the rope
More than my pocket's broke

And you don't see a ring
These are not all of the
Infinitesimal things
You can find wrong with me

Once would you tell me please
What do I do What do I do right
Never wanted to play in this game
Yes, you're right

But losing the game doesn't mean
That we're losing the fight
What do I do what do I do, right
Won't make the bed up straight

I always stay out, great
But what do I do what do I do that is right

Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you want to go, get on below
Pinking out the day, dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love, it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on, hi di ho
Pinking out the black, dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue, now it's undone

I got some dirty boots, yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots

Hey!

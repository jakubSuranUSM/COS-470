If time had a place,
And space for your past.

Like a little novel,
I wanted to read again and again,
Would I be in your novel,
Would I begin and end in it.

If I had a place,
And space for your little boy eyes,
Could you really believe,
I certainly dare you,
I do not want to scare you,
Anymore.

Oh what a fuss when the king rides by,
Oh what a fuss when the king rides,
Straight through my heart,
Straight through my life.

I need your love more than you'd ever know.

If I kissed and touched your hand,
A million things I will never understand,
Oh what a fuss when the king trades in,
Oh what a fuss when the king trades.

Oh love, my love, for someone else's hand,
Needing love more than you'll ever know.

You don't miss your water,
You don't miss your water,
'Till your well is gone.

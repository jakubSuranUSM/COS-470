Ooh, let's call out now to the valley down below
You'll have to burn this house down so we can find a home
Or you'll tear it down now or return to dust man

The devil's got a holda me
The devil's got a holda me
The devil's got a holda me

Well, it's a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely road
The ground, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's so damn cold
We're all in the same mess alone, no love
No lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, oh no

Oh, let's have a special bed for them, a bed that bones just like seats
A bed that's not red, it's cold like their heads I watch chrome
In their forms and twisted fears or feel the four winds

Devil's got a holda me
The Devil's got a holda me
The Devil's got a holda me

Well, it's a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely road
The ground, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's so damn cold
We're all in the same mess alone, no love
No lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, oh

The devil's got a holda me, the devil's got a holda me
The devil's got a holda me, the devil's got a holda me
The devil's got a holda me, the devil's got a holda me
The devil's got a holda me, the devil's got a holda me

Ooh, it's a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely road
The ground, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's so damn cold
We're all in the same mess alone oh, no, no love
No lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, oh no

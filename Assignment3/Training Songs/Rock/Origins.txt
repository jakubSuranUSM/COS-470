Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start
Meant to play the penitent part
Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find
Tempted fate and knowledge divine
View in there a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere?

[Chorus]
Is it so hard to forgive the way
That we’ve been made to live?
how much is required to set things right?
Have you confused your power with mine?

Oh whoa oh

View in there a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere?
Imminent you seem to be
a picture of fragility
What is it that you think of me?
Is it a woman that you see?

[Chorus x2]

Is it so hard to forgive the way
That we’ve been made to live?
how much is required to set things right?
Have you confused your power with mine?

Oh whoa oh
Oh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

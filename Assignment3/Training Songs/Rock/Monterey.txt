The people came and listened
Some of them came and played
Others gave flowers away, yes they did
Down in Monterey
Down in Monterey

Young Gods smiled upon the crowd
Their music being born of love
Children danced night and day
Religion was being born
Down in Monterey

The birds and the airplane did fly
Oh, Ravi Shankars music made me cry
The Who exploded into fire and light
Hugh Masakela's music was black as night
The Grateful Dead blew everybodies mind
Jimi Hendrix baby, believe me, set the world on fire, 
yeah
His Majesty, Prince Jones, smiled as he moved among the
crowd
Ten thousand electric guitars were grooving real loud, 
yeah

You want to find the truth in life
Don't pass music by
And you know I would not lie, no I would not lie, 
No, I would not lie
Down in Monterey

Three days of understanding of moving with one another
Even the cops grooved with us
Do you believe me, yeah?
Down in Monterey

I think that maybe I'm dreaming
Monterey
Down in monterey
Did you hear what I said?

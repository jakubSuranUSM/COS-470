Hey now, the well run dry 
Pages of your book on fire 
Read the writing 
On the wall 

Hoe down, it's a show-down 
Ev'rywhere you look, we're fighting 
Hear the call 

And you know it's gettin' stronger 
I can't last very much longer 
Turn to stone 

Well there's a change in the wind 
You know the signs don't lie 
Such a strange feelin' 
And I don't know why it's takin' 
Such a long time 

Backyard people 
And they work all day 
Tired of the speeches and the way 
That the reasons keep changin' 
Just to make the words rhyme 

And you know it's gettin' stronger 
Can't make 'em run much longer 
Turn to stone

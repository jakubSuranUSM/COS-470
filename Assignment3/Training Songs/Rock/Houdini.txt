Yes, I am trying to figure it out
You must have some special powers alright
No, I'm not sure how you're working things out
You must have some special powers alright

You're like a demon
No one else would believe me
But I know the things you do
Yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know that it's true

Black magic ain't suppose to working these days
That's why I find it so hard to believe
That you ain't got connections with any ghost
Or any spirit who's setting you free, setting you free

You're like a demon
No one else would believe me
But I know the things you do
Yes, I know, yes, I know, yes, I know that it's true

And then you're like a demon
No one else would believe me
You're like a demon
Use your powers to free me

You're like a demon, you're like a demon
You're like a demon, you're like a demon
You're like a demon
Use your powers to free me

You're like a demon, you're like a demon
You're like a demon, yeah

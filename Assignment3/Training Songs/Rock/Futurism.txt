Ignorance pulls 
Apostasy and apathy still rules 
Yeah you know it's cool 
Just suck and see 
A future turn us into silent gods 
And i won't miss you at all 

Grounded 
Boxed in 
Like the evil in your veins 
Grounded 
Boxed in 
I am stuck with you

Fate can't decide 
Alignment of the planets in your hands 
Come on crush our plans 
Just suck and see 
A future that won't let you disagree 
And i won't miss you at all

Grounded 
Boxed in 
Like the evil in your veins 
Grounded
Boxed in

Feeling feeling everything
Feeling feeling everything

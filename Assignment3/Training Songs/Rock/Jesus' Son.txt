Stand, stand to attention
The moment's passed you by
Now is the rest of your life
Dare, dare I to mention
Your laughter makes me cry
A speck of dust in my eye

And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son

Bone, bone of contention
I've lost the count of times
I've seen you fucking goodbye
So good, orderly direction
To pull you from the mire
Your universe on fire

And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son

And I am unafraid and blissful
Here I come
I am unashamed at getting nothing done
I'm a cavalcade that tumbles one by one
But I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son
I'm okay, just like Jesus' Son

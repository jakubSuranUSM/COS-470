I heard the wise man is always right. 
Never seen forgiveness in his eyes. 
You want more and more, I bleed everyday. 
Am I confused or getting insane. 

And when it all ends. 
It's like a little rains. 
I rather lay down and die. 
And feel like a fool. 
If I'm right, I'm satisfied. 

It's a killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time 
You going down down down down. 
Killing time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time 
You going down down down down. 

I wonder how it feels to leave without soul. 
How low you might go before you know. 
Your hands are good for nothing, I'm the one to blame. 
Cause in the end there's nothing left anyway. 

And when it all ends. 
It's like a little rains. 
I rather lay down and die. 
And feel like a fool. 
If I'm right, I'm satisfied. 

It's a killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time 
You going down down down down. 
Killing time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time 
You going down down down down down. 

It's a killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time, 
Killing time, killing time 
You going down down down down. 
Killing time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time, 
Killing Time, Killing Time 
You going down down down down down.

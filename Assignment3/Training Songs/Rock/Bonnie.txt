Your silver nights and golden days
I try to reach you in a million ways
IÂ´m crazy Â´bout you bonnie
Can you tell?

Your diamond rings and fancy clothes
Do I want you babe, well heaven knows
IÂ´m wild about you bonnie
CanÂ´t you see, hey bonnie

IÂ´ve loved you oh so long
I know weÂ´d get along
Hey bonnie will you ever notice me

Yes I know you oh so well
Just one look and I fell
Please tell me that our love will always be

IÂ´ve seen your films and all your plays
I read about you every single day
IÂ´d like to get my lovinÂ´arms Â´round you

From rags to which youÂ´ve got it made
How does it feel to be a famous name
Well bonnie can you do the same for me
Oh bonnie

I feel you in my soul
To love you is my role
Oh bonnie youÂ´re the only one for me

Yes I got my fortune read
And hereÂ´s what the gypsy said
That weÂ´ll live and love and share eternity

Bonnie please be nice
WeÂ´ll find paradise
Beneath the golden skies

Bonnie youÂ´re good
Make me if you could
The toast of hollywood

IÂ´ll give you all my love
WeÂ´ll really live it up
Beneath the stars above

Your silver nights and golden days
I try to reach you in a million ways
IÂ´m crazy Â´bout you bonnie
Can you tell

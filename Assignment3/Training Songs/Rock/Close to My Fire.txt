Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So won’t you come close to my fire?

Baby, it’s cold when you’re gone
Don’t make me wait, wait too long
Whenever you’re near I have all this feeling
You’re melting me down
Oh, I’m a believer

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So won’t you come close to my fire?

Boy you are my symptom delusion
You’re melting me down, my resolution
I can escape, can’t say I’m trying
You say my name , oh I can’t hide it
So come on, shoot down
Don’t smoke it down
You can’t stop craving til you come around
I can’t deny it, I’m right here at home
My fever is waiting
Oh you know I want ya

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So won’t you come close to my fire?

Close to my fire

Ain’t no need to tell me why
Ain’t no need to tell me why
Because you know I want you to…

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up
Oh yea yea yea, You light me up
Oh come on, You light me up!
Close to my fire
Come come come come close to my fire

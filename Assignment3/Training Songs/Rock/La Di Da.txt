Dead good at faking all the romance
Only seventeen
Shot down, waiting for the action
It's a beauty

Won't you take me for a walk?
Don't you wanna show me off?
Won't you take me for a walk?
I need attention

You're all la di da
Drivin' round in your flashy car
You're all la di da di da
You're all la di da
But I know who you really are
You're all la di da di da
Di da!

Drop down, losing her virginity
Like some common tart
Short change, instead of a serenity
Some broken heart

Won't you take me for a walk?
Don't you wanna show me off?
Won't you take me for a walk?
I need attention

You're all la di da
Drivin' round in your fancy car
You're all la di da di da
You're all la di da
But I know who you really are
You're all la di da di da

Does she know how much she's taken?
Who cares what the girl is saying?
La di da!

Drip dry, empty on peroxide
Turn it on for me
Slip slide, baby's got a free ride
It's a beauty

You're all la di da
Drivin' round in your flashy car
You're all la di da di da
You're all la di da
But I know who you really are
You're all la di da di da
La di da

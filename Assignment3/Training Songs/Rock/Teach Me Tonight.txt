Did you say I've got a lot to learn well don't think I'm not trying not to learn
Since this has been the perfect spot to learn teach me tonight
Starting with the ABC of it right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you about a thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear my love should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduations almost here my love teach me tonight

One thing isn't very clear my love should the teacher stand so near my love
Graduations almost here my love teach me tonight
(Teach me teach me tonight)

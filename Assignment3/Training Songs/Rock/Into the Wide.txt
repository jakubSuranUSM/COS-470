At the end of the last road in town
At the edge of that wall of trees
Further in, past any trail or sign
Back to the wide open arms of the Earth

The wind whispered no name
but it’s voice cracked off the cliff
Almost see it rush right through you
Back to the wide open arms of the Earth

It’s a grind, the business role
Every new year, a new bell to toll
Before it’s too late, I’m gonna save my soul
Back to the wide open arms of the Earth

Last night I was dreaming, dreamed about the H-bomb
Well, the bomb went off and I was caught
I was the only man on the ground
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
Thirteen women and only one man in town
And as funny as it may be
The one and only man in town was me
Well, thirteen woman and me the only man around

I had two girls every morning
Seeing that I was well fed
And believe you me, one sweetened my tea
While another one buttered my bread
Two girls gave me my money
Two girls made me my clothes
And another sweet thing, bought me a diamond ring
About forty carats I suppose
Well, thirteen women and only one man in town
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
It was something I can't forget
Because I think of those thirteen women yet
Well, thirteen woman and only one man around

I had three girls dancing the mambo
Three girls balling the jack
And all of the rest really did their best
Boy, they sure were a lively pack
I thought I was in heaven
And all of these angels were mine
But I woke up and ended the dream
'Cause I had to get to work on time
Well, a-thirteen women and only one man in town
There was a-thirteen women and only one man in town
No, I can't tell you where I've been
'Cause I kind of think that someday I'll go back again
To those thirteen women and me the only man around
Well, a-thirteen women and me the only man around 
Well, a-thirteen women and me the only man around

Baby before hangaround this old moldy, mildewy, n crappy
Scene holding hands wit you!
Here`s a whole list of things you`re gonna have to do
Jump off the Empire State in a paper sack!
Talking lovey-dovey to a camel scare the hump off his back
Get the Queen of England`s golden shoes
Put `em on your feet and sing the St. Louis blues...Look here!

Seven days a week with you is more than I can handle
Seven nights of love and dirty laundry on your floor
Baby I can see this whole thing heading into trouble, I'm out the door

I'm not your man cause you're looking for a hero, baby it ain't me
I'm not your man, I ain't nothing 2 hold on 2, baby I ain't what U need

It's easy being here but I've got ground to cover
There's nothing you can do to make me wanna stay
Though I've been here awhile don't think that I've stopped moving
I'm on my way

I'm not your man 'cause you're looking for a hero, baby it ain't me
I'm not your man, I ain't nothing 2 hold on 2, baby I ain't what U need

'I might be a clown but I can get down on my guitar, so hear y'all!

I'm not the one you're gonna take home to your daddy
I'm not the one to sit around with making plans (I'm not your man)
I'm not the one you're gonna settle down & marry, I'm not your man

I'm not your man, cause you're looking for a hero, baby it ain't me
I'm not your man, I'm not the one U wanna cry to, baby in your sleep
I'm not your man, cause you're looking for a hero
I'm not your man, I ain't nothing to hold on to...

There ain't no tomorrow baby there's just right now
(I'm not your man)
You know you got to have some fun while you still know how
(I'm not your man)
Do a monkey-chasing line up a coconut tree (I'm not your man)
A sweet little angel that I ain't ever gonna be! (I-I-I-I-I-ooh)
(I'm not your man...I'm not your man...I'm not your man...I-I-I-I-I-ooh)
(I'm not your man) All the way (I'm not your man) Like I said
(I'm not your man) Look here! (I-I-I-I-I-ooh)
(I'm not your man) All the way (I'm not your man) Hey
(I'm not your man) Look out, y'gotta look out! (I-I-I-I-I-ooh) Oh
(I'm not your man) All the way...[fade]

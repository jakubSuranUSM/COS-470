I was lost and blind 'til a friend of mine
Came and took me by the hand
Then he led me to his kingdom
That was in another land
Now my life is changed, it's rearranged
When I think of my past I feel so strange
Wowie, zowie, well he saved my soul
He's the rock that doesn't roll

He's the rock that doesn't roll
He's the rock that doesn't roll
He's good for the body and great for the soul
He's the rock that doesn't roll

I was all alone like a rolling stone
I was going nowhere fast
I was on the road so far from home
When the future touched my past
Now I feel so blessed 'cause he gave me a rest
And I finally feel like I've passed the test
I wanna be like him, yes that's my goal
Like a rock that doesn't roll

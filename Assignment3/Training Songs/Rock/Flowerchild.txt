I fell into your forbidden arms
Beautiful flower child
I am nothing but an echo through your halls
Well, won't you, won't you just stay here for longer?
I've given all to what was left of you
I don't know where I went wrong, I went wrong

Lately do you feel better when I'm gone?
I made a mess of myself again
Yeah, I know it's all my fault
Well, I've done, I've been whatever you wanted
It's such a shame that still no one likes looking up when they are lost, they are lost

Threading the skin
I am at fault for you
You're keeping me out
Faith in an empty room
Something I've missed in everyone but you
You're keeping me out
Faith in an empty room

Innocent pawn, goddess of my thoughts
As the world turned, we stood far apart
Far apart
Flower child is stuck in her condition
As the world turned, we had fallen apart
Fallen apart

I am wrapped up in momentary touch
I'm feeling so worn down
I have tried but I know that's not enough

Threading the skin
I am at fault for you
You're keeping me out
Faith in an empty room
Thousands of bricks, I carry 'em all for you
You're keeping me out
Faith in an empty room

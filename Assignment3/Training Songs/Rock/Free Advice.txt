A bit of free advice (vice)
We'll tell it to you now (nice, twice)
If you've got some habits
Some people won't allow (won't allow, allow)
Be cool, be clean 
If you know what I mean.

We've all got our ups (ups, ups) 
We've all got our downs (we've all got our downs)
Some of us are careless
And leave 'em layin' around (layin' around, around) 
Be neat, discreet
And keep your ear to the ground
Everyone has had a loved one who's far, far away 
And if you don't want to take that trip someday...
(Think twice)
Be cool (be cool)
Be clean (be clean) 
If you know what I mean.

Everyone has had a loved one who's far far away

A bit of free advice (vice, vice) 
We'll tell it to you now (tell it to you now) 
If you've got some habits

Everyone has had a loved one...
Don't be out on the street...
Everyone has had a loved one...

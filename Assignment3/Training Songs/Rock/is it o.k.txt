Is it OK
This isn't the way
I need you anymore
Did you forget what you came here for

Is it all right
I don't wanna fight
For things I'll never need
I don't ever want no diamond ring

No it wasn't right
To call you at night
For changing my mind
What's nothing today
Is nothing tomorrow

I needed something from you
An echo of the truth
Now I know why
Two people never made up one
Smokin' barreled gun
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow

Is it all right
Baby tonight
I just want you to leave
What you expecting me to be

What did you say
The mystery lays
In the things you'll never see
I want you to be my mystery

No it wasn't right
To call you at night
For changing my mind
What's nothing today
Is nothing tomorrow

I needed something from you
An echo of the truth
Now I know why
Two people never made up one
Smokin' barreled gun
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow

I needed something from you
An echo of the truth
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow
Two people never made up one
Smokin' barreled gun
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow
I needed something from you
An echo of the truth
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow
Two people never made up one
Smokin' barreled gun
What's nothing today is nothing tomorrow

Is it okay
This isn't the way
I need you anymore

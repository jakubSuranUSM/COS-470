Silly Billy been a naughty boy
Gone and broken all your toys
He's a whore for television
Bi-polar supervision
Cracked up in submission
Bound and gagged, a rubber vision

Pandemic
Polyemic
Schizophrenic
Epidemic
Can he do it
Will he take it
Will he make it
Or just take it

Thought you had a vision
A wet dream religion
It's an execution
Of the rebel in you
Viva la revolution
Bring out the disillusioned
They're an institution
You should have stayed in bed

I hear you're into tantric sex
Filmed it all through pink latex
Made all the rags hardcore
Stripped and filleted, looking sore

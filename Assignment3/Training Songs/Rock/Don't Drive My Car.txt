Ah ah ah ah, don't drive my car
I'm just a boy, my favourite toy
And I'm telling you woman
Don't push me too far
I'm telling you straight, don't drive my car

Ah ah ah ah, don't drive my car
Stay where you are, stay where you are
'Cos I'm telling you woman
Now don't you push me too far
I'm telling you straight, don't drive my car

And I'm telling you woman
Now don't you push me too far
I'm telling you straight, don't drive my car

And I'm telling you woman
Now don't you push me too far
I'm telling you straight, don't drive my car

You know and I know
It isn't right
We tried so hard
Every night

I can still remember the night
When I looked into your eyes
I knew it must be love
I can still remember the time
Came as no surprise
I knew it must be love

It's too late, good bye
Not that we didn't try
I feel so bad
I'm hurtin' inside

I can still remember the night
When I looked into your eyes
I knew it must be love
I can still remember the time
Came as no surprise
I knew it must be love

It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love
It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love

I can still remember the night
When I looked into your eyes
I knew it must be love
I can still remember the time
Came as no surprise
I knew it must be love

It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love
It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love

It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love
It's never easy, easy
When you fall out of love

When the time gets right 
I'm gonna pick you up 
And take you far away 
From trouble my love 
Under a big old sky 
Out in a field of green 
There's gotta be something 
Left for us to believe 

Oh, I await the day 
Good fortune comes our way 
And we'll ride down the King's Highway 
Yeah yeah 

No you can't hide out 
In a six gun town 
We want to hold our heads up 
But we gotta stay down 
I don't want to end up 
In a room all alone 
Don't want to end up someone 
That I don't even know 

Lover I await the day 
Good fortune comes our way 
And we'll ride down the King's Highway 
Yeah yeah 

Lover I await the day 
Good fortune comes our way 
And we'll ride down the King's Highway 
Yeah yeah 

Lover I await the day 
Good fortune comes our way 
And we'll ride down the King's Highway 
Yeah yeah

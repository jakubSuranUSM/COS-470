Blue sky, Sunshine, what a day to take a walk in the park.
Ice cream, Day dream, till the sky becomes a blanket of stars.
What a day for pickin' daisies, and lots of red balloons.
And what a day for holdin' hands and bein' with you.
 
Lazy Day, Just right for lovin' away.
Lazy Day, Made for a stroll in the lane,
Baby, you and me (Baby you and me)
and the honey bee ('Neath a shady tree)
Lazy Day, Lazy Day, Lazy Day
'n' you 'n' me
 
Blue sky, Sunshine, flowers bloomin' children sayin' hello.
Row boats, bird notes, people smilin' ev'rywhere that they go.
What a day to be together, and what a sky of blue.
And what a day for thinkin' right out loud, I love you.
 
Lazy Day, Just right for lovin' away.
Lazy Day, Made for a stroll in the lane,
Baby, you and me (Baby you and me)
and the honey bee ('Neath a shady tree)
Lazy Day, Lazy Day, Lazy Day
'n' you 'n' me
 
Lazy Day, Just right for lovin' away
Lazy Day, Made for a strollin' the lane.
 
Lazy Day, Just right for lovin' away
Lazy Day, Made for a strollin' the lane.
 
Lazy Day, Just right for lovin' away

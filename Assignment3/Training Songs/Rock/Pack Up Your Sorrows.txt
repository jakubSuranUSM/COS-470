Well, if somehow
You could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

If somehow
You could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use cryin'
Talking to a stranger
Namin' the sorrows you've seen

Oh, cause there are
Too many bad times
Too many sad times
Nobody knows what you mean

If somehow
You could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use ramblin'
Walkin' in the shadows
Trailin' a wanderin' star

No one beside you
No one to hide you
An' nobody knows where you are

Ah, if somehow
You could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roamin'
Walking by the roadside
Seekin' a satisfied mind

Ah, cause there are
Too many highways
Too many byways
Nobody's walkin' behind

Ah, if somehow
You could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

You would lose them
I know how to use them
Give them all to me

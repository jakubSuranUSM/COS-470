I got this old guitar
The strings are rusty
But it's all I need
Bring in the kick drum
It can back the beat
Let's gather round and sing a song
I got a shaker too
The kinds of sound
That wants to make you move
Bring in the uke
It will complete the groove
Let's gather round and sing a song

There's no worries on the earth tonight
We're all walkin' off the world tonight

Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
We're like a locomotive
Under the big hot sun
We're chained to the gang of rhythm
The song is never done
Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
Come on everyone

We got this melody
Bring in the harmony like CSNY
To write a tune you know will never die
Let's gather round and sing a song

There's no worries on the earth tonight
We're all walkin' off the world tonight

Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
We're like a locomotive
Under the big hot sun
We're chained to the gang of rhythm
The song is never done
Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
Come on everyone

And when the night is done
These chains will hold us strong
The chords will carry on
Long after we're gone oh oh

There's no worries on the earth tonight
We're all walkin' off the world tonight

Come on now everyone yeah
Come now everyone
We're like like a locomotive
Under the big hot sun

Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
We're like a locomotive
Under the big hot sun
We're chained to the gang of rhythm
The song is never done
Come on now everyone yeah
Come on now everyone
Come on everyone

We got this melody
Come on everyone
Bring in the harmony
Come on everyone

I got this old guitar
The strings are rusty
But it's all I need

I remember when I was young
Feeling sick on Sunday morning
I don't want to do it anymore

Standing in a line with a dirty mind
Clean it up on Sunday morning
I don't want to do it anymore

One day a week we turn the cheek
One day a week we turn the cheek
Oh, how we'd kneel down
Oh, we were so quiet
Never any light there
I don't care, it's not right there

Get up early, do your hair
Sunday best on Sunday morning
Well, I don't want to see it anymore

Tea and toast in the social hall
We had it all on Sunday morning
I don't want to see it anymore

We come in fear , to worship here
We come in fear , to worship here

Oh, how we'd kneel down
Oh, we were so quiet
Never any light there
I don't care, it's not right there

It's wrong to feel, it's wrong to care
You must not steal, you must not swear

Oh, how we'd kneel down
Oh, we were so quiet
Never any light there
I don't care, it's not right there

I don't want to do it anymore
I don't want to see it anymore

Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning

An outlaw walking through the valley of men
Glared with a sunken eye of death
Moved his head from side to side and said
Come on you gutless slugs fight like a man
State your name and business and let's see what you got
Another body for the hangman's count
Show me the bar, and show me the cards
Hold on to your guys

Filled up with bug juice
The moon shine in his hand
Hot headed with a temperament
The speediest deadliest man with a gun
A bloody gambler but a gentleman dog
A frontier vagabond who charms all the dames
Hello ladies how's your day today
Let me introduce you to myself
Doc Holiday

Ooooooooooh the outlaw man's roar

A friendly man but without a friend
Fort Griffin Texas here I am
Supported Wyatt Earp to the very end
Cemented brotherhood
Don't get in his way
You cannot shake his boots
You cannot scare his fate
Down under you will hear him grin
Great the man the outlaw himself
Doc Holiday

Oooooooooh the outlaw man's roar

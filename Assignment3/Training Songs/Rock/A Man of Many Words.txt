The Very Best Of Buddy Guy Album I
Transcriber: Awcantor@aol.com
I don't care what nobody say
I'm a many of a many word
I can speak things to you darlin', my dear
I could swear that you never heard
I rap slow and I know I rap long
Come on mama let me turn you on
Now come on, alright
When I rap my game and call your name
You will never be the same
In the midnight hours when ya dream, my darlin'
I swear you will call my name
I rap strong and I know I rap long
Come on mama let me turn you on
Now, come on
I was hauled off to jail, late last night
With no one to go my bail
I rapped strong to the judge early this mo'nin'
And the judge put the cops in jail
I rap strong and I know I rap long
Come on mama let me turn you on
Now come on
Let me tell ya 'bout that baby
I've got to tell ya
I'm gonna preach about it
I want the world to know about it
I want to know what ya did to me
Let me tall ya
Listen!
Can ya hear me?
I want to know do ya hear me now?
I got to know, do you hear me?
I want to know do ya hear me?
Ooh...oooh....

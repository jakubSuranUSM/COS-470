When you call my name from wherever you are
I will find my way back to your home town
I will send a prayer to wherever you've gone
Take us all the way to where we started from
I hope it's alright with you
But you've been on my mind tonight
Well I was lookin' over water
And I was sure I saw you in the light
Like a half-forgotten memory
Of a song that won't quite come back to me
You were dancin' on the waves
Laughin' like a little child
As the river passed you by

When you call my name from wherever you are
I will find my way back to your home town
I will send a prayer to wherever you've gone
Take us all the way to where we started from
I thought I heard you cryin'
But you said it was nothin' to worry me
Told me you'll be waitin'
While I go complicatin' our destiny
You got a talent for makin' the days drag by
While I wait to see you one more time
We'll be dancin' on the waves
Laughin' like little children
As the river passes by

When you call my name from wherever you are
I will find my way back to your home town
I will send a prayer to wherever you've gone
Take us all the way to where we started from
When you call my name from wherever you are
I will find my way back to your home town
I will send a prayer to wherever you've gone
Take us all the way to where we started from
All the way back all the way

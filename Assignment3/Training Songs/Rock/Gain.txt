Here I am again,
gonna cure the common cold,
end world hunger and 
get my movie sold (and uh)...
Gonna teach the world to sing,
give 'em all a hand,
solve their problems and
gonna take a stand

Look around,
come back down
Try to rearrange it once again
And you hold your own,
nails to the stone
You've got it and you don't know what it is

Would you gain?
Time after time it's the same old wrong
Change and you change it's the same old song

I'm bothered by the fact
you cannot take it back 
It goes on record and
multiplies, at that (and uh)...
I gotta break it down
to its smallest part
Put it back together and 
call it art

Look around,
come back down
Try to rearrange it once again
And you hold your own,
nails to the stone
You've got it and you don't know what it is

Would you gain?
Time after time, it's the same old wrong
You change and you change, it's the same old song

You change and you change...
You change and you change...

Would you gain?

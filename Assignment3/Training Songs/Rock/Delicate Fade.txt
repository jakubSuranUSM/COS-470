Ring a ring around the rosie
Got a pocket full of smiles
Take all the lies you could have told me
Dress them up in style
I find myself adrift on a frozen sea
The tears of time melting into me
I throw myself in the arms of a memory
I light a candle and try to see
Ring a ring around the rosie
On the playground for a while
Break all the threads of life that hold me
Falling down in style
I find myself adrift on a frozen sea
The tears of time melting into me
I throw myself in the arms of a memory
I light a candle and try to see
That's how the stars all burned out
And the sky just flew away
That's when the stars all burned out
On this the delicate fade
On this the delicate fade
That's how the stars all burned out
And the sky just flew away
That's when the stars all burned out
On this the delicate fade
That's how the stars all burned out
And the sky just flew away
That's when the stars all burned out
On this the delicate fade
On this the delicate fade
Like water it's all slipping through my hands
Forever our lives erode with the sands (fade out fade out)
Like water it's all slipping through my hands
Forever our lives erode with the sands (fade out fade out)
Ring a ring around the rosie
Got a pocket full of smiles

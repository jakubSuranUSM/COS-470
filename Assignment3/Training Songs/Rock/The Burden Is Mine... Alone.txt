I feel the blood under my skin
Like so many times before
This journey got the best of me
And I am sorry I couldn't wait anymore

The burden is mine alone

I feel the blood under my skin
And I hate every part of me
How could I loose the only thing worth keeping
Now I'm sorry I didn't wait for you

The burden is mine alone

You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back
Trouble came ran away
Now you say she's gone to stay
Got fed up, hit the street
Left without a word to me

Oh you don't know
How the girl could touch my soul

You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back

Suddenly you know my name
Say there's only me to blame
It's gonna rain, it's gonna shine
Gotta stay between the lines
Rolling down a lonely road
You say I should let it go
Wish you would come on down
If you need I'll come around

You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back

Used to have a son named Joe
Where he got to I don't know
Maybe down in Mexico
Livin' off her daddy's dough
If you give me half a chance
I will make her sing and dance
I'm gonna give her all my soul
I'm gonna play her rock and roll

You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back

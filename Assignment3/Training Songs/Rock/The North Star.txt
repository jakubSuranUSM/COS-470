Im losing my direction
Somethings come between us
Its gettin hard to do right
Im searchin for a sign
Theyve split us into sections
Im from mars and your from venus
But stranded in the daylight
Nothin is defined
But as the late summer honey light
Shifts and caresses the buildings...

Dark starry eyes
Searching the skies
Because its hidden from view
Dont mean it isnt for you
You know were gonna make it
Weve only gotta take it
Cos its a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue

Ive made a big decision
In the light of the eternal
Im gonna be your mirror
And you can mirror me
Ill see you in the bright star
Cushioned by the dark sky
Reflected in the river
Flowing to the sea
And as the reasons and rumours recede
Dyin on the lesseing breeze

Sweet starry eyes
Immune to surprise
Because its hidden from view
Dont mean it isnt for you
You know were gonna make it
Weve only gotta take it
And its a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue

And blue is the colour of my heart
Since you blew my senses apart
The feeling were back at the start never ends
As clusters of heavenly jewels
Gaze down on earths lonely fools
Turnin and twistin
Resisting the pull of a fate thats already planned
They cant understand

Dark starry eyes
Searching the skies
Because its hidden from view
Dont mean it isnt for you
You know were gonna make it
Weve only gotta take it
Its a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue
Im placing my faith in the brilliance
Of the bright stars and you.

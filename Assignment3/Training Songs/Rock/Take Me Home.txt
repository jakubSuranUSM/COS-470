Give me the hand of the one I love
Take me away to the sunshine land
I've had enough of this crazy life
Workin' so hard like a mad man

Keep on writin' me mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
Till the blues take me home

Cold, rainy weather
Always getting' me down
Strange talkin' people
Showing me the way

Not what I'm used to
I gotta turn around
Hey, listen mister
I got something to say, yeah

Keep on writin' me mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
Till the blues take me home
Yeah, yeah

Keep on writin' me mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
Till the blues take me home

Take me home, yeah
Take me home, yeah
Take me home, yeah
Take me home darlin', darlin'

Take me home
Take me home, yeah
Take me home

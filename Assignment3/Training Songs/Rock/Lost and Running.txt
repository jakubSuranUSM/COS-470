I was sick and tired of waiting lost
You were mad at me for so much more
I was bored listening to the same old chords
You would complain that I was never around
And we shouldn't hope, no we shouldn't hope
If love is so easy then why am I stuck
If life is so smooth why can't I get enough

I'm still lost and running

Everyday moves like a hurricane
That's dragging me around no matter what I say
Night time in the city streets I'm out of luck
The cobblestones are dark and wet there's no one I trust
And it comes around, yeah it comes around
Mr So'Easy say where have you gone
I'm looking for somewhere I can lay down my arms

I'm still Lost and running

I'm taking my time ill let it float away
Spare me no lies and you'll have nothing to say
The further we slip into this rabbit hole
The harder we look for a new place to go

I'm still lost and running

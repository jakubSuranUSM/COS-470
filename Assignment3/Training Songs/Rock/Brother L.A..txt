Brother you wait up late
When you finish the midnight shift
And you try to put out the hate
And you know it's going to drift

Brother you're going down
Down from the fountain blue
You can call on the one
The one that you knew

It feels right with you my brother
It feels right when you're right here
No, I don't want to know
Every mountain, every fear

I'm the big old brother who can always pick you up
Who can fill your pocket
When you're all messed up

The sea that promises defeat
Is the flood that will come
The heat that keeps your habit warm
Is the flame that will burn

Are you wearing your filters?
Are you changing your clothes?
Are you wearing your colors?
So that nobody knows

Oh brother, brother, brother
Brother of mine

Are you big brother, who'll pick me up
Fill my pockets when I'm all messed up
Invitation you don't have to hide no more
Gimme something I don't mind
You can lay it down on me
You can say it I wanna know
Oh brother, brother, brother
Brother of mine

Oh sister, sister, sister
Sister of mine

Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Look for my brother

If you
Get out 
Before September
Remember 
That I'm 
Still inside
But I'm dry 
I'm dry 

And you 
When you try 
To make a difference
You're so different 
And then I 
Try
And just die 
I die

You know 
That I need 
You more than I want ya
But I want ya 
For all time 
So I 
I guess on the line

It's all that I can do 
To sing these stupid songs to you
I give up half my time 
Just trying to think up words that rhyme
I ain't getting any younger 
But you wouldn't know
So it's on 
With the show

Sometimes 
A smoke 
A drink and a ponder 
Can work wonders
When you're down 
Takes your frown 
Turns it 'round 
Around

And you 
When you try 
To make a difference
You're no different 
Than when I 
Try 
And just die 
I die

And now 
That your day
Dream is forgotten
And forgiven
And the world 
Has been saved 
Be brave

It's all that I can do
To sing these stupid songs to you
I give up half my time
Just trying to think up words that rhyme
I ain't getting any younger
But you wouldn't know
'cause I walk 
In shadow 
And I never ever 
Really show my face
But I'm only ever seen 
In the right place
If you get out 
Before September
Remember 
That I'm 
Still inside
But I'm dry 
I'm dry 

And you 
When you try 
To make a difference
You're so different 
And then I 
Try
And just die 
I die

You know 
That I need 
You more than I want ya
But I want ya 
For all time 
So I

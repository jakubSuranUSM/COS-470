Out in the land I heard some people say
There is no other way than to settle scores of age old grievance
Lost all belief in honesty and sowing seeds of want and greed
I am on my knees

Come and take me to a world full of kindness
I can feel something is going to happen to me
It can happen to me

Om jai, deva - all the love we have will take us higher

Om jai, deva - I believe that we will start the fire

It's our way to take no time,
Never read between the lines of a holy verse we don't understand
We close our eyes so on it goes a weapon for the fallen souls
I am on my knees

Come and take me to a world full of kindness
I can feel something is going to happen to me
It can happen to me

Om jai, deva - all the love we have will take us higher
Om jai, deva - I believe that we will start the fire

Love the guide
Love the cure
Forever right and just in wrong
And right all things we do
Are seen by you

Love in action
Love in word
Spreading joy around the world
I feel something's going on
And it's happening to me

Om jai, deva - all the love we have will take us higher

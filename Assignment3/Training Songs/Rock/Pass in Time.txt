So much stays unknown till the time has come.
Did you imagine you could ever be so strong,
Then watch your fear just turn into relief?
Your sea of doubt become your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
The tears will help to keep your need at bay.

So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.

A mother told me just before she died 
My mother told me just before she died, 
'oh darling, darling, don't you be like me.
You will fall in love with the very first man you meet.'
But mama, mama, some will never know;
The love that you have is still holding my soul.

[Beth Orton & Terry Callier:]
So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a little while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.

[Beth Orton:]

[Beth Orton:]
So much stays unknown till the time you are strong.
Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong,
And all your pain just turns into relief?
All your doubt becomes your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
The years will help to keep your need at bay.

[Beth Orton & Terry Callier :]
So come on now, come on now, child.

You're here just a while.

So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.

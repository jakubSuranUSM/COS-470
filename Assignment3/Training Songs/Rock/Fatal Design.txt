Here we are
In this fatal design
But we'll be as one
Under the sun
And we're facing out for hope

Flaming bombs go down again
Burning all the life
Tainting songs of yesterday
Feeding your desire

The day will come for you as well
We know......And I wish you well
For those of you who seek the truth
I know......And I wish you well

Lay down your guns
Lay down your sons
Then we'll be as one
Under the sun
What's the price of life?

Lay down your hands...
Mothers are weeping
Lay down your hands...
Fathers are weeping
Lay down your hands...
Families are weeping
So lay down your hands

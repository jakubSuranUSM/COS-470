When I lost you, I played a part I never really knew,
Letting go, is the best thing I could do.
Before you turn that knife, you have to say you'll cut me down
And letting go is effortless now
You found me out.

But I can't come down, anymore
I'm here till you say it isn't so.
I'm in hope
And I can't come down, anymore.
No I'm on a road I've never known.
And there's no way home.

I found something, I would die from now
I don't feel fit to live.
Are you the one it finishes with?
I spend my days thinking of you prayin you would think of me.
Was I wrong to let you just leave me?

And I can't come down, anymore
I'm here till you say it isn't so..
I'm in hope
And I can't come down anymore.
No I'm on a road I've never known.
On my ownnnnnnnnnnnnn....

And I wanna know, what things you see up close in lies, they dissapear
And I wanna know, if I was just a waste of time for you
I want you to say... if you're with him alone, or someone new,
But I can't come down, til you do.

But I can't come down, anymore.. until you say it isn't so.
I'm in hope.. And I can't come down, anymore.
No I'm on a road I've never known.
On my ownnnnnnnnnnnnn....

And I I can't come down, anymore.
No I'm on a road Ive never known.
And there's no way home.

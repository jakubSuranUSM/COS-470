Steady girl on your feet
(Steady girl on your feet)
You and your wonderings
(You and your wonderings)
Bread can feed a few
(Bread can feed a few)
So can some cartoons

So it ends
So it begins
Ah my fatherâ??s son
Plant another seed of hate

In a trusting virgin gun
Steady girl for the show
(Steady girl for the show)
Got a versus god ringside
(Got a versus god ringside)
Littered with corpses
Neither God can forgive
So the desert proves
(So the desert proves)
Strawberry canned dust
(Strawberry canned dust
Can you blame nature
(Can you blame nature)
If sheâ??s had enough of us

So it ends
So it begins
Ah my fatherâ??s son
Plant another seed of hate

In a trusting virgin gun
Steady boy watch them pray
To you I suspect
If you keep my flesh firm
Iâ??ll ready those sacraments

So it ends
So it begins
Ah my fatherâ??s son
So it ends
So it begins
Ah my fatherâ??s son
Plant another seed of hate
In another fatherâ??s son.

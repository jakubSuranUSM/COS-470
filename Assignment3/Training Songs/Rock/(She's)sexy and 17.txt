Hey, man, I don't feel like goin' to school no more
Me neither . Can't make me go . No way daddyo  yeah !

I ain't goin' to school it starts too early for me
Well listen man I ain't goin' to school no more 
It starts much, much too early for me
I don't care about readin' , writin', 'rithmetic or history

I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
Well she's the only girl in this whole world who understands me

Well she's sexy and seventeen
My little rock-roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene
Gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound shake it around your mind , mind , mind

Johnny and Eddie and me and Jimmy and Jack
Are gonna do a little number on the teacher when she turns her back
We're gonna cut out of class , meet the girls by the railroad track

Well ev'ry Friday night there's a band that you gotta hear
Just a dollar to get in and twenty-five cents a beer
They play rock and roll music like it hasn't been rocked for years

Well she's sexy and seventeen .....

Well-a-hell-a-hell-a when I feel that rockin' beat
I can't sit still ; up , out of my seat come on
Babe lets shuffle 'round your feet
Can't learn nothin' in school they don't teach you on the street !

Wo-oh , wo-oh , baby I like your style
Wo-oh oh oh oh baby I like your style
You don't care what the other kids say , You go real wild

Well you're sexy and seventeen
My little rock-roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene
Gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around your mind , mind , mind
Dig that sound and shake it around your mind , mind , mind

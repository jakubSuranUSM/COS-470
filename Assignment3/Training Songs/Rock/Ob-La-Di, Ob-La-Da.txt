Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Desmond takes the trolley to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as she gives it to him she begins to sing

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the marketplace
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he still sings it with the band

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Desmond and Molly)

Happy ever after in the marketplace
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he's the singer with the band

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

Ob-La-Di, ob-La-Da
Life goes on, whoa
La, la how their life goes on

And if you want some jam
Sing Ob-La-Di, bla-da, hey

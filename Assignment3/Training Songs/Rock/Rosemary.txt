Rosemary's the kind of girl
Don't need no reason
She's the kind that just won't settle
Down

Clothes are out of season
She'll be done for treason
She'll be hanging from a tree upside
Down

Fever
Fever
Where you trying to run?

Fever
Diva
Rosemary's not done

Well Rosemary's the kind of girl
Tired of her beauty
She has taken all her mirrors
Down

So you best believe her
The girl will give you fever
She's the kind to heat you up and cool you
Down

Fever
Fever
Where you trying to run?

Fever
Diva
Rosemary
She's not done
Not done

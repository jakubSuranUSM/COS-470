If I changed along the way
Is there a price that I can pay?
Just tell me all I have to say is save me

Just tell me it'll be okay
That tomorrow won't be like today
Don't make me have to kneel and pray
For maybes, just save me

I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes

Don't want to know what I've become
I want the wrongs I've done undone
I need more that just the crumbs you gave me

I want a place where I can run
I want a race that can be won
I want a face and a golden sun to bathe me, bathe me

I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand

Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes

Do you want to know?
Do you want to know?
Do you want to know?
What I know?

Do you want to go?
Really want to go?
Do you want to go where I go?

If I changed along the way
Is there a price that I can pay?
Just tell me all I have to say is save me

Just tell me it'll be okay
That tomorrow won't be like today
Don't make me have to kneel and pray
For maybes, maybes

I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
I heard it a thousand times
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes
Life of a thousand crimes

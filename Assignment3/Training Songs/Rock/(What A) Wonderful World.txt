Wonderful world this could be.

Don't know much about history.
Don't know much biology.
Don't know much about science books.
Don't know much about the french I took.
But I do know that I love you.
And I know that if you love me too.

What a wonderful
Wonderful world this would be.

Don't know much about geography.
Don't know much trigonometry.
Don't know much about algebra.
Don't know what a slide rule is for.
But I do know one and one is two.
And if this one could be with you.

What a wonderful
Wonderful world this would be.
What a wonderful
Wonderful
Wonderful world.

Now I don't claim to be an "A"-student
But I'm try'n' to be.
I think that maybe by bein' an "A"-student baby
Baby

I could win your love for me
Don't know much about the middle ages
I saw the pictures and I turned the pages
Don't know nothin' 'bout no rise and fall
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' at all.
Girl it's you that I've been thinkin' of
And if I could only win your love.

What a wonderful
Wonderful world this would be.
What a wonderful
Wonderful
Wonderful world
This would be
What a wonderful
Wonderful

It takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try , it just won't come
But you keep on tryin' and you don't give up
And it's really silly, and it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're going to go insane

'Cause it takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try, it just won't come
But you keep on tryin', and you don't give up
And it's really silly, and it's all in vain
And you could be doing other things

You could be doing what you want
But you keep on tryin' and you don't give up
And it's really silly and it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're going to go insane

It's all in vain and if you don't stop
You're going to go insane
Insane, insane, insane, insane
It's all in vain, and if you don't stop

You're going to go insane
Knew you would
She don't need no one
And she don't need me

Into the flash of the lightning star-riders are hurled, 
See them bumping and grinding bareback on the wheels of the world, 
You can see the dawn a'coming or is that the flash of a spear, 
Ah, the day will come, the dawn will break: 
The day breaks here. 

We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 

People say we've got the power, the phrase I think is hearts and minds, 
Never mind where we came from, we've left our history books behind. 
Not so much teachers as fighters, and what we teach is how we fight, 
And we're going to ring the changes, we're going to ring em, 
Ring 'em right. 

We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 

We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it from here. 
We've got the power and the glory, we're going to take it, we're going to take it. 
We're going to take it, we're going to take it.

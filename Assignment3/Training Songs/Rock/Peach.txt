It took a while to catch my breath
It took a while to come to my senses
When I heard the news, I couldn't believe it was true
As long as stars are blue, I will still love you

In a kinder time than this
I could wait for several life-times
I'll meet you when the sun is in my eyes
And we'll spend our years, floating with the tide

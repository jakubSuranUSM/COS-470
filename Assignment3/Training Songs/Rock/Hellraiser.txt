Look Out!
Momma let me out on a Saturday night
She said Now go out and get her, go and hold her tight
I said Momma you don't understand everytime I touch her
Hand it starts a-burning in the fires of Hell
If I hold it too long, you never can tell
What would happen to me, I wouldn't want you to see

Look out! She's a Hellraiser
Star gazer
Trail Blazer
Natural born raver yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

She's like a live bombshell, like a flash out of hell
When she shakes it up, Oooo! Everyone fell
It's a feeling that's neat and she took me completely
By suprise with her ultrasonic eyes
Flashing like hysterical danger signs that said
Beware where you tread or you'll go out of your head!

Look out! She's a Hellraiser
Star gazer
Trail Blazer
Natural born raver yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Look Out!

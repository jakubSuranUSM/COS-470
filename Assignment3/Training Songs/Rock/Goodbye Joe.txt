We were lost in the fair on the highland, good bye, Joe,
with the sky and the deer on the highland, good bye, Joe.
Time is full of changes and now youâ€™ve got to go.
Donâ€™t forget that we loved on the highland, good bye, Joe.
Good bye, Joe, yes, I understand, Iâ€™m trying not to cry
but if I do, itâ€™s only cause Iâ€™ll miss you, one more time, let me kiss you.
I remember when you came calling, good bye, Joe,
like a sunrise that rose without warning, good bye, Joe.
Time is full of changes and now youâ€™ve got to go.
And we walked on a Manhattan morning, good bye Joe.
Good bye, Joe, yes, I understand, Iâ€™m trying not to cry
but if I do, itâ€™s only cause Iâ€™ll miss you, one more time, let me kiss you.
Good bye, Joe, good bye, Joe, time is full of changes, Joe, and now youâ€™ve got to go.
Donâ€™t forget that we loved on the highland, good bye, Joe, goodbye, Joeâ€¦

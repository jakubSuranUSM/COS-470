If I said I believe my eyes
And science can move my soul
If I said I'm not afraid to die
And I don't need you

I'd be lying

If I said the way he looks at me
Doesn't make me want to undress
If I said I could leave you now
And go where I could forget

I'd be lying

I've been lying all my life with silence
And I need to find the words to tell you

If I said I don't want what I don't have
And all the answers are enough
If I said I believe in myself
And that's enough

I'd be lying

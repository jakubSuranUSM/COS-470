You laugh at me and call me I-D-I-O-T. 
You laugh and turn your back cause I'm not like you're supposed
 to be. 
But it's not a question - a question of low iq. 
Cause if it was well then the answer wouldn't be me but you. 
A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, don't know who the hell 
I'm supposed to be I-D-I-O-T (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!) A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, yeah that's me I-D-I-O-T. (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!)
 
I put with being laughed at cause I put up with being me. 
And then on artificial someone says I'm the I-D-I-O-T. 
But I got motivation yeah I pretty much love it all. 
To make your artificial nation stumble and fall.

A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, don't know who the hell 
I'm supposed to be I-D-I-O-T (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!) A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, yeah that's me I-D-I-O-T. (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!)
 
I know that I'm a screw up. 
I know I'm in a band. 
I know that I am up against a mighty mighty man. 
But I'm satisfied with being, being one of the lucky few. 
Who'll be the ones laughing knowing that the joke is gonna be on you.

A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, don't know who the hell 
I'm supposed to be I-D-I-O-T (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!) A.K.A I-D-I-O-T, yeah that's me I-D-I-O-T. (A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T!)

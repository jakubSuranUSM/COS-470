You're restless baby, the good is gone from your eyes 
I've seen that look before but it's different this time 
I wonder how long you've been living in this lie 

I can't hold on girl 
And I can't give up, no, no 
I just can't turn and walk away 

The night won't make it right, baby, not this time 
I know there's nothing left that's gonna change your mind 
We played the hard way as long as we could 
But this time baby's gone for good 

You're running scared, girl
You've lost what you once believed
Do you lie awake at night do you think about me?
Have you found somebody who can give you what you need?

But I can't stay here
It hurts so badly
But I can't just turn and walk away

The night won't make it right, baby, not this time
I know there's nothing left that's gonna change your mind
We played the hard way as long as we could
But this time baby's gone for good

Baby worries, baby bleeds
Baby must have what she sees
Was it so hard, couldn't you see me?

The night won't make it right baby not this time
I know there's nothing left that's gonna change your mind
We played the hard way but it took a little bit too long
But this time baby knows she's wrong
This time baby knows she's wrong
This time baby knows she's wrong
So wrong

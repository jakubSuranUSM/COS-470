One lonely room
Nobody there
Nobody sits
In one lonely chair
I know the feeling
For the first time in my life
I should
I should have known
Better
Oh I should
I should have known better.

One lonely room
No footsteps on the floor
Nobody needs
To answer the door
I know the feeling
For the first time in my life
Oh I should
I should have known
I should have known better
Oh I should
I should have known
Better.

You took the wind right out of my sails
You took my train right off the rails
You left a car that had no wheels
You left some shoes that had no heels
You took the wind right out of my sails
You took my train right off the rails.

Things they taught you at school
Can sometimes disappear
Why do you disbelieve
The things I said were true
Of a land nothing planned
It just happens
Girls and boys who shout come out to play
With a queen cold as ice
You'd best take my advice
To steer clear of her charm
She's easily annoyed
What's that sound, you turn around
It just happens there are bells
And reindeer drawing a sleigh
There troubled with snow covered peaks
Till the end of time
We know you're a daughter of Eve
And a friend of mine - no
Yes I'm certain that you
Will influence the rest
She could turn you to stone
You're suitably impressed
And so easily led
There just happen to be repercussions
Months ahead
Oh there troubled with snow covered peaks
Till the end of time
We know you're a daughter of Eve
And a friend of mine - no

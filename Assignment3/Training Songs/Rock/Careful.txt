Drop your guard, I'll get to know you
Simon says it's time to move
And God only knows I think about you
‘Cuz its never time to show and prove
It's never time to show and prove
Hiding all the time destroys me
Never know what's right to do
I only needed to feel a balance
I just want to do right by you
Sitting safe beside the truth
Beside you
Watch out for my bullshit
Everybody's got it
Careful as a soldier we're so strong
Begging my new teacher
Thought you'd never reach her
She's standing there in front of you
It's twice as hard to fool us
It's twice as hard to fool us
Careful as a soldier we're so strong
Careful as a soldier we're so strong

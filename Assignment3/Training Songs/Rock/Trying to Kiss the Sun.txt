I'm on my way to sweeter life with something
Left behind me who will pull me from
The jetstream with its surface sunlight?
Nothing is left that can't be done
So let's try to kiss the sun
Sun- Let's take a trip and try to kiss the sun
Sun- Let's take a trip
On my way to space the blinding beauty's rising
With us longing to make it to the moment

Of your greatest triumph
Think of the time when we were young
And we tried to kiss the sun
Open your mind to motion always on the run
All the thoughts that cross my mind become
Undone ? Are we caged inside a universe
Of light? Two of us we count as one
Make it whole and touch the sun

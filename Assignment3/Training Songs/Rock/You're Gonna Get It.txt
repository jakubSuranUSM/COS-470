I don't want you 
No more 
Ain't gonna give any more 
Than you give to me 
I don't want you 
It's too hard 
Can't try any harder 
Than you try for me 

You're gonna get it babe 
I should've quit it babe 
But you look so good 
Yeah you do, you do 
To think that something might change 
But I was just a fool 

Go 
Go to somebody else 
Like you do to me 
I don't want you 
Can't crawl 
I can't crawl any further 
You never crawled for me 

You're gonna get it babe 
I should've quit it babe 
But you look so good 
Yeah you do, you do 
To think that something might change 
But I was just a fool 

You're gonna get it, 
You're gonna get it, 
You're gonna get it 
Baby you're gonna get it

Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip and fryer fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don’t sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well-known hard man
And start a fight
Weigh your chances on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah

Bite the lightning
But tell me how it tastes
Kung-fu fighting
On your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don’t sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh

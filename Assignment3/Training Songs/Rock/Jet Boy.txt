Who's so fly up in the sky
Faster than any boy could ever describe?
Who has got a love so deep
With everything alive?

I said
Jet Boy's fly
Jet Boy's gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

This's the kinda place where no one cares
What you're living for
And Jet Boy's so preoccupied
He don't care 'bout before

And that's why
Jet Boy's fly
Jet Boy's gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

My baby

Jet Boy's fly, you know
Jet Boy's gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

We was all endangered charms
Swear we're havin fun
And Jet Boy goes after all we've done
That's why he's the one

That's why
Jet Boy's fly
Jet Boy's gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

My pretty baby
My pretty, pretty baby
My pretty baby

When I first came around this dump
I knew I couldn't stay
'Cause up above the world are Jet Boy
That's how I gotta play

Don't ya know why
Jet Boy's fly
Jet Boy's gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin' around New York City so high
Like he was my baby, like he was my baby
Like he was my baby, like he was my baby
Like he was my baby

Jet Boy's fly
And ya know he's gone
I said he been gone
Gone, gone, gone

And he been flying
He been flying
He's been flying
He's been flying

Baby, up all night
Baby, New York City
Baby, so, so high
Baby, so, so high

Don't you know that
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my-my-my-my baby
My-my-my-my baby (like he was my baby)
My-my-my-my (Like he was my baby)
My baby, my baby (Like he was my baby)
M-m-m-m-m-my baby
My baby

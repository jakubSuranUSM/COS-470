Maybe I don't say the words
Maybe I don't do the right thing
'Cause here I am sittin' by myself
And there's too much room
In this empty space
Got to fill it up
No matter where I go
Or what I do
I'm still in love with you
Maybe I'm just a stubborn guy
Maybe I have tried to shut you out
Go around hiding
'Cause I think I'm trapped
Like a frightened child
I want to run to you, yea
Crawl into your lap
No matter where I go
Or what I do
Still in love with you
As I carve these words into a stone
'Cause I don't give a damn
What the critics heed
Yea, there's a candle burnin'
Through the winters snow
And I want you to know
That I'm hearing you girl
I want you to know
That I realize what I have
Maybe I leave the lights on too long
Maybe I've forgotten
All those birthday cards
Every little one
I know what's deep inside of me
'O-o Eurasian eyes
Callin' out to me
No matter where we go
Or what we do
Still in love with you, yea
No matter where we go
What we do
Still in love with you
Still in love with you.

You ought to see your face
You ought to hear your voice
Last time I was here 
I wouldn't turn around
You ought to lock that door
Somebody might get in
Didn't I teach you like that?

This perfect world
So blue I can't begin to say
This perfect world
I know I never should have gone away
But I still deserve to say goodbye
No matter what I've done

I see her in your face
I hear her in your voice
Last time I was here 
They'd found her in the lake
Think I'm made of stone
Didn't you tell me that

This perfect world
So blue I can't begin to say
This perfect world
They say that soon I will be going away
But I still deserve to say goodbye
No matter what I've done

This perfect world

Now I've come around it's far too late
And these pills won't even let me cry
No one knows you even when you're gone
But I still deserve to say goodbye
No matter what I've done
No matter what I've done

You ought to see your face
You ought to hear your voice
Lock this after me

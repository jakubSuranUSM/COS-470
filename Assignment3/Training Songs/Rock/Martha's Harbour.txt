I sit by the harbor
The sea calls to me
I hide in the water
But I need to breath.

You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

I've been run a ground
So sad for a sailor
I felt safe and sound
But needed the danger

You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away

Stow away
Stow away

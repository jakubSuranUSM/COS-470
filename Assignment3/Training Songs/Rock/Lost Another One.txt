Just another morning cup of tea, I turn my radio on
And in between the static and the headlines
I heard that you were gone, we lost another one

There was a time we thought we were invincible
That we'd go on and on and on and all along
We'd thought we'd do another show and write another song
But I guess we've lost another one, let it slip away

Breaking all the silver threads that hold you to your dreams
One day they'll fall and you'll fly away

After all the trouble and heartache, we all go out alone
No body else can live your life for you, you're in it on your own
And you just lost another one, we let it slip away, yes, we did

Breaking all the silver threads that hold you to your dreams
One day they'll fall and you'll fly away

I lost a lot of friends on this highway, so long everyone
I watched them all sailing to the distance like a setting sun
They'd only just begun and we just lost another one

We lost another one
We lost another one

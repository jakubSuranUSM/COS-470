Will you have whiskey with your water
Or sugar in your tea ?
What's all these crazy questions
That you're askin' of me

This is the craziest party
There could ever be
Don't turn on the lights
'Cause I don't want to see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun,no, uh uh
Open up the window

Let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin'
From the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin'

About to scare me half to death
Oh open up the window sucker
Let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun,son
That ain't the way to have fun,son

The radio is blastin'
Someone's knockin' at the door
I'm lookin' at my girl friend she passed out on the floor
I've seen so many things
I ain't never seen before
I don't know what it is
I don't want to see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said that ain't the way to have fun son
That ain't the way to have fun NO!

Mama told me
Mama told me
Mama told me

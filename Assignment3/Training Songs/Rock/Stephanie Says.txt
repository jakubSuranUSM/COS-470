( Velvet Underground )

Stephanie says
That she wants to know
Why she's given half her life
To people she hates now

Stephanie says
When answering the phone
What country shall I say is calling
From across the world

That she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska

Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

Stephanie Says
That she wants to know
Why is it though she's the door
She can't be the room

Stephanie Says (Stephanie Says)
But doesn't hang up the phone (Hang up the phone)
What seashell she is calling
From across the world

But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the peeple ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

She asks you is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling
It's so cold in Alaska, it's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska

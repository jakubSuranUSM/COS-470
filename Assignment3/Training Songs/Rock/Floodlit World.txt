Sing for me 
I will sing for you 
As we wander through our floodlit world 
Close your eyes 
Look up to the skies 
As the soft earth falls from under you 
Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Sometimes with my heart I can reach you 
(Sometimes I can reach you) 
People only see what they want to 
(They see what they want to) 
Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Somewhere in the dark if we reach out 
(Somewhere) 
Behind every shadow is light 

Follow me 
I will follow you 
As we wander through in detached swirl 
Bursting out from the white noise phase 
Higher than aeroplanes with lazer eyes 
(AUTONOMY) 

Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Sometimes with my heart I can reach you 
(Sometimes I can reach you) 
People only see what they want to 
(They see what they want to) 
Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Somewhere in the dark if we reach out 
(Somewhere) 
Behind every shadow is light 

Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Sometimes with guitars we can reach you 
(Sometimes we can reach you) 
People only see what they want to 
(They see what they want to) 
Sometimes when it rains there's a rainbow 
(Sometimes there's a rainbow) 
Somewhere in the dark if we reach out 
(Somewhere) 
Behind every shadow is light

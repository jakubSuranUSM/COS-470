This feeling stings like a papercut
A constant draft from the door I can't shut
My legs are sleeping,
My body is weeping,
And I am searching.

An insatiable lust that can never be fulfilled
An annoying bug that I can never quite kill
A human disorder
A life on the border, the lack of a plan.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found.

I'm left here stripped of my own free will
My mind is set on this proverbial kill
As I fill my days with egocentric waste
Never evolving.

This powerful urge that is pulling me forth
A constant drive I am unable to ignore
Leaving my sleepless, holding my breath 
As my heart is pacing.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found

But I just can't leave it alone, 
Found,
But I just can't leave it alone,
Found
Found 
No, it can't be found 
Can't be found

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
There is something lurking in the back of my mind
Vital information that can not be... found! 

But I just can't leave it alone, 
Found,
But I just can't leave it alone,
Found
But I just can't leave it alone,
No it can't be found
But I just can't leave it alone
(inexplicably gone from my mind) 
Can't leave it alone
(inexplicably gone)
Can't leave it alone
(inexplicably gone from my mind)
Can't leave it alone

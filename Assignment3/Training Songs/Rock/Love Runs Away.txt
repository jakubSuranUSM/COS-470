I don’t need a miracle but I need your love for me
Still remember when I had it all didn’t take it for real
How could it be possible I can no longer feel
The way I did long ago now this chapter is sealed

And I know it’s good for to talk
Good for you to walk
Walk away like it was so simple
Can’t you leave me heart alone
You don’t know until you’ve found it
Love runs away

You don’t know until you’ve found it
You don’t know until you’ve found it
It never feels the same
You don’t know it
You don’t know until it’s gone

I don’t need another chance but I need some time to heal
Still remember when we had it all and the nights were unreal
Sometimes is so difficult I can no longer feel
The was I did long ago ‘cause this chapter is sealed

And I know it’s good for to talk
Good for you to walk
Walk away like it was so simple
Can’t you leave me heart alone
You don’t know until you’ve found it
Love runs away

You don’t know until you’ve found it
You don’t know until you’ve found it
It never feels the same
You don’t know it
You don’t know until it’s gone

I don’t need a halo to be seen
I don’t need this trouble in me
I don’t care if you can’t see me

‘Cause I don’t breath
My heart don’t beat
It’s buried in too deep

I know a girl who's like the sea
I watch her changing every day for me, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

One day she's still, the next she swells
You can hear the universe in her sea shells, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

No, no line on the horizon, no, no line

I know a girl with a hole in her heart
She said infinity is a great place to start
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

"Time is irrelevant, it's not linear"
Then she put her tongue in my ear
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

No, no line on the horizon, no, no line
No, no line on the horizon, no, no line

Ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

The songs in your head are now on my mind
You put me on pause, I'm trying to rewind and replay
Every night I have the same dream
I'm, I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm traffic cop, Rue de Marais
The sirens are wailing but it's me that wants to get away
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

No line on the horizon, no, no line
No, no line on the horizon, no, no line

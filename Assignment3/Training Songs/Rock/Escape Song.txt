Streets are hard in this old town
Love lies broken all around
In sorry piles
That carry on for miles 

Stinking places where you go
The good people hide below
The bloody ground
Never to be found

Little girl I tell no lie
You got diamonds in your eyes
So come with me 
Sail across the sea

Mister Ocean can't you see?
We are begging on our knees
To see the sand 
Of some other land

Stay with me
We'll be free
Just wait and see

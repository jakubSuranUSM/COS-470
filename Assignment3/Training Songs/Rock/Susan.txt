Susan
The Buckinghams
(Holvay/Beisbier/Guercio)

        Susan,    looks like I am losin'
        I'm losin' my mind  (losin' my mind)
        I'm wastin' my time

        Susan do you have to be confusin'
        I ask myself why you're sayin' goodbye

        No other girl could ever take the place of you
        Though you're hurtin' me 
        You know I'll always be thinkin' of you
        Girl I always love you

        Love love love love...
        I love you, yes I do, I do      (2x)

        Susan     I love you

Let's head out to see the moon
We have to do it real soon
I'll leave my wallet by the phone
I gotta make it with you

Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you
Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you

Understand I need a drink
I need to get it real soon
In need but still I fell asleep
Forgot what I had to do

Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you
Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you

I'm not sure if what you say is true
That they might be coming for you
I don't mind if you spice it up
If you promise you'll be able to choose

Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you
Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you

Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you, oh, ah
Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you

You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no

You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no
You told me, you told me, you told me no, no

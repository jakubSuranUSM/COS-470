If, I could make a wish, I think I'd pass;
Can't think of anything I need;
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound,
Nothing to eat, no books to read;
Making love with you has left me peaceful warm and tired,
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired;
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak,
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep;
Some times, all I need is the air that I breathe 
Just to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Peavce came upon me and it makes me weak,
Sleep silent angel go to sleep
Some times, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you,
All I need is the air that I breathe 
Just to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

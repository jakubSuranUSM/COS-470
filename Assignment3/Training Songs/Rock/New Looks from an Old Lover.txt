Early this morning I opened my eyes
And caught you watching me sleep
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again

I love you, I want you forever and always
Was written all over your face
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again

It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends

It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again

I feel your fingers touching my body and mind
As they brush through my hair
I'm getting news looks from an old lover again

And deep in your eyes I see the hunger
That only true love can feed
I'm getting new looks from an old lover again

It's such a good feeling
Knowing I that I can still win what I've already won
It's great to know we still can be lovers and friends

It's such a good feeling
Knowing it's better than I ever thought it could be
Because of new looks from an old lover again
I love those new looks from an old lover again

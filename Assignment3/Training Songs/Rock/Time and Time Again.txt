It's been so many years since I saw your face,
But now I'm home again back in my old place
And though you're not quite sure you think you see me by the door
I'll be there.

When the winter comes knocking on the door
And you've the firelight dancing on the floor
In the dead of night when every star is burning bright
I'll be there

Time and time again
I am always there to see you through the night
Time and time again
Rest your tired head and it will be alright
and after all is said, is said and done
Oh God you'll never know
Just how lonely life can be for me.

So let me tell you now what it's like to be
The one whose memories are scattered on the sea
When the wind goes down you'll see them lying all around.

On a cloudy day, high up in the sky
There's a lonely bird who's sailing round and round
Looking for a place to land down on the ground, for a while
Over and over again
Please give your love to me
Throw it in the wind and I'll be there.

Deep within the darkness I'm the shadow next to yours
I'll be there.

Time and time again
I am always there to see you through the night
Time and time again
Rest your tired head and it will be alright
And after all is said, is said and done
Please give your love to me
Throw it in the wind and I'll be there.

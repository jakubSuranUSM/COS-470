Word's got around that we're done for, done
So I call for you, you tell me "Run! Run! Run!"
Well scatter and hide our time has come undone
Our man's on the loose with his live wire gun

He promised us much I think he lied lied lied
Will he smoke us out? I think he'll try try try
Here comes the rain the air is glum hum drum
And it carries the scent of his live wire gun

So I'll run with you and we'll hide in the night
We'll head for the hills out of sight sight sight
I'll run with you and we'll hide in the night
We'll head for the hills out of sight sight sight sight sight

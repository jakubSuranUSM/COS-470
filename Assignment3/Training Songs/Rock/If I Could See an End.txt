Lord knows I try to smile
To say that things have always been the same
The more I look around
The more I feel that I'm the one to blame
Can't face the truth just now
Although maybe I think I should
If I could see an end
You know maybe I think I could

No sense in worrying now
'Cause things will always be the same again
Can't turn the clock back now
I really should have put my foot down then
Can't face the truth just now
Although maybe I think I should
If I could see an end
You know maybe I think I could

'Cause indifference is a bad thing
Gets a hold and don't let go
Eats a hollow place inside your mind
That makes you wonder more and more

Lord knows I try to smile

You know maybe I think I could
If I could see an end
You know maybe I think I could

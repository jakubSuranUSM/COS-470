There is thunder in Berlin
We fell down under a moving sky
When you walked into the room tonight
Lighting took hold of my heart for a while
You are all that I want
You are all that I need
Snow will come and cover this town
If we freeze I want to freeze next to you
City lights shine overheads
I never want to leave you
You are all that I want
You are all that I need
You are all that I've longed for this wintertime
You are all that I need

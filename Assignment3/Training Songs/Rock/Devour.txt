Take it and take it and take it and take it all
Take it and take it and take it until you take us all
Smash it and crash it and thrash it and trash it
You know they're only toys
Try it you'll like, it don't hide it, don't fight it, just let it out
Steal and shoot it and kill it or take another route
Take it and take it and take it
You know they're only toys

Devour, devour
Suffocate you own empire
Devour, devour
It's your final hour
Devour, devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour, devour
What a way to go!

You want it, you want it, you want it
Well here it is
Everything, everything ,everything
Isn't so primitive

Take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all
Nobody, nobody wants to feel like this
Nobody, nobody wants to live like this
Nobody, nobody wants a war like this

Devour, devour
Suffocate you own empire
Devour, devour
It's your final hour
Devour, devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour, devour
What a way to go!

Diving down, round and round [Repeat: x2]

Devour, devour
Suffocate you own empire
Devour, devour
It's your final hour
Devour, devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour, devour
What a way to go!

Devour, devour
Suffocate you own empire
Devour, devour
It's your final hour
Devour, devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour, devour
What a way to go!

Said twice not once

Here comes the morning how it pleases
It always brings me something new
Its golden light will wash away the dust of yesterday
If I try it may let me forget you

And when these winter days are over
I mean to set myself upon my feet
I see me as something that I have never been
And I'll pick up the pieces that will make the girl complete

I'll be smiling all the time at everybody
My friends will tell me I'm just not the same
I won't linger over any tragedies that were
And I won't be singing any more sad refrains

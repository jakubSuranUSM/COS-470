We'll grow old, we'll take care of each other 
I'll be your sister, your mother, your lover 
We'll be friends during changes of weather 
Let's be together on our own 
Let's be together alone 
 
We're believers, we've been hurt by believing 
Needing people, we know looking's not seeing 
I see needs that might be answered by forever 
Together on our own 
Let's be together alone 
 
We'll learn living, like the words of a good song 
We'll learn timing, balance and rhythm 
We'll make it music 
I don't want to sing it on my own 
Let's be together, let's be together alone 
 
Let's be together alone 
Let's be together alone 
 
We'll grow old, we'll take care of each other 
I'll be sister, mother and lover 
We'll be friends 
I'm tired of singing it alone 
Let's be together alone

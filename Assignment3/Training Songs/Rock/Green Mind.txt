Man, oh, man
My hands in the plans
Fan of the man
Sands in the plans

I'm at home
On my own
Gone and flown
A home's a home

Ren the Hoak
And other folk
Soaked and soaked
By their joke

Hey, hey, Joe, Joe
Whatcha know, whatcha know?
Hey, hey, Joe, Joe
Whatcha know, whatcha know?

Push and push
The level of the tone
A bone's a bone
A moan's a moan

What's next, what's next?
Who knows not those?
Bear it wear it
Live it or die it

Hearts that bleed
Hearts that need
Need and need
Bleed and bleed

Toke and toke
The smokin' toke
Smokin' Joe, he know
Smokin' Joe, he know

Hit after hit
My f*ck's not fit
To sit and sit
And follow that shit

On my own
My brain's my home
I'm alone you're alone
I'm alone we're alone

Push and push
The level of the tone
A bone's a bone
A moan's a moan

What's next, what's next?
Who knows not those?
Bear it wear it
Live it or die it

There's no glove
There's no love
Push to shove
No glove no love

Safety first
Safely thirst
Skirt the hurt
That ignorance flirts

Go to bed
Cover your head
Cover your head
Or end up dead

Cover you heard
Or end up dead
Cover your head
Or end up dead

Man on man
My hands in the plans
Fan of the man
Sands in the plans

I'm at home
On my own
Gone and flown
A home's a home

Ren the Hoak
Another bloke
Soaked and soaked
By the joke

Hey, hey, John K
Watcha say, watcha say?
Hey, hey, Joe, Joe
Watcha know, watcha know?

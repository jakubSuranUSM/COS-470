Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the things I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find

What shall I do?
(What shall I do?)
What shall I do?
(What shall I do?)

Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise
All my women have gone out with other boys
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find

I won't complain
(I won't complain)
I feel no pain
(I feel no pain)

Ooh, if this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain
(I won't complain)
I feel no pain
(I feel no pain)

Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the thing I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find

I won't complain
(I won't complain)
I feel no pain
(I feel no pain)
I won't complain, cry
Ooh

Getting out! [x3]

Get tight, Getting loaded
Walk right, on over
Turn up, Stay late
Time to nail me another mistake
Destroy, Displace
Outside of the human space
I need, some action
I gotta get myself some satisfaction

[Chorus]
Hey now! Hey now!
I gotta find a way to get out!
Hey now! Hey now!
Gotta get a ticket out!
Hey now hey now
Outta my head
Hey now hey now
Outta my head!

Pick up, Warp speed
Get a hold of the things I need
No calls, No show
No rain no place to go
Magazine, fade out
No time like, right now
Just one, solution
Yeah
I've gotta get things moving

[Chorus]

Out of my head [x3]

Taken way to much
And I'm cracking up
This place self destroyed
Defaced, paranoid

I'm going out of head! [x4]

There's a high flyin' bird, way up in the sky now,
You know I wonder if she looks down, as she flies on by?
She's flying on the air so easily in the sky.

Lord, look at me here,
I'm rooted like a tree here, yes I am now.
I got those sit-down,
Can't cry Oh Lord, I'm gonna die blues.

You know the sun come around and lights up the day now,
And when he gets tired, you know it roles on on his way
To the east and to the west,
You know he meets God every day.

Lord, look at me here,
I'm rooted like a tree here, yes I am now.
I got those sit-down,
Can't cry Oh Lord, I'm gonna die blues.

Now I had a woman 
Lord, she lived down by the mine, 
She ain't never seen the sun,
Oh Lord, never stopped crying.

Then one day my man ,
Lord, she up and died now.
Oh Lord, she up and died now.
She wanted to die,
And the only way to fly is die, die, die.

There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky,
And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by?
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky.

Lord, look at me here,
I'm rooted like a tree here,
Got those sit-down, can't cry,
Oh, Lord, gonna die blues.

That night we fell in love
Beneath the stars from above
That was a lovely summer night
Remember then, then, then, then then
The summer is over
Our loving is over
To lose that love was such a shame
Remember then, then, then, then, then
Remember then, then, then, then, then
Our love is in the past 
Why has it gone so fast
Why couldn't our love last 
I'm broken hearted now 
Since we have parted now 
My mind wonders now and then 
Remember then, then, then, then, then
Remember then, then, then, then, then

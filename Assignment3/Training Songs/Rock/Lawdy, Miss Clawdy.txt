When I lawdy lawdy lawdy Miss Clawdy
Girl you sure look good to me
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'
But I can't believe it's me

You know I give you all my money
Girl but she just won't treat me right
You like to ball in the morning
Come home late at night

But I'm gonna tell tell my mama
Lawdy what you've been doin' to me
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'
Just like a willow tree

When I lawdy lawdy lawdy Miss Clawdy
Girl you sure look good to me
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'
But I can't believe it's me

You know I give you all my money
Girl but she just won't treat me right
You like to ball in the morning
Come home late at night

But I'm gonna tell tell my mama
Lawdy what you've been doin' to me
You got me reelin' and a-rockin'
Just like a willow tree

Well now Bye Bye-bye Baby
Girl you sure look good to me
But I'm tired of reelin' and a-rockin'
Just like a willow tree

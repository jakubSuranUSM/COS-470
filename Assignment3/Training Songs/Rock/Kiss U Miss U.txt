Alone with you, there comes a time 
That makes the change 
A change deep down inside of me 
Once I was blind 
Now every sense crawls back to life 
And like a new-born I can see 

It takes no life to catch the bliss of happiness 
We long for moments that will last 
There comes a time 
When I'll be standing by your side 
A long day's journey into night 

Those seconds are the rags of time 
But they will make you see 
Those moments never pass you by 
I store them, I hold them in me 

Oh, I kiss you, miss you anyway 
Oh, I kiss you, miss you every day 

There comes a time 
When I will find that precious love 
Comes a time when time will end 
There comes a time 
When we will dance the night away 
A time when we will not pretend

Roll your rain
Roll your rain
Roll your rain down

Well, help me peel the frown off my face...chit-chat-chat
I need a little faith an' that's what I'm after
Diamonds on a band in your hair...chit-chat-chat
You're talkin' to your wall, you're sleepin' with a stranger

[Chorus:]
Oh, moon river
Moon river

Lisa doesn't know what I mean...chit-chat-chat
I try to make it good, I can't rearrange her
Standin' in the track of her tears...chit-chat-chat
You know I'm just a child, I can't see the danger

[Chorus:]

Roll your rain
Roll your rain
Roll your rain down

Oooh, well, typin' up alone in my room...chit-chat-chat
The night goes creepin' by, I talk to the paper
Wakin' up to sun feelin' fine...chit-chat-chat
Got shoes aroun' my feet an' I'm off to my races

[Chorus:]

Roll your rain
Roll your rain
Roll your rain down

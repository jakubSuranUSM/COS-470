Once again I'm gonna make it plain,
I'm much happier with you again,

They say it's the thought that counts,
Your feelings are like cheques that bounce,
I've said before I should be glad,
I'll say it again 'cos I'm feeling sad.

I was lying, I told the truth,
But I was lying,
I thought I knew what you wanted me to say,
But I was lying, I told the truth,
But I was lying.

I don't know what you'll think when you hear me say,
That it's the very first time I've felt this way,
It cuts me up that we;ve come to this,
It's your turn to want, I want another kiss,
the longer this situation persists,
I know your critics will glow,
And if they don't come and change soon honey,
You know I'll change my vote.

It feels so all-consuming,
It's a hunger so consuming,
You've started life inside of me.

Once again I'm gonna make it plain,
I'm much happier with you again,
I'm scared of the way you make me feel,
And I'm always wondering if you love me still,
Tell me how you dream,
I'd like to rip your heart out at its seams.
Tell me how you feel,
Do you love me still?

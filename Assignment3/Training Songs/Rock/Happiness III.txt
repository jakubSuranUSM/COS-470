Something in this town is draining me
Could be the junk food or the gasoline
I hide it well

Tangled up in my last cigarette for a hundred years
I'm not as much of a slave to it as I appear
I'm just bored

Sorry that was cruel I only meant for you to lose your balance in the snow
Slip on the ice so I can catch you fall
Sorry that's not true I didn't think that you would take it all to heart

I'm tired of burning up the time at my PC
I only end up downloading the same old pornography
The same old scene

Sorry that was cruel I only meant for you to lose your balance in the snow
Slip on the ice so I can catch you fall
Sorry that's not true I didn't think that you would take it all to heart
I just to made it up so I could watch you crawl
Sorry if I'm rude I'm getting at your side a darker mood comes over me

Are there any reasons left to get out of bed
Is there anything else I can write that I haven't read
It's all been said

Sorry that was cruel I only meant for you to lose your balance in the snow
Slip on the ice so I can catch you fall
Sorry that's not true I didn't think that you would take it all to heart
I just to made it up so I could watch you crawl

Sorry if I'm rude I'm getting at your side a darker mood comes over me
And it's always worse in the shopping mall
Sorry that was cruel I only meant for you to lose your balance in the snow
Slip on the ice so I can catch you fall

Sorry that's not true I didn't think that you would take it all to heart
I just to made it up so I could watch you crawl

The reverse side of beauty
It dyed by beloved filth
The reverse side of beauty
It dyed by beloved filth

幻惑の海 沈んだ蛍
否定は欲求上の嘘
矛盾で染まる体温
理性を破る愛撫に
踊り溶け込む春は不意に
汚らわしく
My mind which falls
Your seed and
My seed never mixes
The connection of
This blood is eternal
You cannot finish
Suppressing the desire
To true daughter
Sexual disgrace
吐息塞ぐ脈打つ 「飢え」 は
解り合えぬ紅蓮を求む
Closet mind is distorted instability
Please release me
Before breaking
How long
How long
How long
In humiliation
The countless fatal
Scar was born
Sexual disgrace

Prohibited bud
Reckless driving cucumber
The kin' collapses
Near relatives on death
The smell of a cigarette
Smell breath ＆ shit
Moment that bitter
White jam is mixed
Inside of a brain
Caused an error
And goes mad by the sweet bug
Loop
Your seed and
My seed never mixes
The connection of
This blood is eternal
You cannot finish
Suppressing the desire
To true daughter
Sexual disgrace
首を這わす舌先と手
望む表情 紅蓮に染まれ
Closet mind
Is distorted instability
Please release me
Before breaking
How long
How long
How long
In humiliation
The countless fatal
Scar was born
Closet mind
Is distorted instability
Please release me
Before breaking
So long
So long
So long
In humiliation
The final art is
Your dead face
Dad which fell to the trap

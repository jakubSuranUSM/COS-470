It was long ago
You remember though
Like it's yesterday
How you took my innocence and then you stole away
Never to return
Glad it's over now
I can laugh at now
You said I'm the one
Then you lit the fuse and so amused you turned and run
And it's me who got burned
But you'll always stay in love they say
(With the first love, it's your last love)
And you'll always be a part of me
Wouldn't want it any other way

And I wish you luck
I wish you love
Wherever you call home
And you'll always be a part of me
May you never be alone

There's been many times
When I feel that I'm
Living in despair
And believing in a dream that nobody shares
Well you live and learn

But you'll always stay in love they say
(With the first love, it's your last love)
And you'll always be a part of me
Wouldn't want it any other way

And I wish you luck
I wish you love
Wherever you call home
And you'll always be a part of me
May you never be alone

But you'll always stay in love they say
And you'll always be a part of me
But you'll always stay in love they say
(With the first love, it's your last love)
And you'll always be a part of me
Wouldn't want it any other way

And I wish you luck
I wish you love
Wherever you call home
And I'm here to tell
I wish you well
May you never be alone

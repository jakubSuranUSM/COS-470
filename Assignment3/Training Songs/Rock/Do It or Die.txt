Don't let your troubles make you cry
Don't waste a moment wondering why
When everything goes wrong 
You have to go on 
And do it or die
Do it or die now
Stand your ground 

Don't let your bad breaks go gettin' you down
Even when times get rough 
And you've had enough
You still gotta try 
Do it no matter what the people say 
They don't even know you

Die before you let them stand in your way (Don't you know that)
You should know that life is a gamble all along
Winners or losers you keep rollin' on
So go on and roll the dice
You only live twice
So do it or die

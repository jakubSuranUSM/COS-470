I have learned that love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know you had to go
You've got your reasons
Still I wish you would stay
Tell me why you are going away
It hurts me not knowing
And I believe that love's light leaves in September
But Fall; and all I do is remember
Still I wish you would stay
Tell me why you are going away
It hurts me not knowing
How I have wronged you
Oh, how I long to hold you again
Like summer never ended
But winter must fall and I will give all
Of my love to someone new
For summer must follow too, and you
And I have learned that love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know you had to go
You have your reasons
Still I wish you would stay.......

Oh yes, this is it.
This will be the night.
Let your forcefield drop,
Sensors out, and try to communicate
Your x-ray ears are shattering the walls
In your home.
Go, disconnect the phone
It's primitive and cold.
Free the dormant you
Dying to unfold.
Communicate!
I'll meet you in your room.
We'll interrupt your dreaming.
You'll say a prayer or two.
Don't give me that!
Like anyone could help you.
Don't give me that!
Hey!
It's tonight.
This will be the night.
Of all the years you have wished
It could be you and now
It is right! yes!
This is it!
This will be the night!
Communicate!
Try to communicate!
Crawl to your intellect
And ask for it's advice.
Pray, give a sign
The difference of men and mice.
I'll meet you in your room.
We'll do it while you're sleeping.
You'll say a prayer or two.
Don't give me that!
Like anyone could help you.
Give me that!
Hey!
Yeah, this could be the night.
Of all the years you have wished
It could be you, and now
This is your night.
Of all the years that you wished it could be you,
All those years that you dropped
To your knees and ticked away
All the years that you wished it could be you, and now
It is right! yes!
This is it!
This will be the night!
Try to communicate!
Communicate!
This will be the night.

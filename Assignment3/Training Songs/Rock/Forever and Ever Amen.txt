We, we are in love
We, forever
We're, not gonna stop
We'll be, forever

And all the stars in the sky
And all the flowers in the fields
And all the power in the Earth
Could never take you from my heart

And it's forever, baby it's forever
It's forever, baby it's forever
And Let me run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky
We'll Run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky

We, we are the ones
When, together
We, we are the young
We live, forever

And all the stars in the sky
And all the flowers in the fields
And all the power in the Earth
Could never take you from my heart

And it's forever, baby it's forever
It's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky
We'll run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky

Forever and ever

And it's forever, baby it's forever
It's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky
We'll Run til the end of time
Until our hearts are aligned into the sky

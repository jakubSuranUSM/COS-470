I was askin'
For two dollars
Two shots
To Kill the King

"If you really love me
And you're thinking of me
You'd do just about anything"
It happened on a sunday

The liqour stores were closed
Thank heaven for the blue laws
We were swimmin' in out sunday clothes
I was askin'

For two dollars
To cook up somethin' cheap
I was shakin' like the rabbit
That was hangin' from her teeth

"And in many degrees of heat
The fire looked at the meat
And said 'if I cook you
The least you can do

Is lay there and be sweet' "
Call the fire in winter
When it snows it won't be cold
Call the wind in summer

If the salt should reign as gold
Eraticus
Kill the King
Magantas
Kill the King

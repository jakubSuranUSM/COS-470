no summer in the winter time
will keep you warm like a funeral pyre
and nothing like an august night
drenched
in your loving

I got a dirty
black summer
and nothing in the coolest light
can stop the walking out across
the line
no holding back the summer night
I got a feeling

it's just a dirty
black summer

Cheat the odds that made you
Brave to try to gamble at times
Well I feel like dirty laundry
Sending sickness on down the line
Tell you why, 'cause I'm

Jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby

Always drunk on Sunday
Tryin' to feel like I'm at home
Smell the gasoline burning
Boys out feeling nervous and cold

Ooh yeah, yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby

Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you

Never felt like smiling
Sugar wanna kill me yet
Find me loose lipped and laughing
Singing songs, ain't got no regrets 
 
Oh yeah yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, I'm jealous again
Got no time, baby

Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you

Don't you think I want to
Don't you think I would
Don't you think I'd tell you baby
If I only could
Am I acting crazy
Am I just too proud
Am I just plain lazy
Am I, am I, am I, ever

Jealous, jealous again
Thought it time that I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time to let you in

Oh yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time now to let you in
Jealous, yeah, I'm jealous again
Got no time, baby, yeah yeah, oh yeah

I want to spend my life with a girl like you
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
And do all the things that you want me to
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
'Till that time has come that we might live as one
Can I dance with you
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba

I can tell by the way you dress that you're so refined
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
And by the way you talk that you're just my kind
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
Girl why should it be that you don't notice me
Can I dance with you
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba

Baby baby, is there no chance
I can take you for the last dance
All night long, yeah, I've been waiting
Now there'll be no hesitating

So before this dance has reached the end
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
To you across the floor my love I'll send
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
I just hope and pray that I'll find a way to say
Can I dance with you
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba bah ba ba ba ba

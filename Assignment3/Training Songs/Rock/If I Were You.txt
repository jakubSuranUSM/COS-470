You seem to find the dark, when everything is bright
You look for all that's wrong, instead of all that right
Does it feel good to you? to reign on my parade
You never say a word, unless it's to complain
It's driving me insane

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.
The first thing I'd do, is thank the stars for all that I am
If I were you

Look what's around you now, more than you ever dreamed
Have you forgotten just, how hard it use to be?
So what's it going to take? for you to realize
That all could go away, in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.
The first thing I'd do, is thank the stars above, tell the words I love
That I do

Yea if I were you,
Whoa, yea if I were you
If I were you, whoa
Yea if I were you

So what's it going to take? for you to realise
It all could go away, in one blink of an eye it happens all the time!

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.
The first thing I'd do, is thank the stars above, tell the words I love
Take a breath and enjoy the view
Live the life that I wanted to
If I were you if I were you if I were you!

Seems like that everywhere I go
Seems like that everything I do
Seems like everything I dream about
Seems like everywhere I look

Well I got girls, girls on my mind
I think about them mostly all the time
Oh ? so tell me what you'd do?
Oh ? if you were in my shoes?

No, thank you, please, I'm only looking
I don't believe we've met before
I guess I died and went to heaven
Or else I'm lookin' out my nose

(Cause) I got girls, girls on my mind
I think about them sometimes all the time
Oh ? well what about tonight?
Oh ? so what about today?

People say that I am crazy
People say that I am strange
But I don't care about what people say
Cause they can't see inside my brain

I've got girls girls girls girls girls girls
Every lil' girl ? stays in my mind
Oh ? and when I go to sleep
Oh ? I pray my soul to keep

I'm the star of my own movie
Honey, I'm the leading man
You might ask yourself ? who is that guy?
With the girls upon his mind?

I got girls girls girls girls girls ? girls on my mind
Every lil' girl
Stays in my mind
Long, short n' tall ? they're all in my mind

Flyin' all around
All around my mind
Flyin' up and down
All through my mind

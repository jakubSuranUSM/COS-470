Baby
Frozen tears
It was hard through the years

I'll never give up
Never one of my dreams.
Deep inside is my love still alive

And God only knows that I can't let you go.
When I'm in love it'll be for better

I gave you my heart for ever and ever.
No arms can ever hold you more than I do
No man can ever love you
No
It's true.
No arms can ever hold you more than I do

You came to me from heaven
Girl
It's true.
And if I ever lose your love
If I ever lose your heart

Oh baby
I'm dying for your love.

Baby
Now I'm alone and I try to be strong

But my baby
I cry
Silent tears without pride.
And I can't hold on to the feeling that's gone

And there's nothing to lose
'Cause I'm playing the fool.
When I'm in love it'll be for better

I gave you my heart for ever and ever.
No arms can ever hold you more than I do

And l ever lose your smile
And if I ever lose your heart

Everybody need someone to love
And I say,
No arms can ever hold you more than I do

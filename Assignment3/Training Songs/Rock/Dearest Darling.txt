Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling

Don't you know
The lord above
Created you
Just for me to love

Picked you out
From all the rest
Because he knew I loved you best

Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand

I once had a heart
So trill and true
But now it's gone
From me to you

Take care of it
Like I have done
For you have two hearts
And I have none

Dearest darling
Dearest darling
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah
Darling, yeah yeah, darling, yeah yeah

If I get to heaven
Before you do
I'll try to make a hole
And pull you through

Woah, dearest, dearest, dearest

If I go to heaven
And you not there
I'm gonna write your name
On the heavenly stair

If you aren't there
By turn of day
Then I know baby
You know the way

Woah, dearest, dearest, dearest
Oh sweet baby, oh sweet baby, oh, oh, oh

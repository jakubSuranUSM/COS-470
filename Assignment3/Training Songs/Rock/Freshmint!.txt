we're on the way up
i don't want to stop
we're goin' to the top
there's nothing stopping us now
we're not going to lose
and yeah we've got all the moves
just keep the shine in our shoes
we'll never let you down

no pain no gain
light up the sky like a flame
and bum a whole in your brain
no more decisions are ours
and when you're where it's at
you can't do better than that
how could it be such pap?
one thing i never knew

and every time i go to bed
these things keep running through my head
there's nothing going on out there...
nothing going on out there...

be	 be	 be	 baby i could be your superstar
and take too many drugs in a celebrity bar
k k k keep my skin soft and shining from afar
for my high speed death in the back of a car

we're on the way down
and when you hit the ground
you know you make no sound
and no-one sweeps you away
it's tough at the top
you never know when you'll pop
but when you've got what you've got
you never think twice
you don't remember my name
you don't remember my face
thought it was burnt on your brain
was it so long ago?
and now i'm losing my hair
you know that just can't be fair
and next to nobody cares when it's over

and every time i go to bed
these things keep running through my head
there's nothing going on out there...
nothing going on out there...

be	 be	 be	 baby i could be your superstar
and take too many drugs in a celebrity bar
k k k keep my skin soft and shining from afar
for my high speed death in the back of a car
be	 be	 be	 baby i could be your superstar
and we could boot champagne and snort caviar
s s s stick with me honey and you'll go far
as we watch the world burning from a heated spa

burn baby burn (x4)

I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news

Can't find me a reason for sure

Don't tell me why
It's over I can see the end
But please don't lie
If you're leavin' leave me like a friend

I've been tossed around plenty of times
And I've read between all of the lines
You're just another in the grand design
And I've gotten used to bad news

Yeah yeah

I know what you're sayin' is bad
It's not what I wanted but I'm ready for that
I'm ready for that, yeah

I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news
I've gotten used to bad news [Repeat: x4]
Yeah yeah

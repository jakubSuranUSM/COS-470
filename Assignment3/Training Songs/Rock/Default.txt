It slipped my mind
And for a time
I felt completely free

Oh what a troubled
Silent, poor boy
A pawn into a queen

I laugh now
But later is not so easy
I've gotta stop
The will is strong
But the flesh is weak
I guess that's it
I've made my bed
And I'm lying in it

I'm still hanging on
Bird upon the wires
I fall between the waves

I avoid your gaze
I turn out of phase
A pawn into a queen

I laugh now,
But later is not so easy
I've gotta stop
The will is strong
But the flesh is weak
I guess that's it
I've made my bed
And I'm lying in it

But it's eating me up
But it's eating me up
It's eating me up (If I could feel all the snakes on my heads)
It's eating me up (If I could feel all my snails on my heads)
It's eating me up (If I could feel all my snares on my head)

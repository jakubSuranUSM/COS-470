This is the hour when the city turns blue 
This is the time of the lost and found 
They loose the nutters in the Underground 
Everything's far and nothing is true 

When the streets don't feel like a neutral zone 
Or the strangers eye like a neutral glance 
The very next step might blow your chance 
Of finding your way home alone - 

Look sharp 
It's like an opening door, look sharp 
It's what we came here for, look sharp 
You never know what the wind may blow 

And your life's like the voice in the room upstairs 
Raised to someone you never hear 
You can try and try, it never comes clear 
Are you saying or swearing your prayers? 

But the eyes are wide that were shut for shame 
Dogs in their backyards jump up and bark 
Hull and Halifax wake in the dark 
Like someone was calling their name - 

Look sharp 
It's like an opening door, look sharp 
It's what we came here for, look sharp 
You never know what the wind may blow 

This is the hour when the city turns blue 
This is the time of the lost and found 
There's no saviours hanging around 
Keeping a watch over you 

There's words on the wall and a stinking lift 
I hold my breath to the 14th floor 
Empty-handed I knock at your door 
My empty hands are my gift - 

Look sharp 
It's like an opening door, look sharp 
It's what we came here for, look sharp 
You never know what the wind may blow

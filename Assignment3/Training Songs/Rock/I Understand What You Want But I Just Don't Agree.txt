Running all my love in your snow
I play with caller's files when alone
They don't mean bad when they fool you on the phone
The way they walk led them to dream on their own

ohhh

Four thirty A.M. and I'm creeping out
I play the courtroom when I meet your snow
Hang on to the only one
When all the lovers turn and prey on the phone

And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you want
And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you need
And the eyes turn around at you
But I just don't agree

I'm incredible
You just don't see
I'm incredible
you just don't agree

Close my eyes and there will be crying
Oh
Close my eyes and there will be love, love, love

And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you want
And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you need
And the eyes turn around at you
But I just don't agree
Don't agree, don't agree

I'm incredible
You just don't see
I'm incredible
you just don't agree

And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you want
And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you need
And the eyes turn around at you
But I just don't agree, don't agree

I understand what you want
And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you want
And the eyes turn around at you
I understand what you want
And my eyes turn around at you
But I just don't agree, don't agree

And the eyes turn around at you
And the eyes turn around at you
And the eyes turn around at you
I just don't agree

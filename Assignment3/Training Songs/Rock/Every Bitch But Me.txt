You have seen me lie, you have seen me crucify my love
I want it to die, I want it to kiss your ass goodbye
'cause all I ever wanted, all I ever needed, was one hope of respect
Everything I live for, I'm never gonna give you, 
Is one hope of respect, from you

All my lies are good, I have scratched the surface of your shit,
Only ??, it could help my love ?? hold on
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed was one hope of respect
Everything I live for, I'm never gonna give you,
Is one hope of respect, ....from you, ...from you

Love is not the same, is not the same from you 
Love is not the same, is not the same from you 

Not the same to me, not the same to everyone but me
Not the same with me, you're the same to every bitch but me.

'cause all I ever wanted, all I ever needed, was one hope of respect
Everything I live for, I'm never gonna give you, 
Is one hope of respect

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed was one hope of respect
Everything I live for, I'm never gonna give you,
Is one hope of respect

One hope.......of respect X4
Is it on my love upon X2

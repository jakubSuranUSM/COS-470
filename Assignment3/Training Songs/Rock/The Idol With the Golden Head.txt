Bought myself an idol with a golden head
(Great big idol with the golden head)
Put it on a shelf right above my bed
(Great big idol with the golden head)

Got down on my knees and began to pray
(Great big idol with the golden head)
I said, idol, tell me where's my bigfoot May?
(Great big idol with the golden head)

The idol's eyes began to wink and blink
(Great big idol with the golden head)
He said, hold on Jim, give me time to think
(Great big idol with the golden head)

The lightning flashed and the idol did speak
(Great big idol with the golden head)
He said, your bigfoot May, she's down at Catfish Creek

Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Yes, she's rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
(Hopping and a-bopping and a-bumping and a-jumping and, oh)

I said goodbye to the idol sitting on my shelf
(Oh, gee, what did you see?)
Went down to the creek to see for myself
(Oh, gee, what did you see?)

I parked my car and I looked around
(Oh, gee, what did you see?)
There was a mess of empty beer cans laying on the ground
(Oh, gee, what did you see?)

I peeked through the door and my hair turned gray
(Oh, gee, what did you see?)
In the middle of the floor there was bigfoot May

Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Yes, she was rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
(Hopping and a-bopping and a-bumping and a-jumping and, oh)

I went back to the house, I was feeling so blue
(Great big idol with the golden head)
I said, tell me, idol, what am I gonna do?
(Great big idol with the golden head)

He said, I got the answer, there's only one way
(Great big idol with the golden head)
You got to learn to do the boogie with your big foot May

Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Yes, rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
Rocking and a-rolling (rocking and a-rolling)
(Hopping and a-bopping and a-bumping and a-jumping)

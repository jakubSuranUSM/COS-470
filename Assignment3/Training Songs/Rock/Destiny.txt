[Chorus]
Cause its the pick! of Destiny, child
You know where we'll be rockin cause its fucking insane 
Its just the pick! of Destiny, child
More precious than a diamond on a platinum chain
[Verse 1]
In Venice Beach there was a man named Kage
When he was buskin he was all the rage
He met Jables and he taught him well
All the techniques that were developed in Hell
Cock Push-ups and the Power Slide
Geek simulation now there's nowhere to hide
They formed a band they named Tenacious D
And then they got the Pick Of Destiny
[Chorus 2]
Cause its the pick! of Destiny, child
You know where we'll be rockin cause its freakin' insane
Its just the pick! of Destiny, child
Our tasty grooves are better than a Chicken Cho-mein
Cause he who is sleazy, is easy to pleasy
And she who is juicy, must be loosy goosy
And he who is groovy, will be in my movie so come on!
[Verse 2]
The wizard and the demon had a Battle Royale
The demon almost killed him with an evil ka-pow
But then it broke its tooth and thus the demon said "ow"
[Chorus 3]
Cause its the pick! of Destiny, child
You know where we'll be rockin cause its fucking insane
Cause its the pick! of destiny, child, 
You know our movie's better than the Citizen Kane
Cause he who's a geezer, must live in my freezer
And she who is starky, is full of malarky
And he who is groovy, must be in my movie so come on!
(Guitar Solo) 
Cause if your a diva, then go to Geneva
And if your a croney, then suck on my boney
And if you are groovy, then get in my movie
Its called the Pick of Destiny
The Pick of Destiny...!!!

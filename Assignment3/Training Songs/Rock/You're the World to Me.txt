Started talking and the line went dead
Never heard a single word you said

You don't have to turn the sound up
Babe I want you from the ground up

Baby baby you're the world to me

I woke up, the room was cold
Looking tired, feeling old
Cursin' all the changes I've to say
The more I cursed into the flood
The less it seemed do me good
Clearer became my mind than I could say
Baby baby you're the world to me

My head is roaring like a waterfall
Give me everything or not at all
You don't have to turn the sound up
Babe I want you from the ground up
Baby baby you're the world to me

Baby baby you're the world to me

Baby baby you're the world to me
Baby baby you're the world to me

You don't have to turn the sound up
Babe I want you from the ground up
Baby baby you're the world to me

Iridescent like a starlet
Won't you be my little darling
Baby baby you're the world to me

Baby baby you're the world to me
Baby baby you're the world to me

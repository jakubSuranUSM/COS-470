Each night, I wish to God he'd let her rest
Oh, this hurts me more than any man can bear
She's my angel from the west
There will never be one to take her place

When you go, I will know
Follow you to the stars
And when the world burns apart
There'll be a place for your car

I'd give you everything
If only I'd have known you'd take it
But you don't, 'cause you're you
That's why I'll always love you

My Pearl of the stars

Of the pills she takes, the pain of which she drowns
Our baby sleeps next door, she's new in town
I tell her how wonderful you were
I'll remember everything you were to me

When you go, I will know
Follow you to the stars
And when the world burns apart
There'll be a place for your car

I'd give you everything
If only I'd have known you'd take it
But you don't, 'cause you're you
That's why I'll always love you

My Pearl of the stars

When you go, I will know
Follow you to the stars
And when the world burns apart
There'll be a place for your car

I'd give you everything
If only I'd have known you'd take it
But you don't, 'cause you're you
That's why I'll always love you

When you go, I will know
Follow you to the stars
And when the world burns apart
There'll be a place for your car

Yeah I'd give you everything
If only I'd have known you'd take it
But you don't, 'cause you're you
That's why I'll always love you

My Pearl of the stars

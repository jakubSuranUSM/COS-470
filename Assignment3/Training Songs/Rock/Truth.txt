In an ocean of frustration
Sails the ancient freedom boat.
Sailor man of wonder
On his island quite remote.

Truth the ship of oneness
In her stormy sea of doubt.
Dawn of rain bowed fancy
Beacons to young men of the night.

Dancing lady of temptation
Pull the shade and douse the light
Truth can only wonder,
A ray of hope is shining bright

Warriors of the outside, 
Begin their pagan hostile dance
Mystics of hypocrisy,
They're the sad ones and they put 
 
Themselves out in a deep trance
Truth can only wonder,
If this world makes any sense.
Warriors of the outside,

Begin their pagan hostile dance
Mystics of hypocrisy
They're the ones who put the
 
Sad ones in their trance
Truth can only wonder,
If this world makes any sense.

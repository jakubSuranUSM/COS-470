I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while

Far is solace in the maddening pace
Sad state written on my face
Not a tight rope walk but dance, (whoa whoa)
Uncertain game of chance, (whoa whoa)
But I'll see it through in time

I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while

And if a person place or thing can deliver I would quiver with delight
Tempted by the hand that could blind my vision and sight
But at twenty years of age, (whoa whoa)
In frolic and in rage, (whoa whoa)
I will see it through in time

I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
I'll be here a while

But the dawn has come into the endless night
And everything, is going to be alright
But at thirty years of age, (whoa whoa)
Through frolic and in rage, (whoa whoa)
All regressed and healed in time

I'll be here a while, ain't going nowhere
Said I, said I, said I, I will survive

Just got back from the downtown palais
Where the music was so sweet
Knocked me right back in the alley
I'm ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Oh, oh, oh, I'm ready and I'm really gonna rock tonight

Sweet little lady sings like a songbird
And she sings the opera like you ain't never heard
But she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
And she ain't gonna rock and roll

She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room

Come on, I'll show you how to sing the blues
Now baby, come on over you got nothin' to lose
Are you ready, hey, hey, hey are you ready?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, are you ready?
I wanna show you how to rock and roll

Now listen here baby she said to me
"Just meet me at the opera house at a quarter to three
'Cause I'm ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm ready
I'm gonna show you how to sing the blues"

She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room
Far, far away the music is playing

Well, we were reelin' and a rockin' all through the night
Yeah, we were rockin' at the opera house until the break of light
And the orchestra were playin' all Chuck Berry's greatest tunes
And the singers in the chorus all got off on singing blues

And as the night grew older everybody was as one
The people on the streets came runnin' in to join in song
Just to hear the opera singer singin' rock and roll so pure
I thought I saw the mayor there but I wasn't really sure, but it's alright

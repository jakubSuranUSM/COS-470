In the state of Montana
In the Year of the Ford
Nineteen hundred & fifty-four
People are leaving
They're driving all night
Women are crying
They're frozen in lights
And we roll on the river

Our river is black
Our river is deep
Headlights & moonlight
A space full of grief
Secrets and heartaches must carry the load
The heart of the thing is the thing we don't know
And we roll out the barrels

Lo & behold, the night is too long
Anchored in heartache
Afraid of the dawn
Nobody changes
The truth is all gone
Bosses say Everybody must go
And we roll on the ribbons of our dreams

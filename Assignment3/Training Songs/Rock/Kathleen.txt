You're sympatico
And of all the lifts home and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
And Yes, I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you're thinking
But, Let me know when i'm needed home

And I'll come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me you know
Cause he used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress fit for the summer
So you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full of filth
And yes, I know
That I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But, Let me know when i'm needed home

And I'll come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me you know
Cause he used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

The last dance might be your last chance 
Over your shoulder you turn and you glance 
They walk past still no one has asked 
Feeling much older the evening has crashed
Don't surrender don't you cry 
Another lonely night you've had enough 
Another lonely night is one too much 
Another lonely night might just give up 
The last dance
The last dance you hide your empty hands 
No one comes near you 
The noise of the band 
You can't talk so you get up and walk 
All that you've been though 
It's not like you thought

You're smart enough to make your mistakes
And act like you want 'em
Walk off the residual pain
And forget how you got it
Nice guys finish last anyway
And that's just the problem

If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more than you
I want it more than you

It's fine to say this isn't a game
When you've already lost it
It's pointless to go through it again
But perhaps you've forgotten
You've gotta know there's nothing to gain
So why even bother?

If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more than you
I want it more than you

This isn't a trick
So stop over-thinking everything
Just finish your drink
And stop over-thinking everything

If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you're the nice guy, act like the nice guy
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more
If you want this, I want it more than you
I want it more than you
I want it more than you
I want it more than you

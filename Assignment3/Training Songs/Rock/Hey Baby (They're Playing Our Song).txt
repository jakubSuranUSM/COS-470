Hey, baby, they're playin' our song,
The one we used to hear when we used to get along,
Hey, baby, they're playin' our song,
Let's get back together, that's where we belong.

It's the one with the pretty melody,
It's the one that made you fall in love with me.
It made us feel so groovy,
We fell in love, just like in the movies.

Hey, baby, they're playin' our song,
The one they used to play when we used to get along,
Hey, baby, they're playin' our song,
Let's get back together, that's where we belong.

Pleasant memories are comin' back to me (Sigh),
Can't you remember the way it used to be? (Sigh)

It made us feel like dancin',
It gave us time to think about romancin'.

Hey, baby, hey, baby!
Hey, baby, hey, baby!

It's the one with the pretty melody,
It's the one that made you fall in love with me.
It made us feel so groovy,
We fell in love, just like in the movies.

Hey, baby, hey, baby!
Thet're playin' our song, can't you hear it now?
Hey, baby, hey, baby!
I said they're playin' our song, can't you hear it, yeah!
Hey, baby, hey, baby!
Can't you hear it, baby?

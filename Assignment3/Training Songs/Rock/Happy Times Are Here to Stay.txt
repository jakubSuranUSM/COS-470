You've been hurt
I can see that you've been cryin'
You've been hurt
But your tears can start dryin'
Now you've got a man
Who's gonna get you smilin' every day
Baby happy times are here to stay
Just forget all the loneliness you've gone through
Don't you fret now I'm yours to hold on to 
Yeah, you've got a man who's gonna kiss that loneliness away
Baby, happy times are here to stay

I'm gonna do all the things that he forget to do
The sentimental things, the sweet and gentle things
I'm gonna make every happy dream come try for you
Better stop y our grievin' now
And start believin' now
Don't you know I'll bring you happiness
Every heartaches in the past now
You've been blessed with a love that will last now
'Cause you got a man who's living just to hear his baby
Say that her happy times are here to stay

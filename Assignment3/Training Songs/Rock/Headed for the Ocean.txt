I'm headed for the ocean with everything I have 
I have a bit of what you wanted 
And twenty million eyes connecting on all sides 
I've always had opinions 
I've always made it clear 
That everything I hated is what I have right here 
I've come this far and the place I found is the same one as before 

I'm headed for the ocean, for the good wind and the summer 
From this year on when the stars fall down I'll be laughing all the way 
I bet you think I'm boring but wait 'till I get old 
And all good things have ended like every story told 
You win down here when the faces turn and they all come to your door 
I've come this far and the place I found is the same one as before.

Go baby, go baby and don't stop 
Grow up baby grow up baby 
You'll feel lucky 'cause you were born baby 
In the 80's, buddy, you'll had a good time 
Baby, you'll been fine

Don't baby, don't baby and shout out
Don't buddy, don't buddy you'll be fine

Don't baby, don't baby and shout out
Don't buddy, don't buddy you'll be fine

Low baby, low baby, you feel low,
Go baby go baby, and don't stop,
Sleep baby, sleep baby,

You'll have a dream, baby, sleep well buddy!

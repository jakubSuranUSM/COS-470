Alright, you make me love you, it's alright, you make me love you
I said alright, you make me love you, it's alright, you make me love you

When the winter wind is a-blowin', well you never know where it's goin'
For the land is cold and the night is closing in
You can feel your heart is getting older
you can feel the world is getting colder
And it feels so good with you standing next to me

Oh baby alright, I think I love you
It's alright, you make me love you
Oh I said alright, I think I love you
It's alright, you make me love you

Now the days are all getting shorter, they seem to slip away like water
For the land is cold and the night is closing in
But you're always there when I need you
when it feels the world is against you
Oh it feels so close with you standing next to me

Oh baby alright, I think I love you
it's alright, I think I need you
Oh babe it's alright I think I want you, I think I need you
Oh babe it's alright, oh babe it's alright, now that you're here

Oh it's an icy wind that's a-blowin' and you never know where it's goin'
But it feels so good when you're curled up close to me

Oh baby alright I think I love you, it's alright you make me love you
I said it's alright, I think I need you, it's alright you make me love you

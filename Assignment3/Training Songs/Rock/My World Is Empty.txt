My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

This is the new sound, this is the new sound. In moonlit transit, the moonlight transmits, the golden years displaced. Nothing rises so we're content to decline with a certain grace. Electricity, it's in me, electricity and trash. This is the new sound, this is the new sound. Tonight my life depends on YOU and ME, and this trust that we'll believe in something when this party crashes us. Electricity, it's in me. Their machinery shuts down. Electricity, it's in me. Electricity and trash. In the absence of love, we loved the absence. For soul, for soul, not money.

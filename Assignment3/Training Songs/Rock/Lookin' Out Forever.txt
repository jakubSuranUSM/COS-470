The one who loves you most
Is giving up the ghost
And taking to the stage
Like a stone on a grave
Yeah I think of her
Every once in awhile
Every once in awhile
Forever

I'm lookin' out forever now
I love you now forever now
I love you now forever now yeah
I'm lookin' out forever now
I'm lookin' out forever now
I'm lookin' out forever now yeah

I love you now forever now
I love you now forever now
I love you now forever now yeah
I'm lookin' out forever now
I love you now forever now yeah

Ain't nothing else I can say
Nothin' left to give her
Abandon the wind
I'm a bend in the river

Standing by the bank
They're calling me across
Think of me sometimes
When the river flows because

I'm lookin' out forever now
I love you now forever now
I love you now forever now yeah

God I know I'm going home
God I don't belong

Taste me in his kisses
Waste me in my prime
Are replace me with another
Think of me some time

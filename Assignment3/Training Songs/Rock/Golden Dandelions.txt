She came to me in rows of white
In the corner of my room
A specter of the night
Silhouetted by the moon
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened sky
Colors burst as I close my eyes

Ooh-ooh, and she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooh-ooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting

A thousand pictures in my mind
In a painting of the past
I'm brushing over lines
And I'll paint them all again
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
Colors burst as I close my eyes

Ooh-ooh, and she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooh-ooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting
'Cause I've been waiting

And aren't we bright
In the candlelight
I will cradle all these memories
'til the end

And she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark
Ooh-ooh
She said lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting
Yeah, I've been waiting
'Cause, I've been waiting

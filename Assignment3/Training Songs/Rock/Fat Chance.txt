I’ve been feeling weary, 70 degrees in February
Mama’s raking leaves, and I’m about to leave
I-90 barreling down, Pacific Northwest-bound
Through this cage’s screens, watch the turning of the leaves
Oh I’m free, oh I’m free

Oh, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home

But I ain’t often home, keep company but feel alone
All the sights to see, I know where I could be
I’m a lonesome boy, but loneliness pair well with joy
All in all live, and learn what you can give that’s free
Oh that’s free

Home, rest easy while I’m home
Well I’m home
Home, while I’m home
Well I’m home

Often miss my pa when I hear that Amanaz
Follow Khala my friend down the road that has no end
Ain’t got time to meet someone I would treat in that loving way
Cause I’m leaving any day if I’m free
Oh I’m free

Oh, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home

Just a traveling man in a traveling band
Hope to lend a hand before the Earth turns into sand
Wanted to have a daughter and a son that loves the water
Swimming in the sea living worry-free
Fat chance, fat chance…

Home, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home
Home, rest easy while I’m home
While I’m home
Home, while I’m home
Well I’m home

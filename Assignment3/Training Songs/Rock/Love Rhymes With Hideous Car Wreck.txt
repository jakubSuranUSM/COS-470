These tire tracks
zigzag your torso like the devil's self portrait
the car accident, the skin graft treatment, the flower baskets, the wincing relatives

You bid her farewell then you got in your car
and that's the last thing that you can recall
and when they pulled you out, you didn't know your name, exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame

You met Jane four years ago today, dancing at some vomit stained frat party
her newspaper gown, her flashing headline brown, her violent gypsy dance, her tired underpants

Jane let you touch her and feel her and she was so free like a pineapple in a tree but
You said it's dangerous to be so intimate, you know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

Jane said when she laid on her back the sun hit her body like an ugly landscape but
Some things never get better, 
Like used cars and bad livers, 
So you traded her in for a better looking brand
One with fake porno tits, 
A padlock on her lips
A disposable tan
Biodegradable hands

And back at the hospital you got no visitors at all, but she visits you in your sleep, and that Newspaper gown is always on fire (x2)

She met him a week after you left her
When you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector.
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
And then they did all the things
You never said that you wanted.
And the sirens are laughing underneath your skull
And your thoughts are turning dull, callous and cold
Yesterday you gave your burden a name
Yesterday you gave your burden a face

And that burden, looks an awful lot like her

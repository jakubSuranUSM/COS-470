I saw a picture of you today
Taken years before I found you
You wore a tangerine beret
The lights of angels played around you
Hair tumbling long like waves
And breaking on your brow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

Your kiss was like the morning dew
Your lips were soft and wet
A fateful breeze was blowing through
The desert when we met
Danger closed around us
We made it through somehow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

Look down the carousel of years
And darling there you are
A dancer crying salty tears
A vagabond, a star
The slayer of mediocrity
Of every sacred cow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

By water’s edge a spirit dances just beyond my reach
From beach to promenade and back from promenade to beach
A ghost of golden hair, a ghost of silver jeans
The slender fleeting phantom, of you at seventeen

From deep of sleep I wake at dawn 
But as I wake I find
A distant wave still breaking on
The west coast of my mind
Time casts its grand illusion
Such glimpses we’re allowed
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

I’m gonna wrap my love around you

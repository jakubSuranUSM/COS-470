You've got heaven
Heaven in your hand
You've got heaven
Running through your land
Why don't you fight for it?
You're right for it, you know
Why don't you kill for it
Get ill for it also?

You've got heaven
You've got heaven
You've got arms and you've got legs and you've got heaven

Heaven in your eyes
You've got heaven
Don't you recognize?
And when you wake for it
You'll ache for it all night
And when you dream for it
You'll scream for it all right

You've got heaven
You've got heaven
You've got arms and you've got legs and you've got heaven

You've got heaven
Every single time
You've got heaven
Every single climb
And when you seek for it
You peak for it all day
And when you choose for it
You'll ooze for it, I'll say

You've got heaven
You're just heaven
You're just heaven
You've got arms and you've got legs and you've got heaven
You've got arms and you've got legs and you've got heaven
You've got arms, legs, heaven
You've got arms, you've got legs, you've got heaven
You've got arms
You've got legs, and you've got heaven
Arms, use your legs, and you've got heaven

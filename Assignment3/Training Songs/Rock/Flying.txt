I'm flying across the ocean and I'm soaring
Back home to the place I was born
And probably raised and I'm flying
Across the mountains and valleys
Back home to the one that I love so happily

Can ya' blame me for feeling homesick
'Cause I've been away such a very long, long time
I served a while in the county jail
Five years for, for being hungry tired and poor

On and on, woh woh woh
You know, I will follow
With your buttons and your bows

On and on, and on and on and on
You know, I will follow
With your buttons and your bows

On and on
You know I will follow
With your buttons and your bows

I'm flying across the ocean
Goin' home, woh woh woh

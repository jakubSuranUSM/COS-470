Every day there is some kind of darkness,
That just won't go away,
No matter how hard I try.

Crawls into your system while your guard is down,
Becomes the ball that you drag around to,

Every party,
At every function,
To give to people with written instructions,
Don't try to get away,
I'm here to stay,
My name is fate.

Every night sleep wonders on its own,
Never once does it kiss me,
With its chloroform.

It crawled into my system while my guard was down,
Became the bore I like to have around at,

Every party,
At every function,
I give it to people with written instructions,
Don't try to get away,
I'm here to stay,
My name is your fate.

I've come to crush your bones,
I've come to make you feel old,
I've come to mess with your head,
Cause it'll make you feel good.

I've come to make you feel good,
I've come to make you feel good,
I've come to make you feel good, alright yeah,
I've come to make you feel good, alright yeah,
I've come to make you feel good, alright yeah,
I've come to make you feel good, alright yeah.

Come to the party,
Come to the function,
Give me aggression with written instructions,
Don't try to get away,
I'm here to stay,
Hear me now.

A running man left thief,
My blood is shut so soon
(She got me running)
I was beaten and confused
On the New York City rules.
I’ve been bare hands and feet
On a dirty city street
The band shit no one care
With a heart of a beaten dog.

My love Indian heart was pounding,
I was running so fast 
I was running so fast 

We got the drugs 
We got the drugs
We got the drugs
Drugs can heal

And all the children of the loving temple
Turn the face into the light
And they check the phase much faster
Licking honey from a knife.

My love Indian heart was pounding,
I was running so fast
I was running so fast

Hit the water and let it all in
Yeah, I’m drowning, get me out of this place
Let the water amid of it all
While I’m drowning get me out of this place
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out
Let the water amid of it all
Yeah, I’m drowning, get me out of this hell.

We got the drugs
We got the drugs
We got the drugs
Drugs can heal.

Fucked up children.

Yes my darlin' I want you to know 
Each an every day I love you more and more 
Let's get married, get married soon 
You be the bride and I'll be your groom 

I'm tellin' you darlin' what I'm gonna do 
I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you 
I'm gonna buy you a weddin' ring 
So I won't have to worry 'bout a doggone thing 

Now we married it's plain to see 
I was meant for you and you were meant for me 
I'll buy a home and we'll settle down 
Way out in some little country town 

Yes, my darlin' it's plain to see 
I was meant for you and you was meant for me 
We get married, get married soon 
You be the bride and I'll be your groom 

I'm tellin' you darlin' what I'm gonna do 
I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you 
I'm gonna buy you a weddin' ring 
So I won't have to worry about a doggone thing

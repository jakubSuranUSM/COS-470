Saints and children we have gathered here to hear the sacred story 
And I'm glad to bring it to you with my best rhyming and rhythm 
Cause I know the thirsty listen and down to the waters come 
And the Holy King of Israel loves me here in America 

And if you listen to my songs I hope you hear the water falling 
I hope you feel the oceans crashing on the coast of north New England 
I wish I could be there just to see them, two summers past I was 
And the Holy King of Israel loves me here in America 

And if I were a painter I do not know which I'd paint 
The calling of the ancient stars or assembling of the saints 
And there's so much beauty around us for just two eyes to see 
But everywhere I go I'm looking 

And once I went to Appalachia for my father he was born there 
And I saw the mountains waking with the innocence of children 
And my soul is still there with them wrapped in the songs they brought 
And the Holy King of Israel loves me here in America 

And I've seen by the highways on a million exit ramps 
Those two-legged memorials to the laws of happenstance 
Waiting for four-wheeled messiahs to take them home again 
But I am home anywhere if You are where I am 

And if you listen to my songs I hope you hear the water falling 
I hope you feel the oceans crashing on the coast of north New England 
I wish I could be there just to see them, two summers past I was 
And the Holy King of Israel loves me here in America"

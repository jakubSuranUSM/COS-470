Well my heartbeat is running wild
Because of you my problem child
Oh-oh baby, don't be running wild
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child

Well don't you see this shakin' spree
Is bound to be the death of me
Oh baby, don't be running wild
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child

Well my heartbeat is runnin' wild
Because of you my problem child
Oh baby, don't be running wild
Control yourself, don't be a problem child

Well don't you see this shakin' spree
Is bound to be the death of me
Oh baby, don't be running wild
Well cool off baby, don't be a problem child

Well then i'm gone, that's all she wrote
You'll sing this same song
Oh baby, don't be running wild
Control yourself, you're a problem child

Ooh, problem child, running wild
Problem child, running wild
Problem child, running wild
Problem child, running wild
Oh baby,you're a problem child

Slow down girl, down
Slow down girl, down
Down girl, down
Slow down girl, down...

Don't put your red dress on for him
Don't put your red dress on
Don't put your red dress on for him
Don't put your red dress on
Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be afraid of the dark and what you are without him

Don't be afraid of the dark and what you are without him
No meathook is as bad as a hook in the heart
There's no pain that can make the non-feel feel at all
A hole through the skin will not make you whole
What is dominion over a faltering soul
And a heart that has severed from the body?
Is it anything to control someone that has been broken open?

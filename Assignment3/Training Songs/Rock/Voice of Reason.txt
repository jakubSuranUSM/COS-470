Wanna waste no time
Wanna stay out of the firing line
See it now, still it's just the same old situation
Hear it now, can you stand up to the voice of reason?
Voice of reason

All your talk aloud
Does it get you anywhere at all
See it now, can you stand up to the voice of reason?
Voice of reason

If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now

Hear it now
Voice of reason
Voice of reason

If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now
If only you could hear it now

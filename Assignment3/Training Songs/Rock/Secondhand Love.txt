Don't bring me secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
I know you went out tonight
Who've you been hanging around with this time?
I don't care if he's black or white
I just don't like his kind.
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love

He's been leaving his scent on you
I can sense it from a mile
All my money is spent on you
But you're still selling your smile
Don't bring me secondhand love
Don't bring me secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love

Give your love, and keep blood between brothers
Give your love, and keep blood between brothers
I don't want your secondhand love

I can guess where you've been tonight
You've been hanging out on the street
Wearing your dress too tight
You're showin' out to anyone you meet
But I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't bring me your secondhand love
Don't bring me your secondhand love

I want the first call on your kiss
Answer me one question:can you promise me this
I want my defenses laying in your hands
I don't want to rest in the palm of another man
I don't want your secondhand love
Don't want, Don't want, your secondhand love
I don't want, I don't want, your secondhand love
I don't want,I don't want your secondhand love
I don't want,I don't want your secondhand love

I have a t.v. screen of some 32 inches
T.v. dinner and an easy chair
From where I view a disaster
And switch the channel fast
And thank my lucky star I wasn't there
The world's in a hurry but I don't have to worry
There's a movie on with a happy end
I've seen it before but I can see it some more
So I don't have to go out and pretend

No I don't have to go out
I'll just stay inside - it doesn't bother me
I have all I need because everything is on t.v.

Well I burned all my books
On my ass I sit and look
And behold the world deteriorate
I don't have to stand up just to take a stand
I'll sms a live t.v. debate

No I don't have to go out
I'll just stay inside - it keeps me company
I have all I need because everything is on t.v.

I can pay to get heard or to get the last word
Wire money to some charity
While I do as I please and bake in my own grease
I better keep my conscience clean
The world's in a hurry but I don't have to worry
I got my virtue and I got my vice
I got bedsores - aching ligaments galore
Now that's a tiny sacrifice

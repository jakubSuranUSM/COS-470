Wake and pray, work all day
Walk past the places I used to lay
Now I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way
Some days are hard, some days are long
Some days I'm weak, some days I'm strong

I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way
I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way

But my hopes are so much higher
Don't count me out, I'm a survivor
I've chased these dreams down city streets
Dead-end roads that no one sees
And I'm proud to be a fighter

Don't shut me out, don't hold me down
I'm right here, I'll be around
I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way
Some days are slow, some days fly by
Some days I laugh, some days I cry

I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way
I'm paying my way, I'm paying my way

But my hopes are so much higher
Don't count me out, I'm a survivor
I've chased these dreams down city streets
Dead-end roads that no one sees
And I'm proud to be a fighter

When I look back and see your side
When I look hard into your eyes
When I take stock of what I've done
I think about how far I've come

And my hopes are so much higher
Don't count me out, I'm a survivor
And my hopes are so much higher
And I'm proud to be a fighter

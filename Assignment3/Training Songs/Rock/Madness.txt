Only the righteous kiss those lips 
Too much guessing, too much "need to believe"
This is madness (madness)
This is madness

Why should I suffer when I can't see your eyes? 
See your eyes 
Whose truth is your truth?
What brain can you pick? (what bones?)

This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness

When did living start being a sin?
If this is today, well, what the f*ck's tomorrow?
Whose fashion is your fashion?
What passion can you buy?
When you know that god is dead
And you are god (madness)

This is madness (madness)
This is madness

This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness
This is madness

Only the righteous kiss those lips 
Too much guessing, too much "need to believe"
This is madness (madness)
This is madness

Why should I suffer when I can't see your eyes? 
See your eyes 
Whose truth is your truth?
What brain can you pick? 
Madness

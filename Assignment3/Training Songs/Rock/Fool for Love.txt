I'm leaving this place behind
And I'm heading out on the road tonight
I'm off for the winter lands
Way up north to have taught you to stand
Before I commence my ride
I'm asking Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
But he ain't gonna delay my plans

I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love I'm gonna live my life with her
You know I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him cause I'm a fool for love

I've come far to find Big Jim
Well here I am and I guess you him
I see how you got your name
You're tall as hell and broad as a train
They say you a hard-broiled man
And the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well I'm not afraid to fight
Let's step outside and I'll show you why

I'm humming like a revved up truck
Never mind the odds I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough
I'm dangerous cause I'm a fool for love

You know you don't hit half bad
For my love I will lay in the grave tonight
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you off to an early death

I lie in the drifting snow
Bleeding out as it covers me up
If Spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground

I lost friends along my way
I knew I'd need them eventually
No I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive

I know I should've never looked back
But you ain't gonna win a woman's heart like that
I never should've called his bluff
I was born to lose cause I'm a fool for love

I stare into the endless sky
And I saw a tale of my life go by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don't know where I'm going

I stare into the endless sky
And I saw a tale of my life go by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don't know where I'm going

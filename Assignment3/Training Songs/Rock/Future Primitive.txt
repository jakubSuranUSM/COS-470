I'm a future primitive I came from the sky
I'm a new definitive with no reason why
Come and find me I'm alone
Come and find me before I go
Yeah it may show (?)
Yeah here and now
I don't know what is going on
I don't know where the future is gone
I'm future primitive a long long ago
I'm a new definitive and nobody knows
Come and find me I'm alone
Come and find me before I go

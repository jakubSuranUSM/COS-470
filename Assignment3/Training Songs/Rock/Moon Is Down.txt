The moon is down 
And heaven is waiting 
For us to find her in our sites 
With focus that's strong 
But my strength keeps slipping 

Now we're all the terminal cases 
(We're all the terminal cases) 
But we're so determined to thrive 
And those with defeat on their faces 
(Those with defeat on their faces) 
Are those that we must keep alive 
And I admire your strength 
You keep us going on 
(You keep us going on)
You keep us going on 
(You keep us going on)
You keep us fighting long
after the fire 

You've measured our strides 
Marked the degree of our fever 
Charted the log 
Made sure the temperature's rising 

To fan the flames 
And brandish our new courage proudly 
As if it were ours from the outset 
(As if it were ours from the outset) 
As if we were never alone 

The moon is down 
And heaven is waiting 
For callers and entries 
As we're calling out 
"This is ours, ours, ours 
This one is ours!" 

Now we're all the terminal cases 
(We're all the terminal cases) 
But we're so determined to thrive 
And those with defeat on their faces 
(Those with defeat on their faces) 
Are those that we must keep alive 
And I admire your strength 
You keep us going on 
You keep us going on 
You keep us fighting long after the fire

Hearin' the song of a thousand and one politicians
They sing you a song but the words are the same as before
They deal you a hand, but all of the aces are missin'
I feel the earth movin' under my feet
Where the heart keeps jumpin' a beat
Shakin' the house down, wakin' me up from a dream

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

With thunder and lightening, tomorrow is on the horizon
But if you stay outside then you'll get caught in the rain
Keep your hand on the wheel, your foot on the floor
And you're drivin'
Cause when you're out so close to the edge
You need eyes in the back of your head
Takin' a chance on never comin' back here again

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

So now that you know that the order is changing
It's a sign of the times, be first now or later be last
We're flyin' a flag for the next generation
Cause when you're out so close to the edge
You need eyes in the back of your head
Takin' a chance on never comin' back here again

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

Here comes another world!
Here comes another world!

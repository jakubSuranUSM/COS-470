(Never thought it would be like this)

What will you do
Now that you're gone?
On to somebody new
Well, that didn't take long

And where you gonna go?
Not that I care
And who can you trust
Now that I'm not there?

Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would be like this
What will I do now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone

And what will you do?
Now you're all alone
Who's gonna keep you warm
Out there in the cold?

And who's gonna rescue you
When you're lost at sea?
And who's gonna love you
If it isn't me?

Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would end like this
Oh, what will I do now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone

Now, you're lost in the wilderness
You never dreamed it would end like this
What will they say
Now that you're gone?
Now that you're, now that you're gone

So now you're flying like you wanna be
Right where you belong

Runnin' from the sun again, it's alright, alright
Runnin' from the dreams you seem to lose
You've been runnin' for a while, a while
You can't slow down

Runnin' from the sun again, it's all right, all right Somebody is
Tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now you're flying like you wanna be

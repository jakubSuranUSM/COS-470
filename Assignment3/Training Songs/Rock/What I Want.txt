Should I get up?
Or sleep all day
Answer the call?
Or let the telephone ring
Sit in silence
Turn the radio on
Find somebody to talk to
Or sit around on my own

Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
I don't knowâ?¦

Cross the street
I could stay on this side
I could play for your team
Or keep playing for mine
I could save all my money
I could blow it all now
I could work on my body
Just give up on my health

Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Maybe it's you maybe it's somebody new

Keep on pushin
I could fall on my knees
I could try to get famous
I could try to get free
I could live for today
I could plan for my future
I could be dead
I could be richer

Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
I can't decide what to do with my life
Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Ah ah don't know what I want
Maybe it's you maybe it's somebody new
Maybe it's you maybe it's somebody new!

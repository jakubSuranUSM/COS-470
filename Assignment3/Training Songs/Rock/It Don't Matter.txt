Everyday people like you and me,
Just want to live naturally.
Time taught you and you taught me,
Nothin' gonna get us down.
Can't you see I said,

If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me. no no no no
If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me.

People all around 
Makin' sounds and all kinds of noise.
If I could only get there,
Then I could enjoy.
Who they try to be, 
Who they tryin' to fool?
Lets change the mood right now,
Turn down the lights,
It's time to cool it down.

If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me.
If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me.

Yesterday and what we could be,
It don't matter.
Gettin' more of what we don't need,
It don't matter.
Everything unless I'm with you,
It doesn't matter to me, no.

Bring it on down 
Bring it on down to me.
Sing it on down 
Sing it on down for me.
Sing it on down 
Sing it on down to me.

If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me.
If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me. I said,
If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me. no no no no
If it don't matter to you 
It don't matter to me.
Sometimes it don't matter to me.
Don't matter to me.

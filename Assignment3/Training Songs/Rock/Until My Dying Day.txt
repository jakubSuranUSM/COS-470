I can see the fading sun, sinking at the edge of town
And it's one more day that's gone
I'm thinking 'bout the past, and the time that slipped away
But I can't change what I've done

Chasing after foolish dreams
I should've let go but I just can't seem to stop
I don't deserve your loving baby, I don't know why you stay

There's a child within the man, and it's keeping me keeping on
Yet you always understand
The future can't be planned, but I'm gonna keep fighting on
While I've still got two strong hands

Maybe I'll change someday
Maybe I'll chase those dreams away
I need you by my side now baby
'Cause you're the price that I won't pay

Girl you're the only one to light a fire inside me
You're the only woman that can make me feel this way
I want to stay with you forever I'll never let you go
Until my dying day

Chasing after foolish dreams
I should've let go but I just can't seem to stop
I don't deserve your loving baby ' I don't know why you stay

Hey baby you're the only one to light a fire inside me
You're the only woman that can make me feel this way
I want to stay with you forever I'll never let you go
Until my dying day

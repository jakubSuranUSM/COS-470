I never thought it could happen 
It was the furthest thing from my mind 
I just turned my back on a sad love affair 
Was try'n' to leave it all behind 
That's when I met you 
I just couldn't say no 
One look in your eyes 
And I said here I go
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I'd seen so much deceivin' 
I almost stopped believin' 
I'd ever fall in love again 
I was runnin' around hidin' my heart 
Fakin' it with all of my friends 
I was down on my luck 
That's when you came along 
You put me back on my feet 
You got me singin' this song 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
And she loves me in the midnight hour 
You know ever since I found you 
And put my arms around you 
I don't need a doggone thing 
You know that ev'ry day is such a beautiful day 
I want the whole world to dance and sing 
So don't you dare hang your head 
Don't you dare be blue 
If it can happen to me 
It can happen to you 
And you'll be singin' this song 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love

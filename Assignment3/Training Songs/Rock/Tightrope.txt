Yes I used to walk the highwire every night
Yes I used to walk the tightrope
But it got too tight.
I walked the straight and narrow line
My head was spinning round
I worked without a safety net
But it was such a long way down.

Yes I used to walk the highwire every night
Yes I used to walk the tightrope
But you need a head for heights.
I walked the straight and narrow rope
My head was spinning round
I worked without a safety net
But it was such a long way down.

Oh you might have seen us
If we came to your town
This game's made for heroes
And clowns.
Not thinking about tomorrow
Living for today
I never left a note saying
I'm going away.

I used to walk the highwire every night
Oh I used to walk the tightrope
But it got too tight.
I walked the straight and narrow line
My head was spinning round
I worked without a safety net
But it was such a long way down.

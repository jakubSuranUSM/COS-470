You're gonna break my heart I know it
But if you don't
You're gonna break my run of unhappiness and destroy my career
I'd rather feel full than sing these shit songs
I'll sell my guitar and never look back
You're gonna break my heart I know it
And when you do
I'm going to run to the country and plug my ears
I'd rather have you than sing these shit songs
I'll sell my guitar and get an education and never look back
You're gonna break my heart I know it
If you don't break my heart I'll do it myself
And when I do
I'm going to count all the numbers for all the years
If I don't have you I'm condemned to sing shit songs
I'll f*ck my guitar and drink myself deaf
I'll be an education and I'll never look back
I don't want to sing these shit songs anymore

Called to see if your back was still aligned
And your sheets were growing grass out of the corners of your bed

But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
That has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard 
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You told us of your new life there
You've got someone coming 'round
Gluing tinsel to your crown
He's got you talking pretty loud

Berate, remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
You say you're still in love 
And it's true what can be done
It's hard to leave all these moments behind

Called to see if your back is still aligned
And your sheets are growing grass out of the corners of your bed

And you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It's too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You tested your medal of doe's skin and petals
Kissing the lipless and bleed all the sweetness away

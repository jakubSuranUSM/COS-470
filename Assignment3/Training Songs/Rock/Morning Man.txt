I arise to the 5 AM skies
Left over from yesterday
With a moan I reach out for the phone
It's her says, she's on her way

And fifteen minutes later
I hear the elevator
I gave her my apartment key
So she eases in and lies with me

Pay my way with a nine to five day
She's working a midnight grind
Dressed in white by the dawn's eerie light
She reaches my cobwebbed mind

She brews us up some coffee
And pulls the covers off me
I grab her wrist and pull her near
And the night begins to clear

Morning man, doesn't take much to wake me
Just you shake your morning man
I've been dreaming of how you'll wake me
Since this endless night began

So curl up with your early riser
In my eyes you see the plan
You'll catch up on your sleep this evening
And I'll be your morning man

Eight at night in the last of the light
I wander back home again
Time is cheap 'cause I know she's asleep
And out for the count 'til ten

And when she's finally wakin'
I'll fix some eggs and bacon
She'll say, "Goodnight, I'm late again"
I'll say, "Goodnight, I'll wait"

Morning man, doesn't take much to wake me
Just you shake your morning man
I've been dreaming of how you'll wake me
Since this endless night began

So curl up with your early riser
In my eyes you see the plan
You'll catch up on your sleep this evening
And I'll be your morning man

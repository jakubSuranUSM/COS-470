I walk in stride with people
Much taller than me
And partly it's the boots but
Mostly it's my chi
And I'm becoming transfixed
With nature and my part in it
Which I believe just signifies
I'm finally waking up 

And there's this moth outside my kitchen door
She's bonkers for that bare bulb
Flying round in circles
Bashing in her exoskull
And out in the woods she navigates fine by the moon
But get her around a light bulb and she's doomed 

She is trying to evolve
She's just trying to evolve 

Now let's get talking reefer madness
Like some arrogant government can't
By any stretch of the imagination
Outlaw a plant
Yes, their supposed authority over nature
Is a dream
C'mon people
We've got to come clean 

'cause they are locking our sons
And our daughters in cages
They are taking by the thousands
Our lives from under us
It's a crash course in religious fundamentals
Now let's all go to war
Get some bang for our buck 

I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

Gunnin' for high score in the land of dreams
Morbid bluish-white consumers ogling luminous screens
On the trail of forgetting
Cruising without a care
The jet set won't abide by that pesky jet lag
And our lives boil down to an hour or two
When someone pulls a camera out of a bag 

And I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

So I walk like I'm on a mission
'cause that's the way I groove
I got more and more to do
I got less and less to prove
It took me too long to realize
That I don't take good pictures
'cause I have the kind of beauty
That moves

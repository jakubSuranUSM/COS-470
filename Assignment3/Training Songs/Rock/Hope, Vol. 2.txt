Hope is beauty,
Personified.
At her feet, the world,
Hypnotized.

A million flashes,
A million smiles.
And on the catwalk,
She flaunts her style a long mile.

An angry sign of darkness,
Our hope lies lost and torn.
All flame like love is fleeting,
When there's no hope anymore.
 
Pain and glory,
Hand in hand,
A sacrifice,
The highest price.

Like the poison in her heart,
Like a whisper she was gone,
Like when angels fall.

And in this side of darkness,
Our hope lies on the floor.
All love like flame is fleeting,
When there's no hope anymore.

Like the poison in her heart,
Like a whisper, she was gone,
Like an angel, angels fall.

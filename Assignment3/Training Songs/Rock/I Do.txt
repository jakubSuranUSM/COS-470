Tomorrow, you will ask me if I do
Know that the sorrow will drop away
Like June, from a flower in bloom

When you say "I do"
When you say "I do"

Tomorrow, you will take me for your bride
And know that the grey skies will blow away
We're forever and I feel it inside

When you say "I do"
When you say "I do"
When you say "I do"

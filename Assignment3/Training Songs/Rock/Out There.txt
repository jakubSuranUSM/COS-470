Through all my pain - the hope's remained that someone's out there
Blind like me - dependent on belief that someone's out there 
Hard as I may try - who is on my side if there's nobody out there 
I stop and wonder why - why should I even try if there's nobody out there 
Could I have walked right by - or even said hi to that someone out there
Blind like me - dependent on belief that someone's out there 
How can I find what I'm looking for?

Don't always dream for what you want
But I love to watch good dancers talk
My heart is stronger than you all
But I love to watch good dancers talk

The war's good and I'm so tired

Don't always dream for what you want
But I love to watch good dancers talk
My heart is stronger than you all
But I love to watch good dancers talk

The wars good and I'm so tired x4

When you think with your mind you've got a place to go now
When you think with your mind you've got a place to go now

Don't always dream for what you want
But I love to watch good dancers talk
(When you think with your mind you've got a place to go now)
My heart is stronger than you all
(When you think with your mind you've got a place to go now)
But I love to watch good dancers talk
(When you think with your mind you've got a place to go now)

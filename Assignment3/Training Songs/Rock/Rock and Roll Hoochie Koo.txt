I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold 
It was a warm spring night in the ol' town hall 
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down 
Don't ya know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound 

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Lawdy mama light my fuse 
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Truck on out and spread the news 

The skeeters start buzzing 'bout this time o' year 
I'm goin' round back, she said she'd meet me there 
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn 
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm 

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Lawdy mama light my fuse 
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Truck on out and spread the news 
Hope y'all know what I'm talkin' about 

The way they wiggle that thing, it really knocks me out 
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope ya'll are too 
Well come-on a little closer, gonna do it to you 

Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Lawdy mama light my fuse 
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo 
Truck on out and spread the news 
That I'm tired of payin' dues 
Done said goodbye to all my blues 
Lawdy mama light my fuse

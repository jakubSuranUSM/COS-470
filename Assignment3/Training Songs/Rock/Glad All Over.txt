Ain't no doubt about it, this must be love
One little kiss from you and I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot-dang-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over
I got goose pimples baby, 'cause it feels so good

When you cuttle me like you do and I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm a real cool pappy and I'm happy
And I'm glad all over
Well your touch goes through me like electric fire

Well, every part of me glows
It don't take much lookin' to see what I got
'Cause it shows, shows
Come on honey please one more time

Everytime you do, well I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, hot-dang-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over
Well I'm tryin' to tell you I'm cookin' inside
When we're cheek to cheek

Temperature's low but my fever is hot
I can't speak, I'm too weak
Come on honey-bunny kiss me one more time
Everytime you do, well I feel glad all over

Ooh mercy, hot-dong-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over
Hot-dang-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over
Ooh, hot-dang-dilly, it's so silly but I'm glad all over

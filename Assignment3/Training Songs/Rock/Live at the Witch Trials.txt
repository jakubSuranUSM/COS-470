We're still one step ahead of you
I still believe in the are and are dream
are and are as primal scream

Tied to the Puritan Ethic
Nonsympathetic to spastics
After all this, still a lonely bastard.

Eggheads, boneheads, queue
Queue for them
We were early and we were late
But, still, live at the witch trials

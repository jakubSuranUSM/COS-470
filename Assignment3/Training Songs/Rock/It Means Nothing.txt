Did we lose ourselves again?
Do we take in what's been said?
Do we take the time to be
All the things we said we'd be
And we bury heads in sand
But my future's in my hands
It means nothing
It means nothing

You can find yourself a God
Believe in which one you want
'Cause they love you all the same
They just go by different names
When we fly our flag today
Are you proud or just ashamed?
It means nothing
It means nothing

[Chorus]
It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you

And the sun sets in the sky
You're the apple of my eye
If the bomb goes off again
In my brain or on the train
I hope that I'm with you
'Cause I wouldn't know what to do
It means nothing
It means nothing

[Chorus]

If I haven't got you
You, you
Oh,

(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)
(It means nothing)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

The mountain's high
And the valley's so deep
Can't get across
To the other side

Don't you give up, baby
Don't you cry
Don't you give up til
I reach the other side

I was lonely, baby
I couldn't sleep
The night they took you
From my side

I was a lonely soul
Until you became my goal
And then I saw the spark of love
And then the stars fell
From up above, oh, yeah

I know someday
We will meet again
But I don't know exactly
Where or when

But, baby, if fate has its way
We'll meet again some other day

The mountain's high
And the valley's so deep
Can't get across
To the other side

Don't you give up, baby
Don't you cry
Don't you give up til
I reach the other side

Look what you get for following leaders,
Who lead from the rear - where are they now?
What did we learn in history lessons?
How to sit quiet at the back of a class.
With so many things open to question,
It's too late to cry - there's no one to ask.
Life's an education - a multiple equation,
Everybody finds their own solution in the end.
"To be or not to be" is a very lengthy question,
Has somebody please got a sharpened pencil they can lend?

How to sit quiet at the back of a class.
With so many things open to question,
It's too late to cry - there's no one to ask.
Marching in time down a production line,
What did they teach you about life in a dole-queue?
The Law of Relativity - (life's relative misery)
The Law of Probability - (it's probably contrived)
Newton's Law of Gravity - (we face a grave reality)
The law that runs the jungle - (only the strong survive).
Look what you get for following leaders,
Who lead form the rear - where are they now?
The path of least resistance - a bland text book existence,
Don't expect to find the answers printed at the back.
The only sound advice that's carried me through life -
When the cards are stacked against you - play the joker in the pack.

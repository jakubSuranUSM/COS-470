High time, we made a stand 
And shook up the views of the common man
The love train rides from coast to coast
DJ's the man we love the most

Could you be, could you be squeaky clean and smash any hope of democracy 
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah, yeah
 
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
 
I spy tears in their eyes they look to the skies 
For some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste

Politician granny with your high ideals 
Have you no idea how the majority feels?
So without love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam, yeah, yeah

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me, in love

Feel the pain
Talk about it 
If you're a wanted man
Then shout about it
 
Open hearts, feel about it
Open minds, think about it
Everyone, read about it
Everyone, scream about it 
Everyone (everyone, yeah)
Everyone (everyone) read about it, read about it
Read it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read
 
(Sowing the seeds) Sowing the seeds of love, we're sowing the seeds, 
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Mister England sowing the seeds of love
 
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes

Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes

Time to eat all your words (high time we made a stand and shook up the view of the common man)
Swallow your pride (and the love train rides from coast to coast)
Open your eyes (every minute of every hour)
Open your eyes (I love a sunflower)
Open your eyes (and I believe in love power, love power)
Open your eyes (love power)

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds, an end to need
And the politics of greed

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love (hand in hand), seeds of love (hand in hand), sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
An end to need

Get out of my town
Get out of the spot light
You saw my heart so what does it look like?
It's not what you do but it how it gets done
And now I've had my fun

I took you out into the world
I tore you down and I burnt you badly
I scream and shout, I'm lost for words
I don't know
I took my gun, shot you down
Left an exit wound
That your afraid to show me
I scream and shout, I'm lost for words
I don't know

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out

I got your message and I feel like a mistake
You said you want to learn
To let go of dead weight
It's not what you do but how it gets done
And now I've had my fun
I brought you back down to earth
I twist your skin and I bruise you badly
I scream and shout, lost for words
I don't know
I took your heart for what its worth
You said there's nothing else
For you to do but hate me
I scream and shout, I'm lost for words
I don't know

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out

I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out
I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out

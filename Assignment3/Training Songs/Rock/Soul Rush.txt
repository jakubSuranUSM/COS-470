How long will it take before my soul breaks free
and tastes the salt of morning's first kiss?
Mornings first kiss on my skin
How long will it take before it bursts?
Sunny days lick my soul, lick it free
With days like this and nights like weeping songs
‘cause they belong to anyone who's felt the need,
felt the need for a rush
With days like this and nights like weeping songs
Sunny days lick my soul, lick it free
With days like this and nights like weeping songs
‘cause they belong to anyone
who's felt the need for a rush

Someone waits for you, someone treats you like dirt
Someone changes you, someone makes you stay the same
And someone tells you that you're the only one,
the only one to lick your soul, lick it free
And your sister she's in love, she has children there to prove it
And your brother, he's a beauty, he's so beautiful it hurts
Yes, your sister she's in love and she has children,
and those children lick my soul. They lick it free.
With days like this and nights like weeping songs
‘cause they belong to anyone
who's felt the need for a rush

I've wasted half my life with a guitar and a song
And it's solid and it's dreadful and it's sweet in its breath
I've wasted half my life with this guitar
And these songs lick my soul, they lick it free
I tell you, all people, it's been an honour to be here
And to all of you who have known me as a kid
To be in love and to be loved in return is to lick,
lick your soul, lick it free
With days like this and nights like weeping songs
It'll be free like it's supposed to be
And it belongs to anyone who's felt the need,
felt the need for a rush

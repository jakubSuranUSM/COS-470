Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but could not make it
Last night he could not make it

On a holiday, for many miles
Looking for a place to stay
Near some friendly star, he found this mote
And now we wonder where we are

How could this so great turn so shitty
He ended up in army crates
And photographs in files, his tiny boat
Sparked as he turned to grazed our city

I started driving on the motorway
I was feeling down

Last night he could not make it
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but could not make it
Last night he could not make it

On a holiday, for many miles

How could this so great turn so shitty

Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but could not make it
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but could not make it

He started heading for the motorway and he came right now
He started heading for the motorway and he came right now
He started heading for the motorway and he came right now

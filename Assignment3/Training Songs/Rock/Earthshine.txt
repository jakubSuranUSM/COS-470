On certain nights
When the angles are right
And the moon is a slender crescent
It's circle shows
In a ghostly glow
Of earthly luminescence

Earthshine
A beacon in the night
I can raise my eyes to earthshine

Earthshine
But you're out of reach
Form a dream to rise to earthshine

Floating high
In the evening sky
I see my faint reflection
Pale facsimile
Like what others see
When they look in my direction

Earthshine
A beacon in the night
I can raise my eyes to earthshine

Earthshine
Stretching out your hand
Full of starlit diamonds earthshine

Reflected light
To another's sight
And the moon tells a lover's story
My borrowed face
And my third-hand grace
Only reflect your glory

Earthshine
Stretching out your hand
I can raise my eyes to earthshine

Earthshine
You're still out of reach
Form a dream to rise to earthshine
Form a dream to rise to earthshine

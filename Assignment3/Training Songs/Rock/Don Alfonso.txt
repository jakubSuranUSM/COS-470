Now I'm a toreador
I am for sure
I kill bulls by the score
And sometimes more
And when they hear the bell ring
Inside the bullring
The bullocks all start trembling
They know I'm coming
I'm Don Alfonso
Some call me Pedro
But that is not so
I'm Don Alfonso
I fought bullocks out in sunny Spain
Out in sunny Spain
I fought bulls in the sunshine
And I fought them in the rain
I'm Don Alfonso
I work for Oxo
And all the bullocks are afraid of me
Oh, my sword I pull
Kill zi bull!
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full
Then we have steak and chips for tea
I met a sweet se√±ora
In Barcelona
Her christian name was Mona
She was thumbs-up bona
She told me she was single
That made me tingle
My heart went jingle, jingle
I said "Let's mingle"

[ Chorus ] 
I'm Don Alfonso
Some call me Pedro
But that is not so
I'm Don Alfonso
I fought bullocks out in sunny Spain
Out in sunny Spain
I fought bulls in the sunshine
And I fought them in the rain
I'm Don Alfonso
I work for Oxo
And all the bullocks are afraid of me
Oh, my sword I pull
Kill zi bull!
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full
Then we have fully beef for tea
[ Repeat Chorus ]

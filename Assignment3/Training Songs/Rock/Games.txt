See how they run
Taking a ride on an everyday fight to nowhere
Run inside it's a great place to hide themselves 
And you know
Yeah you know 
Yeah you know
Yeah you know
You know what they're doing

Can't they see
The dreams in the mind are the only thing
That bind them together
Serving the purpose until
They turn it away for dead feeling
And you know
Yeah you know
Yeah you know
Yeah you know
You know what they're feeling

You play the game
Take it while you can
Don't you give it to the man behind you
You can put it down 'til
You pick it up again
If you want to
And you know
Yeah you know
Yeah you know
Yeah you know

You know what you're doing.

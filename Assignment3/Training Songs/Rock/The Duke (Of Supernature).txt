Come on, 
Checking out the office girls on a Friday afternoon
Well she's got the shape I need for the mine to break too soon
It's all dead moons and chicken bones
And child don't you fear
You'll be singing in a higher purpose
Now your super nature's clear
Yeah, it all comes near

Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the devil lost the big war
But he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the duke of super nature's coming back
Is coming back
Is coming back

My old pal Icarus rode too close to the sun
And folks tend to get off sand
When they see how the job gets done
Now close your eyes, and pay no mind to the circles round your head
The answer to those questions
Is right here in my own bed
Yeah, oh
In my own bed
Hit it

Well I swear I did you baby
Back in 49 in vain
When the master lost the big one
But he figured out a way
Now I watch and make the world come
And in dollars due thus die
And I praise the day the duke of super nature's coming back
Is coming back now
Yeah

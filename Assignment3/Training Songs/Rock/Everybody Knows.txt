Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows that the war is over
Everybody knows that the good guys lost

Everybody knows the fight is fixed
The poor stay poor and the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows that the boat is sinking

Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody's got this broken feeling
Like their Momma or there dog just died
Everybody's hands are in their pockets

Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
Everybody knows

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
that's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
that's the way it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows that its now or never
Everybody knows that its me or you
Everybody knows that you live forever
When you had a line or two

Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old black Joe still pickin' cotton
For ribbons and bows
Everybody knows you love me baby

Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you been faithful
Give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you been discrete

So many people you had to meet
Without your clothes
And Everybody knows

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That's the way it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That's how it goes
And Everybody knows

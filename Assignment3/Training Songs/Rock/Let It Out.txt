Yeah!

This is ours, we made it with our everything
Something real, as real as it could ever be
You gave me all of yourself, I gave you all of me
Now set it free from yourself, for everyone to see

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid to let it out
I'm gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
(Who cares if you don't like it?)

(If you don't like it)

Go ahead, you know just what you want to do
Don't deny, you feel it 'cause I feel it too
Take a look all around, you feel it in the air
From the sky to the ground, I feel it everywhere

[Chorus]

I'm not afraid to let it out
I'm gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
To let it out
(Who cares if you don't like it?)
(If you don't like it)
(If you don't like it)

(Who cares if you don't like it?)
[repeat x4]

This is ours, we made it with our everything
Something real, as real as it could ever be
You gave me all of yourself, I gave you all of me
Now set it free from yourself, for everyone to see

[Chorus]

I'm not afraid to let it out
I'm gonna show you how I feel
I'm not afraid to let it out
To let it out
To let it out
(Who cares if you don't like it?)
(If you don't like it)
(If you don't like it)

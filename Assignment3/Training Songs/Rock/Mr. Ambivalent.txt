Mr. Ambivalent
You ain't going nowhere
Sitting on that fence
Mr. Ambivalent
We're all sick and tired
Of your ambivalence

Mr. Ambivalent
You don't gain no ground
When you stay in one spot
Mr. Ambivalent
Make a little movement
Or get off of the pot

If you love it and you hate it
You just stay in a bind
Take it or leave it
Make up your mind

Mr. Ambivalent
You got options open
But you're headed for a fall
Mr. Ambivalent
You'll wind up with nothing
Because you want it all

Mr. Ambivalent
First you say you're sure
And then you're not so sure
Mr. Ambivalent
No one thinks it's cute
When you're so damned demure

If you love it and you hate it
You just stay in a bind
Take it or leave it
Make up your mind

Mr. Ambivalent
Lord, you love to waffle
How you go back and forth
Mr. Ambivalent
You say you're flying south
And then you stay up north

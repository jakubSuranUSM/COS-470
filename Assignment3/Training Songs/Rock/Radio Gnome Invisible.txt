Gnome, gnome  
Radio gnome  
Radio gnome, radio gnome invisible

Then when you're receiving
Perceiving your telepathic powers
Who knows why the wind blows through this window
Why you believe in me
We believe in you

What's that in the sky now?
Teapots that can fly now
Voices in your head
Tell me what they said

Banana, nirvana, manana (you know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (i know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (we know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (who knows)
Banana, nirvana, manana (you know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (i know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (we know)
Banana, nirvana, manana (who knows)

Everything you think shows
Hanging round your head
Underneath your long hair
Tell me what you feel there

You hear me
But I don't see you
You feel me
One day I'll be you

Radio gnome invisible

Then when you're receiving
Believing your telepathic powers
Who knows why the wind blows through this window
Why you believe in me
We believe in you

What's that in the sky now?
Teapots that can fly now

Tell me what they said

Tell the one above he’s a criminal 
For taking and giving life like marble candy
Everything collapses around me
Overwhelms and astounds me
A Terrible Truth

When you leave this life, the world will be a darker place for
All Who Remain
When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for
All Who Remain
The light you gave the human race will go away…

I see you every time that I close my eyes
I Hum every lullaby that you used to sing
You never know the last time you’ll see someone 
So give them all of your love
Cause they’ll disappear

When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for
All Who Remain
When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for 
All Who Remain
And the light you gave the human race will go away...

If I can’t have you in this life
Then I don’t want this life at all
Cause there’s nothing in this broken world
That I’ll ever ever love as much

I called and I called you never picked up
I cried and I cried but you never woke up
You died and died without asking me first
You left me all alone here on Earth

When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for
All Who Remain
When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for
All Who Remain
When you leave this life the world will be a darker place for 
All Who Remain

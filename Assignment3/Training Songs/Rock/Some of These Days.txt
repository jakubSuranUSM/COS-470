Some of these days you're gonna miss me honey
Some of these days you're gonna be so lonely
You'll miss my hugging miss my kissing too
You'll be so sorry when I'm away from you
Now you're gonna be lonely just for me only
Cause you know honey that you had your way
And when you leave me you know it's gonna grieve me
You're gonna miss your little honey some of these days
(Now you'll be lonely) yes you'll be lonely (just for me only) just for me only
(Cause you know honey) yes you know honey (you had your way) yes you had your way
Cause when you leave me oh you know it's gonna grieve me
You're gonna miss your little honey some of these days
(You're gonna miss) you're gonna miss your little honey some of these days
(Some of these days)

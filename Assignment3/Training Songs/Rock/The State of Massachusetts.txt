She had excuses and she just used them 
She was the victim of unspeakable abuses 
Her husband was violent, malicious and distant 
Her kids now belong to the state of Massachusetts

They've been taken away 
They've been taken away 

Billy was a bright one 
Tommy's off his head 
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said 
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past 
Send them both to DSS, now you had your chance 
The poison who stole your babies 
The judges took your rights 
You can have your children, or the night 

I suppose you've a victim 
I suspect you may have lied 
If you've lost all ambition won't you give this thing a try 
If you can't and you fail won't be the only loser 
These kid don't stand a chance with you in their future

They've been taken away
They've been taken away

Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said 
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past 
Send them both to DSS, now you had your chance 
The poison who stole your babies 
The judges took your rights 
You can have your children, or the night 

The poison stole your babies 
The tenants took your rides
You can have the children, or the day

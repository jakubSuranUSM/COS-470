Baby, join me in death 
Baby, join me in death 
Baby, join me in death 
We are so young,and our lives have just begun
But already, we are considering
Escape from this world
And we've waited for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
Together in death
Whooo
Won't you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death) 
Won't you die (baby join me in death)
Won't you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death)
This world is a cruel place, and we're only to lose
Before live tears us apart, let death bless me with you
Whooo
Won't you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death)
So will you die (baby join me in death)
Won't you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death)
Join me in death
Whooo
This life ain't worth living (2x)
Join me
Join me
This life ain't worth living (join me, join me)
Join me 
Join me
This life ain't worth living
Won't you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death)
So will you die (Baby, join me in death)
Will you die tonight for love (Baby, join me in death)
Baby, join me in death

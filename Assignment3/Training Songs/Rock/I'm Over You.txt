The summer sun, the winter rain
Won't ever change now I'm over you
The morning light, the evening night
Won't ever change now I'm over you
I'm over you, now I'm over you
Now I'm over you

Clouds in the sky, birds flying by
Won't ever change now I'm over you
A young child's cry, a lover's sigh
Won't ever change now I'm over you
I'm over you, over you, now I'm over you

Without your love
The morning light hurts my eyes
Without your love
The evening skies make me cry
Without your love
I'd be no place at all
I'd be lost without you

Clouds in the sky, birds flying by
Won't ever change now I'm over you
A young child's cry, a lover's sigh
Won't ever change now I'm over you
I'm over you, over you, now I'm over you
I'm over you, over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, over you, now I'm over you
Now I'm over you, over you, I'm over you
I'm over you, over you, I'm over you

You never call my name
On the telephone
You never call my name
On the telephone
I just sit and cry
By the telephone

I try and call your phone,
But you're never home
I try and call your phone,
But you're never home
You watch me sit outside
You watch me wait and try

And much to my surprise,
I caught you on the number 9
You never called my name
On the telephone

You never call my name (you never call my name)
On the telephone (you never call my name)
You never call my name (you never call my name)
On the telephone (you never call my name)
You make me sick inside (you never call my name)
You make me wanna die (you never call my name)

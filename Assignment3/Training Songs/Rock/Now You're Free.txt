The girl said forever,
But she still may never be sold on the heart of this place
Sweet was her mother and kind was her brother
But neither would meet face to face

Don’t give up now
Don’t’ give up now cos’ we’re already
Don’t give up now
Don’t give up now
We’re just facing our fears

Sing til you mean it
And love til you feel it
'Cause I still believe in your heart
Don’t let the waves push and pull you away
Now you’re free and it sets you apart
Now you’re free and it sets you apart

With anxious devotion and hearts set in motion
We won’t have to go this alone
I need to you feel it
Send kisses to seal
And walk with me all the way home

Don’t give up now
Don’t give up now cos’ we’re already here

Sing til you mean it
And love til you feel it
'Cause I still believe in your heart
Don’t let the waves push and pull you away
Now you’re free and it sets you apart
Now you’re free and it sets you apart

It’s too late to come back home
And you’re always on your own

Sing til you mean it
And love til you feel it
'Cause I still believe in your heart
Don’t let the waves push and pull you away
Now you’re free and it sets you apart
Now you’re free and it sets you apart

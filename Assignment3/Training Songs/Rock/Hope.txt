Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to
It's gonna get that the best of you
It's gonna lift you up and let you down
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that
You learn to love

Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
At in the end of a roll of delusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I see can right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't
Always
Have to hold to your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so,

Du du du
Hope you're not alone
Hm hm hum

Your,
Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can probably get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth
It fading way too soon
Your shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too
Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
Cause you don't
Always
Have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not so,

Du ru ru ru ru
Hope you're not alone
Hm hm hm
Better hope
Hu hu hm
Better hope you're not alone
Hu hu hm
Hope

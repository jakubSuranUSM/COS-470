Wah wah wah wah

In a place where no one goes I secede whilst next door low and behold
A girl is waiting pleasantly placing animals through my hair and hers
I have no complaints to restrain me, the ship has gone to places far gone
She will follow elegant strides, forget-me-nots, thunder in my guts

You are the custodian of your own stomach and all that's in it
Colonic irrigation dear followed by sex and beer
I am there while you are here, I am no Indian you are no fairy
This place will be a mess in a day, so why no go our separate ways

I am no red Indian

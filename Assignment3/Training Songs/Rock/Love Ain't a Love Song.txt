Happiness is a bottle, happiness is pain
Happiness is a woman who you love 'til she goes on and shames you
Happiness is value, happiness is a poem
Happiness is a lie for you know the calm before the storm
Ain't nobody love you better, ain't nobody but me
And all I want is a fair shake at love, get a little something for free
(Love ain't a love song) love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song) Tell me baby yeah (love ain't a love song)
Hip them all to the city
Hip them all to the scene
Hip them all to the woman you want bringing them all to their knees
Hip them all to the badlands
Hip them all to the stars
All I know is the woman I knew didn't get me too far
Ain't nobody love you better, ain't nobody but me
All I want is a fair shake at love, get a little something for free
Ain't nobody work harder, ain't nobody love you more
All I know it's the fall of a man wearing the crown of thorns
(Love ain't a love song) love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song) Tell me baby yeah
(Love ain't a love song) Love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song)

Ain't nobody love you better, ain't nobody but me
All I want is a fair shake at love
Give a little something for free
Ain't nobody work harder ain't nobody love you more
All I know is the fall of a man wearing the crown of thorns
(Love ain't a love song) love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song) Tell me baby yeah
(Love ain't a love song) Love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song) Tell me baby yeah
(Love ain't a love song) Love ain't a love song
(Love ain't a love song)

When I was a young man
Money was my hero
Something to believe in
Something to be seen 
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
I'm adding up the zeros
In the book of might have been 

When I was a young man
I was someone's hero
Someone to be seen with
Someone to believe 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
All that dirty water
In the river of my dreams 

All that dirty water in my dreams 

When I was a young man
Being cool came easy
Playing in the big lights
Trouble came for free 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
Trying to find the good seed
Now I'm down here in the weeds 

All that dirty water in my dreams 
All that dirty water in my dreams 

When I was a young man
Music was my saviour
Took me to the fast lane
Answered all my needs 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
All it did was show me
All the things that might have been 

All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams

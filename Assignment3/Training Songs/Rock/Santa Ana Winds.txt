When the wind decides that it's time to ride 
To spread a little hell through the heartland 
It takes a good long toke then it blows the smoke, through the desert night 
And the wings of fire, keep climbin' higher 
Flames cuttin' hard through the homeland 
It takes a mighty strong will to strip the chill from the desert night 
You waken from your dream, by a siren's scream 
Trapped by the walls that surround you 
Then it's will to will, and you wonder still can you struggle free 
In a thousand ways, when you turn the phrase 
The wind's like a love of a woman (woman, woman, woman) 
It takes a mighty mean bitch, some fire witch 
To set the night on fire 
And the Santa Ana wind's gonna have its way tonight 
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind 
And ain't it a lot like love the way desire takes you in 
And sparks the fire like the Santa Ana wind 
Now the air is calm, and the heart grows numb 
The ashes burnin' low in the heartland 
Till again the wind starts closin' in to set the night on fire 
And the Santa Ana wind's blowin' cross my heart tonight 
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind 
And woman I want your love 
I need that passion deep within 
Like the ragin' fire needs the Santa Ana wind 
And the Santa Ana wind's gonna take your life tonight 
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind 
And ain't it a lot like love 
The way desire takes you in 
Swept away with the Santa Ana wind

I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words 
But I started listening to the wolves in the timber 
Wolves in the timber at night 
I heard their songs when I looked in the mirror 
In the howls and the moons round my eyes 

[Chorus]
So long, so high 
So long, so high
So long, so high
So long

Then winter came and there was little left between us 
Skin and bones of love won't make a meal 
I felt my eyes lifting over your shoulder 
There were wolves at the edge of the field
But I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words 

[Chorus]

Then one day I just woke up 
And the wolves were all there 
Wolves in the piano 
Wolves underneath the stairs 
Wolves inside the hinges 
Circling round my door 
At night inside the bedsprings
Clicking cross the floor 
I don't know how they found me 
I'll never know quite how 
I still can't believe they heard me 
That I was howling out that loud 

[Chorus]

At times in the frozen nights I go roaming 
In the bed she used to share with me 
I wake in the fields with the cold and the lonesome 
The moon's the only face that I see 
But I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words 

[Chorus]

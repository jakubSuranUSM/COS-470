Hey take it right down 
Lay back in the sun 
Gonna have me some good times babe 
Good dope good fun 
Hey honey y'know 
Gonna slip on right down 
Gonna have me some good times in town 
Gonna have me some good friends around 

Hey honey I feel 
So good to be free 
I've got a fever inside of my soul 
I've got a fire in me 

Gonna have me some fun 
Lay in the sun 
Take me some more 
Take me someone 
Gonna have good times babe 
Good dope good fun 

Hey take it right down

Shame on you 
For thinking that you're an exception 
We're all to blame 
Crashing down to earth 
Waisting and burning out, yeah 
Fading like a dead star, wooo
One is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way

You used to be everything to me 
But i'm tired of the fighting
Tired of the fighting 

Shame on you 
For thinking 
You're all alone
If you want to make a wish you weren't
Failing to impress 
Why can't you sleep with 
Someone who'll protect you, yeah 
One is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way

You used to be everything to me 
But now i'm tired of the fighting 
Tired of the fighting
Fighting yourself

+ First version

She'll know for thinking
Your with assumption 
We're all to blame
Crashing down to earth
Wasting and burning out 
Fading like a dead star
One is coming your way
Its coming your way 

And you used to mean everything to me 
And now your tired and shining
Tired and shining, burning up

They know you for thinking your all alone
If you want it you should learn
Fading to the ground
Why can't you sleep with 
Someone who'll protect you
One is coming your way
Its coming your way

And you used to mean everything to me 
And now your tired and shining
Tired and shining, burning up

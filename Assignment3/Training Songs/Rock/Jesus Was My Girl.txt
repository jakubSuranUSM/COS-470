So he dies and I'm the joke
A Play Doh mask a million miles to go
A suped up cock tease with a little twist
When sex got ugly I'd insist
Hear you'll empty all I've got
Fucking's over but I can't stop cumming
Still born dead or never born at all

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

It's impossible for me
Harder even if I turn it over
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
Hear you've taken all I got
Fucking's over but I just keep cumming
Still born dead and never born at all

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl
When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease

When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl
When Jesus was my girl
She told me
When Jesus was my girl

I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symphony of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease
I'm not as pretty as I thought I'd be
Another symptom of my damn disease

I'm so bored with you
It didn't take long
I hear all about you
Every day of the month
You sounded so in control of it
On Radio 1
But I don't believe you
And though they all seem to
And though they all scream for you
And though they all dream of you
Retro's out Jumble's in
You dinosaur thing
Afro's out Boneheads in
You dinosaur thing
Help us out Rag it all in
You dinosaur thing
Do you believe it?
Or are you tryin it on
Like something that caught your eye
On Kensington Market
You always seem so beautiful
Like you fell out of bed
But I think you're wearin' it
I think you care about it
After all that you said
You're just another spotty fool
Who started a group
Out of your mind and all over the world
But the stuff you do
It's so uncool
You can't remember
How it feels to kick your heels
What do you know of being young
I hear you're almost twenty-one
Help us out
Retro's out
Afro's out, jumble's in
You dinosaur thing
Retro's out, Bonehead's in
You dinosaur thing
Mojo's out
Go-Go's out
Help us out
You dinosaur thing......

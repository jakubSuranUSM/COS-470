Lonely nights, never end,
They come here again and again,
Whenever I'm alone, without you.
This love, it seems, to keep taking me higher.
But I'm flying alone, without you.
I know I tried and tried before,
(I know, you know.)
You know I need you more and more.
Were you tellin' me lies?
Did you really mean goodbye?
Can't you see, I'm yours,
I'm in love for the first time.
And now I'm lost,
Without you, without you, without you, without you.

I'm flying with broken wings,
I'm flying alone
I'm flying with broken wings,
I'm flying alone.
(Yeah, I'm flying, yeah I'm flying alone)
I'm flying with broken wings,
I'm flying alone.
I'm flying with broken wings,
I'm flying alone.
(Can't you hear me, can't you hear me?)
I'm flying with broken wings,
I'm flying alone.

I took myself out walking
By the evening I was running
I hadn't done this for a long while
My friend said cheer up, it was high time

But can't you see I'm lovesick?
I need a cure so bring it real quick
This time I'm fearing heartbreak
Look at the time, it's almost daybreak

Oh, I don't want to settle down
I don't want to leave this town
I'm feeling lost and found
Am I wild, wild, wild, wild, wild?

Oh, I am most dissatisfied
You can tell this looking in my eyes
She looks like a lovely piece of art
But pills plus miles tear us apart

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I took myself out walking
By the evening I was running
I hadn't done this for a long while
My friend said cheer up, it was high time

But can't you see I'm lovesick?
I need a cure so bring it real quick
This time I'm fearing heartbreak
Look at the time, it's almost daybreak

Oh, I don't want to settle down
I don't want to leave this town
I'm feeling lost and found

Am I wild, wild, wild, wild, wild?
Am I wild, wild, wild, wild, wild?
Aren't we wild, wild, wild, wild, wild?

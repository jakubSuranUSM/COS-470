If a cold wind starts to rise,
I am ready now, I am ready now
With the last sail lifted high,
I am ready now, I am ready now

All the wreckage I left behind,
I burned the earth beneath my weary-weakened feet.
Feel my heart stop and lift my eyes,
I can’t choose when to love or who I am part of

If a cold wind starts to rise,
I am ready now, I am ready now
With the last sail lifted high,
I am ready now, I am ready now

I was so wrong and unaware,
I locked myself away, I thought that I’d be safe,
Then I realized I’d gone nowhere
Life is just too sweet to lie in this defeat

If a cold wind starts to rise,
I am ready now, I am ready now
With the last sail lifted high,
I am ready now, I am ready now

If a storm blows in on me,
I am ready now, I am ready now
When the waves come from underneath,
I am ready now, I am ready

If a cold wind starts to rise,
I am ready now, I am ready now
With the last sail lifted high,
I am ready now, I am ready now

If a storm blows in on me,
I am ready now, I am ready now
When the waves come from underneath,
I am ready now, I am ready

With the last sail lifted high,
I am ready now, I am ready now.

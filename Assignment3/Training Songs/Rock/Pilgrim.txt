A pilgrim at the gray of dawn
Leaving in the mist of morning
On his journey of goodness
Heaven sent, God blessed

Pilgrim laughing at the world
Spreading joy
At the touch of his hand
Wiping out all the misery
Making love and history

Those of us who don't know war
We shouldn't try to make it
So many did and even more died
Do you think you could take it?

Love lies waiting at my back door
Such a beautiful matter of fact
Life's like an apple
With love as the core
And I'll tell you â€˜bout that

Just a man in my prime
Love was there
But I had no time
I was cheered and adored
And I thought fame
Was all the world

Battles won and victory cheers
Were the sounds
I'd heard for years
But the women I really loved
Was losing me
To all this blood

I only knew I had to win
And build a world
Where I was king
But leaders come and leaders go
And that's the truth
I came to know

Love or war I couldn't choose
And so both
I had to lose

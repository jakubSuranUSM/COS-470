I'm walking this railings edge
Just to feel this good
And freaky be beautiful you came
Following me like I knew you would
It tickled my fancy
Tickled my sense of fun
You claw like a rack on my back
Ever thickening its just begun 

Freaky be beautiful he falls
And his blood sprays so cold on my face
He feels so cold 

My crallow bird waiting
Shallow breathed shrapnel lung
I'm pressing the beak to my cheek
And its thickening kick off turns the sun 

Freaky be beautiful he falls
And his blood it sprays so cold on my face
He feels so cold
Freaky be beautiful
Oh no oh no
Freaky be beautiful 

Freaky be beautiful he falls
And his blood it sprays so cold on my face
He feels so cold

So I rot down inside for the loss
And I will not deny
I'm winding
Dig it out
Freaky be

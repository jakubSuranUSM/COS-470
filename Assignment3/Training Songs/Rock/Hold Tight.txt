Hold tight feels right, 
let me stay with you tonight. 
Feels right, so right. 
Feeling, reeling, 
my heart's just hit the ceiling. 
Feels right, so right, 
hold tight tonight. 
And if this is the way I wish I had this feeling everyday. 
So hold tight (hold tight) tonight's alright. 
Cold feet, knees weak, 
I stammer when I try to speak. 
Feels right, so right, 
hold tight tonight. 
And if this is the way I wish I had this feeling everyday. 
So hold tight (hold tight) tonight's alright. 
Cold feet, knees weak,
I stammer when I tried to speak. 
So hold tight (hold tight) tonight's alright, 
tonight's alright, 
tonight's alright.

Yeah

Got me losing' myself
And I can’t explain it
Got me losing myself
Mute the voices in my head, my head

So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own

Oh say what you want but I can’t hear it
Baby please don’t go, baby please (baby please)
Baby please
Oh say what you want but I can’t hear it
Baby please don’t go, baby please
Don’t go

Oh 

Don’t go

It's your boy boy Eazi
Torn up letters
So many things I wish I said
I miss the days when
We were young without a care
Skimming stones
Feels like the future is behind
And I'm gaining by myself

So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own (on my own, on my own)
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own (on my own, on my own)

Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please, baby please (baby please)
Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please, don't go, baby please
Don't go

No, no, no, oh
No
Don't go

Please don't go, I can't do it on my own (O can't do it on my own) (ooh)
So please don't go, I can't do it on my own (ooh)

Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please don't go
Baby please (baby please)
Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please (don't go)
Don't go (zagadat)
Nah
Don't go (nah)

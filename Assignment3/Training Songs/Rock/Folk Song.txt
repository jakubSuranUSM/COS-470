Lying in the long long grass
Blossom on the trees
Springtime's slipping away my love
Yeah springtime's slipping away
When it comes around again
It will never be the same
Heavens slipping away my love
Yeah heavens slipping away
Yeah heavens slipping away

Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads its wings
We cant keep a hold on time
Just receive what it brings

Lying in the long long grass
Clouds are drifting by
Springtime's slipping away my love
Yeah springtime's slipping away
Dreaming in this lost domain
Which you'll never see again
Heavens slipping away my love
Yeah heavens slipping away
Yeah heavens slipping away

Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads its wings
Light a candle in your heart
Light it to the spring
Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads its wings
We cant keep a hold on time
Just receive what it will bring

Mellow evenings in the spring
Full of warmth and hope
You are dreaming unaware
Unaware that you are letting go

Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads it wings
We cant keep a hold on time
Just receive what it will bring
Walking through this lonely season
Sorrow spreads its wings
Light a candle in your heart
Light it to the spring

Springtime's slipping away my love
Yeah springtime's slipping away
Heavens slipping away my love
Yeah heavens slipping away

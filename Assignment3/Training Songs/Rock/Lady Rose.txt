On the dark nights
By the fire light
I see her face
Before my eyes.

Lady Rose
My Lday Rose
Oh Lady
My Rose

My Lady Rose.
De
De-de-de
De de-de-de.

Lost in mem'ries
Of the moment
Of the time spent
How the days went

Lady Rose...
From the shadows
Through the bright lights
From the dark nights
Through the sun light.

Lady Rose
My Lday Rose
Oh Lady
My Rose

My Lady Rose.
De
De-de-de
De de-de-de.

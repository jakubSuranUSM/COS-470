I just recived a message from my mother
She asked me nicely not to bring the girl back home
She says that she's good-looking but she's crazy
Oh, but mama dear i knew it all along

She Don't fool me
She thinks I only see what I wanna see
No, she don't fool me
She don't fool me

I needed someone I could call my mistress
To help me back from the fire to the frying pan
She's young enough to write me off as senile
But I'm old enough to read between the lines
She Don't fool me
She thinks I only see what I wanna see
No, she don't fool me
She don't fool me

A very normal business transaction
Somehow turned into a daymare overnight
I know she knows I know she doesn't love me
She knows I know she knows it ain't working right

No, she don't fool me
She thinks I only see what I wanna see
Oh, she don't fool me
She thinks I only see what I wanna see
Oh, she don't fool me

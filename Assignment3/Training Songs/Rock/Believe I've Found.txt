There goes my childhood, 
There goes all I thought was true,
With the friends I knew and the ones I left behind 

And there goes my heroes, 
And all that I used to trust, 
With the ones I cursed and the ones who crossed the line

But I believe I've found, 
A better way to satisfy, 
I believe I've found, 
A better way to satisfy your kind

There goes my heartache, 
There goes all my troubles too,
With the dreams that flew and the ones who let me down

And there goes my ego, 
And all that I had to share, 
With the ones who cared and the ones who said: 
That's mine! 

But I believe I've found, 
A better way to satisfy, 
Yeah, I believe I've found,
A better way to satisfy your kind

And if I will make it I don't know, 
And If I will hate it I don't care,
As long as you're not afraid to get by
There goes my life

And all that I had to face, 
With the human race and the children of denial

But I believe I've found, 
A better way to satisfy, I believe I've found,
A better way to catch your eye, 
Yeah, I believe I've found, 
A better way to satisfy, 
I believe I've found, 

A better way to satisfy your kind,
A better way to satisfy your kind

I see you in the darkness, I see you in the light
I see your eyes shining in through the night
Make me feel, make me feel like I belong
Don't leave me, don't leave me here all alone
Cast your eyes like summer skies
Bluer than the ocean, clearer than the sky
Yeah
* Sunshine on a rainy day
Makes my soul, makes my soul, trip, trip, trip away
[Repeat *]
You touch me with your spirit, you touch me with your heart
You touch me in the darkness, I feel it start
Make me feel, make me feel, so unreal, so unreal
Like a wind in the desert, like a moon on the sea
Yeah
[Repeat * , * , *]
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine ... till fade

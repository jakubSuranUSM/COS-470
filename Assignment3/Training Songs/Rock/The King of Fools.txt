(Here comes the king of fools)
(Here comes the king of fools)

Make way, make way I say
Well, today is coronation day
I'm gonna wear my heartbreak
For a crown
And tears instead of jewels
'Cause I'm his majesty,
The king of fools

Raise a cheer as he passes by
Drink a toast to this lonely guy
I'm gonna wear my heartbreak for a crown
And tears instead of jewels
'Cause I'm his majesty,
The king of fools

How can you fall
Oh, slap bang out of love
Don't ask me, you should know,
You found it easy enough

Make way, make way I say
Well, today is coronation day
I'm going to wear my heartbreak for a crown
And tears instead of jewels
'Cause I'm his majesty,
The king of fools

How can you fall
Oh, slap bang out of love
Don't ask me, you should know,
You found it easy enough

Make way, make way I say
Well, today is coronation day
I'm going to wear my heartbreak for a crown
And tears instead of jewels
'Cause I'm his majesty,
The king of fools

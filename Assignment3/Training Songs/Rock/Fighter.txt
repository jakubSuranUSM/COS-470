Aquarius, 
Eyes so green like a treetop canopy.
So curious, 
Lips are red like a hilltop forest fire.
Oblivious,
Voice so sweet like a songbird singing choir.
So tell me now,
What's in your head?
My patience hanging by a thread.

'Cause I am the fighter,
And you are the fists tht bruise my face.
This burning desire,
Her innocence is such a waste. 
Her innocence is such a waste. 

Feel the lust,
Tip the scales like a prison ball and chain.
And take this trust,
Once it's gone it can never be regained.
'cause it's a must,
Truth be told all secrets see the light.
Tell me why?
My patience hanging by a thread.

'cause I am the fighter,
And you are the fists tht bruise my face.
This burning desire,
Her innocence is such a waste.
Her innocence is such a waste. 

Save her, save me.
Save her, save me.

'Cause I am the fighter,
And you are the fists tht bruise my face.
This burning desire,
Her innocence is such a waste.
Her innocence is such a waste.

Traffic
Six AM
New York time
A little late

Lose your job
Frame of mind
I don't know
What's the score

10 to 9
Take a swing
Tie it up
Miller time

Up all night
Take a run to the other side
It's all right
Don't you trip on your open mind

New York Time
Gotta get away from the New York Crime rave
New York Time
Got no reason to stay

New York Time
Gotta get away Gotta get away yea
Freak Show
Disco

Limousines
Crime rave
Not so
Fast with me

Out all night
On a run to the other side
It's alright
Don't you trip on your open mind

New York Time
Gotta get away from the New York Crime rave
New York Time
Got no reason to stay

New York Time
Gotta get away Gotta get away yea
Someone's singing "Swing Low"
Waering a halo

In another time
Today is going to be the day
I rise above it all
Here I go

The sun is gonna shine
New York Time
Gotta get away from the New York Crime rave
New York Time

Got no reason to stay
New York Time
Gotta get away Gotta get away yea
New York Time [Repeat: x3]

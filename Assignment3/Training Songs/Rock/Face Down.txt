We'll have a good time baby
Well it's a Planet of the Apes and a Third Eye kinda thing
Well, let's all lay down and dig through the ground
To find the holy ride that'll make your thing go ding
What Mother Earth gives back to man
Is running through my bones
But now's the time for the beautiful exchange honey
And you ain't gonna do it all alone

When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down
I'll be floating
Squirming and laughing
Next position
That begins face down

They're gonna miss their children 
I mean I'm still alive but I'm almost gone
But now stands for everything
So get your ass down on the playing ground

Baby will you slide me through the world
I ain't working for the man, I'm an allosaurus, baby
Well, I'm sucking up more karma than I need
So have supernova on me

When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down
I'll be floating
Squirming and laughing
Next position
That begins face down

When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down
When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down
When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down

In the heat of the morning
In the eye of the sun
Hear the wind start blowing
See the horse and the gun
Now the peace pipe, it ain't smokin'
All the promises are broken
In the heat of the morning
See the horse and the gun
All in the name of God somehow
Oh-oh-oo-whoa!
Tearing the temple down
Burn down the sacred ground!
Tear the temple down!
In the name of God somehow…
Burn down the sacred ground!

In the dead of the evening,
When the spears come down,
Say a prayer for the plowboy
On the killing ground.
Now the peace pipe, it is broken,
All the shaman's gone unspoken.
In the dead of the evening
When the tears come down,  yeah!
All in the name of God somehow…
Oh-oh-oo-whoa!
Tearing the temple down
Burn down the sacred ground!
Tear the temple down!
In the name of God somehow
Burn down the sacred ground!

All in the name 
All in the name

All in the name of God somehow
Hey, hey!  Oh-oh, yeah, yeah!  Oh-oh-oo-whoa!
Burn down the sacred ground!
Tear the temple down!
In the name of God somehow
Burn down the sacred ground!
Hey, hey!  Yeah, yeah!  Oh-oh-oo-whoa!
Burn down the sacred ground!
Burn down the sacred ground!
Burn down the sacred ground!
Burn down the sacred ground!

In the clear of the day every evening he calls for a love from above carefully watch for a reason mistaking devotion
and love isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation surrender to self preservation and brothers who care for themselves
as long as it touches perfection a person is like everything else isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation mother I tried
do believe me I'm doing the best I can I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through I'm ashamed of the person I
am isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation but if you could just see the beauty whose face I could never describe
who's playing the game to distraction isn't my heart for a prize? isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation

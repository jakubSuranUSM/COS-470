Oh, I feel sympathy. 
Be grateful my son for what you get.
Expression and passion. 
Ten days for watching the sunset;

When I was your age 
Amusement we made for ourselves.
"Permission to breathe sir," 
Don't talk like that, I'm your old man.

They'll soon be demobbed son, 
So join up as soon as you can.
You can't borrow that 
'Cause that's for the races 

And doesn't grow on trees.
I only feel what touches me
And feel in touching I can see
A better state to be in.

Who has the right
To question what I might do,
In feeling I should touch the real
And only things I feel.

It's advice and it's nice to know 
When you're best advised.
You've only turned thirty, so son, 
You'd better apologize.

And when you grow up, if you're good 
We will buy you a bike.

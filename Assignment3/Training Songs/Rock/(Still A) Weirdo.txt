Now I know, I took for granted 
That things would always go the way I wanted, oh
I was going to be a treetop
A sea, a boat, a rock of ages

I don't always get it right
I'd see it in a different kind of light

Pay my lip service
Keep it eloquent
Optimistic but
Never quite elegant
Still a weirdo
Still a weirdo, after all these years

I'd always thought it's automatic
To grow into a soul less static
But here I am upon the same spot
Attempting to lift off into space

I don't always get it right
But a thousand different ways
And I just might

Pay my lip service
Keep it eloquent
Optimistic but
Never quite elegant
Still a weirdo
Still a weirdo, after all these years
Still a weirdo
Still a weirdo, after all these years

Pay my lip service
Keep it eloquent
Optimistic but
Never quite elegant
Still a weirdo
Still a weirdo, after all these years

Still a weirdo
Still a weirdo, after all these years

After all these years

Morning has come with the first rays of sun
Breaking through our windowpane
Songs fill the air but there's no singer there
Just an old wooden guitar playing

Writing this song won't take very long
Trying not to use the world "old"
Thinking about taking chances and doubts
That still linger in the cold

Looking forward, all that I can see
Is good things happening to you and to me
I'm not waiting for times to change
I'm gonna live like a free-roaming soul

On the highway of our love

Looking forward, all that I can see
Is good things happening to you and to me
I'm not waiting for times to change
I'm gonna live like a free-roaming soul

Morning has come with the first rays of sun
Breaking through our windowpane
Songs fill the air but there's no singer there
Just an old wooden guitar playing

Well I thought my life was over when she walked right out on me
And I watched the world around me just explode
That's when I hit the highway, that's how I came to be
Morning Rider on the road

Well, I'd wake up in the morning with the sunshine in my eyes
And the music of the Canyon would begin
And I'd soar just like an eagle through the blue Montana skies
Like a glider on the wind

There were times when I was hungry, times I missed a friend
But sleep would hush it over

There were times the rain would wake me and all my dreams would end
But a dream can't last forever

Na na na... Morning rider on the road
Na na na... Morning rider in the sun

There were times when I was happy, being free was fun
Like a hobo in the sun

There were times when I was lonely and I'd wish the night was done
Like an Indian on the run

And all at once I met you and you stop me in my tracks
And all at once I lose the urge to roam
So the hobo in the sun, and the Indian on the run
And the rider on the highway found a home

And all at once I met you and you stop me in my tracks
And all at once I lose the urge to roam
So the hobo in the sun, and the Indian on the run
And the rider on the highway found a home.

The more I try to love the less I love myself 
I guess that you could say I'm headed down 
Is there anyone among us who's never lost it? 
Probably not I think as I look around 
‘Cause everyone around here knows that love is for children's stories 
And that God is a concept we measure pain with 
Hey, relax, I'm just quotin' John Lennon 
All you need is love 'til your heart ends up deadened 

Maybe you are a baseball 
And I am a broken window 
So it doesn't matter what it is you do to me 
We can coexist or you can strike me out like a batter 
Either way I'll be in pieces sharp and shattered 

Two steps forward then a hundred thousand back 
I'm not good at lettin' go and moving on 
I lost a good friend once to a cancer that rotted out his colon 
It's been 18 years Danelle where have the days all gone? 
‘Cause everyone around here knows that I like to carry on 
About my big big dreams that no one really wants to hear 
Heartbreak is motivation to get your ass going 
And that's the truth about why I quit living here 

Maybe you are a baseball 
And I am a broken window 
So it doesn't matter what it is you do to me 
We can coexist or you can strike me out like a batter 
Either way I'll be in pieces sharp and shattered
We can coexist or you can strike me out like a batter 
Either way I'll be in pieces sharp and shattered

The voices die in the distance
The crying is faint
The same fate overtakes them
The sound rings in the midst
Better days will lie in wait
So I'll endure this 'til you take me away
Holding close to your hands never slipping through your grip
The road is getting longer and I don't know if I can make it
But I'll hold hoping to get stronger all the while
Calling out, let it pass
Let it drown with the water
Freedom from this place is found in you, it's found in you
I'll be home soon with the letter in my left hand
I'll be home soon cause I'm coming home to you
Chasing the wind
The light that you lead is only a shadow now
But it's bright enough for me to lead you out
So I'll take this until it fades
Until it falls
Until it breaks
And I'll kiss it goodbye
I'll kiss life goodbye
This world goodbye
I'll be home soon
I will be home soon

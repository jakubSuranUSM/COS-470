Was it for a moments pleasure
That brought me to your door
Was it for your darkest treasure
Could I have loved you more

Did I take the time to tell you
I'd seen you once before
You were standing in my garden
And I was on the floor

You came around that evening
You came around that fall
My heart went out that evening
Never came back at all, oh

And so I came to know you
As keeper of my heart
It saw me search and saw you
It showed me from the start

Time and again I've held you near me
I wonder if you've ever known
How I hold you near me
Is not exactly shown

I'm coming around to know you
I've come to find my place
And someone there to go to
It's come to be my fate

Like a fire holds its heat in
Like the winter holds its cold
Like a question holds its answer
That's the way you hold

I came around that evening
I came around that fall
My heart went out that evening
Never came back at all

Coming around to know you
I've come to find my place

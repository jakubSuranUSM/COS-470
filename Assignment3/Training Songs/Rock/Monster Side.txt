I am young 
But a fool
I am stupid
But I'm cool
I am kind 
But I'm weak
I can turn the other cheek
All I wanted was to find a friend again again and
I just can't hide
My monster side
My monster side and
I can't control the loss I feel 
The loss I feel

If I had another chance I would peacefully advance
But as I'm fated to be here 
Resined and ridden by my fear
I should love myself 
My vanity loves someone else and

I just can't hide 
My monster side 
My monster side and
I can't control 
The loss I feel
The loss I feel

I am the best there is 
That's all there is
It's harder 
I'm fulfilled I take it out on you 
Because you care
Because I love you
I expect you to be there

I just can't hide 
My monster side
My monster side and
I can't control
The loss I feel
The loss I feel

I can't abide my monster side
My monster side
But it's an animal
I just can't ride
I just can't ride

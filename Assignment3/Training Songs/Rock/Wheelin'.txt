We were sitting in a car, looking out at all the stars
Well I had to talk to you, I had to get through to you
Well we talked all through the night, 'cause we knew the time was right
Well we thought we'd reached the end but we're going round again

Wheelin', dealin', stealin', wheelin'...
Well the very next day, we were standing on the stage
It was in the open air, there were lots of people there
In the middle of a song, everything was going wrong
Well we all forgot to change, everyone was feeling strange

Wheelin', dealin', stealin', wheelin'...
(repeat and fade out)

Well you told me
That I was just not the one
And you left me standing out in the cold
It's been a long time
And I'm so much better now
That I'm looking back and seeing it all
     
And for the first time
There's no pain in my life
It's been a long hard road that I've gone
We had a good thing
And it made me a man
And I know you got me going
Pardon me, my feelings are showing
I'm only saying
What's on my mind
     
Well I found you
Or maybe I found myself
And I think we knew it all of the time
We fit together
Just like a lock and a key
And we opened up each other's mind
     
Yeah I was laughing
'Cause there was no room to cry
There was too much growing to do
We had a good time
And it ain't over yet
'Cause I know you've got me going
Will you pardon me, my feelings are showing
I'm only saying
     
You came from nowhere
And you just jumped in my life
And I know it never will be the same
You made me love you
Now I'm home once again
No I never want to leave you nomore
'Cause I'm attached to the better half of myself
And there is nowhere else that I'd rather be
You feel same thing
You fixed a bad broken heart
Yes I know you've got me going
Pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind

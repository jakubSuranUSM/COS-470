Everybody knows you came with him but another girl caught his eye-ee-eye (I'll 
take you home)
Now you're sitting there all alone watching them dance by (I'll take you home)
And I know you're wondering what you'll do if he doesn't come back to you
But, don't worry, I'll take you home so, little girl, don't you be blue

Now I know that you wore that pretty red dress just for him to see (I'll take 
you home)
Mm-mm-yeah
But I wanna tell ya that red dress looks good to me (I'll take you home)
Whoa, I know you feel like you wanna die but try pretending that I'm your guy
And don't worry, I'll take you home so, little girl, now don't you cry

I'll take you home when the dance is over
I'll take you home, just wait and see
You're gonna dance the last dance with me

Let me tell you now

I know the way that you feel, I can understand (I'll take you home)
Mm-mm-mm
'cause I had a date just like you when the dance began (I'll take you home)
But the girl I came with just wasn't true, she's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home 'cause little girl, I'm lonely, too

Ohhhhhhh, let me tell you now

I know the way that you feel, I can understand (I'll take you home)
Mm-mm-mm
'cause I had a date just like you when the dance began (I'll take you home)
But the girl I came with just wasn't true, she's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home 'cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

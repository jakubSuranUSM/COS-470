Take these words and stick 'em in your head
Now roll then 'round until you can't forget 
What's said

Take this time to lie abut everything
About who you are and who you've been
Don't let the world get in

It's happened to me
It won't happen to everyone
It don't give in,
It will repeat, it will repeat, it will
And my central theme barks like a dog in me
The modern idiot is here and plain to see
I can't kick aside a kick inside
Call off the dogs, I won't admit 
I changed at all but lied just a little bit]

Seconds out
D'you wanna know what this fight's about?
Commerciality over art can't win out

I'm alike in a lot of ways
I'm alike in a lot of ways
I'm alike in a lot of ways

Just a little bit
Just a little bit

I'm alike in a lot of ways
I'm alike in a lot of ways
I'm alike in a lot of ways

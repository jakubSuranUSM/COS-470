I was always the one
Who did the thinkin'
It was me, I'm sorry
I who made the plans
There was never a thought
We might do somethin' between us
It's so clear I think
I'm beginning to understand
I was the one who had to
Lay it out and pay it out
I would work all night
Even though I wanted to
Play out and stay out

Now it's your turn to remember
And it's your turn
To try to understand

But you never would, would you?

When the time came
For stayin' together
You refused to even
Talk about for ever
It was easy telling me
You love me
And I was a little late in
Finding out the truth
The rule of love was there
You had to bend it
Now the damage is done
It's impossible to mend it
I can't mend it

Now it's your turn to remember
It's your turn to feel a little pain

I feel a little better
Talkin' about her
Yet her memory's not good for me
The skies are not so grey now
I've found a new tune to play now
It's a better song
It'll be followin' on

And when the time came
For stayin' together
You refused to even
Talk about for ever
It was easy telling me
You love me
And I was a little late in
Finding out the truth
The rule of love was there
But you had to bend it
Now the damage is done
It's impossible to mend it
You know I can't mend it

Come on babe

It's your turn to remember
Your turn to feel a little pain

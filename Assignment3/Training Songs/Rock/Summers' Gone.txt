Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing 
Because you're gone, gone from my arms 
Gone from my lips but you're still in my heart 

What to do? Oh, I'm left here just crying 
Over you, oh, I'm so blue 
What can I do now that you're gone? 

The days, they prolong now that you're gone 
My nights, they leave me blue (you're so blue) 
I don't know why there are tears in my eyes 
Can it be that I'm still in love with you? 

Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing 
Because you're gone, gone from my arms (from my arms) 
Gone from my lips (from my lips) but still in my heart 
(Still in my heart, still in my heart) 

Summer's gone and no songbirds are singing 
Because you're gone, gone from my arms 
Gone from my lips but still in my heart 
(Summer's gone but you're still in my heart)

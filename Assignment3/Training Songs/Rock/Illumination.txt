I close my eyes, but sleep won't come
You're in my waking dreams
It's a feeling right inside of me
'til you're in my arms again

The prayer I ask, is where I'm going to
Without your undying love
I'm as worthless as a cold, cold sun
That shines for no-one, at all

How many time, must I return
From distant oceans, just to learn
That with your song
Illumination comes

I close my eyes
And I hear no-one
I'm in a moving film
It's black and white
And beautiful
And it has no end to write

Hey go away you're annoying me
I'm a dick I'm a dick
And I could care less

You lied to me now
I can hear you say
You're a dick you're a dick
And I could care less

You have nerve
And when you tell everybody
Lies about me and I see
You so well
You're a fake and you know it
I won't stick around you here

You're a freak
I really thought you were different
I won't be around you here
Times a wasting
Anybody can see
I'm better off without you here

Hey go away you're annoying me
I'm a dick I'm a dick
And I could care less

You lied to me now
I can hear you say
You're a dick you're a dick
And I could care less

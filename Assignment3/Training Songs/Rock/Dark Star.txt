A dark star follows me tonight
Filled with horror and delight
She's come to make another son
A brother for the other one
Who's gone

The black storm on the pillow there
Is the color of her hair
Held by some strange gravity are my dark star
And me

A dark star follows you tonight
You're filled with horror and delight
You've come to make another son
A brother for the other one
I hold a picture of your face, in my memory in embrace
With you I find I can't replace
My dark star.

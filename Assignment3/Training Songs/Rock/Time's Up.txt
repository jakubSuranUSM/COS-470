We've been friends for a long term run
Shared the goods and we shared the fun
But it's true that nobody knows and no one can tell
Why in heaven do these moments come
Yeah, who in heaven lets these moments come
When the truth gets twisted and somebody's ringin' hell's bell
Yeah we've seen some high times
And it's too bad, one's always sad
You got ten seconds baby and then I'm gone, gone
Gimme one reason for stayin' home
Time's up, I hope you make a million
And have a lot of pretty children
But this is my song, gotta say "so long"
I'm always hopin' for the best in life
I try to put it right between my lines
But somehow you been missin' the clues
And you got me feelin' used
Yeah, we've seen some high times
There's more to come, where they come from
You got ten seconds baby and then I'm gone
Gimme one reason for hangin' on
Time's up, I hope you make a million
And have a lot of pretty children
And this is my song, tonight I gotta say "so long"
Time's up, I hope you get the picture
For your case there ain't no cure
I'll be free and you'll be fine
Time's up, I hope you make a million
And have a lot of pretty children
But this is my song,Â gotta say "so long"
Time's up
So long, bye, bye
Time's up

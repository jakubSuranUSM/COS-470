Waved goodbye to a friend of mine 
I guess its time as the sun shines through the dawn 
Another night is gone 
Seems like days since I saw her face 
In her place no trace of yesterday 
Yeah  but that's okay 
If she never comes back  it'll be too soon 
I'm doin' just fine just me 
And the man in the moon 

Well all in all it ain't a bad change 
I like it alone 'cause no one ever complains 
I don't confuse the names 
I heard about love is blind 
Well I found lying times and true deceit 
The way she uses me 
The air so think it feels like June 
I'm doin' fine just me 
And the man in the moon 

If she never comes back, it'll be too soon 
I'm singin' my song to the man in the moon 

Once in a while you can catch me smile 
With time to burn I turn the music on 
I play my favorite song 
All in all it ain't a bad change 
I like it alone 'cause no one ever complains 
I don't confuse the names 
I remember her face when I hear that tune 
I'm doin' fine just me 
And the man in the moon

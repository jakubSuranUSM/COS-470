It’s going right, I hate you took me right on
It’s getting me by, I hate you took me right on
And never the heart, I hate you took me right on
The city in light, I hate you took me right on

The kids in the park, I hate you took me right on
The city of dark, I hate you took me right on
It grows in the back, I hate you took me right on
And nothing would last, I hate you took me right on

But take your greedy hands
Lay them on me
But take your greedy hands
Lay them on me

This is not my heart, I hate you took me right on
You sit at the bar, I hate you took me right on
We lay in the dark, I hate you took me right on
We wait for the core, I hate you took me right on

But take your greedy hands
Lay them on me
But take your greedy hands
Lay them on me

I’m moving too fast, I hate you took me right on
We move in the past, I hate you took me right on
And it never can last, I hate you took me right on
It grows in the back, I hate you took me right on

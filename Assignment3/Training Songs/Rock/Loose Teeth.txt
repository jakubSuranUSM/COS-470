I was running, I was jumping but my body moved so slow
I was gazing at the pages that my mind could not decode
You said I'm better off alone
I don't call, just let it go

Loose teeth, what does it mean?
Eyes rising out of the cream
Blue, brown, green

In the middle of the day I am in my room alone
I don't have much to say but I've got places I could go
Free floating deaf and dumb and dull
Through a world I am not of

Loose teeth, what does it mean
Eyes rising out of the cream
Somethings I'll never believe
New baby riding with me, lost in a dream

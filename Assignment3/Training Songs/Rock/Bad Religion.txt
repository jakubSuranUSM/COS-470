Can you feel I'm not like you anymore
I can't see, I can't breathe
See you quiver like the dogs on the streets
Looking down on as I beat you
It's bad religion, from a broken nation
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it anymore
Who's to say I won't like you anyway
Take a deep breath, I'm alive
Can you feel me, I'm alive inside of you
Agony creeps up behind you
It's a bad religion, from a broken nation
It's a contradiction
And I can't take it any fucking way!
Can you feel it? I gotta live with it everyday
I can't take the pressure, I'm going insane
Now go away!

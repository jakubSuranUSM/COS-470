You think the birds are pretty 
And you sleep eight hours a night. 
And I'm fog, out of the city, 
And still you stake it all.
And trains stop for you and so do the boys, 
When you run your fingers through your hair.
But resistance is futile. 

And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.

Just breathe, and mouth "goodbye."
If you want, I'll give you eternal life.
Well, not so much life, 
But have you ever seen a good zombie movie?
Well, like that, but you'll be smarter 
And you'll stay twenty-three.

And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I just wanna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I just wanna drink your blood.

And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.
And I am gonna drink your blood.

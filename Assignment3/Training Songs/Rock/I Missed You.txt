Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Let me tell you about the way I roam
I call the road my home
So it makes the nights alone without you
Though I've travelled a million miles
You're the only thing that makes me smile
I think about my baby all the while I'm without you

So so so what I need to know know know
Is when I get home home home
Will you still be there

I've been around the way
Been around but not ok
Ah whoaaa
Cos I missed you so
I'm coming home
Just to let you know
That I missed you

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

The first time I met her
I started feeling better
So I thought I'd let her in
Now she's my everything
The reason why I sing
She turns my winter into spring
When I'm near her

So so so what I need to know know know
Is when I get home home home
Will you still be there

I've been around the way
Been around but not ok
Ah whoaaa
Cos I missed you so
I'm coming home
Just to let you know
That I missed you

Every croud I see you face
I keep looking just incase
It's all perfect but there's something outta place

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

So so so what I need to know know know
Is when I get home home home
Will you still be there

I've been around the way
Been around but not ok
Ah whoaaa
Cos I missed you so
I'm coming home
Just to let you know
That I missed you

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

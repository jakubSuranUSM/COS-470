Head full of time, heart full of lonely, night time comes to town
I'm all alone, wondering if you're around
Well, there's no way to explain it, I don't even understand why
But I know this time it's over, baby, my turn to cry
And I'm wondering
Love Love
Oh, where did you go
And I'm wondering
Love, Love
Yeah, where did you go
Well, I can't look at my face in the glass as I drown myself to sleep
While everyone else is out dancing in the street
Well there's no truth to the rumor I've been out running around
No, you will never find me hanging on the bad side of town
Leave me wondering 'bout
Love Love
Mmm, where did you go
I'm wondering
Love, Love
Where did you go
Ooh, so one more night I wait for sunrise, dry my weeping eyes
You know, since you're gone, can't find no one to sympathize
And there's no way to explain it, I don't even understand why
But I know it's over, baby, my turn to cry
And I'm wondering
Love Love
(Oh, love)
Oh, where did you go
(Where did you go)
I'm wondering
Love Love
(Oh, love)
Where did you go
I'm wondering
Love Love
Yeah, where did you go
(Where did you go, Where did you go, Where did you go)
Oh, I'm wondering
Love, Love
Mama, where did you go
(Where did you go, Where did you go)
You know I'm wondering
Love (Love)
Love (Love)
Where did you go
(Where did you go)

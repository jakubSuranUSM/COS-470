You're really something else
Made me forget myself
My lights came on
When i got to you
You were almost through
You're almost gone
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
The moon and the stars goes crashing round
Don't let it get you down
An angel walked amongst us
Tried but couldn't love us
Somethings wrong
Since you've gone you know
There's nothing and no one
To hang love on
So tell me how it feels
Tell me how it feels
To touch the flame
Tell me who i am
Tell me who i really am
What's my name
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
(when you're alone)
The moon and the stars goes crashing round
(when you're alone)
Don't let it get you down
God's above us and jesus loves us
If god's above us and jesus loves us
If god's above us
(if you want it, you can get it)
And jesus loves us
(if you want it, you can get it)
If god's above us
(if you want it, come on get it)
And jesus loves us
(right now)
If god's above us
(if you want it, you can get it)
And jesus loves us
(if you want it, you can get it)
If god's above us
(if you want it, come on get it)
And jesus loves us

Good morning, good afternoon
And what have you got to say?
Well, I'm waiting but I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day

There's a time to be talking
And there's a time when it's no use
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse

I've just gone solo
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo?

What a wonderful way to live
She's traveling all over the world
Why the flame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled

But no time for the gent with the Milliner Bentley
And heaven knows what else
Why he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil wells

She just went solo
Do you play solo
Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?

I've always lived in a Maison
On the other side of the moon
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune

I could tell you that the grass
Is really greener on the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will

We've all gone solo
We all play solo
Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?

Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?
Ain't life a solo?

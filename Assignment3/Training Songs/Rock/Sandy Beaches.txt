Now look here, honey, I got all this money
So let's me and you go down to Mexico
We'll find us a haystack, a little place we can lay back
A bottle of Red Wine, a whole lot of sunshine

And I'll be lovin' you, lovin' you
We'll do all the things those Latin lovers do

We got sandy beaches, we'll find someone to teach us
The way to a hideaway where can't nobody reach us
We'll find us a rainbow and chase it all day long
When the sun goes down and there's no one around

That'll be okay, we don't need them anyway

We can make believe that we are adrift on the sea
On a slow boat to China, baby, just you and me

We got sandy beaches, we'll find someone to teach us
The way to a hideaway where can't nobody reach us
There won't be no worry, won't be no hurry
'Cause we got plenty of time because love is blind

I'll be loving you, yeah, I'll be loving you, oh baby

That's all I wanna do, I just wanna make love to you, yeah
Sweet love to you, ooh baby
Girl, I want you to love me too, oh yeah yeah

Wake up baby 'cause I'm coming to you from the future.
Don't be surprised when I'm sitting at the foot of your bed.
I bring you a light you could never see in the daytime,
Planting the seed of my perfume in your head.

Well I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever.
And I've paid all the god damn dues that I want to pay.

Never let them hear you beg.
Never let them know.
Your pillow nest of a dripping god
Is a place you go alone.

But late at night I hear you cry.
Your taste for dirt just makes me smile.
My purple tablet turns to goo.
Have I got something warm for you.

Well I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever.
And I've paid all the god damn dues that I want to pay.
If I can't slip into the 13th house of your twilight, baby yeah.
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams.
I'll plant a bomb in your temple of your dreams yeah.

Wake up baby 'cause I'm coming to you from the future.
And don't be surprised when I'm floating above your bed.
I bring you a god you could never love in the daytime.
Nailing the seed of my perfume in your head.

Well I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever.
And I've paid all the god damn dues that I want to pay.
If I can't slip into the 13th house of your twilight, baby yeah.
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams.
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams.

Temple of your dreams.
Temple of your dreams.
Temple of your dreams.

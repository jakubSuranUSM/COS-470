Where have the flowers gone sun-children
Your shirts are loud and your hair is long
Now do you ever think we'll make it
Something more than a uniform

And we're almost there
We learn to love and we learn to give
And we earn the flowers in our hair

Where has the vision gone sun-children
Colors glow but your eyes are closed
I swear I still believe we'll make it
In your eyes I see your soul

And we're almost there
We learn to love and we learn to give
And we earn the flowers in our hair my friend
So take my hand
One day is always too far away

I wish we had the hearts of children
Their eyes are wide and their love is pure
But we only dare to say 'please love me'
At the seventh glass of wine

You need to get out of my sight
A lonely heart can beat
You're too dangerous
A lonely heart can bleed

I cannot stand it, to be enclosed and isolated
A lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated

You're too much
A lonely heart is weak
Too dependent
A broken heart will seek

You take the life out of me
No heart is broken forever
It's broken promises
But my faith is broken forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

A lonely heart will break
Pressure will make me forsake you
A lonely heart won't forsake me
As if we're both the same

Wounded and beaten but still not defeated
A lonely heart can be wounded and beaten but still not defeated

'Cause I won't let you in
So if it's all for real
Your weakness will be my strength
Your heart should be melting

You might be lonely
But I am not beloved and bounded forever
Because we're all the same
Beloved and bounded forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe
The power between us?

Oh, discord, see them fail, oh

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe in the power between us?
Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

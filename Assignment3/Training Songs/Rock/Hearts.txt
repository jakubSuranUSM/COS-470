Is everything alright?
I just called to say how, lost I feel,
Without you
Miles away, I really can't believe
I'm here and how I still care, about you

Hearts can break, and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry, when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything the same
Do you ever think of me and how we loved one another
Will you change your mind
Will you want me back again
Or have you found yourself a new lover

Hearts can break, and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry, when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything okay?
I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world how I miss you
'Cus each and every day
I think of all the words I never said
And all the chances that I had to

Hearts can break, and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry, when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be that way

Hearts can be
Is everything alright?

We're having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the D.J.
On the radio

The cokes are in the icebox
Popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby, yeah
We're out here on the floor, oh yeah

So, Mister Mister D.J.
Keep those records playing
'Coz I'm having
Such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging
Sally's doing that twist now
If you play requests now
I've got a few for you

Play that one called 'Soul twist'
Play that one called 'I know'
Don't forget them 'Mashed potatoes'
No other songs will do

If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered

Like why does she feel all dead on the inside
But as a child she remembers feeling alive
who was that man that made 
my mother cry all night
was that my father who was my father

If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered

The men that walked into her life
are no different than all the others
that promise the world and then they leave her
She says I should have known better,
I should have known better

Will she always feel so all alone
Why was there never a man in her home
and will I end up like my mother
by myself with no other
with no other

If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered

You're the analyst, 
The fungus in my milk, 
When you want no-one, 
And you got someone, 
Through the wind you crawl, 
And laugh at burning dunes, 
When no-one else will ever see 

Now that you know why you feel like you do 
They're turning their head 
Whilst they wait for no-one 
And finally I know why you feel like letting it go 

I'm watching you, watch over me 
And I've got the greatest view from here 

Mistakes don't mean a thing, 
If you don't regret them, 
So pack your tactic toes for the winter 
Chain a waterfall, 
To a burned and withered skin 
When no-one else will ever see 

I'm watching you, watch over me 
And I've got the greatest view from here 

Now that you know why you feel like you do 
They're turning their head 
Whilst they wait for no-one 
And finally I know why I feel like you're letting me go 

I'm Watching you, watch over me 
And I've got the greatest view from here

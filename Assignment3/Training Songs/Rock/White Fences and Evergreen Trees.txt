If I could paint pictures I'd paint one for you
A picture portraying the love we once knew
Then a tear would reveal the sorrow in me
As I painted white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater than the mountains or seas
But it's only as great as two hearts believe
Faith blew away in yesterdays breeze
And we lost our white fences and evergreen trees

I've walked through a valley and cried all night long
In search for the reason why true love goes wrong
With a prayer on my lips the earth touching my knees
I've prayed for white fences and evergreen trees
Love can be greater

[I wanna hear you beg!]
House of Shame.
Come on back {Welcome} to the House of Shame.
Blood's burning to play my game now.
Racks are roasting. Bitches are boasting.
With your blood they are toasting.
Humiliation is your dream.
We'll make you laugh then scream.
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'...
In my torture kitchen!
Pain - You can't take it another day.
But you ain't leaving you're here to stay.
A precious moment without the pain,
Breeds only longing in my {your} brain.
You will...I need...It's your fucking time to bleed.
You will obey everything I say.
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain.
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame.
Stay {Pain}...In a world with no autonomy.
Branded slave, racked and hanging, only function is pissing and hanging.
Forced entry breeds with a heart full of self confidence. (?)
But who's to blame for your desire;
Problem parents or porno flicks?
You will...I need...It's your fucking time to bleed.
You will obey everything I say.
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain.
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame.
Pain - You can't take it another day.
But you ain't leaving, you're here to stay.
{For a} precious moment without the pain,
Breeds only longing in my {your} brain.
In the House of Shame. (x3)
In the house of...
[lots of whispers that we can't make out]
You will...I need...It's your fucking time to bleed.
You will obey everything I say.
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain.
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame.
Pain - You can't take it another day.
But you ain't leaving, you're here to stay.
{For a} precious moment without the pain,
Breeds only longing in my {your} brain.
In the House of Shame. (x3)
In the house of...
Come on back to the House of Shame.
Your blood's burning to play our game now.
Racks are roasting, bitches are boasting.
With your blood they're toasting.
Humiliation is your dream.
I {We'll} make you laugh then scream.
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'...
In my torture kitchen!

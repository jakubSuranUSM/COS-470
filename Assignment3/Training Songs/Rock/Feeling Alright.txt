Seems I've got to have a change in scene
Every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it should have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
Someone's locked the door, she's took the key

Feelin alright?
I'm not feelin to good myself
Feelin alright I'm not feeling to good myself

Well, boy you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
And when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't wipe my face, I must keep dry
I gotta stop believin' in all your lies
Cause there's so much to do before I die

Feelin alright?
I'm not feelin to good myself
Feelin alright I'm not feeling to good myself

(Feelin' alright)Don't believe in all I say 
(I'm not feelin' to good myself)
Cause at that time I really felt that way
(Feelin' alright)But that was then and now it is today
(I'm not feelin' to good myself)
I can't get off so yet, I'm here to stay
(Feelin' alright)Till someone comes along and takes my place
(Feelin' alright)With a different name and yes a different place

Feelin alright?
I'm not feelin to good myself
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Feelin alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm not feeling to good myself
Good God, good God almighty I feel good
Feelin alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm not feeling to good myself
Feelin alright?
I'm not feelin to good myself
Feelin alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm not feeling to good myself

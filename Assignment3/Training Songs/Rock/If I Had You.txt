I wouldn't have the TV in the bedroom
I wouldn't have this tear drop in my eye 
I wouldn't need the radio to be my lullaby 
If I had you, if I had you

I wouldn't need the sun to light the morning 
(I would need no sunshine)
If I could have your love to light my night 
I'd never for a second keep our love from burnin' bright 
If I had you in my life

If I had you again
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
If I had you again
I'd never let the lovin' end
If I had you again
I'd show you baby you're the only one

So say that you believe in second chances
(You believe in love) 
And say you'll let me be with you tonight
(All through the night)
If you'll take my hand I'll show you 
just how love could be so right
If I had you ( If I had you)
If I had you 
(Here in my life)

If I had you again
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
If I had you again
I'd never let the lovin' end
If I had you again
I'd show you baby you're the only one

If you'll take my hand I'll show you 
just how love could be so right
(Ooooooooohhhh)
If I had you (If I had you)
If I had you 
(Back in my life)

If I had you again
(If I had you, I wouldn't be blue)
I wouldn't be the fool I've been
(I wouldn't be the fool yeah)
If I had you again
I'd never let the lovin' end
(I'd never be a fool)
If I had you again
(If I had you, I would be true)
I'd never let this moment dissappear
(If I had you, I wouldn't be blue)

If I had you in my life.

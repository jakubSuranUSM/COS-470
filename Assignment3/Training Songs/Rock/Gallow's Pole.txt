Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while, 
Think I see my friends comin', 
Ridin many a mile. 

A-friends, did you get some silver? 
Did you get a little gold? 
What did you bring me, my dear friends, 
Keep me from the Gallows Pole? 
What did you bring me 
Keep me from the Gallows Pole? 

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold, 
You know that we're too damn poor 
To keep you from the Gallows Pole. 

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while, 
I think I see my brother comin', 
Ridin many a mile. 

Mm-brother, did you get me some silver? 
Ah, dya get a little gold? 
A-what did you bring me, my brother, 
Keep me from the Gallows Pole? 

Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah, 
I brought a little gold, 
I brought a little of ev'ry thing 
To keep you from the Gallows Pole. 
Yes, I brought you 
To keep you from the Gallows Pole. 

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile, 
I think I see my sister coming, 
Ridin' many a mile, mile, mile, mile. 
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand, 
Take him to some shady bower, 
Save me from the wrath of this man, 
Please take him, 
Save me from the wrath of this mad-man. 

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile, 
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride, 
Ride for many a mile, mile, mile. 

Oh, yes, you got a fine sister, 
She warmed my blood from cold, 
She warmed my blood to boiling hot 
To keep you from the Gallows Pole, 
Pole, pole, pole, yeah yeah. 

'brother brought me silver, 
And your sister warmed my soul, 
But now I laugh and pull so hard 
And see you swinging on my Gallows Pole, yeah. -

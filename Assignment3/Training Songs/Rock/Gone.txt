broken moments in time couls till shine 
             but they're getting old 
             if you could see the world with my eyes 
             you'd be so surprised at what you'd know 

             so, if you see my angel of light 
             with her sweet wine 
             could you let me know 
             because i think she's gone again 

             fatal are these moments of trust 
             that pleases us and who would know 
             helped here by the passions of life 
             now strife won't let me go 

             so, if you see my angel of light 
             with her sweet wine 
             i thik she needs to know 
             that i've gone again 
             i've really gone again 
             i think i'm gone again 

             so lonely

I've been watching you,
For such a long time.
I can't lose your memory, baby, 
You're always on my mind.
Tearin' my day, baby. Weekends too.
I just can't lose your memory, baby, 
Everywhere I look I see you.

You got spirit. Spirit, baby.
You got, you got spirit. Spirit, baby.
Come on, come on, come on, spirit. Spirit, baby.
Give it up, give it up, give it up. Yea, yea. 
Spirit, but I ain't got you. I ain't got you.
Blow your horn, blow your horn, baby.
Blow your horn, baby. Blow, blow.

Ooh your spirit is taunting me, baby.
Ooh your spirit is haunting me, baby. Yea.
I can't get you, baby, out of my mind (out of my mind).
Ooh I can't get you, baby, yea 
Out of my mind. I swear,
I'm goin' crazy, yes I am. 
I swear I'm goin' crazy, for you.
You got what I need so bad, 
You got what I need so bad.

Everywhere I go, baby, all I see is you
Staring back at me. 
Spirit, spirit baby.
Spirit, spirit baby.
Give it up, give it up, give it up. Yea, yea.
Spirit, spirit baby.
Come on, come on, come on.
Spirit I ain't got you.
I wish that I
If only I, if only I, if only I, if only I,
If I had you, baby, I'd have the world tied in the palm of my hand.
Ooh in the palm of my hand, I'd have the world in the palm of my hand
If only I had you, if only I, If only I.
Maybe you don't know, baby. Maybe you don't know, baby,
But you know that love is, love is everywhere, yes it is.
Love is, love is everywhere, love is everywhere, love is, love is, love is

You lick your fingers 
I'll wipe up the bottles that spilled
I'll just get drunk and you just keep pop-popping your pills

I've got my head in my hands and it's doomsday over nothing
Keep your head up, keep your head up, keep your head up

I'll lay you down in the Florida sunshine if you promise that you will
I gladly gave you something for nothing 
But then you moved in for the kill
Cause you are crazier than me 
Crazier than me 
And I'm crazy for you

You keep on spending 
I'll just keep on paying you bills
I've had enough and just ca-ca-can't get your fill

I've got my head in my hands and it's doomsday over nothing
Keep your head up, keep your head up, keep your head up

I'll lay you down in the Florida sunshine if you promise that you will
I gladly gave you something for nothing 
But then you moved in for the kill
Cause you are crazier than me
Crazier than me
And I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

I'll lay you down in the Florida sunshine if you promise that you will
I gladly gave you something for nothing 
But then you moved in for the kill
I'll lay you down in the Florida sunshine if you promise that you will
I gladly gave you something for nothing 
But then you moved in for the kill
Cause you are crazier than me
Crazier than me
And I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

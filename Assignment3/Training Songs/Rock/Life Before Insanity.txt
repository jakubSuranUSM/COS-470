All I see are faces, a sea of faces
Surrounded by the memory of life before insanity
Hard to explain the hunger, if you don't feel it
What I really need is your breath raining on my skin

And I'm so tired, tired of feeling sorry for myself
And I want more

All I feel are clouds, surrounded by clouds
Yesterday's anger is the sadness of today
Our lives were filled with summer and laughter
Now are smiles are grey 
Once I held you close, now my thoughts just drift like the wind

Can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it 
Coming down

And I'm so tired, tired of feeling sorry for myself
And I want more, got me wanting more
Night keep falling, and the wind keep calling my name

All I see are faces, a sea of faces
Surrounded by the memory of life before insanity
Hard to explain the hunger, if you don't feel it
What I really need is your breath raining on my skin

Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
When you were mine
Since you went away
My heart's not free
It keeps raining down on me
Will there be a day
When the sun will shine

I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

When I hear your name
I start to cry, each day's the same since your goodbye
It's like a game, forgetting you

Every night I pray
Tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things
Just like the way it used to be for you and me
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountain again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
When you were mine
Since you went away
Since you went away
My heart's not free
It keeps on raining down on me
Will there be a day when the sun will shine

I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
Sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

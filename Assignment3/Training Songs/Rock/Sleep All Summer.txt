Weary sun, sleep tonight, go crashing into the ocean
Cut the line that ties the tide and moon, ancient and blue
We take our empty hearts and fill them up with broken things
To hang on humming wire like cheap lamps down a dead end street
Close your weary eyes until the wintertime
And every time we turn away it hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you but, babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Give the ocean what I took from you so one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we used each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
So why won't you fall back in love with me?

Combing over Broken Cross I held on you
Haunted by the ghost of something new

Curtains fall, fashions fade, an endless summer over
Another tide to launch an autumn moon over the dunes
There must be a better way to pull a whole apart
To keep a world from caving in
Another way to while away from you, frozen and blue
Close your weary eyes until the wintertime
But every time we turn away it surges like a tidal wave
I would change but, babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Give the ocean what I took from you so one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange way we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

Why won't you fall back in love with me? [Repeat x3]

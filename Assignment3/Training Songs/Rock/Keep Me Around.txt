There's so little love left in my heart for anyone
I'm like an ant on your map
You can see me going down the drain 

Will you keep me around 
I've got nothing to hold on to
The sound the air makes as I fall
Is like a laugh that was torn
From way nothing was before
From when things just seemed the same
How did I get so far down 

Will you keep me around 
If you don't want me, why don't you say
Why don't you tell me 
I've been cut off for so long from anyone
My face is like a broken map and I can't go anywhere 

Will you keep me around

Oh baby babe ...
Oh come back baby, I wanna make
You told me that you loved me
And always would be true
But now you've gone and left me
And made me oh so blue
Love to you
Babe

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come back a-baby come
Oh come back a-baby come
Oh come back baby, I wanna make love to you
Oh baby, babe ...
Oh come back baby, I want you to love me too

If I was you little baby
I'd go and have my face
I'd like to see you find a man
You think will take my place

[Chorus]

Now you may think I'm jealous
Of eveyone in town
But when it comes to lovin'
You're the sweetest thing around

[Chorus]

Oh baby babe

Waiting there, a [?] before a darkness fell
I'm lost, but not alone
And all my words have turned to stone again
Take me with you when you carry me away
And I will throw all of these words I have to say

But you're still the storm cloud, but I love you just the same
But you're out killing shadows with your shade

And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you

Trouble and I, a long lost kind
Statue of 100 blinking lights
Well, I built this wall around so no one else could hurt you
But now I'll trade you truth for truth

But you're still the storm cloud, but I love you just the same

And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two

You say reverie came over me
Like fire, like blood, like sunlight
You say reverie came over me
Like fire, like blood, like sunlight

And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you
And I broke my heart in two
One for me and one for you

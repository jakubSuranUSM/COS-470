I know what you feel
I know what you love
I see through your eyes
They shine like suicide
I know that you hurt
1,000 Reasons to implode

With all your suffering
You've been so far from yourself
So someone else
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness can kill
It's a killer

See you in the sky
I've seen you on the moon
Now the color of your rainbow
It's disappeared
We're all see through
I feel you falling
It's like there's nothing I can do

With all your suffering
You've been so far from yourself
So someone else
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness can kill
It's a killer
It's a killer
This loneliness can kill

Within you
We can find a way within you
Without you
Empty feelings without you
I don't want to bring you down
I don't want to bring you down
I don't want to bring you down

You've been so far from yourself
So someone else
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness is a killer
This loneliness can kill
It's a killer
It's a killer
This loneliness can kill
It's a killer
Killer
Killer

Outside in the hall there's a cat fight
It's well after midnight
I guess I'll be alright
I'm laid out on the floor
Drunk and poor
How much longer how much more

Rock me to sleep
Strong & deep.
The screaming cats they give me the creep
But aside from all that I feel no pain
Staring up at the ceiling stains
Neon in the window
Sirens far away
News on the radio happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday

They're at it again next door
This whole floor I swear
They're out to drive me crazy
Not right now I'm high as a cloud I'm soft and gray and lazy
Neon in the window
Sirens far away
News on the radio happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday

Fly me
Out the window.
Somewhere far away
Singing on the radio

Radiate simply, the candle is burning, so low for me 
Generate me limply, can't seem to place your name, cherie 
To rearrange all these thoughts in a moment is suicide 
Come to a strange place, we'll talk over old times we never smile 

Somebody called me Sebastian 
Somebody called me Sebastian 
Work out a rhyme, toss me the time, lay me, you're mine 
And we all know, oh yeah! 

Your Persian eyes sparkle; your lips, ruby blue, never speak a sound 
And you, oh so gay, with Parisian demands, you can run-around 
And your view of society screws up my mind like you'll never know 
Lead me away, come inside, see my mind in kaleidoscope 

Somebody called me Sebastian 
Somebody called me Sebastian 
Mangle my mind, love me sublime, do it in style, 
So we all know, oh yeah! 

You're not gonna run, babe, we only just begun, babe, to compromise 
Slagged in a Bowery saloon, love's a story we'll serialize 
Pale angel face; green eye-shadow, the glitter is outasight 
No courtesan could begin to decipher your beam of light 

Somebody called me Sebastian 
Somebody called me Sebastian 
Dance on my heart, laugh, swoop and dart, la-di-di-da, 
Now we all know you, yeah!

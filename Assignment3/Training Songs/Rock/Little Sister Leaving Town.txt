As always I stop to speak
Some girls like to say their piece
As always I turn to you
Don't understand what you're doing
And

Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found 
Little sister leaving town

Says the poet "I won't grass"
Some things are better left and not taken to task
I guess I knew she was a Rose
She knows what hurts and how to hold

If your daddy he turned round
Let the grass around him scream the sound
I'm so sorry for these tales you're telling
Sometimes you can't account

Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found 
Little sister leaving town

And sometimes it's absurd
A minor triumph when you hear the words
"I'm just trying to stake my place
No real fears upon this face"

And my wishes
Nobody says
All the signs when I cross the days
I'm just holding back for you
Sometimes that helps too

Light up this town
Grow weary and back down
It's such an amazing sight
To be found 
Little sister leaving town

Little darlin', do you want me to sing you a song
Or little darlin' do you want me to leave you alone
You got your head in your hands and I don't know why

Is that your dirty heart
Is that your dirty heart

The sky's turning little darling, a storm's on the way
Nobody's gonna hear you cry at the end of the day
The rains are comin to wash down the filth and the grime

Off the dirty hearts, off the dirty

So little darlin', do you want me to sing you a song
Do you want me to sing you a song 
Do you want me to sing you a song
Do you want me to sing you a song

I fell straight
Into your arms
Like a drunk
Who’s been on it
All morning
And the sun’s up
And my head’s fucked
And immediately I grabbed you
You go all red
Like the first time
I love it when you do that
Gotta love it when you do that

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You’d stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends all hate it!

But f*ck it if they talk
F*ck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

Our cocoon
Run your shoulders
When you’re half cut
And you’re frozen
And you’ve got that visible grieving
You’re depending on me again

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You’d stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends all hate it!

But f*ck it if they talk
F*ck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

F*ck it if they talk
F*ck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

And if you wanna track down and pose as positive
Hide smoking from relatives
Rest on me
Honey, that’s all right!
And if you wanna act more drunk than usual
To help you get away with more than
Rest on me
Honey, that’s alright!
Honey, that’s alright!

Our cocoon
Round your shoulders
And I’m good
Yeah, that's good

F*ck it if they talk
F*ck it if they try and get to us
'Cause I'd rather go blind
Than let you down

I remember when we
Swapped names and I thought maybe
You’d stay and try to out-drink me
Your friends all hate it!

If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold

We got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me
We got it all sewn up

Take my hand, lead me
Feed my heart with your love
Take my mind, believe me
Nothin' you could ever do could deceive me

Don't you know we got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me
We got it all sewn up

Right or wrong, we're together
It feels like it's workin' out long
We can go on forever
Every day is feeling so much better

Don't you know we got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me
We got it all sewn up
   
We don't depend on nuthin' to get by
What we do we see eye to eye
We live for the day our love we survive
And I'm gonna to both till the day that we die

We got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me 

We got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me 

We got it all sewn up
Takin' it easy
We got it all worked out
Don't have to please me

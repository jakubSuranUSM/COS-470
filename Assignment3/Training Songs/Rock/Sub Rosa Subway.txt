Back in 1870
Just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind machine
His wind machine
New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth
As Alfie blew underground
Blew underground, he blew underground

Ah, all aboard Sub Rosa Subway
Had you wondered
Who's been digging under Broadway
It's Alfred
Poor Al, oh no, Al
As for America's first subway
The public scoffed
"It's far too crude"
One station filled with Victoria's Age
From frescoed walls
And goldfish fountains
To Brahmsian tunes

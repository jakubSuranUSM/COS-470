Starry eyes
How can I get to you
My true little
Starry eyes
What can I say or do
For you my little
Starry eyes, starry eyes
Forever shall be mine

Starry eyes
What Can I say
To make you listen
Starry eyes
What can I do
For your attention
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

When I'm alone
I hear and feel you
I wish that I could reach right out and touch you
But knowing you're the one
To greet me and meet me
Two alone in the dark
May it be

Starry eyes
Stars will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen
That I'm here being
For you starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

When I'm alone
I hear and feel you
I wish that I could reach right out and touch you
But knowing you're the one
To greet me and meet me
Two alone in the dark
May it be

Starry eyes
How can I get to you
My true little
Starry eyes
What can I say or do for you my little
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever shall be mine

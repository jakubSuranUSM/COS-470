I was born a poor man's son, and followin' tradition
When I came of age I hit the road, and followed blind ambition
I served my time and payed my dues, now I'm sittin' pretty
Sleeping in a feather bed high above this city.
It's four in the morning, and I'm sittin' here still thinking
Our love's on the borderline, I know this ship is sinking
I still remember when we talked about the Southern Cross a long time ago
Look through my window and I watch the cold rain fallin'
Somewhere in the distance I can hear a siren callin'
Is this a wilderness or just another station on the Rock Island Line?
When I first came to this town with sweet anticipation
My days were filled with music, and my nights with conversation
I didn't worry, didn't care which way the wind was blowin'
Yes there was magic in the air, and music kept on flowin'.
I was a superman ridin' on a river
She always wanted so much more than I could give her
I still remember everytime we said goodbye when I was back on the road
I was a rhythm man, now I'm a local hero
I still remember when my luck was down to zero
Right now I sit and wonder why nobody ever comes to knock on my door.
Now life is bitter, life is sweet, life is what you make it
Your love makes my life complete, and I just can't forsake it
The time has come to travel on, yes now the days I'm countin'
We're goin' back to where we come from, gonna live on some old mountain.
It's four in the morning, and I'm sittin' here still thinking
Our love's on the borderline, I know the ship is sinking
I still remember when we talked about the Southern Cross a long time ago
I was a rhythm man, now I'm a local hero
I still remember when my luck was down to zero
Is this a wilderness or just another station on the Rock Island Line?

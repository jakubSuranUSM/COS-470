I sleep to dream away
Stuck inside a dream
I feel a breeze blowing through my mind
I hear her calling me
She lays all in ruins
And suffocates everything I love

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight

I'm sliding into her sin
The pain is cast aside
I think it's time to leave it all behind
I'm in a ring of fire
All I had is gone
Forever lost
Oh please set me free

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight

I'm losing faith in who I am, so:

I pray someday the sun will shine on me
I dance throughout the night in pale moonlight

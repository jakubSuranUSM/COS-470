Love can make a fool of you 
You do anything it wants you to 
Love can make you feel so good when it goes like you think it should 
Or it can make you cry at night when your baby donâ??t treat you right 

When youâ??re feeling sad and blue 
You know loveâ??s made a fool of you 

You know love makes fools of men 
But you donâ??t care, youâ??re gonna try again 

Time goes by, itâ??s a-passinâ?? fast you think true love has come at last 
But by and by youâ??re gonna find crazy love has made you blind 

When youâ??re feeling sad and blue 
You know loveâ??s made a fool of you

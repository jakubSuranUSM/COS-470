Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh

We were born in the desert
We were reared in a cave
We conquered in the sun
but we lived in the shade
Yeah baby we were savage
we existed to kill
Our history is damaged
at least it was a thrill
But now we can see!
Now that our vision is strong
we don't have to admit we were wrong
Now we can see
but the images donÃ¢??t stick
Our enemies lay dead on the ground
and still we kick

Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh

Now we can see
The warnings and the signs
Reading between the lines
like writing on the wall
Now we can see
What do we need
We should need nothing
Nothing at all
Yeah!

We were born on an island
we grew out of the sand
Never saw another creature
never knew another man
Yeah baby we were nothing
we existed for less
Our present was empty
our history a mess
But now we can see
Now we do as we please
Now we do away with our disease
Now we can see
Now the image sticks
We still need the medicine quick
We still take the pill

Now we can see
The warnings and the signs
Reading between the lines
like writing on the wall
Now we can see
What do we need
We should need nothing
Nothing at all

Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh

Yeah now we can see

You're not a politician,
And without a thought you would build a fort, defend what you are.
You're not religious and without Catholicism
You would turn to God to save your soul.

And all I can do is try my best for you,
With all my indecision.
And all I can do is try my best for you,
We can live with indecision.

You're not superstitious
And without charm you would touch wood if you thought it'd do good.
You're not the sporting type but without gripe
You would bet your life if you thought you were right.

And all I can do is try my best for you,
With all my indecision.
And all I can do is try my best for you,
We can live with indecision.

And all we can do is try our best for you,
Even with all our indecision.
And all that we can do is try our best for you,
I can live with indecision.
And all I can do is try my best for you,
We can live with indecision.

We all need an attitude.

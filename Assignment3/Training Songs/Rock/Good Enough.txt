I've got an aching in my bones 
I've been exposed to what I want to see 
The fuse is burning somewhere; it's drenched in heat 
it's where I long to be 

There's always two sides you don't have to suffer 
If this is heaven then send me to hell 
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize 
Hey, there goes the bell 

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

Sing a song as the sun does rise 
if you don't ask questions and you don't know what 
There's a bridge to the other side 
don't take your eyes from the prize 

There's always two sides you don't have to suffer 
If this is heaven then send me to hell 
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize 
Hey, there goes the bell 

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

There's always two sides you don't have to suffer 
If this is heaven then send me to hell 
So stay in the light, don't take your eyes from the prize 
Hey, there goes the bell 

You'd like me to buy mind, 
The situation may never find

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me 
It's good enough for two, it's what I want to see 

(good enough)

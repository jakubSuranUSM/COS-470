I work so hard just to get along
Before I know it, all the money's gone
I do my best just to make headway
And save some money for a rainy day

If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks, I said
If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk, talk about it
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk

I find it rough just to pay the rent
Before I know it all the money's spent
I work hard and toe the line
And learn to take one day at a time

If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks, I said
If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk, talk about it
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, let's talk

We pay our taxes just like they say
And man it hurts to give the money away
A penny saved, a penny earned
You do your best, and you still get burned

If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks, I said
If money talks, it's not talkin' to me, if money talks
I work so hard, just like you (just like you)
But someday things'll change
If money can talk, this is it
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk, talk about it
If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk

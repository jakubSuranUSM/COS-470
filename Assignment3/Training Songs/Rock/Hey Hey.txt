Oh no (uh uh uh oh no)

You think 
You can play mind games
On me
Tommy doesn't know
Will wants me
While you do your thang
I'm playin' house wife
While you're off the chain
And I told you 
Straight from the jump
No commitment
But that's what you wanted
Now you 
Do what you want to
Hear you get around
While you hold me down

Guys think they can see through you
Do anything that they want to do
I tell you one thing is true
I can do much better than you

Hey hey hey hey
You got's to be on your way
You're playin' games I don't play
If you want to stay with me
Drop them hoes tell me
What you're gonna do

Hey hey hey hey
You got's to be on your way
You're playin' games I don't play
If you want to stay with me
Drop them hoes tell me
What you're gonna do

They say a playa get played
I'm not with that (woo)
I hate to play the game
Of get back
I'm better than that 
Though you messed around
With half the town
You know
I ain't no hoe
But fa'sho'
I'm letting you go
You act like 
You got it wrapped tight
Yeah you're wastin' time
So I'm goin' for mine

Guys think they can see through you
Do anything that they want to do
I tell you one thing is true
I can do much better than you

Hey hey hey hey
You got's to be on your way
You're playin' games I don't play
If you want to stay with me
Drop them hoes tell me
What you're gonna do

You keep tryin' 
But you keep lyin'
Expecting for me
To keep cryin'
You keep callin'
And you keep stalkin'
Keep on talkin'
While you keep walkin'
You keep tryin'
But you keep lyin'
Expecting for me
To keep cryin'
You keep callin'
And you keep stalkin'
Keep on talkin'
While you keep walkin'

Hey hey hey hey
You got's to be on your way
You're playin' games I don't play
If you want to stay with me
Drop them hoes tell me
What you're gonna do

Oh no!

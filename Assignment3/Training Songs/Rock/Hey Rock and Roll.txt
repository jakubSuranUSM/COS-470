And you
Kids
Get on your feet now
And get ready and it's rock and roll
Showaddywaddy

Standing on the corner in my new blue jeans
Dreamin' 'bout the girl in my limousine
Everybody's talking 'bout the world's greatest rock 'n roll band.
News-boy on the corner says:

Hold on kid
What's the use of dreaming
'Bout a rich guy's greed?
Get yourself aboppin' with the world's greatest rock 'n roll band.

Hey rock and roll
Bring it to town
Let's stroll
Hey rock and roll

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go.
Hey rock and roll...

Rockin' to the band in a rocket-machine
Susie hand-jive
She's a rock and roll queen
Johnny sings a love-song
He sings it right from a-ha a-ha a-ha
Whenever Mickey's dancing with the girl in blue
Over to the band and a song for you
Everybody's shouting to th;! world's greatest rock 'n roll band.

Hey rock and roll...

Shirley, Shirley I love you so 
I'm never gonna let you go 
Shirley where you going tonight? 
Shirley, Shirley will you be my girl? 
I'll take you all around the world 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 

Oh Shirley 
Shirley I'd buy you anything 
Would you like a diamond ring? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 

I called Shirley's mama on the phone 
She said Shirley's not at home 
She said my little girl won't be back soon 
She's gone on her honeymoon 

Oh Shirley, Shirley you've done me wrong 
That's why I sing this song 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 

Ah

I called Shirley's mama on the phone 
She said Shirley's not at home 
She said my little girl won't be back soon 
She's gone on a honeymoon 

Oh Shirley, Shirley you've done me wrong 
That's why I sing this song 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 

Oh Shirley, Shirley I love you so 
I'm never gonna let you go 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you goin'? 
Shirley, where you going tonight? 
Shirley, where you going tonight?

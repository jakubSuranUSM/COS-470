There's these feelings that implode
Pulling me apart, out of control
As I fall into despair
Fever

Fever

I shoot the devil by the hand
Stole the whiskey from the mouth of a broken man
From the ruins through a town
From the ashes grew a forest across the land

Give us soul, give us love
Give us freedom, give us peace
Hallelujah, sing it back to me
If you believe

There's these feelings that implode
Pulling me apart, out of control
As I fall into despair
Fever

There's still thoughts I receive
And a voice that carries wisdom in the breeze
As I look to the west
A neon sign is glowing through the trees

Give us soul, give us love
Give us freedom, give us peace
Hallelujah, sing it back to me
If you believe

There's these feelings that implode
Pulling me apart, out of control
As I fall into despair
Fever

There's a reason I must go
To replace my shadows, got my soul
As I fall into despair
Fever

How could I forget
Why would I forget
Think of the alibis
So much for sacrifice

How could I forget
Why would I forget
Caught in the eye of a hurricane

Shoot the devil by the hand
Shoot the devil by the hand
Shoot the devil by the hand

I shoot the devil
By the hand
Stole the whiskey from the mouth of a broken man

Fever
Fever

There's these feelings that implode (fever)
Pulling me apart, out of control (fever)
As I fall into despair (fever)
Fever

There's a reason I must go (fever)
To replace my shadows, got my soul (fever)
As I fall into despair (fever)
Fever

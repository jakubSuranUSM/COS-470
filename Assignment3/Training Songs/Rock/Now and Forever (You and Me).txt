Up until now I've learned to live without love
Like a ship without a sail, wandering aimlessly lost
I never knew how it felt to lose my control
Now that I've found you, this is all so new

You and me, we've got a destiny
Starting tonight we'll be together
You and me, this is what love should be
And it's gonna be right, now and forever
Darlin', inside your eyes I can see mysteries there
And you're melting the ice surrounding me, I'm no longer scared
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captured tonight

But don't let go, this is paradise
You and me, we've got a destiny
Starting tonight we'll be together
You and me, this is what love should be
And it's gonna be right, if you tell me
There's a heaven up above, then that's what I'll believe
'cause you're the one thing that I'm so sure of
I feel you inside my soul and I'm captive tonight

But don't let go, this is paradise
You and me, we've got a destiny
Starting tonight we'll be together
You and me, this is what love should be
And it's gonna be right, now and forever

You and me, we've got a destiny
Starting tonight we'll be together
You and me, this is what love should be
And it's gonna be right
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

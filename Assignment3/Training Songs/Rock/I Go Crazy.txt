I go crazy

I go crazy when I'm without you

What have I done today
Just sat and watched the jets fly over
A car goes by
And the sun goes down
We talk about the town

This city's mad in the head
And sick in the soul
All the stars flew away a long time ago
Isn't that nice
Like Miami Vice

I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

Well your life is like an infants dream
It's like everything's on TV
You see your face in the mirror
Could it be your place in the mirror
And so we turn on the TV one more time
And we see that everything is fine

But what have I done today
I go crazy
What have I done today
I go crazy when I'm without you

I go crazy
I go crazy
I I I go crazy when I'm without you
Go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you

What have I done today

What have I done today

Sue-Ellen looks so upset
This isn't the first time
And it won't be the last
Things going on behind her back
Oh they give you a heart attack

I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you
But what have I done today
I go crazy

I go crazy
I go crazy
I go crazy

But what have I done today
I go crazy
But what have I done today
I go crazy when I'm without you

I go crazy

I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you
But what have I done today
I go crazy

I go crazy
I go crazy
I go crazy

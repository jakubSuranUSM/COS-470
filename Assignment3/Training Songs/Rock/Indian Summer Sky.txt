In the ocean, could swim, dig the sky
Like there, I don't know why
In the forest, there's a clearing, I
Run there towards the light
Sky
It's a blue sky

In the earth, a hole, dig deep, decide
If I could, I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way
The spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade
On this, the longest day

So wind, blow through to my heart
So wind, blow through my soul
So wind, blow through to my heart
So wind, blow through my soul
So wind, blow through to my heart (so wind blow through my soul)

You give yourself to this, the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away
Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees will light a way for I
Will light a way
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky

To lose along the way
The spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade
On this, the longest day

So wind, go through to my heart
So wind, blow through my soul
So wind, go through to my heart
So wind, blow through my soul
So wind, go through to my heart
So wind, blow through my soul
So wind, go through to my heart (wind blow through my soul)

You give yourself to this, the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away

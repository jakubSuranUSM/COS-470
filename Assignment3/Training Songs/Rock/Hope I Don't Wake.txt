Hope I don't wake in the morning 
Find you running right away 
Every hour I'm down and worried 
Dream about it night and day 

To many places you can go 
When drowning in your sleep 
But no one wants to lie awake 
For hours counting sheep 

I'm fine what about you 
OK tell me the news 
We all know how to fight 
When there's something to lose 
In my mind I feel elation - oh, oh oh 

Hope I don't wake in the morning 
Find you running right away 
Every hour I'm down and worried 
Dream about it night and day 

For many days I know you'll go 
Surrounded by four walls 
By yourself you'll stay inside 
Behind your own front door 

I'm fine what about you 
OK tell me the news 
We all know how to fight 
When there's something to lose 
In my mind I feel elation - oh, ooh ooh 

Hope I don't wake in the morning 
Find you running right away 
Every hour I'm down and worried 
Dream about it night and day 

Well I need to be on my way 
Hope to get through another day 
Well you know what shape I'm in 
And it seems I can never win 

Oh oh 
Hope I don't wake in the morning 
Find you running right away 
Every hour I'm down and worried 
Dream about it night and day

You don't believe that this whole universe
Could be inside your little sister's purse
You don't believe you're just a living glob
Like Lucy, Freddy, Ricky, Frank, and Bob

We're life in the bloodstream, baby
That's the natural progression
We're life in the bloodstream
I hope the little boy don't fall and skin his knee

Ain't it hard when you discover
Your energy has to leave you for another
Don't it make you wanna lay down and cry
When they tell you it's time you have to die

We're life in the bloodstream, baby
That's the natural progression
We're life in the bloodstream
I hope the little boy don't fall and skin his knee

We're life in the bloodstream, baby
That's the natural progression
We're life in the bloodstream
I hope the little boy don't fall and skin his knee

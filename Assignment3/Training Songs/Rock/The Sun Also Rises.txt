Take a look into tomorrow
When everything is gray
Borrow from tomorrow
And you will find your way

[Chorus]
When you're standing in the middle of the road
Going nowhere (going nowhere)
And it's raining (and it's raining)
Going nowhere (going nowhere)
And it's raining (and it's raining)
Going nowhere

The sun also rises
The dark will go away
The sun also rises
As night walks into day

[Chorus]

The sun also rises
The dark will go away
The sun also rises
As night walks into day

You know the sun also rises
The dark will go away
The sun also rises
As night walks into day

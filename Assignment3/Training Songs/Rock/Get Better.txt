His silence speaks volumes, his silence speaks volumes. 

Won't you, and won't you, 
won't you, and won't you, 
won't you, and won't you, get better. 

His President's fireside chat, his president's fireside chat. 

His thinking knows no bounds, his thinking knows no bounds. 

won't you, and won't you, 
won't you, and won't you, 
won't you, and won't you, take him away. 

Hold me, and get better, hold me, and get better. 

We'll all be smiling then, we'll all be smiling then. 

Won't you be smiling then, won't you be smiling then.

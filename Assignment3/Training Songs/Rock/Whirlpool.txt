There was a swirling mass of water
That lived in a quiet pond
It asked permission from its master
To visit the lands beyond

And its master allowed it to fly
So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky

The whirlpool's mother wore a jacket
She'd sewn out of dental floss
It was stolen by a monkey
That sold it to an albatross

And it had the idea to fly
So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky

There was a swirling mass of water
That lived in a quiet pond
It asked permission from its master
To visit the lands beyond

And its master allowed it to fly
So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky
And it had the idea to fly
So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky

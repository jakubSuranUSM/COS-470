I pulled in to Nazareth
I was feeling bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where can I find a bed
He just grinned, shook my hand
No, was all he said

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw old Carmen and the devil walking side by side
Well, I said, hey, Carmen
Come on, let's go downtown
She said, I got to go
But my friend can stick around

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me

Go down, Miss Moses
There's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke is
Waiting on the judgement day
Well, Luke, my friend
What about young Anna Lee
He said, do me a favor, hun
Won't you stay and, keep Anna Lee company

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me

I get your cannonball now
To take me down the line
And my bag is sinking low
And I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny
You know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me

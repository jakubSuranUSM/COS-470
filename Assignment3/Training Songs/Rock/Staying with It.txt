This is it, this is what I've waited for so long
Startin' now, gotta trust these feelings comin' on
Take a chance even though I feel like I should run

Stayin' with it, let my heart take me there
Got a feelin', ooh, I'm goin' somewhere
I'm deep in it and I really do care
Wait a minute now, boy don't walk out now

I can see, I can see your disbelievin' eyes
Don't you know holdin' back your love is so unwise?
Take a chance, ain't it time you took a lover's stand?

Stayin' with it, let my heart take me there
Got a feelin', ooh, I'm goin' somewhere
Deep in it and I really do care
Wait a minute now

Stayin' with it, let my heart take me there
Got a feelin', ooh, I'm goin' somewhere
Deep in it and I really do care
Wait a minute now, baby and don't walk out now

Stayin' with it, let my heart take me there
Got a feelin', ooh, I'm goin' somewhere
Deep in it and I really do care
Wait a minute now, baby, don't walk out

Stayin' with it, ooh, stayin' with it
Stayin' with it, ooh, yeah
Stayin' with it, don't hold back
'Cause you gotta take a chance on me

Stayin' with it, ooh, staying with it
Stayin' with it, ooh, yeah
Stayin' with it, don't hold back
Cause you gotta take a chance on me

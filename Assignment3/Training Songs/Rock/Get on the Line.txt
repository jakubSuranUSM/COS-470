We started something gonna get together
Every man and woman, boy and girl
Loving one another, all sisters and the brothers
Loving one another, 'round the world

[Chorus]
Get on the line
Get on the line for love, hey
Get on the line
Get on the line for love, hey

The sun is rising on a brand new morning
Got to tell the people everywhere
Got to pass it on, before all hope is gone
Let the man go by he didn't care

[Chorus]

Can't you see what's happening, open up your mind
Reach out your hands to your brothers and sisters
All you're gonna be left behind it and you know

[Chorus]

We started something gonna get together
Every man and woman, boy and girl
Loving one another, all sisters and the brothers
Loving one another, 'round the world.

Come on, get on the line
Get on the line for love, no, no, no
Get on the line
Get on the line for love
Get on the line
Get on the line for love
Clap your hands
Come on, come on

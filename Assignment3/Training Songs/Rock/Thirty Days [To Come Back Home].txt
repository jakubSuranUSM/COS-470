I'm gonna give you thirty days to get back home
I done call up to the gypsy woman on the telephone
She gonna send out a world wide hoodoo
That'll be the very thing that'll suit you
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days

Oh thirty days (thirty days!)
Oh thirty days (thirty days!)
Baby, I'mma see that you be back home in thirty days
Well, she's gonna send out a world wide hoodoo
That'll be the very thing that'll suit ya
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days

I done talked to the judge in private early this morning
And he took me to the sheriff's office to sign a warrant
They gon' put a false charge again' ya (against ya)
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Oh thirty days (thirty days)

I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Yeah, we're gonna put a false charge again' ya

If I don't get no satisfaction from the judge
I'm gonna take it to the FBI and voice my grudge
If they don't give me no consolation
I'm gonna take it to the United Nations
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Oh thirty days! (thirty days)
Oh thirty days! (thirty days)
Baby, I'mma see that you be back home in thirty days
Well if you don't give me no consolation 
I'm gonna take it to the United Nations
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days!

There was a time I would've trusted you
There was a time that I would give it all away

There was a time I'd give it just to you
There was a time it didn't matter
What you'd say
What you'd say

[Chorus:]
I loved you so but that was long ago
When it only takes a day
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

Lying on my own again
Standing for whatever comes along
You'll never be alone again
You're only lonely when you let yourself get strong
Get too strong

[Chorus]

Look at your catastrophe
Look at me how it has to be
Say goodbye, it's all the past to me
Just don't try
Not the last to be
Free and stupid in the sunrise
Summer blowin' by and shining in the trees
I get the feeling that you feel no surprise
Unexpected morning had me on my knees
On my knees

[Chorus]

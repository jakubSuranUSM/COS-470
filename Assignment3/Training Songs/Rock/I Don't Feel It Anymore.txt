Hold on this will
Hurt more than anything has before
What it was, what it was, what it was
I've brought this on us
More than anyone could ignore
What I've done, what I've done, what I've done

I've worked for so long
Just to see you mess around
What you've done, what you've done, what you've done
I want back the years that you took
When I was young
I was young, I was young
But it's done

Oh, take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh, take it all away
Oh, take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh, take it all away

We'll fall just like stars being hung by only string
Everything, everything, here is gone
No map can direct how
To ever make it home
We're alone, we're alone, we're alone

Oh, take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh, take it all away
Oh, take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh, take it all away

It's a pity
It's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again? 
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside 

It's a pity
It's a downright crime
But it happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
Wanna hide from the vicious world outside 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

Your daddy he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied, 
And you know
That's not right 

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good
So dry your eyes 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 
It's high time that you decide
In your own mind 

Tried to comfort you
Tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind
They can't see 

Fortune gonna come some day
All gonna fade away
Your daddy the war machine and
Your mama the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she can not see 

They told you life is hard
It's misery from the start
It's dull and slow and painful 

I tell you life is sweet
In spite of the misery
There's so much more
Be grateful 

Who do you believe? 
Who will you listen to
Who will it be? 

It's high time you decide
It's time you make up your own sweet little mind 

They told you life is long
Be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more
You should be grateful 

But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know
It will be over 

'Cause life is sweet
And life is also very short
Your life is sweet

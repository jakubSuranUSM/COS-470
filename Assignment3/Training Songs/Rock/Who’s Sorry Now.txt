Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Whose heart is achin' for breakin' each vow
Who's sad and blue, who's cryin' too

Just like I cried over you
Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow

You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now
Right to the end

Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay

I'm glad that you're sorry now
I'm glad that you're sorry now...

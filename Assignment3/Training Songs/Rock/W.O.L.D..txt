Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You picked me up in your battered blue
Volkswagen, babe
You laid me down on the mattress on the
Floor that was your bed

Some wisdom in you told you
Ministering to my body
Brought a temporary respite to the
Demons that were screaming in my head

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me
And in holding me you held off the night a little while

You had a beach and a cottage and some nights that were free
You had those eyes that smiled in a dream
But I was lost, confused and still you seemed to see
How I was tired of running rapids
I was trying to find an island in the stream

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me
And in holding me you held off the night a little while

It's too late to call a doctor
I know something you don't know
You have swallowed something awful
I know something you don't know
It's too sad to watch a feeling
Disappear from sight, you know
It's too late

[Chorus]
Leave this house don't be slow
I know something you don't know
Leave this house and make it quick
Well never click

If you know the sickness started
It's a crime to hold it in
If you know your hearts deflated
It don't wash to hold it in

[Chorus]

It's too late
It's too late

Gemstones cracking, cause we're just too strong
Drum-sized yearning 'cause the pressure's gone
Supervised love, crucified stuvs
Simmering red in the sex farm clubs 
There's an exit to this desert
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen 

Cavemen humping in the sterling space pod
Drumstick pumpkin in the Starbucks courtyard
Gigolos dance, stepping on toes
Benedryl nights in the okay holes 

There's an exit to this desert
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen 

Let's break into the labyrinth of lies
Let's dive off the end of his eyes
Hollywood hills, peppermint pills
I can still taste the grime that you stuffed in my gills 

Oh Johnny, can't you set a place for Holly?
She's a wild one, she'll be staying for a spell
Till they find her, then they drag her down
To Barcelona! Down to Barcelona!
I'm a very funny boy, but I know not to say 'cha cha cha'
Dunkin' Donuts, give me Dunkin' Donuts!
She's a very funny girl
But I love that crazy bitch, alright!

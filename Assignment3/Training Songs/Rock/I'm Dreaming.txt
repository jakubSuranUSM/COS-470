Watching all the fishing boats coming
Lying back in the warm, soft sand
Seeing you with the sun in your eyes

Looking 'round with the wind in my hair
Easing down without a care
Touching you under sweet summer skies

There's a place I can go to any time
I feel myself unwind
And oh, the feeling's fine

I'm dreaming of a time beyond today
When you turn to me and say
You'll always feel this way?

I'm dreaming of a sun that never sets
Of a life without regrets
In a world that lets its lovers' dreams come true

Taking time to talk to each other
Finding out who we really are
Being happy, being here with you

Feeling sure that the feeling will last
Even when this dream is past
We will see our love come shining through

I'm dreaming of a time beyond today
When you turn to me and say
You'll always feel this way?

I'm dreaming of a time beyond today
When you turn to me and say
You'll always feel this way?

I'm dreaming of a sun that never sets
Of a life without regrets
In a world that lets its lovers' dreams come true

Dreaming of a time beyond today
When you turn to me and say
You'll always feel this way?

I'm dreaming of a sun that never sets
Of a life without regrets
In a world that lets its lovers' dreams come true

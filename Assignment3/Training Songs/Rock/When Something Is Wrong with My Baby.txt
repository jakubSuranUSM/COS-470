When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I know that she's worrying
I know I'd feel the same misery
 
We've been through so much together
We stand as one
And that's what makes it better
 
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
 
Just what she means to me, now
Oh, you just wouldn't understand
People can say that she's no good
But she's my woman and I know I'm her man
 
And if he's got a problem
I know I've got to help him solve 'em
 
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
 
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with my baby
 
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

Could I act like you, and put a smile on face?
Not even for a second would I lie to myself..
Too many things are missing
And there's a tear in my eye
It's not a question or an answer
But it will change you mind

We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we've all been painted my numbers
We dance and eyes will follow
You said it was love
I said I'd like you to be mine

I couldn't act like you
But I can love like you do
Between us there is something
I can explain it to you

[Repeat: x2]
We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we've all been painted my numbers
We dance and eyes will follow
You said it was love
I said I'd like you to be mine

We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we've all been painted my numbers
We dance and eyes will follow
Sing a song for sorrow

'Cause we've all been painted my numbers
We dance and eyes will follow
You said it was love
I got what I need to get by

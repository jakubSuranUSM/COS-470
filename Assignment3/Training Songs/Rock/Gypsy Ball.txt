(Dickie Peterson & Leigh Stephens)
The gypsy wizard, he rattled
His broken tattered tambourine
And asked for me to share with him
In this timeless dream. Ow!

Lost in the dazzling fascination
I caught myself touching my imagination
And holding the sights I'd never known
And hearing the sounds I'd not yet been shown.

Toms and trinkets made of green to make us all see.
Tainted jewels and diamond rings and other things. OW!

Lost in a maze of liquid smoke
I thought my brains were gonna choke
Holding the sights I could not tell
Under gypsy wizard's spell.

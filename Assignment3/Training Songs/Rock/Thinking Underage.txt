So soon to say it's over 
Lets see what happens later on 
I'm 16 the world just opened wide
I've got a pocket full of change 
I'm tired of thinking underage 
Just cut this string and let me fly
Say goodbye, say goodbye

[Chorus]
Forgive me mom and dad 
If the music makes you sad 
Nothing can prepare us for the day 
That little boys grow old 
And don't do as they're told 
But I will find my way 
I'm just tired of thinking underage, 
Tired of thinking underage, 
I'm not thinking underage anymore

I'm first in line at the DMV 
I'll sweet talk you, just give me the keys 
I don't have a curfew in my mind 
Little Katie and me like the Rolling Stones 
She keeps me still by letting go 
It's not like were running out of time 
Cause you will find, yeah you will find

[Chorus]

Just like gravity, the ups and downs 
Will always be OK with me
I am over all that underage can be so

[Chorus]
(Forgive me mom and dad)
I'm not thinking underage anymore [Repeat: x2]
(If the music makes you sad)
I'm not on that page anymore, no
I'm not thinking underage anymore [Repeat: x2]

In the dark I get so confused
I fall in love like I fall from grace
I wander round,
Wonder where I went
I wander round,
Wonder where I went through the,
The blank spaces,
And the,
The empty places,
And
I don't get around & I don't fall in love

I need a car that can get me around
At night in the city where the air can shine
We'll drive around,
And oh!,
We'll fall in love
We'll drive around,
And oh!,
We'll fall in love
And
Things will be alright
Things'll be alright
Things will be alright
Things'll be alright
And
I don't get around & I don't fall in love much

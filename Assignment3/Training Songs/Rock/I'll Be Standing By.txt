Standing in the shadows
Waiting for your love light to shine on me
When you're lonely and the pain shows
Call me, I'll be right there to set you free

Walking down a dark road to loneliness
The night has no mercy
I feel a need in me I can't express

[Chorus]
I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by

Come to me, when you're lonely
You need someone to love, let it be me
The way you love me and hold me
Made me realize how sweet love can be

Standing on a backstreet in the falling rain,
Cryin' for mercy, until you come to me and ease the pain

[Chorus: x2]

I'll be standing by
There'll be no need to cry
I'll be standing by

Come to me, come to me,
Cause I'll be standing, I'll be standing by

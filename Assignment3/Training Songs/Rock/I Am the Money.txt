Drink more wine then break a leg 
Don't call me early 'cause I'm not done yet 
Gotta take my faith and stained control 
Gotta take my feelings that can go 

So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 
So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 

Feeling mortal, better put a bit back 
Never seen any porn that I didn't like 
A generation a plague of zombies 
Don't go Yoko on me, on me 

So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 
So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 

It gets cold, I'm down and out and I don't know your name again 
This could put me in a super black hole 
But I'm a genius, you're an asshole 

So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 
So don't call me honey, 'cause I am the money 
So don't call me honey, Don't call me honey
'Cause I am the money, I am the money
So don't call me honey, Don't call me honey
I am the money

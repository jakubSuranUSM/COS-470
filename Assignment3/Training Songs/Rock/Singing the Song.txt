You sing a song for feeling alive
You sing a song just knowing it's right 
You write songs when everything's a mess 
You sing a song to get it off your chest 

You hate to brag but you do it anyway 
You close your eyes when you sing to yourself 
Being what you are does not make a change 
You sing a song for setting things straight 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for being in love 
You sing a song that made it to the tops 
Never get wise on music, just let it go 
You sing the song if it makes you grow 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

All in all it's wonderful 
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening 

You sing a song for making your day
You sing a song to take the pain away

All in all it's wonderful
But isn't there something missing 
All in all wherever you go 
There is always someone listening

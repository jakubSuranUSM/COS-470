I can see just who you are
You are you are the missing part
The only living boy left in the world

What’s the city done to you?
You’re walking down Fifth Avenue
You’re looking for salvation in a girl.

If you get what you receive,
It comes down to what you believe
Do you believe you’re someone she can love?

Life is like a loaded gun,
Point it at the lonely ones
Will the final bullet be enough?

You’re the creation
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink
You dance
You fight
You die
And maybe you believe in love

(Maybe you believe in love)

I know who you want to be
You want to be good company
But everything you say gets turned around

So you decide to be alone
You disconnect your telephone
And run off to some place you can’t be found

Everybody needs a friend
Who will love you in the end
Can you be somebody they can trust?

Change your mind and change your life
Find yourself a pretty wife
And be a man
Until you turn to dust

You’re the creation,
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink
You dance
You fight
You die
And maybe you believe in love,

(Maybe you believe in love)

You’re the creation,
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink
You dance
You fight
You die
And maybe you believe in love,

(Maybe you believe in love)
Maybe you believe in love,
(Maybe you believe in love)

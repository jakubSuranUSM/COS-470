Looks like my crazy family 
Is down one crazy daughter 'cause
I'm shipwrecked in a desert that
Once was underwater just 

Looking for a swift turn of phrase
Some colors to fly
As I float by 
In the parade

Plus I dream in skin scented sentences
Of a stronger faster fiercer you
And to each noun, verb and predicate
I dedicate a vivid hue

But you ain't done too well
Getting past your permanent pastel 
Have you now?
Yes, the desert seemed so promising 
And then it paled somehow

So school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
And turn over your test

Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me

I've got a slot at eye level like
A speakeasy door
And I know you know the password 
'Cause I've seen you here before

And I've got something sweet for you 
And I don't care if it is more than you deserve
I've got a lot of love and a lot of nerve
So watch me while I take this curve

Yes school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
And turn over your test

Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me

Plus I have this whole new family
And I'm in love with each of them
And I'm on this list called lucky 
Whenever I'm in reach of them

And I'm learning how to say
That I'd be happy either way
With your love

I'm calling on the stars above

School is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
Turn over your test

Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me

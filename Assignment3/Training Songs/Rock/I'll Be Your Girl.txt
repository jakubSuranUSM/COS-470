When the summer days live to bore you
And the river lies long before you
And the one that you love ignores you
I'll be your girl

Like a senator works a full room
Like a lover undone by full moon
Like a lily alive in full bloom
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage and all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man but I'd be that much more
And more

So when everything soft abrades you
When fortune has long betrayed you
And you're longing for an arm to stay you
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage and all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man but I'd be that much more
And more

So if you're ever feeling less your time due
Like someone bereft and lied to
And you never need a guy to guide you
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl

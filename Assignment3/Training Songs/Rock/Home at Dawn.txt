Turned over and spun around
Take me back you've got it down
Reciting lines out of a book
Who wrote it? I forgot to look
I tried to grab a bunch
But there was only one
I tried to crawl away
But gravity made me run
I tried to resist
I tried to resist
You held me by the arm
I tried to make a list
But there was only one
Two hours of sleep
Think that's enough
Straining my eyes to see
To find my stuff
I'll leave you sleeping
Turn off the light when I'm leaving
I tried to grab a bunch
But there was only one
I tried to crawl away
But sudden words make me run
I tried to resist
I tried to resist
I end up walking home at dawn
I tried to make a list
But there was only one

Well I took my baby home
She said don't you leave me alone
She kissed me on the cheek and I moaned
I said I won't

Well, she said, baby I know what's best
She said I could do with a rest
Then she put her hand on my chest
I said I won't

She had some pile-drivin' kisses
They really knocked me out
They knocked me oh-oh-over
She had a hug like a vice
She squeezes once or twice and I moan

So when I took my baby home
She said don't you leave me alone
She kissed me on the cheek and I moaned
I said I won't
Won't
Won't
I said I won't

She had some pile-drivin' kisses
They really knocked me out
They knocked me oh-oh-over
She had a hug like a vice
She squeezes once or twice and I moan

So when I took my baby home
She said don't you leave me alone
She kissed me on the cheek and I moaned
I said I won't
I said I won't
Won't
Won't

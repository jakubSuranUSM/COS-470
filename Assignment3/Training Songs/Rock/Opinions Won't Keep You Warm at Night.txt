Wait while jealousy tears you apart 
I'm sorry but I cannot help the way you are 
That we do the things you can't 

Just wait 
Can't you see you're being weak? 
It's shallow and dark you know every time you speak 
You're just lying through your teeth 

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me 

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me 

We are everything you wish you weren't 
But, I'm feeling kinda concerned 
We're probably friends 
But you hide from consequence 

Yeah you must have a lot of spare time 
To put down the words that you write 
But no one cares 
You should put your mind to rest 

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me 

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me 

Get to me
Get to me

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me 

Sometimes, days are like this and you don't agree with what you see 
But I will never let the bitter things you say ever get to me

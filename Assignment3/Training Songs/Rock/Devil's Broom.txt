Every time when I can't get enough to make it
Give me back every sense that I used to have
Waking up with my face down on the pavement
Everything that I own in a garbage bag

Where are you?
What did I do?
Why can't you see?
You mean everything to me to me

Waking up in the tank, disorderly break-up
And no one here will even tell me what I did
With the guilt and the shame completely vacant
It's hard to stay alive when you don't know how to live

Where are you?
What did I do?
Why can't you see?
You mean everything to me to me

Since you've gone ain't nobody else gonna save me
Cause I can't trade a bottle for an empty room
I just pray that the lord gonna come down and take me
Sweep me off the floor with the devil's broom

Where are you?
What did I do?
Why can't you see?
You mean everything to me to me

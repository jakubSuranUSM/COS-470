Between dancin' legs
And stumblin' feet
I need you so bad
So bad - so bad

Sick of myself
In this crowd
I need you so bad
So bad - so bad

We're just lovebugs
In a corner
Just lovebugs in a corner
That steal away

Maybe I'm affraid
Of lettin' go
But it's simply not the time

We take our coats
We rob the fridge
And then we steal away

Don't want to fall
In love with you again
But just can't let it be
So weak - so weak

Don't want to fall
In love with you again
But just can't let it be
So weak - so weak

Sick of myself
Sick of myself in this crowd

Is this what you expected?
All the blame you've deflected.
You've perfected your talent and turned it on me

I've tried starting over again
With the way I've been treating my friends
And the way they can influence me in the end
Well, it puts things in perspective

All of the endings are locked behind doors
Far beyond borders or miles from the shore
So I dare still anticipate more
Of your misdeeds?
The way we had it before

Now when I'm facing temptation
I move without hesitation.
Wanting and acting are one fluid motion for me

Whatever I used to resist
Is now at the top of my list
Along with all the nuances I could've missed
Hanging and taken for granted.

Every love song's a mystery here
Fables and proverbs just ring in my ear
But all the endings aren't written in stone
It's the sweetest dream I've ever known

I feel my instincts returning to me
Eating the fruit of the poisonous tree
Pick it dry and return to the sea
Yearning for
The way we had it before

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splickly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows, I was feeling alive

Now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh, Lord, lemme tell you that the feeling's getting stronger

And at six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Well there's trucks all a-passing and and the lights all a-flashing
I'm on my way home from your place

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh, Lord, lemme tell you the feeling's getting stronger

And my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splickly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows, I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks

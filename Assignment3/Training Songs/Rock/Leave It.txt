Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out

[Repeat: x4]
You've got to leave it, leave it, leave it, leave 
You've got to

Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Filled to the top then split open

Repeating over and over
Now you have to leave it, leave it, leave it, leave

[Repeat: x3]
You've got to leave it, leave it, leave it, leave 
You've got to

Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won

[Repeat: x2]
Once you leave never come back 

Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won

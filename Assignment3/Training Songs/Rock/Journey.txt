I know you, I know your face
There you lie asleep in your place
Now you can dream the voyage away
The endless night that turns into day

Once you begin
You never know you lose or you win
Nothing to say
Just close your eyes and dream away
Nothing to do
You know that it's not up to you
Nothing to see

You know that you will never be free
I know you, I know your dream
To search for a place where no man has been
To find a new world and call it your own
To conquer the land and make it your home

I know you, I know your fate
The voyage is long and so is your wait
The journey will end, a new world is near
A cool mist rises, so do your fears

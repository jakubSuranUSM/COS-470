Well the moon is on the highway, darkness fills the sky
As long as I keep driving, I know that I won't die

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone Ridin'

Well I broke up with my baby, told myself I won't cry
Broke up with my baby, told myself a lie

And I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone Ridin'
Get gone Cal

Well the moon is on the highway, darkness fills the sky
As long as I keep driving, I know that I won't die
And I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone Ridin'
Gone Ridin'

Well when I get home day's been rough
Gimme all your company
And when I get low and I've had enough
Gimme all your sympathy

And when I need your love
I need it all day all night anyway is all right
I ain't sayin' nothin' new
Gimme you gimme you only you

Honey you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you
And if I've been bad done you wrong

Gimme time to make it right
Honey don't be mad 'cause it takes
Too long
And we ain't got time to fight

And when I need your love
I need it all right right now gonna get
It anyhow
I ain't sayin' nothin' new

Gimme you, gimme you only you
Honey you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you

Gimme you gimme you only you
You know all you gotta do is gimme
Gimme gimme you

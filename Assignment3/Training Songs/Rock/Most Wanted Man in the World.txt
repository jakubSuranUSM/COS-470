Paul Kelly (Mushroom Music)
I'm not good looking, well-built or tall
I'm not a movie star up on somebody's wall
But when I lie next to my girl
I'm the most wanted man in the world
When she calls my name in a voice soft and low
The she calls it again, something inside of me goes
When she starts moving her hand
I'm the most wanted man in the land
I'm the most wanted man in the world
Arrest me now, take me I'm yours! I'm guilty of loving you
Hold me down, I won't fight it, I surrender!
And when I'm working miles from home
I spend all my money on the long distance telephone
When she says "I wish you were here"
I'm the most wanted man anywhere
I'm the most wanted man in the world
I'm the most wanted man in the world

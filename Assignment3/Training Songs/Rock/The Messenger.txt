Got a letter from a messenger 
I read it when it came 
It said that you were wounded 
You were bound and chained 
You had love and you were handled 
You were poisoned you were pained 
Oh no you were naked 
You were shamed 

You could almost touch heaven 
Right there in front of you 
Liberty just slipped away on us 
Now there's so much work to do 
Oh the door that closes tightly 
Is the door than can swing wide 
Oh no not expecting to collide 

For a minute I let my guard down 
Not afraid to be found out 
I completely forgot dear 
What our fears were all about 
Oh no there's no need to be without 

If there's a chance I would take it 
This desire I can't kill 
Take my heart please don't break it 
I will crawl to your foothill 

I'm frightened but I'm coming 
Please baby please lay still 
Oh no I'm not coming for the kill

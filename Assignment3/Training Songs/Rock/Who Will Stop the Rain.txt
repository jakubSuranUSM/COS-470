This problem is insoluble
The answers seem impossible
The logic ceases to exit
Emotion is the beat we miss

I stand on a world
Where dreams, realities, existence are the same
We take from our mother´s skin
But the world is not to blame

[Chorus]
Who tells the wind which way to blow ?
I wonder who will stop the rain
The rocks that hold the secrets, they don´t know
So who can stop the rain ?
We've lost the path for all we know
Now tell me when will it start again ?
And as the old man lifts his hands
Please can you stop the rain

Stars fall far away
Like they never did before
A new moon shining
Like it never will again

[Chorus]

Desert white cloud
Spirits they sing
Rain falls from the big sky
Onto broken wing

There is no sense in turning back
To wash the débris from the track
World without reason without rhyme
We fought for peace within our time

[Chorus]

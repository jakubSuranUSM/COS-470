Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Young Johnny Day, Day
Johnny

Crouching unarmed and completely alone
Just a hundred yards away
His enemy is set to slay
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Three spears he holds and woomera too
And there's a blood lust burning
Every time his eyes are turning
To Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Sad the tribe as they for the death
Of young Johnny Day, Day
Johnny

She was to marry this much older man
But all the love she had was for the
Tall and  handsome lad they call
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Three weeks have passed since 
The pair ran away
But they were both dragged back
When all the hunters set to trackin'
Young Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Silent now as they wait for the death
Of Young Johnny Day, Day
Johnny

Johnny was brought before the council
Of elders and he heard them say
We give the older men
Three spears against you
Thrown when the sun stands high today

Hah! is the signal. The enemy leaps
The flashin' spear is hurled and then 
The second and the third towards 
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

Johnny dives flat back and rolls to his right
And them it's jump, turn, twist, hah!
And all the spears have missed 
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny Day

The tribe go wild as they welcomed
To life again
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny
Johnny is livin' again 
Johnny Day, Day
Johnny is livin' again 
Johnny

I feel tears wellin' up going deep inside
Like my heart's gonna get broke
And the stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you broke me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide my sorrow
When i may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be
Now I live in fear of waking up each morning
Finding that she's gone from me
There's aching pain in my heart
For the name of the one
That I had to replace
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

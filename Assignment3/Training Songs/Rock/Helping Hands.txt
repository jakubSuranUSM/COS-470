It's in these letters that we write
To our friends and family
Spilling secrets of our past
A brief history
Packed with pills, alcohol
And cuts that'll run so deep

So we must stand up
For the ones we love
And give them hope
Before they fall down

So they say, I've lost and I've found
And I've found no way out
Of this mess that we have made
So let me get this straight
You want out
Or just to leave town

So we must stand up
For the ones we love
And give them hope
Before they fall

And we must stand up
For the ones we love
And give them hope
Before they fall down

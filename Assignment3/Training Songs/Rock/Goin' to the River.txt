Oh, I'm goin' to the river, gonna
Go overboard and drown
I'm goin' to the river, gonna
Jump overboard and drown
Because the girl I love
She just have left this town

When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I would be
I would be the one to cry

Well, if you see my mama, tell
Her good-bye for me
If you see my mama, tell
Her good-bye for me
I'm tired of livin'
Livin' in misery

(Matraca Berg/Jimmy Fadden)

Why do I lie here like this
Paralyzed by the truth in your kiss
You think that I don't know there's someone else
I should get up and go, but I'm not feeling well

There's a slow poison inside of me
A slow poison, killing me by degrees
It's a strong potion, love and jealousy

Don't tell me it's all in my mind
I ain't gonna fall for that this time
I'm not really holding on, can't you see?
It's just when I'm feeling strong
Something brings me to my knees

There's a slow poison inside of me
A slow poison, killing me by degrees
It's a strong potion, love and jealousy

Please, please save me, say you don't love me
Sometimes the venom is the only remedy

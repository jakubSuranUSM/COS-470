How much is enough?

Good enough, is not good enough
Don't complain that you've got it tough
With all you have, your life's a bore
Can't relax, you want so much more
Blind needs won't set you free
Can't you see that time is slipping away? But I got to say

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough, is enough

Gravity may bring you down
But harmony could spin you 'round
Information Ariel says buy buy buy material
Give take all day long
Can't you see it's hopeless being strong
When you live it wrong?

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough? How much is enough?
Buy buy buy, buy buy buy

So give me your attention, I know it's getting late
While we were dreaming, something slipped away
We're drowning in possessions, playing tricks with our minds
Lost from one another, baby put your hand in mine
Time is slipping away, but it's not too late

How much is enough? When your soul is empty
How much is enough? In the land of plenty
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough?

How much is enough? How much is enough?
When you have all you want and you still feel nothing at all
How much is enough? How much is enough?
How much is enough? How much is enough?
How much is enough? How much is enough?

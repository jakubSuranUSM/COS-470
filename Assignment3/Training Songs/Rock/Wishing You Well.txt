Thoughts of you
My hand clenched white
I write it down
Will these words catch flight?

I wish life was
A starlet scene
With scripted lines
Said perfectly

Wishing you well
We say our last goodbye
This is farewell, so
Good luck and goodbye

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm

Turn the page
A chapter ends
When one love dies
Another one begins
Like fire burning
Buildings down
Like a symphony's resolving
Resolving sound

Wishing you well
We say our last goodbye
This is farawell, so 
Good luck and goodbye

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm

Colors in your life
I'll wait for you
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

Wishing you well
We say our last goodbye
This is farewell, so
Good luck and goodbye

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Just say goodbye
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Just say goodbye

Oh, try goodbye
Oh, hey

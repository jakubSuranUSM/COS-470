Well, the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Now think this through with me, let me know your mind
Whoa oh, what I want to know is, are you kind

Now it's a buck dancer's choice, my friends, better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Now will you come with me, won't you come with me?
Whoa oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?

Sister, well, I declare, have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls, their motto is ''Don't tread on me"
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone, he's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me, it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Whoa oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I've got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Whoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band, playing to the tide
Come on, come on or go alone, he's come to take his children home

Whoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children home

Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
(Brother, ain't no time to hate)
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
(Sister, ain't no time to wait)
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children home

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

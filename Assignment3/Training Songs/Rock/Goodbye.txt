I'm waiting over here
Just to see you
My love
For the last time

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I love to see you fade and die
I love to see you kicking, screaming as you try to reach the sky

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I love to see you fade and die
I love to see you kicking, screaming as you try to reach the sky and die

I'm begging you tonight
I want to free you
My love
Just one last time for you

Maybe we could change
We always seem to fall again
We are still alive
You have to give up everything and die
And all I want is you
And all I want is you

So it's over now
And I have loved you
With my life
But this is the last time for you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I love to see you fade and die
I love to see you kicking, screaming as you try to reach the sky

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I love to see you fade and die
I love to see you kicking, screaming 
As you try to reach the sky and die

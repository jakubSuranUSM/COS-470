I never wanted to hear you say goodbye 
And I wondered why 
I had to let you go and dry my eyes 
My weeping eyes 
Try to figure what was wrong with me 
What was wrong with me? 
But I'm glad you're back now baby 
Now that we can complete what we started 

Bring it back bring it all back, bring it back do it like that 
Bring it we got nothing to lose, I wanna see ya 
Bring it back bring it all back, bring it back do it like that 
Bring it we got nothing to lose, I wanna see ya soon 

It's been oh such a long time 
But a change's gonna come 

It's been a long time but I'm glad it's over now 
We said so many foolish things and how 
It's over now 
And the sun came out the moment you called Â­ I'm glad you called 
I'm gonna be whatever you want me 
So if you wanna we can try to 

[Chorus]

And I don't care what anyone says 
People gonna say what they're gonna say 
So if you wanna try we can start it over 
And I don't care what anyone says 
People gonna say what they're gonna say 
So if you wanna try we can start it over, over 

Bring it back bring it all back, bring it back do it like that 
Bring it we got nothing to lose, I wanna see ya soon 
Yeah 
Bring it all back Bring it all back yeah, bring it all back Bring it all back yeah 
'Cause I don't care I don't care, I don't care I don't care

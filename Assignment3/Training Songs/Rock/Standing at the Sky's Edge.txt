I'm going away now sweetness, don't be sad
Though tonight was the best night that we've had
I'll put away my old suit and say goodbye
Cause something is with us tonight

Oh come on now sweetness don't you cry
The living here hasn't been easy for a while
I'll put away my old shoes and say goodbye
'Cos something is with us tonight

Yeah I'm leaving on the next train that's blowing round the bend
And I'll be there by the morning and I won't be back again
'Cos I've just seen the ending to our story
Well something is
Yeah something is
Yeah something is with us tonight

I'm going away to the station in the rain
I'm sorry sweetness but there's nothing more to say
I've put away all my old things, this is goodbye
'Cos something is with us tonight

Yeah I'm leaving on the next train that's blowing round the bend
And I'll be there by the morning and I won't be back again
'Cos I've just seen the ending to our story
Well something is
Yeah something is
Yeah something is With us tonight

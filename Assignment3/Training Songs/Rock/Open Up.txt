Is it true, when they say its alright
In aworld which is made up of lies
Takes a lot of courage, takes a lot of prise
Holding onto something when your faling down inside
I have only to open my eyes
I'm running down the road, I'm running down the road
I'm running down the road, out of here
I'm living in this world, I'm kicking in this world
'till there's something in this world i can see
Takes a lot of courage, takes a lot of pride
Holding onto something when you're falling down inside
I have only to open my eyes
Tomorrow as it stands, i should rise
Like the wind, take me up in your eyes
Takes a lot of courage, takes a lot of pride
Holding onto something when you're falling down inside
I have only to open my eyes

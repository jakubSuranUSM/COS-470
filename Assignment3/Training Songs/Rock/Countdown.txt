I'm waiting on the countdown
Sitting in the shade
Things about to turn around
How the madness fades
Oh, I've been waiting on the countdown
Things about to turn around
And now I'm out of the lost and found
Just waiting on the countdown
Time slips away
Oh, this feeling lingers
Right here I'm going to stay
I've been waiting on the countdown
Things about to turn around
And now I'm out of the lost and found
Just waiting on the countdown
So I'm sitting in the shade
Under the dreaming tree
Now the madness fades
Right here I'm going to be
Oh, I've been waiting on the countdown
Things about to turn around
And now I'm out of the lost and found
Just waiting on the countdown

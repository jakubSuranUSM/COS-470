The world never ends
It's only the beginning
And we can't pretend
To discover it's meaning

We talked for hours at a time
Then I came to my senses
You're more than a friend
You're my perfect lover

I'll never be all you want me to
But that's all right

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna dry your tears
And we're gonna stay together
For a million years

It's the least I can do
Just to make you my baby
No words could describe
Oh, pinch me I'm dreaming

Your hair's long and black
As it lays 'cross my pillow
When I stare in your eyes
I get lost in your glory

I'll never be all you want me to
But that's all right

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna dry your tears
And we're gonna stay together
For a million years

When you were a little girl
Your great big world came tumbling down
So sad

Yeah, the river it bends
But it flows to the ocean
And baby here I am
I'm your sea of devotion

I'll never be all you want me to
But that's all right

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna dry your tears
And we're gonna stay together
For a million years

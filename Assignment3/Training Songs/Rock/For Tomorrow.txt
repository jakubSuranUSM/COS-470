For Tomorrow
Hold just one moment
You're out of line
And it is choking
What we've got

I'm so tired
Of being right
Keep me from stealing
What we've got

Nothing's too good, nothing's too bad
We can't live for today, just live for tomorrow
We gotta go on, gotta go on
No we never know
Oh no no
Nothing's too good, nothing's too bad
We can't live for today, just live for tomorrow
We gotta go on, gotta go on No we never know

Oh you're a liar
Don't waste my time
Everything changes
You know it's so

Nothing's too good, nothing's too bad

We can't live for today, just live for tomorrow
We gotta go on, gotta go on
No we never know
Oh no no
Nothing's too good, nothing's too bad
We can't live for today, just live for tomorrow
We gotta go on, gotta go on
No we never know

Please try to read me
Don't get me wrong
Please try to see me
Try, try to hang on
Please try to hear me
Now you know

Nothing's too good, nothing's too bad
We can't live for today, just live for tomorrow
We gotta go on, gotta go on
No we never know

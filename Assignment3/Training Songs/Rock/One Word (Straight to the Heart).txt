One word, one heart, one night, is all I want,
One word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me;

Midnight, and all is well,
I hear the mission bell,
Out on the road, nothing is moving,
As I speed from town to town;

Two hearts are beating fast,
But they are still many miles apart,
Oh the mood was shining on a distant shore,
Burning like a fire in my heart,
I've got to see her, I've got to say 

One word, one heart, one night, is all I want,
One word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me,
I never knew I cared so much before,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I'm going to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
Like a cannonball

Headlights are blazing through,
Turn on the radio, I hear the news,
Hand on the wheel, foot on the floor,
And on, and on, and on we go,
This car is like a friend,
Bring her the message that I want to send,
Oh the dawn was breaking and I saw the sun,
Burning like a fire on the bay,
I'm nearly there now, I'm gonna say 

One word, one heart, one night, is all I want,
One word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me,
I never knew I cared so much before,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
Like a cannonball

One word, (yes,) one heart,
One night, (yes,) one girl, (yes,)
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
I've got to give her my love, straight to the heart,
I've got to give her my love, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her myself, straight to the heart,
I've got to tell her tonight, straight to the heart,
Like a cannonball

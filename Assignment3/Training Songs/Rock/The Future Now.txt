Here we are, static in the latter half
Of the twentieth century
But it might as well be the Middle Ages,
There'll have to be some changes
But how they'll come about foxes me.
I want the future now,
I want to hold it in my hands;
All men equal and unbowed,
I want the promised land.

But that doesn't seem to get any closer,
And Moses has had his day...
The tablets of law are an advertising poster,
Civilization here to stay
And this is progress?
You must be joking!
Me, I'm looking for any kind of hope.
I want the future now,
I want to see it on the screen,
I want to break the bounds
That make our lives so mean.

Oh, blind, blinded, blinding hatred
Of race, sex, religion, colour, country and creed,
These scream from the pages of everything I read.
You just bring me oppression and torture,
Apartheid, corruption and plague;
You just bring me the rape of the planet
And joke world rights at the Hague.
Oh, someday the Millennium!
But how far is someday away?
I want the future now
I'm young, and it's my right.
I want a reason to be proud.
I want to see the light.
I want the future now,
I want to see it on the screen,
I want to break the bounds:
Make life worth more than dreams.

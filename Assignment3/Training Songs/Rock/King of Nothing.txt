He's got a Jesus tattoo
Indian Ink Sitting Bull
I wanted to be pure
I wanted to be sure
I want it to be perfect
Perfectly flawed

She says she wants to be free
Says she's not happy to bleed for me
I want it to be real
Something I can feel
I wanted to explain
To all you unbelievers

This is the way you build a fire
These are the hands that will provide
You sleep you dream you get inspired 
By all the simple things in life

She's such a beautiful kid
Heaven will open and let her in
I wanted to be pure
I wanted to be so sure
I want it to be perfect
Now it's automatic

This is the way you build a fire
These are the hands that will provide
You sleep you dream you get inspired
By all the simple things in life

A little snapshot for your notes
Another chapter on the road
And if it kills you
It'll kill you when you're on your own
You got to tend to all your love
Pay attention to your love
It'll break your little heart
Andy dies in this one

King of nothing
King of nothing
King of nothing, King of nothing, King of nothing

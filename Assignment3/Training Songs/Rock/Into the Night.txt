Tonight we'll start a fire
You know we'll let it burn
Somehow we'll over come it
I'll never know
I can't stop thinking about it
It's eating away inside
Believe me when I tell you
It's mine
You now know
I decided long ago
I was gonna be with you
But into the night we both will go
And find our own way

A thousand lights above us
We're gonna let them shine
What comes first tomorrow
Or maybe the next life
'cause you live for the weekend
And I live forever
And you say you don't need it
I don't know
You don't know
I decided long ago
I was gonna be with you
But into the night we both will go
And find our own way

I decided long ago
I was gonna be with you
But into the night we both will go
And find our own way
Do you know
Do you know
Whoa woe

Do you know
Do you know
Whoa woe
I'm taking my things
Leaving behind
All of the pain you've caused me
And I never want you
Back in my life
Back in my life
In my life
I can't stop thinking about it
It's eating away inside
Believe me when I tell you
It's mine
You now know
I decided long ago
I was gonna be with you
But into the night we both will go
And find our own way
I decided long ago
I was gonna be with you
But into the night we both will go
And find our own way

Yeah, we will find our own way

Do you know
Do you know
Whoa woe

Fire me in an oven
Until I go hard enough
To deal with losing you
I'm tired of thinking of you
Each and every minute I see
Something I know that you'd love

We're all made of glass
All made of glass
Cheating ourselves to believe we'll be last
Like a fool, I thought it was true
I was holding your flowers
If only you knew

A diary fills it's pages
With one eye on the clock
How long?, how long?
Have we got
Until we're everything we ought to be-eeeeeeee
Terrified, while the picture of dignity
Come eat with me, at the table of this life

All made of glass
All made of glass
Yes, we're all made of glass
all made of glass
cheating ourselves to believe we'll be last
Like a fool, I thought it was true
I was holding your flowers
If only you knew
If only you knew

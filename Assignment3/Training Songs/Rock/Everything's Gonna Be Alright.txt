Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride 
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Now I sign a couple of autographs
Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me
Smooth is Flipping
Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
Tim is in the front and
Mo'Bettas right behind
and me I'm just laying on the prowl
Guys say what's up as the girls cry aaaahhh
She grabbed her man
I think she tried to play'em
My only thought was to step to the a.m.
'Cause I came to have a good time
and at the end of the night
No doubt I'm gonna get mine
'Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain if you know what I mean
understand I'm not conceded
Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth dark romeo freak kind of fellow
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
 
Do that dance do that dance, baby.
Do that dance. Let's work it out.
Do that dance do that dance baby.
 
Do that dance do that dance, baby.
Do that dance. Let's work it out.
Do that dance do that dance baby.
 
Lounging on the d.l.
this type of night is rare
I glance to the right
Oh, who do we have here
Puff and stew gettin' ripped
What the hell
I see Mr. Uptown himself, Andre Harrell
conversating 
with his boys
as they start to barge straight through the crowd
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mello, so I leap to sista' and the soul
rollin' five deep
Mark, Corey, Shakim, L.Q. doin' the wild thing
'cause the soul is true
And every time I hear the music thump-id-dee-thump
and all the girlz gettin' bucked right in your rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor
 
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
 
Ev'rybody, dance with me.
Ev'rybody, move with me.
Ev'rybody, dance with me.
Ev'rybody, move with me.
Ev'rybody gonna be alright.

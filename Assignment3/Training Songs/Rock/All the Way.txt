Darlin' can we go, all the way, 
I really wanna go, all the way, so darlin'
Can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all the way

Come with me, you won't find nothing better
You should come with me, we can do whatever,
I can't wait another minute, wait another minute, wait
Another minute
Baby lets get down to business
Come on girl, ride with me,
Hit the spot and never leave,
Spend the night, just you and me
Oh, oh,
Nothings ever felt so right, 
Think about you every night,
Tell me that you wanna wanna, that you want it right

California loving was playing while we was teasing,
It's hard to be alone when her phone won't stop ringing,
Forget about the others, it's just you and me,
Get between the covers and then you'll start believing,

Darlin can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, 
All the way, so darlin'
Can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all the way

You could be the one that I hold to,
And you could be the one that I come home to,
I can't wait another hour, wait another hour, 
Wait another hour,
I can't get on without her,
Saddle up and ride with me,
Hit the spot and never leave,
Make a toast to you and me,
Oh, oh,
Nothing's ever felt this way, think about you everyday,
Tell me that you gonna gonna, that you gonna stay

California loving was playing while we was teasing,
It's hard to be alone when her phone won't stop ringing,
Forget about the others, it's just you and me,
Get between the covers and then you'll start believing,

Darlin' can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all
The way, so darlin'
Can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all the way

I could your everything, you know that I'll never change,
I need you to feel the same way to make it out okay
Every night I hope and pray I could find the words to say,
Think about you everyday, don't ever go away,

California loving was playing while we was teasing,
It's hard to be alone when her phone won't stop ringing,
Forget about the others, it's just you and me,
Get between the covers and then you'll start believing,

Darlin' can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all
The way, so darlin'
Can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all the way
Can we go, all the way, I really wanna go, all the way

Darlin' can we go all the way

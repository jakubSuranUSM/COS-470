She's over you
Boy, you know it's true
But you can't stay here
You had it coming for years

Pull yourself together
Draw the line
Pull yourself together
Can't stand to see you cry

It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

It's over now
You've been taking your time
But you can't stay here
Boy, dry up your tears

Pull yourself together
Draw the line

It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

Pull yourself together
Draw the line
Pull yourself together
Can't stand to see you cry

No point in looking back
Over your shoulder
Leave your worries behind
For a while
You'll forget everything
As you get older

It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

Stand up, stand up
Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

Pull yourself together
Draw the line
Pull yourself together
Can't stand to see you cry

Wasting time and wasting money,
You've been acting like a fool.
You spend your whole life fighting for a guarantee,
When all you really need is a friend.

Hey, there's a good light, shining in you. 
There's a magic in your eyes.
Hey, there's a good light, shining through, and I need it tonight.

You've been looking for rhyme and reason.
The confusion is dragging you down.
You got lost in the chaos.
You got lost in the ashes and dust.
What you needed was someone to trust.

Hey, there's a good light, shining in you. 
There's a magic in your eyes.
Hey, there's a good light, shining through, and I need it tonight.

We're all stumbling through the darkness.
No one can stay there and still make it through.

Hey, there's a good light, shining in you. 
There's a magic in your eyes.
Hey, there's a good light, shining through, and I need it tonight.

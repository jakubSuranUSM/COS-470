Here we go again,
With your hair in your face,
My head in my hands
Hoping to find something
That we've never known.
Looking like two little kids with our wide eyes,
Slow tenderness,
Asking,
Saying things that we always do.

When we're feeling we've been cheated out of
Something we deserve,
Then these small wonders
Keep us awake at night,
These small wonders
Hold us down the ground,
And show us who we are.

Walking side by side
With our fear,
Our hope,
Our love,
And our pride,
Two steps forward, no looking back.
Every chance to fall through
Then its one look and the world becomes you
Untouched,
We know we're on our way.

When we're feeling we've been wasted
By too much time inside,
Then these small wonders,
They keep us awake at night,
These small wonders,
Hold us down to the ground,
And show us who we are.

Just when we know we've heard it all before,
The world comes screaming through our door

These small wonders these small wonders

Here we go again
Your hair my face your head my hands,
My clumsy hands.

I'm free at night from desire 
And I keep my eyes up on the streets
The people say you're a liar
When you smile and you speak to me
No one can help or will save you tonight 
'Cause the time has come to make things right

Die, die, baby, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, baby, die
Die, die

You know there is nothing else I aspire
But you know that you sell all my dreams
My heart and my soul are on fire
Because your words are not quite what they seem ???
But no one can help or will save you tonight
'Cause the time has come to make things right

Die, die, baby, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, baby, die
Die, die

Die, die, baby, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, baby, die
Die, die

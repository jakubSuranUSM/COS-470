In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told, yeah

When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew

That the chains were on
That the chains were on, my my my

In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away

Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free

But, still your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on

You've seen them walkin' on the water
You've seen flyin' through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes

Yes, when the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew

Yeah, that the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
Oh, my, the chains were on

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still the chains are on

Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still the chains are on
And the world was aglow and magic
But, the chains are on

Yeah, the chains are on
Oh, the chains are on
Yeah, the chains are on
Oh, the chains were on

Yeah, the chains were on
(Seen them walkin' on the water)
Oh, the chains are on
(Seen flyin' through the sky)

My, the chains were on
(They were frightening in the darkness)
Yes, the chains are on
(They had rainbows in their eyes)
Yeah, the chains are on

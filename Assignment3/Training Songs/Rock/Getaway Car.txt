Remembering when we first met
We had that adventure in our eyes
But something got away I guess
In the everyday of our lives
 
And I don't know what keeps us here
Let's disappear and start all over again
 
[Chorus]
We can run away
Baby come as you are
You can look at my heart
As your Getaway Car
We can drive all night
It'll be alright
Love can take us so far in my Getaway Car
 
All we need is the open road
More fuel for the fire inside us
Steer us onto lands unknown
We can leave this world behind us

[Chorus]

Turn up the radio and don't look back again
Let me put the pedal down, gonna leave this town
Don't be afraid to ride
 
[Chorus]

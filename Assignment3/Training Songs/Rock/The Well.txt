We can make it, I know we can
Only time will tell
Let's take a walk down to the water
Let's go the well
You hear that low humming underground
Hear the skylark in the dell
The wild world is speaking
Let's go to the well

Sometimes my heart feels like a dandelion
Seeds scattered in a careless wind
And nothing to show for my life and time but 
Innocent wonder in the face of thunder
Feeling like something is about begin

Let's build a bonfire
For the stories we tell
Of wild years, the wasted tears
Ant he silent way they fell
See the curls of smoke rising up 
To the big old sky as the moonlight falls 
Down over those distant hiss 
I don't want to be anywhere else anymore
Let's go to the well 

You better believe my faith in you
It is wide and steady as a Texas moon
And when this stuff starts rolling through
Its as all innocent wonder in the face of thunder
Feeling like something is coming soon

We can make it, I know we can
Only time will tell
Let's take a walk down to the water
Let's go the well

And let's go down to those hills through the 
Trees across the rocky path
Down to the Blanco river
Come with me darling, the sky is a so big today
My heart's so full
C'mon, lets go to the well now, babe

Out in the streets inspiration comes hard
The joker in the deck keeps handin' me his card
Smilin' friendly he takes me in
Then breaks my back in a game I can't win
Jivin', hustiln', what's it all about?
Everybody always wants the east way out
Thirty golden pieces for the Judas kiss
What's a nice boy doin' in a place like this? 

[Chorus]
Never Surrende, keep your dreams alive
Never Surrender, hold your head up high 

Modern apathetics; you got plenty of nothing to say
Some are born to follow: some will make their own way
Today you found a hero tomorrow you'll forget
You're lookin' for convenient truth you haven't found it yet
You don't make commitments no time for regrets
Easy come and easy go and easy to forget
You don't ever take responsibility
Don't you know that part of you is part of me 

[Chorus] 

Never Surrender, it's easier said than done
But you go to finish what's already begun
Never, that's forever, seems like such a long time
But I only got one life to live - It's gonna be mine 

Never Surrender, we cannot be denied
Never Surrender, spread your wings and fly

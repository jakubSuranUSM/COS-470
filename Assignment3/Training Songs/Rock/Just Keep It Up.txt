Well, one day baby,you'll be sorry
For the way you make people cry
It's not so funny
Not one bit, honey
One day you'll wake up and realize

Just keep it up
Just keep it up               
Just keep it up
And see what happens

One day you told me
Oh, how you told me
Things that made me shake inside
And then you kissed me,
ummm,oh how you kissed me
Then turn around and said you lied

(repeat 2)

Please stop doin
The things you're doin
I know we can get along
Your luck will run out
One day you'll see
And then your lovin' arms will
belong to me

(repeat 3)

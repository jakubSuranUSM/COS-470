You look like gold to me
And I'm not too blind to see
You look like gold

You make me wanna sing
With all the joy you bring
You look like gold

Like the rays down from the sun
When a new day has just begun
You look like gold

I've been fooled before
But now I know
I've made the mistake in the past
But now I know the difference
From gold and brass

Not the kind of gold you wear
But the kind that can feel my care
You look like gold

Some shine when the day is new
But fade when the day is through
But you look like gold

I've been wrong before
But now I know
I've made mistakes in the past
But now I know the difference
From gold and brass

You look like gold to me
And I'm down on bending knees
You look like gold
And I just want you to know
To me you mean so much more
Than all the gold
You look like gold

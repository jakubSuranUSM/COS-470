The stars and a moon
Aren't where they're supposed to be
For the strange electric light 
It falls so close to me 
Love, I come to ride 
High on that seasick rolling wave 
And you know that I am 
Just trying to get out 
Oh the glorious sound 
Oh the one way street 
But you can't get 
Can't get it down without crying 
When I'm dressed in white 
Send roses to me 
I drink so much sour whiskey I can't hardly see
And everywhere I've been 
There's a well that howls my name 
From the one tiny sting 
To that vacant fame
Oh the deafening roar 
Remember that's called a one way street 
And you can't get 
Can't get it down without crying 
Mystery's a sigh 
You can't get out 
In a psychotropic light, you can't get out 
Love, I come to ride 
High on that seasick rolling wave 
That's the way that I fall, trying to get out 
Oh the glorious sound 
Of the one way street 
And you can't get 
Can't get it down without crying 
Oh the deafening roar 
It's called a one way street

Mother Earth is waitin' for you, yes she is
She is big and she's round
And it's cold way down in the ground

You may not be happy all the time
You may never be that way
Mother Earth is waitin' for you
For that debt you?'e got to pay

Don't care how big you are
I don't care what you were
When it all is up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth

You could be blass with life
Only make love to foreign girls
You may have a little jet, baby
And fly all around the world

Don't care how big you are
I don't care what you were
When it all is up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth
She is waitin' for you
Yea

When it all is up
You got to go back
Way back to Mother Earth, yes

I feel so bad, oh, all I can do is sing these blues, yea
When it all is up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth
Oh baby you hear what I say

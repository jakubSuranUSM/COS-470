From the album slow down world

Slow down world
Major problem ahead,
You have been on the go
For a long, long time I know.
Take a rest from the race,
Why chase it ?
Slow down world,
Take a tip from old times.
You've seen how greed
Consumes you with its need.
Take a rest from the race
Why chase it ?
Happy is the man
Who rests when he can,
Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.
And happy is the gal
Who calls peace her pal.
If you want to be free,
You shall, you shall.
Slow down world,
Take a break for God's sake.
(Slow down)
You just can't stop your climb
Your money-mad climb up to the top,
Don't you just glance at the chance,
Why waste it ?
Don't chase it,
Why waste it ?
Happy is the man
Who rests when he can,
Let old man time's sand
Slip through his hand.
And happy is the gal
Who calls peace her pal.
If you want to be free,
You shall, you shall.
Slow down world,
Slow down world,
Slow down world,
Slow down world,

There is a bar they call The Bitter Sea.
And she sits and drinks a velvet crush--that's
Kool Aid and gin--casing the clientele
Like a relentless cameraman. She is
Elsewhere. She says You keep a-knocking
But you can't come in, and I say
Little Sister, don't you do what your Big Sister does

Spiral down down down down down down down

Well desire looks just like you with an Uzi nine
Gun down fifteen bystanders in a roadside drive by
Desire is the grass fire drinking gasoline
And she says Open up your mouth, man, let me come inside

Spiral down down down down down down down

She's gone,
Gone gone

Aaah, leaning up against the wall
I will lash out dancing like a madman when you're gone
I will spit the blue flame and hurl my glass against the wall
And I will hear your name coming out from a boom box
I will hear your name called out from passing cars

Spiral down down down down down down down

She cracked

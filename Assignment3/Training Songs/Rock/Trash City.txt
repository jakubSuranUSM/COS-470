In Trash City on Party Avenue
I got a girl from Kalamazoo
In Trash City on a transit line
I put you on hold but you're looking fine

In Trash City on Party Avenue
I got a girl from Kalamazoo
In Trash City on a transit line
I put you on hold but you're looking fine

When I see your car at the donut house
Wanna see a movie 'bout a creeper on the house
Wanna go bowling wanna chuck some rocks
Wanna come to my house and change all the locks

In Trash City on Party Avenue
I got a girl from Kalamazoo
In Trash City on a transit line
I put you on hold but you're sure looking fine

Sing you a song like rubber on a turn
Fifty-seven records that you know you ought to burn
Garbage men don't care for the blues or rock n' roll
It's five o'clock in the morning in a coffee shop in Seoul

First I got a hot dog in a nightmare zone
Then I vandalize a cheap payphone
Crying to the girls won't you leave me alone
Makin' love in the graveyard with cockroach bones

In Trash City on Party Avenue
I got a girl from Kalamazoo
In Trash City on a transit line
I put you on hold but you sure look fine

First I got a hot dog in a nightmare zone
Then I vandalize a cheap payphone
Cryin' to the girls won't you leave me alone
Ain't makin' love with cockroach bones

Down on transit avenue
I got a girl from Kalamazoo
Down on Transit Avenue Panama Time
To hold to be real fine

One time!

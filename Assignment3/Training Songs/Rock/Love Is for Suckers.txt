It’s all acting on the outside, I’m trembling  on the inside
Don’t know what  I’m getting into, 
Some kind of con game, Some kind of swindle
I want a future, Not a moment, Some affection, Hand holding
Don’t wanna end up half faking, Don’t wanna find out I’ve been taken
Love is for Suckers, 
Love is for Believers, 
Love is for Losers, 
Love is for Dreamers   Love, Love, Love       

Love is for Suckers like me               

Don’t expect much, Never got that, But I’d be willing
Don’t wanna hold back, So if you want me, Come and get me
I’m ready, Your so beautiful, I’m so gullible
I’d probably believe most anything

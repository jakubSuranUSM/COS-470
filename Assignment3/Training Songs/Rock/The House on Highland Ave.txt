Were you ever thinking
When you met that girl uptown
And were you ever thinking
When you pulled her underground

       There is no fire in your glass eye
       There is no feeling when you're done
       And one day you will find out
       What kind of monster you've become

Were you ever thinking
When you pulled her off the bus
And dragged her down in the basement
And left her soul to rust

(chorus)

And were you really thinking
When you got wired up in L.A.
Like death she sat and waited
And came to us to stay

(chorus)

And were you ever thinking
When she came home from work at night
And you kicked her into a coma
While she was still alive

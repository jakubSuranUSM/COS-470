Look beyond the sullen sound
Past your boxed up hollow station
We are moving forward towards your own betterment
Fire your attention away from jaws to your feet where
We'll make 'em, make 'em move forward

If you change this grand design and sweep its general outlines
You are one step closer towards your own betterment
Every time we close our eyes, rhythm falls out
Come on, come on you can't hide

Slide into the middle, don't wait for an answer
Maze of disco lights, you never knew you were a dancer
Hands are shaking, breaks are breaking
The sea will start a fire

Living in the lights, never caught you a breakthrough
The people are in lines, trying to be you
Oh, and now you are dancing

I see all the waking ones
From silhouettes to the beating drums
With the free will towards their own experiment
Underneath the covered core are countless numbers
That are rushing to the floor

Slide into the middle, don't wait for an answer
Maze of disco lights, you never knew you were a dancer
Hands are shaking, breaks are breaking
The sea will start a fire

Living in the lights never caught you a breakthrough
The people are in lines trying to be you
Oh, and now you are dancing

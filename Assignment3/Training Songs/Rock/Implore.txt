Where did you get your summer rays
I'm caught thinking towards the days
When summaries didn't cloud
And everything I did made my mother proud
Don't you ever compromise
Then you will see just where it lies
Underneath their best intentions
Where did I get those winter ways
If you want me I'll be outside
With my hands in my pockets
With my mouth on the ground
Don't you ever realize
It's not just those that I despise
But your lack of attention
It's just a problem you need
Swing
Did you ever get that letter that I wrote you
Said I hope you feel better soon
Maybe by then we could comprehend
How to work things out, how not to shout
When we sit down late
Mourning for the death of your ever-present pout
Every time I get the feeling things are going fine
I get this creepy little feeling climbs spine ladder to whine
It's just a something
It's just a none thing
It's just a problem you need
Need
Want

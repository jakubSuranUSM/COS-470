Sad suffering
I knew you when
Fairwell thee friend of mine
I try not to think

I merely blink
Hope to wish away the lies
I
Can you protect

Me when I'm wrecked
I'll pretend you're still alive
I choose the day
One death and grey,

Thick fog, I hide and smile
Clear all your sins
Get born again
Just repeat a couple lies

Lies, yeah
Sad suffering
Get born again

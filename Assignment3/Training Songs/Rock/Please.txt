For always I see you there
For always I hold your hand
For always be your man

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I had to go and
All is nothing without you, without you
Without you, without you

For always I see you there
For always I hold your hand
For always be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I had to go and
All is nothing without you, without you
Without you, without you

Please
Please
Please say something

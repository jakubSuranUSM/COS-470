What is romance
Without the one you love?
Well, it's heartbreak and misery
Without the one you love
You fool yourself and say
"I'll forget"
And knowing all the time that it's not so
Playing the lonely role of
Pagliacci
Crying all day and sad and hurting and much more
Life can seem so cruel
Without that one you love
You're like a dying rose of summer without the one you love
One telephone call (one telephone call)
One life (one life, that's all)
Could mean a world of difference (mean a world of difference)
Just like lovebirds you never
You'll never-ever, ever, ever know
But life can seem so lonely without the one you love
One, one telephone call (one telephone call)
You know that charge'll brighten me one line of change (one line, that's all)
All of this could mean a world of difference (mean a world of difference)
Just lovebirds, you'll never-ever-ever know
One life can seem so lo, so lonely
Without the one you love

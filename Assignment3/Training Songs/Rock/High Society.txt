It can be lonely up at the top 
Above your problems and your stress 
And if there's trouble then we will take a pill 
To find a high society 
Up in the air with your poverty 
And on the way to a Broadway play 
She bought whatever was in her way 
She got her hair done there on 
Crosby and prince a shave and a rinse 
Just for her high society 
She bought her high society

aah, life's much richer than the sound 
I feel us going up, the others going down and down 
This world is full of filthy sights 
I won't go out at night 
Unless the corners there are bright 
In light of high society 
She bought her high society 
Just for her high society

she took her way like a magistrate 
She bought whatever was in her way 
And paid for dinner 
With 200 dollar bills what a thrill 
To eat her high society 
She bought her high society

aah, life's much richer than the sound 
I feel us going up, the others going down and down 
This world is full of filthy sights 
I won't go out at night 
Unless the corners there are bright 
In light of high society 
She bought her high society 
Just for her high society

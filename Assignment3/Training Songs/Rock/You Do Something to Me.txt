You do something to me
Something deep inside
I'm hanging on the wire
For a love I'll never find

You do something wonderful
Then chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
That throws me back again

Hanging on the wire, yeah
I'm waiting for the change
I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
An' feel real again

Hanging on the wire, yeah
Said I'm waiting for the change
Oh, I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
An' feel real again

You do something to me
Somewhere deep inside
I'm hoping to get close to
A peace I cannot find 

Dancing through the fire, yeah
Just to catch a flame
Just to get close to
Just close enough 
To tell you that

You do something to me
Something deep inside

They got things to make us happy and they got things to make us sad
They do offer opportunities which may bring the good things
To the bad and lonely awful only

We know who we must believe in and we know ways to compromise
There's nothing that we don't know how it feels like
There's nothing that we haven't heard or seen and had and been at

All the things that we have said
They won't matter til we're dead
Even if we meant to make it better
I guess it's time to understand that this wasn't on the plan
Even if we meant to make it better

I know ways to make you happy
you've got your ways to make me sad
They built machines to bring the good things
Bring all the good things to the bad and lonely, awful only

All the things that we have said
They won't matter til we're dead
Even if we meant to make it better
I guess it's time to understand that this wasn't on the plan
Even if we meant to make it better

All the things that we have done
They won't matter til we're gone
Even if we meant to make it better
I guess it's time to understand that this wasn't on the plan
Even if we meant to make it better

I know ways to make you happy
you've got your ways to make me sad
They built machines to bring the good things
Bring all the good things to the bad and lonely awful only

We've got lost in the battle with rock'n' roll
We've got lost in the battle with rock'n' roll
We've got lost in the battle with rock'n' roll

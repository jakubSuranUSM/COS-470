Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kinda dry

Well, I never had me no money
Never had me no money
Never had me no money
I ain't that kinda guy

So, jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kinda dry

I'm gonna work 'til the good Lord calls me
Be workin' 'til the good Lord calls me
I'm gonna work until the good Lord calls me
It'll be in the by and by

So, jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
Jailer, bring me water
My throat is kinda dry

Now, jailer, should ya see my baby
Oh, jailer, if ya see my baby
Jailer, if you see my baby
Just tell her I said, "Goodbye"

Everybody singin'

Jailer, bring me water
Come on jailer, bring me
Jailer, bring me water
Come on jailer, bring me
Jailer, bring me water
Come on jailer, bring me
My throat is kinda dry

Ah, jailer, won't ya bring me some 
Bring me water
Jailer, won't ya bring me some 
Bring me water
Jailer, won't ya bring me water
My throat is kinda dry

Shake that fat in every direction
Move your smile across the floor
Tip your hat, the night is perfection
It's a funky music number
Who could ask for more?

Oh, me and my lady was down in the city
Our feet stuck in concrete and our heads in the fog
I must have been crazy, sure ain't no pity
Well, the dogs there live like people
And the people like dogs

Oh, they're jumping up north
They're trekking in the Delta
Standin' in Manhattan and L.A's got the blues
C'mon, shake that fat in every direction
When you're startin' foolish, you got nothin' to lose

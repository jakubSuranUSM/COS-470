Stick 'em up!

Undercover of the silver moon, run for cover,
There's a lover with a magic gun,
Gonna work you over, roll you in the clover.

'Cause he's a rock and roll outlaw with a six string gun, stealin' love for fun,
Sayin' c'mon baby, let's ride tonight, until the risin' sun

We gotta ride, ride, ride, ride, ride.

When I spot you, put your love in my hands, 'cause I got you,
When I catch you, won't know how to behave,
My heart is drummin', and trouble is comin'.

'Cause I'm a rock and roll outlaw with a six string gun, stealin' love for fun.
When I go down baby, goin' down for love, so let the beat go on,
Shoot 'em up now baby!

{Instrumental}

After midnight, when the beat is strong by the moonlight,
After midnight, though I know it's wrong,
I have me a lover, and then I start on another.

'Cause I'm a rock and roll outlaw with a six string gun, stealin' love for fun,
Sit back baby, 'cause I need all night, until the job is done.

And I'm a rock and roll outlaw with a six string gun, take your love and run,
Sayin' c'mon baby let's rock tonight, Well let the beat go on.

I'm a rock and roll outlaw, woo
Gonna roll you over, yeah
C'mon baby, yeah,
C'mon baby, well, well
Well I'm a rock, rock, rock ,rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
A rock and roll outlaw
C'mon baby, woo hoo!
Stick 'em up, woo hoo
Put your hands up high...

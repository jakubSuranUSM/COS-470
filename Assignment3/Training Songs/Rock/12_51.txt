Talk to me now I'm older
You're friend told you 'cause I told her
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me

We could go and get 40's
F*ck goin' to that party
Oh really, you're folks are away now?
Alright, lets go, you convinced me

12:51 is the time my voice
Found the words I sought
Is it this stage I want?

The world is shutting out for us
We were tense for sure
But we was confident

Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me

We would go and get 40's
Then wed go to some party
Oh really your folks are away now?
Alright I'm coming
I'll be right there

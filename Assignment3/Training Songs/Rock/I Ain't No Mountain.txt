Now it wasn't easy when you didn't mean much
And buried your feet and you lost your luck
You cheated someone then you strayed too far
Now you're on your own and you drive your car

I ain't no mountain for you to climb up
Ain't nobody that you can be
So don't make my bed for me to lie on
While I'm playing my outlaw rag

Oh you've seen some action, you know it's bad
All it seemed to tell you was 
What you all never had
Don't think so loudly as you drive your car
Or you'll blow your mind and I'll know who you are

I ain't no mountain for you to climb up
Ain't nobody that you can be
So don't make my bed for me to lie on
While I'm playing my outlaw rag

Some folks take their pleasure slow
Others like it fast
And some folks lose their futures
By living in the past

If you win by taking
You might lose your chance to win
And if you lose of heartache
You are bound to love again

To love again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To love again
To love again

Every single daytime
Loses out to night
And every bit of darkness
Well it uses up the light

You are my religion
Even though you're just a man
A man will go on loving
So we're about to lose again
Lose again

To lose again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To lose again
To lose again

Karin's meditating
And my dog is scratching flees
And me, I think too much
'Cause people think too much to see

We think too much of loving
And we lose more than we win
A woman dies of giving
But she's bound to live again

To live again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To live again
To live again

We think too much of loving
To love all that we can
A woman dies of giving
But she's bound to live again

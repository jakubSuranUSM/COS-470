Got this good feeling in me.
Now that everything's feeling clear inside.
Look around, that glow is real.
Silence felt so good,
Inside it lay so calm
Wind that blew some cold;
Now it feels a world away.
Not to try and just to be,
Someone truly special like you always were.

And when your time comes to work things out,
Your time will come to work things out when it flows

A passion came to me,
Warmth around, just like you found someone.
Alongside it walked with me,
Showed me to be grateful, for the way I am.
Came from deep inside.
Thoughts so real, just as the ground you're on.
Why do you want to try to be?
Look to yourself I think you'll find someone.

And when your time comes to work things out,
Your time will come to work things out when it flows.

It feels so close to me.

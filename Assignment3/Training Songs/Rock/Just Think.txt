What if everything was different
Never the same way twice
What would make a man go stiff rent
And disregard the price - yeah
Just think...
What if nothin' changed for the better
But never got no worse
Conversation beats a letter
A blessing beats a curse - yeah

What about the situation
In which it gets revealed
The secrets to negotiation
Of an emotional deal
Just think...

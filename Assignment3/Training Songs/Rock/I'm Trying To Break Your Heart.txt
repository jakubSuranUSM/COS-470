She kills them all in a heartbeat
And all the kids at the party
Wants to have her close, like a love overdose 
And something they couldn’t afford

It’s like they’re always waiting
On the streets, doing same things
Like a teenage dream in a fast machine
They used to watch the sky turn from blue to green

I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
And you think its love

Now they’ve left for a new place
All the kid’s found a new crave
They got blinded once, blinded twice
They can’t see for the light we put in their eyes
It’s like were always winning
But our heads are spinning
Because they made us two, like we’re made out of glue 
Like we’re used to

I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
And you think its love

I wanna be on my own
Without feeling lonely tough
And its not much to ask
You take what you’re given and give it back
All of that paradise glow
Got nowhere else to go
You wanna give em some hope
You wanna give em some hope

I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
I’m trying to break your heart
And you think its love

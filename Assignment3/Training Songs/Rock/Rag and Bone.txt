[Jack White and Meg White]
Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!
Rag and bone!

[Jack White]
Meg, look at this place.

[Meg White]
What? Woo...

[Jack White]
Well, this place is like a mansion!
It's like a mansion, look at all this stuff!

[Meg White]
I dunno...

[Jack White]
Look, I see something over there

[Meg White]
Woo...

[Jack White]
Man...

Well, could you ever sell it rag and bone?
Bring out your junk and we'll give it a home
A broken trumpet or a telephone
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me

Yeah

Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me

Oh, rag and bone
Rag and bone

Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to me

Oh, looking pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones

[Jack White]
Well, man, look at all this, you don't want it?

[Meg White]
Mmm, ooo, I could use that.

[Jack White]
You sure you don't want it, man? I could use... take it.
It's just things you don't want - I can use 'em; Meg can use 'em;
We can do something with 'em; we'll make something out of 'em,
Make some money out of 'em at least.

[Meg White]
Mmm-hmm, this fits me perfect.
Give it to me.

[Jack White]
Hey, if you ain't gonna use it, just give it to us.
We'll give it a home.

Well, have they got something shiny for me?
Anybody got a Christmas tree?
Can you party with a toilet seat?
Ah, jump up, ah, jump up, ah, jump up
Come on and give it to me

Rag and bone

We wanna get it, granny, while it's hot
You think it's trash, granny, but it's not
Oh, we'll be taking whatever you got
Ah, give up, ah, give up, ah, give up
Come on and give it to me

Woo!

Oh, looking pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones

[Meg White] 
I saw some stuff in your yard; are you gonna give it to us?

[Jack White]
Ah, Meg, don't be rude

[Meg White]
Or not?

[Jack White]
They might need it.
If you don't want it, we'll take it.
If you don't wanna give it to us, we'll keep walking by.
We'll keep going; we're not tired.
Got plenty of places to go, lots of homes we ain't been to yet
On the west side, the south-west side, Middle East, rich house, dog house, outhouse
Old folks' house, house for unwed mothers, halfway homes, catacombs, twilight zones.
Look at what techniques turn tables to gramophones.
So take a last lick of your ice-cream cone
And lock up what you still wanna own
But please be kind (take your time)
And don't rewind (it's fine)...

All of your pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones
Yeah, your pretty little rags and bones

Ah, jump up, ah, jump up, ah, jump up
Come on and give it to me

Oh, your pretty little rags and bones

Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on
Come on and give it to us!

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm walking with Sophie tonight, 
She lives in the air that I breathe; 
I can't get it out of my mind
How you were left to bleed 
Was it how you dressed?
Or how you act?
I can't believe
How they could act so violently, 
Without regret, 
Well, we will not forget 

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're not out there on your own
If you feel mistreated, 
Torn and cheated, 
You're not alone, 
We are the others (we are the others)

As simple as air in your lungs 
As simple as words on your lips 
And no one should take that away 
No one should argue this
Now with our heads up high
We'll carry on, 
And carry out, 
And we won't let them get us down, 
Wear us out, 
'Cause we are not alone 

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're not out there on your own
If you feel mistreated, 
Torn and cheated, 
You're not alone, 
We are the others (we are the others)

Normal is not the norm, 
It's just a uniform 
(We are the others)
Forget about the norm, 
(We're the outsiders)
Take off your uniform, 
(We are the others)
We are all beautiful, 
(We are the others)

We are the others, 
We are the cast outs, 
We're the outsiders
But you can't hide us, 
We are the others, 
We are the cast outs
You're not out there on your own
If you feel mistreated, 
Torn and cheated, 
You're not alone, 
We are the others (we are the others)
We are the others (we are the others)
We are the others

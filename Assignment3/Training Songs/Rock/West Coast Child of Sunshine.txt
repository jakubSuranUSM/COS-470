West coast child of sunshine
Every day's a po' man's blues
West coast child of sunshine
Every day's a po' man's blues
I been tied, hosed, and shanghaied
I'm tired of paying dues.

West coast child of sunshine
It must have been my love/hate blues
West coast child of sunshine
It must have been my love/hate blues
I been tied, hosed, and shanghaied
I'm playing this song for you.

Slice my brand
Said you'd stay with me till the very end
It was a lie
Completely, but I stuck it by
I'm here to love you
To make you feel good
The way you stuck me
I wish that we could
Get back together
And working on a smile
I feel the venom of the law.

I see the Western Nooga
The answer to keep me sane
I stood in Rasanooga de Angeles
To eat my brain
Got a snow job, Fall out
But I'm tired of playing games.

(Ah
I wanna see that west coast child of sunshine
I know that she lied
She said she'd stay with me till the very end
Ah)

I was a troubled soul
I had a worried mind
Drifting from place to place
I was the restless kind
Right there in front to me
Bright as the light of day
You saw a broken girl
You loved me anyway

And if I sprouted wings
I would not be amazed
Cause faith is a mystery that
Rocks me for days and days and day and
I could be in the street
I could be on a train
Or struck in some doorway down
In the pouring rain
Now there is not one place
That doesn't feel like home
No matter where I go
I know I'm not alone

[Chorus]
I've never been so sure of love

And if I sprouted wings
I would not be amazed
Cause faith is a mystery that
Rocks me for days and days and day
Oh you can ask me once
And I will tell you twice
No one's convincing me
This isn't paradise
And if I cause you pain
I'd only hurt myself
Cause we have a righteous love
I feel for on one else

[Chorus: x2]

Go watch the TV
Tell me what you see
All these bleeding wounds
And rising seas, they don't mean much to me
From the couch here, I plead apathy

The politicians, they don't speak for me
A wreck's a wreck, atleast that's what I see
And your faith you keep, is it dark now?
It's waiting for me

So stop the bad dreams
Stop the headaches
And leave a little light
Like when you say it's alright
Like when you say it's alright
Well, I guess it is

Go watch the TV
Tell me what you see
Any hope and love or realised dreams?
That's what I want to see
No more pain, no tears, no more grief

So stop the bad dreams
Stop the headaches
And leave a little light
Like when you say it's alright
Like when you say it's alright

So sing to me, I love it when
You sing to me, I love it when
You sing to me, I love it when
You sing to me, I love it when
You sing

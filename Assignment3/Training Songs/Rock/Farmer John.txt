Oh yeah, un huh, oh yeah, un huh
Mnnn, Farmer John I'm in love with your daughter
Woah, with the champagne eyes
She knows that I love her even though she tells me lies

I love the way she walk, the way she talk
She really makes me out, I'm gonna make her shout
Woah...

A looka here
Farmer John I'm in love with your daughter
Woah, with the champagne eyes
She knows that I love her even though she tells me lies

Come on and sing!
Oh yeah, un huh, oh yeah, un huh
Let's go!

Oh yeah un huh, oh yeah un huh

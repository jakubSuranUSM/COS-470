I grabbed a flashlight, just like I always do
A damp sorta night, and now I'm telling you, well
I saw a pair of eyes, and I'm sure they saw me too
Don't never never run, hell yes I'm going too

How long should I feel like bait now?
Wide open, careful where the mind goes
Moonlight, a superstitious glow
If it's my time, well I'm going out alone

You ever tried to hold your breath?
Well here's a tip, don't follow through
You feel the nightmares never end
And now it seems it's coming true
No one should see what I can see
It's up to you with weakened knees
That little creep just grabbed my arm
It's gonna be the longest night

How long should I feel like bait now?
Wide open, careful where the mind goes
Moonlight, a superstitious glow
If it's my time, well I'm going out alone

Alone, alone, alone

Night, you're a friend of mine, another family
Better not divide, any, armed, with its beastly doom
I'll beat this jackal down, this interference ends
Send it back beyond

When hunter, meets hunter, this hunter, eats hunter
When hunter, meets hunter, this hunter, eats hunter

How long should I feel like bait now?
Wide open, careful where the mind goes
Moonlight, a superstitious glow
If it's my time, well I'm going out alone

If it's my time
Well I'm going out alone

If it's my time
Well I'm going out alone

If it's my time
I'm going out alone

Gonna find it hard to sleep through it all
This rain veil's gonna fall
Walk behind him, sweet duress
Try to conduct yourself

Behind royal walls, blacked out eyes
A solitary bird, high tension line
Dreaming of a pure white sky
Did somebody stop the time?

(Twisting in)
Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride
Reached in, pulled out your life

Is this what you get in amoral times?
Used to burn, now no fire of life
Settle for the riches to be fed
Deliver to the valley of the bed

(Twisting in)
Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride
Reached in, pulled out your life

Living's so dangerous
Try to conduct yourself
Remember what your mother said
Try and use your heart, not head

(Twisting in)
Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride
Reached in, pulled out your life

(In)
Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride
Reached in, pulled out your life

Twisting in, twisting out the knife
Paying for your past crime
She'll make a darling bride

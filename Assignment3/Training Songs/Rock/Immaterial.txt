Baby, get out of here
I'm too far gone
For you and me it's too late
If you really want me to
I'll tell you what's wrong
I saw you and your date
Out of the corner of my eye
How did you know I was there that night?
Girl, no matter what you say
It won't help now
We've talked it out before
It's about time you faced reality
This is too big to ignoreHow is it we're always fair
In love and war
It's a clich
I don't want to hear anymore
They say, love is a changing game
It's you that are out to put the blame
Because it's
Immaterial immaterial
Immaterial
Immaterial immaterial
Immaterial
Baby, I'm running out of words to say
I'll be cool for now, but as for you
Hope there is something from our affair
Our trouble will renewHow is it we're always fair
In love and war
It's a clich
I don't want to hear anymore
They say, love is a changing game
It's you that are out to put the blame
Because it's
Immaterial immaterial
Immaterial
Immaterial immaterial
Immaterial

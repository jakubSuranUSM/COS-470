Well ooh ooh tell me, thousands cried holy
Battles of fortune, sons of our god
Daughter of zion, judah the lion
He redeemeth, and he brought us with his blood
John the revelator, great advocator
Gets 'em on the battle of zion
Lord, tellin' the story, raisin' the glory
Cried, "lord, don't you love some I"

Well moses to moses, watchin' the flock
Saw the bush where they had to stop
God told moses, "oh pull off your shoes"
Out of the flock, well you I choose
It's you I chose the tears of the angels
Burning down from heaven, 
Waiting for the love of god
Down for the glory, I'm telling the story
This is the story of us

Well who's that writin'?

It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
Holding me down
Turning me round
Filling me up with your rules

I've got to admit it's getting better
It's getting better all the time
I've got to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand

You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better
It's getting better all the time
I've got to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It' getting better all the time, better better, better
It' getting better all the time, better better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman I beat her and
Kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean, but I'm changing my scene and I'm doing the best that I can
I admit it's getting better
It's getting better all the time
I've got to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time

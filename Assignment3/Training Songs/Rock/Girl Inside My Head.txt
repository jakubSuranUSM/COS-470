When all is said and done
I wish I needed no one
Never was up to me
Just something in her way that sets me free
It seems so easy

And yeah I try to pay attention
But there's only four things running through my mind

How hard will it be if she is nice to me?
How bad will it get if I let her get to know me?
Should she see the willing dog or should I be a jungle cat?
And most of all, my god, how does she make her eyes do that?
And I don't need another girl inside my head
Girl inside my head

"Johnny, be brave." I say inside
As I won't take a bite from the apple that she gave me
But that's not what I'm after
Still all along, my mother's voice singing "Treat her like a lady"
And yeah I try to pay attention
But there's only four things running through my mind

How hard will it be if she is nice to me?
How bad will it get if I let her get to know me?
Should she see the willing dog or should I be a jungle cat?
And most of all, my god, how does she make her eyes do that?
And I don't need another girl inside my head
Girl inside my head

I'm not the only one to write her letters
It doesn't matter anyhow
The question isn't if but...

How hard will it be if she is nice to me?
How bad will it get if I let her get to know me?
Should she see the willing dog or should I be a jungle cat?
And most of all, my god, how does she make her eyes do that?

And I don't need another girl inside my head

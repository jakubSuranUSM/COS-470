No kiddin'
I'm ready to fight
I've been lookin' for my baby all night
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom, right here, out go the lights

No kiddin'
I'm ready to go
When I find her boy don't you know
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom, what is it, out go the lights

I thought I treat my baby fair
I just found out she don't want me here
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom, come on, out go the lights

I never felt this mad before
When I just found out she don't want me no more
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom, come on, out go the lights

No kiddin'
I'm ready to fight
I've been lookin' for my baby all night
If I get her in my sight
Boom boom, one more, out go the lights

Take it home

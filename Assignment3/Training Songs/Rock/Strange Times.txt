Kings and Sons of God,
Traveled on their way from here.
Calming restless mobs,
Easing all of their, all of their fear.

Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here

The statue in the square,
Meant so much when it first stood.
People come from far and near,
To bless them if, Bless them if it would.

Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here

Sadie, Dry Your Tears,
I will be the one.
To pull you through the Mere,
Before you come, before you come undone.

Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here
Strange Times Are Here

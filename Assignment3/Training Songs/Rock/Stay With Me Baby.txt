Where did you go when things went wrong now baby
Who did you run to and find a shoulder to lay your head upon

Baby, wasn't I there
Didn't I take good care of you
Oh no, I can't believe you're leaving me

Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby I can't go on

Who did you trust when you needed tenderness
I gave you so much and in return I found happiness

Baby, what did I do
Maybe, I was too good to you
Oh no, I can't believe you're leaving me

Remember, you said you'd never, never leave me
Remember, you said you're always gonna need me
Remember, remember
I'm askin' ya, beggin' ya, please, please

Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
Stay with me baby I can't go on

I'm running on empty alone in a steel cold town
The colours are fading to grey when you're not around

I'm going over what you said
The words keep ringing in my head
What happened to the promises
The promises we made

[Chorus]
You gave me frostbite in my heart
'Cause you had me branded from the start
Nobody knows what I'm going through (hey baby why..)
You gave me frostbite in my heart
'Cause you tore the love we had apart
Somebody tell me now what I should do

I'm driving alone with the radio on in my car
I'm staring at faces in places that used to be ours

Can't you see what you do to me
I'm drowning in my misery
That fatal kiss of destiny
Is clinging on for evermore

[Chorus]

(I had to let you know) I keep thinking of you
(I can't let go) You know it's all that I do
(I had to let you know) 'Cause you are still on my mind all the time
Don't leave me hanging
You had me branded (Branded from the start)

[Chorus]

Why leave me hanging... You had me branded
Don't keep me hanging on (Hey baby why...)

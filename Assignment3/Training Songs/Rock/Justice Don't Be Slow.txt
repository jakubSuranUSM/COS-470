I'm sorry to hear 'bout your problems
It came as a chock to us all
You know that we have always read
There's no way that you'd ever fall
Well, I grant you, it looks good on paper
But lately you've dropped out of sight
And we feel it's gone quite far enough
Don't you think that it's time now to light?
Justice, don't be slow
Everyone's here but you
You haven't got far to go
Now they make your life worth leaving
When they covered your face with their dung
Then they laughed while you lay floundering
Just hoping you'd swallow your tongue
Their hatchetmen bungled your mansion
And throttled your sons in the night
Their foot soldiers pummeled your daughter
God dammit, your vengeance is right.
Well, now that you've caught your tormentor
He still won't admit to his sin.
He claims he was busily sleeping 
While his henchmen were doing you in
But all of this high-ranking jesters
Have turned into sniveling louts
They're pleading for mercy and freedom
I say throw all those hooligans out!

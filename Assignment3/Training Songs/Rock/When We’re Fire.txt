Wake up
I've been trying to make your pain stop
This is not just entertainment
I've been trying to let you know

Lately
Nothing has been coming easy
Only nocturnal blue movies
Pink kimono on the floor

Even when you won't believe me
Try to make it easy, easy

Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved
Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved

Distress
From the past or from my weakness
I can take you through the darkness
I can help you let it go

Damage
Why the f*ck did you just say that
I'm a person not a concept
Work it out or let me go

Even when you won't believe me
Try to make it easy, easy

Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved
Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved

Oh, you never know
Oh, you never know
You never know

Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved
Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved

Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved
Even when we're fire
Even then you never loved
You never loved

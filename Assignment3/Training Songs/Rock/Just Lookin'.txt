There's things I want 
There's things I think I want 
There's things I've had 
There's things I want to have 
Do I want the dreams 
The ones we're forced to see 
Do I want the perfect wife 
The word perfect ain't quite right 
Shopping every day 
Take it back the next break 
They say the more you fly the more you 
Risk your life 
I'm just looking I'm not buying 
I'm just looking keeps me smiling 
A house I seen another could'a been 
You drenched my head and said what I said 
You said that life is what you make of it 
Yet most of us just fake 
I'm just looking, I'm not buying 
I'm just looking, keeps me smiling

On top of the world like a flag on a mountain
Feeling so high you can feel so alone
Unable to breathe at the height that you flew
Staring on clouds with no view of below

On top of a girl like a dream in a hotel
Falling towards something out of control
Unable to miss like the man in a tram
Crashing your car in Amsterdam

He did it without knowing
He didn't feel pain
He just wrecked it and kept going

The space around the stars
Is something that you know
A billion miles of darkness
Left you feeling low

The space around the stars
Is something that you know
Everything about you
Is so perfectly restrained
But everything inside you, bites you

Everybody in the whole of the world
Feels the same inside, woah woah
Everybody in the whole of the
Whole of the, whole of the world
Everyone is only everyone else
Everybody's got to know, know
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies
Everybody in the whole of the world
We're the same inside, woah woah

Everybody in the whole of the
Whole of the, whole of the world
Everyone is only everyone else
Everybody's got to know, know
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies
Everybody in the whole of the world
In the whole of the world
In the whole of the world
Everybody we're the same inside
We're the same inside
In the whole of the world

High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can

Are You Sleeping with her
Are You Sleeping with her
Tell me now
Are You Sleeping with her
because I am, you know I am.

I see her strength in your eyes,
yeah there she is.
I hear her breath in the silence,
upon her lips.
Are You sleeping with her,
because I am, you know I am.

Spare me the lies,
and all your time
I won't be cold and rude, Don't fight.

Chorus:
Tell me everything,
what's going on? Tell me all about it.
Tell me has she broke your heart and cut the line.
I wouldn't doubt. 
Tell me everything,
Leave nothing out. Tell me all about it.
I'm right here listening you so tell me everything

Have you fallen for her.
I mean really fallen for her.
Tell me now.
Have you fallen for her, just like I have.
You know I-

Loosing a friend is hard enough,
I want to know have I lost my love?

Chorus to fade

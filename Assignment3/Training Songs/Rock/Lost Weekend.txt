It took a lost weekend in a hotel in Amsterdam
And double pneumonia in a single room
And the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now, may I please laugh along with you?

This morning I woke up from a deep unquiet sleep
With ashtray clothes and miss lonelyheart's pen
With which I wrote for you a love song in tattoo
Upon my palm, 'twas stolen from me when Jesus took my hand

You see, I
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces so easily

I was a king bee with a head full of attitude
Wore my heart on my sleeve like a stain
And my aim was to taboo, you
Could we meet in the marketplace
Did I ever, hey please, did you wound my knees?

You see, I
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces, yes

Yeah, easy, there's nobody else to blame
I hang my head in a crying shame (shame)
There's nobody else to blame
Nobody else except my sweet self, oh

It took a lost weekend in a hotel in Amsterdam
Twenty four gone years to conclude in tears
That the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now, may I please laugh along, oh

I was a king bee with a head full of attitude
An ashtray heart on my sleeve, wounded knees
And my one love song was a tattoo upon my palm
You wrote upon me when you took my hand

You see, I
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces too easily
Too easily
Too easily

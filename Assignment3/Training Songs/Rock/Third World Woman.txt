What if I were that mother staring from my TV
What if that were my brown-eyed baby
Hungry as she could be
What if that were my family
What if that was my world
Waiting on water waiting on a vaccine
Waiting on someone to bring me a bag of beans

Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me

What of I was that mother and I was waiting on me
The big success so well dressed on the other side of the sea
Living with my distractions
Life's been good to me
Maybe she's praying
Praying for a miracle
Maybe the answer is me

Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me

Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me

I was born in Georgia where I could do as I pleased
And I can get my hands on just about anything I might need
Who's that third world woman
Maybe she could be
Could be mother, could be daughter
Could be sister to me

Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me

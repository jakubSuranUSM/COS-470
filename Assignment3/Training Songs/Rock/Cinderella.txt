I'm on a roll
Everything I touch turns to shh...
It's taking it's toll
Can anybody get me off it?
Stuck on a roll
And it's wearing thin

I remember the night
No wet eyes, no crossroads
No mention of fate
Just a poor decision

I shouldn't have gone
Even though my head would bust
I shouldn't have gone

Be careful what you hope and you pray for
You know you only get what you pay for

And I can hear the ticking of time bombs
For poor Cinderella

I'm on a roll
Everything I touch turns to gold
It's taking its toll
Can anybody get me off it? 

I shouldn't have gone
Even though my head was busting
I shouldn't have gone

Be careful what you hope and you pray for
You know you only get what you pay for
And I can hear the ticking of time bombs
The clock strikes
It's midnight
For poor Cinderella

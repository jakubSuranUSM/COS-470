People of the Earth can you hear me?
Came a voice from the sky on that magical night
And in the colors of a thousand sunsets
They traveled through the world on a silvery light
--More--(51%) 
The people of the Earth stood waiting
Watching as the ships came one by one
Setting fire to the sky as they landed
Carrying to the world Children Of The Sun

All at once came a sound from the inside
Then a beam made of light hit the ground
Everyone felt the sound of their heartbeat
Every Man - Every Woman - Every Child

They passed the limits of imagination
Through the doors - to a world - of another time
On the journey of a million lifetimes
With the Children Of The Sun - They started their climb

No more gravity, nothing holding them down
Floating endlessly, as their ship leaves the ground
through the walls of time - at the speed of light
Fly the crystal ships on their celestial flight
On their celestial flight.

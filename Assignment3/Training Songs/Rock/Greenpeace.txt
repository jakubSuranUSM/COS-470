Man 1:
I don't like the world I see
So I'll avert my gaze to the TV
I'm too cool to get involved
Someone else can change the channel for me
Man 2:
Gonna suck the juices out of this world
Gonna treat her rough
It's all she deserves
She's so cold to me
Gonna rape this world
With my straight lines
Gonna straighten her out
Because nature is just history
There's a hole in my heart
Your so cruel to me
There's a hole in my heart
>From your industry
There's a hole in my heart
Man 1:
It's no use to get involved
You'll never stop the world from turning
I just want to rest in peace
I can't stop the world from burning
Man 2:
Gonna test my bombs wherever I want,
Gonna poon the whale
Gonna drain the swamp
It's money to me
Gonna f*ck with genes
I am what I am
Much more than a God
Much less than a man of industry
There's a hole in my heart
Your so cruel to me
There's a hole in my heart
>From the industry
There's a hole in my heart

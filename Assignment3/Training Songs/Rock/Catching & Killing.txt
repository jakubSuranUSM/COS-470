Compression, sustain,
Impression, remain.
I am not a guilty sentence.
Well I just get up and switch it off.
Separate temptations, standard frustrations.
Oh, you know I look inside
There's nothing in there.
All you parasites, you done schedule
You solitary man, sit in your territorial machine.
I need you to tell me this is wrong.

Catching and killing
No I,
Feel like a winner

Tapestry in the lounge room.
Talk back rejects
Tell me your name
A man sits at his computer,
And moves infinitesimally.

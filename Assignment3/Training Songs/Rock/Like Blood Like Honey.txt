You want to catch your breath you want to get out
But as you surface you don't really know how
How to live upon the solid ground
Sometimes it's easier to let yourself drown

LOVE IS
THICK LIKE
BLOOD LIKE
HONEY

You cannot spell it out there are no words
Mrs Johnson never taught me those verbs
On how to give myself and how to receive
It is something that's inside of you and me

LOVE IS
THICK LIKE
BLOOD LIKE
HONEY

Forget everything you ever learned
No one listens when you want to be heard
Just bleed the bittersweet

Seven sunrises and seven more nights
You'd think that we could learn to do it right
If nothing changes then I'm gonna stop
But do I really have a choice?
I think not

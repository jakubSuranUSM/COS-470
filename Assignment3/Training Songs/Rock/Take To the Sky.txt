Blue sky morning, red sky night
Sailor take warning when the eagle takes flight
If I had wings I would delight and fly away
Black cloud riding on the cotton fields back home
Every man's an island in the desert of his soul
Take to the sky, there's nowhere else to go
And fly away

I can remember all the days of my life
Cold, dark September
When the eagle took flight
I had to stay, I had to stay
I cried a river to the empty sky
Someone deliver me by and by
I'll fly away, l'll fly away

It don't take nothing to be lonely
It comes too easy to be holy
It does nothing for the soul
But tear holes in tomorrow

Somebody, somebody said I don't want to be
Nobody said I don't want to see
Nobody said I don't want to need
Nobody said nothing at all
Sitting and waiting for the axe to fall

Sun come raining, lighten up the day
I ain't complaining I got nothing to say
I'll fly away, I'll fly away
If I had the courage to be flying blind
I'd fly too high to buy my way home

Somebody wants somebody to be lonely
And nobody settling only for love
How much time can you borrow?
Making it easy to lie, faking it on the sly
Shaking and stammering
Taking it up to the sky
Hammering nails in tomorrow

Sun come raining lighten up the sky
I ain't complaining, I get no reply
I'll fly away, I'll fly away
When I get the courage to be flying blind
I'll fly to high to buy my way home

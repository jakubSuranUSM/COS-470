New town
There's a place
A mad affair
In a new world

Heaven send
A life that's made for us
Out of luck
Out of touch
Out of love

No concrete jungle
Dancing feet
Cul-de-sac of desire
Is in itself

Destroying me
I've got to live down
Don't want to dwell in history
That's why I'm leaving now

New town
There's a place
To do or die
In a new world

Heaven sent
A life that's made for us
Out of luck
out of touch
Out of love

No laughing boys
Forbidden dreams
No willow weep
For me now

The shadow hanging over me
I've got to tear it down
New town calling me

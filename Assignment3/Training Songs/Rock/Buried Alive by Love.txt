I carry the burden of losing rest
Upon my shoulders
And its weight seems unbearable
Your tomb is where your heart is
I should have told her
But within me hid a secret so terrible

To cry is to know that you're alive
But my river of tears has run dry
I never wanted to fool you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love

If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
If I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile

If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
If I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile

The kiss of vanity blessed me with, spiritual murder
And fed the gods of war insatiable
Your home is where the dark is, I should have told her
And embrace the fire indestructible

To die is to know that you're alive
And my river of blood won't run dry
I never wanted to lose you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love

If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
If I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile

If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
If I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile

Oh, it seems to cry is to know that you're alive
And my river of tears has run dry
I never wanted to fool you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And a deserted soul is gone
A cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love

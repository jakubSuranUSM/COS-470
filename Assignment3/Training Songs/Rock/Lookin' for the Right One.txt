I've been so unlucky, I'm no good at playing games,
I remember their faces; forget their names.
Thought I'd found the right one, but she hasn't found me,
So I bundle up my emotions and start,
Looking For The Right One.
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm Looking For The Right One,
When will the right one come along?
They say there's no use runnin' after something you'll never get,
But my heart says, "Don't say no."
Somewhere in this lonesome city is the woman for me,

But would I wait another lifetime just to keep on
Looking For The Right One,
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm Looking For The Right One,
When will the right one come along?
They say love always comes and goes,
Well, that I already know. Yes, I really know.
Looking For The Right One,
But will the right one ever come along?
Looking For The Right One,
But will the right one come along?

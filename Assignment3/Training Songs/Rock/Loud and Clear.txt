I hope that you miss me 
Put me down on history
I feel such a reject now
Ger yourself a life
I hope that you're sorry 
For not accepting me
For not adoring me
That's why I'm not your wife

People are stranger
People in danger
People are stranger 
People deranged or.

I remember there was 
Nothing I could ever do
Never could impress you
Even if I tried
Tell somebody who cares
Fill the room with empty stares
Go to bed and say my prayers 
Keep them satisfied

People are stranger
People in danger
People are stranger
People deranged

Loud and clear I make my point dear

I hope that you never
Get the things that you wanted to 
Now I cast a spell on you
Complicate your life
Hope you get a puncture
Everywhere you ever drive
Hope the sun beats down on you
And skin yourself alive

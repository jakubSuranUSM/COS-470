So dramatic when you called
So dramatic going down
So dramatic when you sang
It’s the best you ever get
Ever get

Next summer I will return
I’ll be back
I’ll break your heart
I’ll break your heart
When next summer starts

Next summer I will return
I’ll be back
You'll crash and burn
Now it's your turn
To crash and burn

And you’ll be just like a hurricane
Ruining everything

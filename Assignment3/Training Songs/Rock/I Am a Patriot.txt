And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
Someday

I was walking with my brother
and he wondered what's on my mind
I said, What I believe in my soul
ain't what I see with my eyes
And we can't turn our backs this time

I am a patriot and I love my country
Because my country is all I know
I want to be with my family
people who understand me
I've got nowhere else to go

And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
Someday

And I was talking with my sister
she looked so fine
I said, Baby, what's on your mind
She said, I want to run like the lion
released from the cages
Released from the rages
burning in my heart tonight, yeah

And I ain't no Communist and I ain't no Capitalist
And I ain't no Socialist and I ain't no Imperialist
And I ain't no Democrat so I ain't no Republican
I only know one party and it is freedom

I am, I am, I am
I am a patriot and I love my country
Because my county is all I know

And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
Someday

And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
And the river opens for the righteous
I want to run like the lion
Released from the cages
Released from the rages
I said what I believe in my soul
Ain't what I see with my eyes
Someday
Someday
Someday
Someday
Someday

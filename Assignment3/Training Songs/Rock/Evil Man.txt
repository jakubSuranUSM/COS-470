Born to refuse, and raised to exclude
Fed myths to disprove by post-colonial prudes:
The city was evil, some country was evil, the hippies were evil,
The writers were evil, the homeless were evil, the workers were evil
The summer was evil, independence was evil

Grown and released with the heart of a thief
Wanting only to seek the very gentlest of streets where
Nobody's evil, nobody's evil....
So easy to hate / Just look at the face

The nose in the clouds / The bulge in the brow
And the head on backwards
The need to escape all visible space / Continuous drift to depend and dismiss
And the head on backwards

(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, man we'll get even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!

Here comes the fun / Blink and it's gone
See what you've won / The end's just begun
I am the demon, I am the demon...
The morning is hell / The night full of blood

Each sickening smell announces a flood / in a human holiday
No wall at the back / No light on the map
No fiction, no fact / no fibre now...chaff / in the human holiday--see

(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil demon, quit while you're even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!

I'm clearing my desk / It's time for a rest
Tomorrow is dead, so the worms have been fed
With the head on that wards
The washing of hands / The kissing of feet

The failure which brands / Nightmare without sleep
To any fool with a grievance, it's open season!

(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, quit while you're even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!

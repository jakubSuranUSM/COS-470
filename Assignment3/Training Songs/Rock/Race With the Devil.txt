Well I've led an evil life, so they say 
But I'll hide from the devil on judgement day, I said 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line, oh yeah 

Well me and the devil, at a stop light 
He started rollin', I was out of sight, I said 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line, oh yeah 

Well, goin' pretty fast, looked behind 
A-hear come the the devil doin' ninety-nine, I said 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line, oh yeah 

Well thought I was smart, the race was won 
A-hear come the devil doin' a-hundred and one 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line 

Well, goin' pretty fast, looked behind 
A-hear come the the devil doin' ninety-nine, I said 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line, oh yeah! 

Well I've led an evil life, so they say 
But I'll hide from the devil on judgement day, I said 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move, hot-rod, move man 
Move hot-rod, move me on down the the line

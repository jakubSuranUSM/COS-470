Sometimes I think about the way my life is supposed to be
That I am what I am and that's enough for me
I'm doin' fine, I'm doin' alright
Gonna be with my baby tonight

You can make it, you can break it,and you can be what you wanna be
I'm happy with the world around, it's good enough for me
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I'm doin' alright
Gonna be with my baby tonight

No worries, feeling fine
When she's by my side
No worries, that girl is mine
And she'll be by my side

You can make it, you can break it,and you can be what you wanna be
I'm happy with the world around, it's good enough for me
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I'm doin' alright
Gonna be with my baby tonight

You can make it, you can break it,and you can be what you wanna be
I'm happy with the world around, it's good enough for me
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I'm doin' alright
Gonna be with my baby tonight
Gonna be with my baby tonight
I wanna be with my baby tonight

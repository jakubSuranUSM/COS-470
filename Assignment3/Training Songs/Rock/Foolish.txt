It would be nice to breathe
[it would be] nice to breathe
[it would be] be nice to [leave] sometimes
Nail the windows shut
Leave on the [heat]
We have bowls to burn up and back
It would be nice to breathe
It would be nice to leave sometimes
I remember Miami beach
I remember you under the umbrella
I remember dc
I remember you with your bicycles
It would be nice to leave
It would be nice to breathe sometimes
It would be nice to leave
It would be nice to bring it all back
Unfold the map again and drive
Take 40
Take 95
It'd be nice to leave
It'd be nice to breathe sometimes
I remember our lies
I remember the liquor I helped you buy
I remember no lights
I remember you with your glasses off
I remember TV
I remember the couch sucking me in
I remember dc
I remember wanting you to laugh again
I remember how foolish I was
It would be nice to breathe
It would be nice to leave sometimes

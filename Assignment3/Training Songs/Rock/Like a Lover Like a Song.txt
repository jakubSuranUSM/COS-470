I don't want to talk about it anymore
When there's nothin' goin' on, and somethin' should be done
'Cause we believed for nothin' it seems
And now it's ended broken-hearted
And as anyone can see, there was no way we'd agree

And we can get there if we try
And I want to live if I have to die
And it'll come so sweet and softly, like a song
And really turn me on, like a lover like a song
Really turn me on
Turn me on

It seems there's somethin' deep inside of you
And I can tell that you've been lonely
And you've had hard times too
'Cause we believed for nothin', it seems
And now it's shattered all apart, like a broken heart
It's the end, it's a start

And we can get there if we try
And I want to live if I have to die
And it'll come so sweet and softly, like a song
And really turn me on, like a lover like a song
Really turn me on
Really turn me on

And there's somethin' inside that's been burnin'
And there's somethin' inside I've been learnin'
And I can't hide 'cause it's all over me
And deep inside of you, inside of you
Deep inside of you, inside of you

I don't want to talk about that anymore
When there's nothin' goin' on
And somethin' should be done
'Cause we believed for nothin', it seems
And now it's ended broken-hearted
And as anyone can see, there was no way we'd agree

And we can get there if we try
And I want to live if I have to die
And here's a chance for you to see
What this pain's been doin' to me
And I want to lose it everyone
And have a heartache on the run
And we can get there if we try
And I want to live if I have to die
If I have to die, if I have to die

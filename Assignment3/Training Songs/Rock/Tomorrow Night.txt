When I wake up in your bed,
I can still hear what you said.
Like a bad dream I can't fight,
Tomorrow Night.

Am I lying here next to you?
Am I thinking I need to
Really love you? Do it right,
Tomorrow Night.

Time goes so slow when you're gone.
Days turn to years, it seems so long.

If you still feel like today,
If tomorrow's the same way,
Then I know it'll be right,
Tomorrrow Night.

Can't you trust me to see it through?
Can't you wait 'till I see you?
When you're working, you're uptight,
Tomorrow Night.

Time goes so slow when you're gone.
Days turn to years, it seems so long.

When I wake up in your bed,
I can still hear what you said.
Like a bad dream I can't fight,
Tomorrow Night.

Am I lying here next to you?
Am I thinking I need to
Really love you? Do it right,
Tomorrow Night.

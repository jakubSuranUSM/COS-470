I type at will? 
Knobby nose 
Take my pillow when I'm well 
Ain't I nice 
You see it's mind over meal 
And it's trying still 
If you're trying for me 
Maybe you could try and listen to 
My cliche 
And I said you 
You got these pictures 
You know them 
Each as each other 
'cause I'm kind of ashamed 
To be leavin' all I've gained 
Here she be leavin' me nice 
Way beyond this sacrifice 
My cliche 
Bring me a vodka on ice 
Even I can't pay that price 
I've got these pictures of you 
Being nice at the same time 
My cliche 
I've been talking to you and I've been talking to you 
Quick there goes my mind 
Dry bones and blisters 
It's these little things, little things 
That made me cry 
Leave me at will 
It's these little things we all feel 
I've got something to say 
And it will not go away 
My cliche

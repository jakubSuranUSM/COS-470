Converted to addiction
So easy to complain
I haggle to decipher it
Consume what I have claimed
Attending on a minute
Transcend that I am here
Engage me with a purple mind
And struggle for your fear

In here
I hated my awareness
A creature with a spine
Some maze me with their footsteps
And others still deny
Distracted for a second
I tremble cause I'm scared
So rarely done to act like milk
Insist me to despair

It's so cosy in hell
I'm wondering about the things she tells
Perverted like a wisdom
This witness on a scale
Remove me like a headless frog
Deceived but no one wailed
I collapsed into addiction

Impressions don't exist
You're talking about a compromise
Erase me from your list
It's so cosy in hell
I'm wondering about the things she tells?

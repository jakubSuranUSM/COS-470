Can you feel a wind blowing 
Got me talking to myself 
One more day, one more truth, got to find out where 
Feel the blow of the river taking me there 
Good Lord only get you so far, then you got to help yourself 
I don’t need no reason, reason to hang my head 

'Cause I gotta get over 
(Get on over to the good side) 
Lord I gotta get over 
(Get over, you get a lil’ closer) 
I gotta get over 
(Getting closer to the good side) 
Gotta get over 
(Getting over, over) 

I’ve been breaking like the waves upon the sand 
You know I need some fortitude, gonna keep it close at hand 
And I gotta shake it if I’m gonna break it on down the line 
Ain’t nobody can help me if I stay helpless all the time 

I gotta get over 
(Get on over to the good side)
Gotta get over 
(Help me get a little closer) 
I gotta get over 
(Getting closer to the good side) 
Lord I gotta get over 
(Getting over, over)

When the local population starts to worry about your mood
Starts to wonder why the clouds are in your eyes
You can tell them that it's the flowers or the cinder in the air
But don't let on what's under your disguise

Hey 

I can't reveal what's inside or behind me and
Thoughts that are real I can't feel 
They won't find me

Hey

Put the clock back on the wall!
I've been away where the night meets the morning
Flashes of gray bring the day and it's warning me. 

Hey

Put the clock black on the wall!

When the local populations starts to act a little strange.

Starts to make you giggle to yourself inside, and he'll ask you why you're laughing as he laughs along with you, you don't know but you both laughed so hard you cried, 

Hey

Put the clock back on the wall!

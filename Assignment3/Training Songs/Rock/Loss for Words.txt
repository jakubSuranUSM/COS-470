I'm at a loss, 
I'm at a loss for words, I really want to say
I'm finding for myself
What can I do 
When every road I travel leads me back to you 
Instead of somewhere else
I apologize 

[Chorus]
Cause what I wanted to say 
Never came out the way
I wanted it to, I wanted it to 
Cause what I wanted to say 
Only got in the way
I never meant to hurt you 
But I didn't have a clue 

I'm just a man 
I'm just a man in need of something better than
I'm finding for myself 
You count the cost 
For everything you gain there's always something lost 
You're worth so much more
Listen to my heart whispering
I need you 

[Chorus]

Empty words cannot suffice
I've been runnin' from what I know is right 
When only Yours are words of life 

[Chorus]

Every time you come around 
Every time I make a sound

Hey! Do you believe there's anything
Beyond troll-guy reality?
I do. I do. I do

It gets so hard, just to be okay
Sometimes being happy, baby
Is what I'm most afraid of
Baby, you know
It gets so hard for me to fight
I don't know why, I guess I never did
Why don't you show me now
How to lose control

She's so very I don't care
She's so very I don't care

Just cause my world, sweet sister
Is so fucking goddamn full of rape
Does that mean my body
Must always be a source of pain?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

She's so very I don't care
She's so very I don't care

Just cause I named it right here, sweet chickadee
Don't mean for a minute you should think
I'm the opposite of anything
But if you want to know for sure, I'll tell you
We're not going to prove nothing, nothing
Sitting around, watching each other starve
What we need is action/strategy
I want, I want, I want, I want
I want it now

I believe in the radical possibilities of pleasure, babe
I do. I do. I do

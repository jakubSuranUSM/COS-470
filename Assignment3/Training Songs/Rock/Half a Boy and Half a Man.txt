You'd better run
You'd better hide

You'd better lock you house and keep the kids inside.
Here come the twentieth century's latest scam
He's a half a boy and half a ma
He ain't a fool but he's a tool

Because his left don't know what his right hand's doin'.
He'd keep a King Kong eating out of the palm of his hand

Now he's a half a boy and half a man.

Or else the S.P.G. 's gonna clear the streets.
They never made no provision in the original plan for half a boy and half a man
When his fingers do the walking in the middle of the night.
When his people stalk in, baby
Let me tell you, nothing comes out right.
Best be fleet up on your feet

When his fingers do the walking in the middle of the night

You'd better run
You'd better hide

He's a half a boy and half a man
He's a half a boy and half a man

He's a half a boy and half a man, come on.

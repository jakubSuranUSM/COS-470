I hear you
Been comin' 'round
I feel you, just by the sound
I want you, just like a pill
I feed you, need to just for the thrill
Come undo me like the way you used to do
Come abuse me like I want you to

Get in, get out
For a little while
Get in, get out
Yeah
Get in get out
For a little while

You let me in without a doubt
Now, open the door, get in, get out
I see you shaking
Hold my hand
I'll make you take you any way I can
Only for a moment
Don't let it pass
It's time to get up off your ass
Don't you worry; I won't tell no one you're here
Stay a little while, then you can disappear
You know what I'm talking about

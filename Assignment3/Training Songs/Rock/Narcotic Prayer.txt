As the party closes
I ain't got a clue
Red and yellow roses
Nipple rings and tattoos

Well, I never met no girl
No one, no where
I never met no girl
Narcotic prayer

If I seen her breathing
How could I adjust
Should I see her bleeding
Calling me in trust

Well, I never met no girl
No one, no where
Narcotic prayer

I copped and caught a movie
But you know it can't last
Lights come up
And I just crashed

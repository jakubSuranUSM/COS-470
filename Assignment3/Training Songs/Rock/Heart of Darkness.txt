Blood flows just like water,
Changing into wine.
Everything looks better in the black sunshine,
In the black sunshine.

Echoes drag my memories
Back where they began
But I just can't be sorry - my tears turn into sand.
All those tears torn into sand.

I don't care now
For what might have been,
The heart of darkness doses in on me.

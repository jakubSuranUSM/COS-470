While you sit and seek a crescent moon is laying
At your feet
With hope that's made of sand
It don't think you can

But you have held it all in your hands
Verse 2 (strings enter):

But from the start

I've seen where it goes
Still somehow my love for you grows, Lady-o

        So on my heels  I'll grow wings
        Gonna ride  silver srings
        But I'l l see you in my holiest dreams, Lady

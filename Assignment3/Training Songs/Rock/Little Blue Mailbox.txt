Little blue mailbox, wonder if you'll have the next letter
Little blue mailbox, wonder if you'll ever make me feel better
Looking at the streetlight, when it's lit there'll be a night waiting
I fumble with the paper, see the words you wrote are already fading
I’ve been waiting all this time for a letter
My insides shaking, will this feeling last forever
I’ve been waiting

Staring in the mirror did you finds another true beauty
A girl with bluer eyes and
A girl who never tired and moody
Time on my mind, it's a funny thing
I just wanna hear you
The words that you sent are the only thing that makes me feel near you
I’ve been waiting all this time for a letter
My insides shaking, will this feeling last forever
I’ve been waiting
I’ve been waiting

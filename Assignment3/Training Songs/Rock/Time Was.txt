Time was
When we had fun on the school swings,
When we exchanged graduation rings
One lovely yesterday.
Time was
When we wrote love letters in the sand,
Or lingered over coffee and
Dreamin' our time away.

Picnics and hay rides
And midwinter sleigh rides,
And never apart.
Hikes in the country;
There's more than one tree
On which I've a place in your heart!

Darlin',
Every tomorrow will be complete
If all our moments are half as sweet
As all our time was then!

Picnics and hay rides
And midwinter sleigh rides,
And never, never apart.
Those hikes in the country;
And there's more than one tree
On which I've a place in your heart!

Darlin',
Oh, every tomorrow will be complete
If all our moments are half as sweet
As all our time was then!

Yeah go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead
Go, go, go, go right ahead
Down the streets in a UFO
Go right ahead, find a bull and you grab the horns
Go right ahead, spin your head up at the day you were born

Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead,
Go, go, go, go right ahead

Here’s a secret keep it tight, go right ahead
It’s California late at night, go right ahead
Go right ahead, we’re gonna drink, f*ck and fight all night
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead go

You should turn around, you never know
Soldiers come along
I wanna show you
Our god is a sinner, our king is a god
The room’s about to crumble as I go to the phone
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead
You gotta go from A to Z from when your gone until your dead

Go right ahead, go right ahead
Go, go, go, go right ahead

Like a tiger taking out of the sewer, go right ahead
Do anything that you wanna do, go right ahead
Do as you are they want to to
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead go

You should turn around, you never know
Soldiers come along, I wanna show you
Our god is a sinner, our king is a god
The room’s about to crumble as I go to the phone

Go right a
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead
Go right ahead,
You gotta go from A to Z from when your gone until your dead
Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead

Down the streets in a UFO
Find a bull and you grab the horns
Go right ahead
Spin your head up at the day you were born

Go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead, go right ahead go

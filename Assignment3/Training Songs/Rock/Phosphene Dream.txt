The sky is blue and you are too
I feel like running
Your eyes are red and mine are too
I feel like laughing
The wind sayin' nothing, nothing at all
It all meant someone was gonna fall

In the middle of summer
No one haunts me like you do

Mom and dad look old again
Where am I heading?
My two sisters miss me yes,
Without me knowing
It all meant something,
Something to us all
The wind said nothing,
Nothing at all

In the middle of winter
No one haunts me like you do
In the middle of winter
No one haunts me like you

Our president then was dead to us
Hallelujah!
He takes his pills so he can kill
Praise the bible

I need no pills to kill
Hallelujah!
I need no pills to kill
Raise the rifle

Oh, the phosphene dream,
The phosphene dream
Oh, the phosphene,
The phosphene dream
Oh, the phosphene dream,
The phosphene dream
Oh, the phosphene dream,
The phosphene

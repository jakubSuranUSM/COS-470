Who sees you when you're sleeping?
Who knows the thoughts you're keeping?

You're reaching out your hand 'cause someone's calling.
Don't open your eyes too soon, 'cause it might be me.

The darkened sidestreets that you've taken.
Faces all around say you're forsaken.
You see yourself and someone else behind you.
Don't open your eyes too soon, it might not be me.

[Chorus]
Haunted by my broken dreams.
Haunted by my empty screams.

Creeping cautions 'round the corner,
Climbing slowly out the window.
Running fast but getting nowhere.
Don't know if I'll ever make it back alive.

[Chorus]

Shitfaced, fumbling in a dark place, drinking in the last days
This street looks just like the next street, bumblefuck on repeat
This time you should have stopped but where’s the fun?
The outcome, the only friend you ever had is setting off with a rich son
So sure she was like a brother ’til you dropped another
So sure you kept it under covers, until you knew you loved her
Now you can’t think straight, because you’re not straight
In the back of her mothers car
No secret’s too safe, and how you can’t stay
In the back of her mother’s car
No secret’s too safe, and how you can’t stay
Higher than the stars.

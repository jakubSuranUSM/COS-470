'Round about '20 the folks had plenty
No, they couldn't ask for too much more
The father kept thumpin' and the satch got jumpin'
And they rang right through with a roar
Then around '30 when things got dirty
All the players meant a whole lot more
The duke got stompin' and the count started rompin'
And what do you think it was for?

They put power in the music, and boy, you oughta hear it now
They put power in the music, the boys are gonna show you how

'Round about '40 when things got sporty
They were dancin' every night till dawn
The bird got 'em hoppin' with his crazy be-boppin'
And frankie crooned on and on
Then around '50 when folks got nifty
They were gettin' round to bendin' an ear
Chuck was duck-walkin' and the king got rockin'
And what do you think was here?

They got power in the music, and boy, you oughta hear it now
Well, they got power in the music, the boys are gonna show you how

Then four boys made a brand new noise, from far beyond the sea
We loved all four and we yelled for more, it was natural as could be
Watts went up and loose ends went down, now it's anything it wants to be

We got power in the music, and boy you oughta hear it now
Yeah we got power in the music, the boys are gonna show you how

They got power in the music, and boy, you oughta hear it now
Well, we've got power in the music, the boys are gonna show you how

Don't you know they gave it power, power in the music
Yah yah yah
Can't you feel it giving you now, power in the music
Yay, yay, yay
Can't you feel it growing every day, power in the music
Yaz, yaz, yaz
Don't you feel it disbursing, power in the music
Yah, yah, yah
You see them dancing up and down now, there's power in the music
Yay, yay, yay
I feel it growing every day now, there's power in the music
Yaz, yaz, yaz

Yauw, Yauw, Yauw Yauw
Yauw, Yauw, Yauw, Yauw

You ask me, pretty baby, to forget your sin
You ask me, pretty baby, let you come back in
Well I've heard you crying all night and day

CHORUS
It's out of the question, oh yeah
It's out of the question, oh yeah
It's out of the question

I don't need a ball to see
There's pain and there's heartaches heading for me
A'just like before it come to pass
A love like yours can never last
So cut it, girl, well this is the end
You know my love just won't bend

CHORUS

It tears my heart out deep inside
Without your love, I want to die
Without your love, I can't go on
You know no man is that strong
Well, don't let me see you face
Don't let me remember the place
Don't let me heary your name
You know I'm going insane
Pretty baby, it's out of the question

CHORUS

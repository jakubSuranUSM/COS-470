Rockin Chair By Magnum.
-----------------------
You want love
You get hate
Oh you push and you shove
You know you just can't wait
You've had your fun
You don't fool no one
You build it up
To tear it down
Runnin out of luck
I won't get kicked around
I could drive all night
Till you're out of sight
Hide and seek
Turnin' on the heat
Runnin like a cadillac
I'm so sick and tired
You're a damn dirty liar
When I run
I ain't coming back
Oh you better beware
Keep on rocking this house
Baby I don't care
Breakin' out this jailhouse
We're going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rockin' chair
When you came
You played rough
Now I know your game
And you ain't good enough
On't know what you've done
'Cause you ain't begun
You fool with me
You gotta understand
That you don't get to choose
Whe night comes around
I can't be found
Hide and seek
Turnin' on the heat
Runnin like a cadillac
I'm so sick and tired
You're a damn dirty liar
When I run
I ain't coming back
Oh you better beware
Keep on rocking this house
Baby I don't care
Breakin' out this jailhouse
We're going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rockin' chair
Red sky burnin'
Won't be no returnin' so long
Fire up the motor
Don't you get no closer
Yeah I'm gone
Oh you better beware
Keep on rocking this house
Baby I don't care
Breakin' out this jailhouse
We're going nowhere
I ain't ready for no rockin' chair
I need my rockin'
But I don't need no rockin' chair

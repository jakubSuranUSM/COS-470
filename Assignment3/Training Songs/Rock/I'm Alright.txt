Well it's been a long time, glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
We better grab a chair and a couple of beers
You're lookin' good in your three piece suit
You know I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one who followed the light and
You look like you're doing alright

I've been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where the money gets tight
But i guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well we raised a lot of hell when we were younger
They thought we were crazy but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends and skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ass
Lost touch, we lost in love
And lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
But I guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call that will even be better
Give the wife a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
Tell them all my future's looking bright and I miss them
But I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

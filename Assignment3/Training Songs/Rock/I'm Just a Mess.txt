I'm searching for those party lights
Where everybody's having a good time
My baby said she'd hold me tight
And you know that this could be the right time

And I don't care what else
In the middle of your tenderness
I'm just a mess
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

It was a September night
The air was turning warm to cold
My baby said she'd hold me tight
The autumn brought the springtime home

And I don't care what else
In the middle of your tenderness
I'm just a mess
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

I like the way
You looked that day
When our love it was new
And if I saw you again
Somehow I'd just have to say
Sometimes you're just too plain to see
Then again, you're just like me
You had to say something
You waited so long
Here I am
I could be wrong

Stay with me baby, oh yeah
Stay with 'til morning comes
Stay with me baby, oh yeah
Stay with 'til the morning comes

I don't care what else 
In the middle of your tenderness
I just confess
I guess you messed me up again
I just confess
I'm just a--whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah yeah
I'm just a mess

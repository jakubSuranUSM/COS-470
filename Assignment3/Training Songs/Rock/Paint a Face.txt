Try to get the colors right
And I?ll paint your face, she said
?Cause life is on the outside, babe
And you got to try and get it right

Buy a ten dollar camera
Take a picture of everyone
?Cause people change
Yeah, they change
Yeah, they're changing everyday

And I don't want to be the one
That you don't recognize
No, I don't want to be the one
The one that's left behind

Got a broken car
Yeah, got a selfish heart
Running down the road
With a jukebox in my head

Funny how I got to here
?Cause I don't remember how
I just want to live somewhere
Where the air is sweet and clear

And I don't want to be the one
That you don't recognize
No, I don't want to be the one
The one that's left behind
No, I don't want to be the one
The one that's left behind

I don't want to be the one
That you don't recognize
No, I don't want to be the one
The one that's left behind

No, I don't want to be the one
That you don't recognize
No, I don't want to be the one
The one that's left behind

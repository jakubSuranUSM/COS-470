Oh, please don't go out on me
Don't go on me now
Never acted up before
Don't go on me now

I swear, I never took it for granted
Just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you
Just passing it on, go f*ck

Once fastened, servile
Now your getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly
With such disarm

I pulled the covers over him
Shoulda' pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis
A fool not a fucking God
Jump, turn, search, burn

Please, don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, oh

Search, uh, touch
Please, turn on the picture
Tuck, turn, see

Please, please, please, don't go on me
Don't go on me, don't go on me
Don't go on me, don't you want me
Don't go on me, please don't go on me

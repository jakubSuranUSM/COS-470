It's an easy beat of nothing
And we don't need no guitars
We can run and sing and wreak our cars
Be careful of the judge inside
His gavel and his stand collide
But he's only guilty of what's wrong
Now you can take a feather and pull it from your hat
You murder all the liars who say they're about to die
Oh die, die, die, die
You know that you'll die, die, die, die
I won't let you die, die, die

Oh
They tell you time and time again
It's now or never
But a bird flying out with the breeze
It's a damn good reason
For the change of season

We all lost our dog now
To the hunter and the fog now
Either it's asleep or it's lying
Well, there are many things that I would love to turn you on to
Underneath the sun, but we are cool
Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool
You know that we're cool, cool, cool

Oh
They tell you time and time again
It's now or never
But a bird flying out with the breeze
It's a damn good reason
For the change of season

Just take what you can
Like a chicken in the pan
You're bound to drop it
Just doing what you can

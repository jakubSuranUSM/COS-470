You have never been there
Till you've heard the fat girl sing
Then nothing else matters
Everything just pales with in

Hanging round the corners
Shouting at the top of your voice
Sing you little fuckers
Sing like you got no choice

I believe it's true
We are everywhere
And I feel the wind
And it feels so high

There really is no purpose
Definitely is no need
To go running round the houses
Like a racehorse on speed

[Chorus:]
I believe again
We are everything
And I feel the wind
And it gets so high

Come on
Baby let's go
Oh come on
Baby let's go

You say where to
I say I don't know
I just need to run
And you need it too
And I catch your eye
And I feel the wind
And it feels so high

We're planting up the acorns
Wondering to where they'll lead
We're planting up the acorns
Wondering to where they'll seed

[Chorus]

You say where to
I say I don't know

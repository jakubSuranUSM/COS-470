I can see your eyes from here
I can't see anything in between
Everything I thought I ought to know about you has vanished
Like the snow when the sun comes out
There's nothing but green lights from here
Nothing but empty roads
You and I gonna drive ourselves outta this town
In a 1989 black Mercedes Benz

I can hear your voice from here, girl
And I can't hear no other sound
No need to spend anymore time apart
That's it
I'm not being left out anymore
I gotta hold on what's going on
I've got my foot in the door, so to speak
There's nothing but green light from here
There's nothing but green light from here
From here

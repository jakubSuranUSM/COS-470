Darling, darling, darling
If you should say we're through
I would sell my heart for a penny
'Cause it's worthless to me without you

Oh, oh, oh
With these arms I hold you
That's all I use them for
I would sell these arms for a penny
If they couldn't hold you any more

In other words, I seem to have nothing at all
Unless I have you by my side
Without you my whole world would crumble and fall
But with you I'm so satisfied

Oh, oh darling, darling, darling
I swear by up above
For a penny, for a penny, for a penny
I'd give all that I own for your love

I'd give all that I own for your love

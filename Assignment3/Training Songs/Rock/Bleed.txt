He only wants to take control

Grant him his black eyed fantasies
He claims that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Do you believe this bullshit?
Tell me you don't want to face this situation anymore than I do

You're bound to catch it if you wait
I've seen the symptoms before, they come as they please
Here comes the low rent man again

He'll claim that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Will you believe this bullshit?
Tell me you don't want to face this situation anymore than I do

He claims that he knows you, says it written in the stars
Do you believe this bullshit?
If you don't want to face this situation anymore, then I don't

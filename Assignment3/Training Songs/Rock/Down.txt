My one night stand, my summer fling
Came as fast as she left me
Oh, it's such a tragedy
We both had way too much to drink
This empty bed, the long drive home
Leaves me crushed and most alone
You came and left way too soon
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you

You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, yeah, down, no
You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, down, down, down, down

I met her in the rock show crowd
The band was playing oh so loud
Touch me, feel me, hold me close,
Feels so good only heaven knows
She got all the glamor of Hollywood
I can't be with what I should
I love your sweat on my skin
Feel these words, they're sinking in
Feel these words, they're sinking in
Feel these words, they're sinking in

You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, yeah, down, no
Your bring, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, down, down, down, down

I love to hate you, hate to love you
What could I do? What could I prove?
So long, so long, so long
I can just scream at the top of my lungs
How come you always do me wrong?

You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, yeah, down, no
You bring, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, down, down, down

You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, yeah, down, no
You bring me, you bring me, you bring me down
Down, down, down, down

I love to hate you, hate to love you
What could I do? What could I prove?

I can just scream at the top of my lungs
How come you always do me wrong?

Down, down, down

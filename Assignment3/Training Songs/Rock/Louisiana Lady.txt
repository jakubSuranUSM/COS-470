I been on this road for seven days
And I’m so beat my vision’s just a yellow haze
But I know that I am gonna make it home tonight
And then I’m gonna see my light

Yeah, tonight I’ll see my Louisiana lady
My Louisiana lady’s gonna  sleep with me tonight, and hold me tight
Louisiana lady
Know that I need you
Louisiana lady I love you
Louisiana lady I love you

Six more hours till I make New Orleans
Oh, well I been doin’ too much speed and feelin’
Downright mean
And I think that I can cut an hour off the time
If I keep lady on my mind

Yeah, tonight I’ll see my Louisiana lady
My Louisiana lady’s gonna  sleep with me tonight, and hold me tight
Louisiana lady
Know that I need you
Louisiana lady I love you
Louisiana lady I love you

Well, every man has got to earn his pay
Oh, but I feel so bad each time I have to
To go away
But when I get home tonight it’s gonna be worthwhile
I’m gonna see my lady smile

Yeah, tonight I’ll see my Louisiana lady
My Louisiana lady’s gonna  sleep with me tonight, and hold me tight
Louisiana lady
Know that I need you
Louisiana lady oh
Louisiana lady oh
Louisiana lady oh
Louisiana lady I love you

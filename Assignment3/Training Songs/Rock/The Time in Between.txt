I watch the sun every morning  I see the moon at night  But thereÆs a time, time in between  That I donÆt see a light, I donÆt see it, no no no  That I donÆt see a light     I hear your footsteps in the hall  I hear your knock on the door  But thereÆs a time, time in between  That I donÆt hear you there at all, I donÆt hear you, no no  That I donÆt hear you there at all     The way you used my love  It makes me cry, it makes me cry  The way you threw me up  It makes me die, it makes me die     I watch the sun every morning  I see the moon at night  But thereÆs a time, time in between  That I donÆt see a light, I donÆt see it, no no  That I donÆt see a light     But thereÆs a time, time in between  That I donÆt hear you there at all, not at all, no no  That I donÆt hear you there at all     The way you used my love  It makes me cry, it makes me cry  The way you threw me up  It makes me die, it makes me die     I watch the sun every morning  I see the moon at night  But thereÆs a time, time in between  That I donÆt see a light, I donÆt see it, no no no  That I donÆt see a light, light, light, light, light

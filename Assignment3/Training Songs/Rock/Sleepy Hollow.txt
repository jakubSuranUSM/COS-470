There's a place I call Sleepy Hollow 
Where I go when you're not around 
There's a brook running clear in the meadow 
I lose my blues in it's sound 

The wind and the trees from the hollow 
Whisper secrets of life in my ear 
When I lay down in their shadows 
I dream that you're still here 

The bubbling babbling brook is your laughter 
The wind blowing softly,your touch 
I've found the one thing I'm after 
Your love, your love means so much 

Until you say that you love me 
And make all my dreams come true 
I'll go down to my Sleepy Hollow 
And dream my dreams of you 
I'll go down to my Sleepy Hollow 
And dream my dreams of you

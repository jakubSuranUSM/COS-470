Laser guns are set to stun, sabers interlinked
And try to know the one who shuns the world for inner space
And nothing comes between the sadness and the scream
Exploding rooms of pain; dematerialize again
And gogo bars filled with showgirl stars and Friday set aflame
With crashing cars, sunburst guitars, amphetamines and fame
And crawling from the smash, aliens all slain
A beam of light and a flash, lifts you up to where
You know that you can choose to
Never have to feel that way again
Rushing through the stars, captivated by the worlds beyond
So far, unknown
Floating in a car, past the gates of Must Destroy dot com
You are alone, it's a small world, and you've grown.

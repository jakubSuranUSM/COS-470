We are an altar of broken stones
But You delight in the offering
You have the heavens to call Your home
But You abide in the song we sing

Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
To bring You praise that will never cease
But hallelujah from here below
Is still Your favourite melody

We sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

And should the fire that once burned bright
Become an ember my eyes can't see
I will remember Your sacrifice
I will abide in Your love for me

Oh, we sing
Hallelujah

Jesus Christ our King enthroned
All the praise is Yours forevermore
Hallelujah here below
All the praise is Yours forevermore
Jesus Christ our King enthroned
All the praise is Yours forevermore
Hallelujah here below
All the praise is Yours forevermore

Oh, what a wonderful day to come
When every knee bows before Your name
But we will not wait until it does
For here and now shall Your Kingdom reign

We sing

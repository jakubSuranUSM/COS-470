Know that I went as high
As I could go on my first time

Where's the fun if your feelings
Are left behind

And it's your right when you mean it
To find the proof make me hear it

Cause when I'm wrong I don't see it
Anymore

Cause I feel like a fake when I feel
Any feeling,

Cause I wouldn't want to happen to you.
Cause I know ya mean it.

You have a laugh when you let go
That makes it's a big un-wanted side show

Why count the times that you feel low
When you shine,

Cause your stone cold wise
I'm in to what you doin'

And I wouldn't want to happen to you
Cause I could never climb the
Walls you'd walk through
And it's the smiling lies that always come
To make you feel that I'm the one for you

I know it feels like you spent your whole
Life with people trying to keep you in your place
But no-one knows you better than me when I say
No, no, no, no

And I wouldn't want to happen to you
Cause I could never climb the
Walls you'd walk through
And it's the smiling lies that always come
To make you feel that I'm the one for you

You pinned your hope one me like I'm all you find
But I wouldn't want to happen to you this time,

(I've gone away)
(I've gone away)
(I've gone away)

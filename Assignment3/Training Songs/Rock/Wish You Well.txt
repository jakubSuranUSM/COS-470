Up so early feel so bright
Didn't get much sleep last night
Freight train rattled through my head
Whistle blowing love is dead
Is dead

Heart attacked by fear and doubt
Won't be long till the truth comes out
First impressions never lie
Lover's bonds they hold so fast

Restless future burning bright
The past is holding on so tight
Never heard the warning bell
And I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well

Welcome swallows dip and swing
Take their cue from the slightest thing
Rolling fog into my room
Why did you give up on me so soon?
So soon

Restless future burning bright
The past is holding on so tight
Never heard the warning bell
And I just want to wish you well

I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well

Why did you give up on me so soon?
Did you give up on me so soon?
I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well

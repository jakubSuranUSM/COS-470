Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh, ooh yeah

What it is a burning flame
A fire out of control
What it is a chance in the world
For sanity down the road
What it is a simple thing
That everybody needs
What it is the chance to bring
All of us together

[Chorus]
Love somebody
Love somebody
Love somebody
Got to love somebody

Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh

What it is I'll say it again
'Cause everybody needs
What it is a simple thing
All of us together
What it is a burning flame
A fire out of control
What it is a chance in the world
For sanity down the road

[Chorus]

Ooh woh ooh woh oh
Ooh woh ooh woh oh

What it is what it is
What it is what it is
Huh!

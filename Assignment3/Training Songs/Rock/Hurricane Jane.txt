Jane, I've made it plain,
Although I'm faded as a ghost
I want you here inside me
Say the word
Oh, you've been playing nice,
But I can see it in your eyes,
You're thinking, "Christ.
He's everybody's girl."

You can't spend the night

Jane, I've seen you at the club
You were tearin' up the rug
With no regard for form
You're such a brute!
You had a ready elbow
For the girls you hate
Or just don't know
You head-butt me,
Cos you thought it was cute

You can't spend the night
Yes, I'm sure you're right
You can't spend the night
Yeah, I'm sure you're right
You can't spend the night
Yes, I'm sure you're right
But we could spend the night together
Or alone. That would be better

It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
Oh, what's the use of making a bed?
I took something and it feels like karate
It's kicked me down and left me for dead
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody,
So what's the use of pulling a shape?
I put what I want, when I want, in my body
I'm never gonna give what I take

Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt
You've been with all my friends
You tell me guard my heart,
I might get hurt
No doubt you'll hurt my feelings,
And it's a given I'll be kneeling
But I'm telling myself
That it's gonna be worth it

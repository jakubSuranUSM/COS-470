Sometimes I see her down by the river
The water dances on her skin
She can captivate you with her eyes
But she'll never let you in
In the dark she lingers
Like a tear without a soul

And I what a lonely girl
Trying to find her way
In this mixed up messed up world
And I see so many faces just like her
So many broken hearts in the world
And I what a lonely what a lonely girl

He said lately she's been watching the weather
The weather doesn't know what to do
cause sometimes when its cold outside
That's when she's feeling blue
But I see through her sadness deep into her soul
All she's wants to have is someone she can love to make whole

And I what a lonely girl
Trying to find her way
In this mixed up messed up world
And I see so many faces just like her
So many broken hearts in the world
And I what a lonely what a lonely girl

Isn't it regrettable'
Oh isn't it regrettable
She finds her love and then she lets it go
And I see so many faces just like her
So many broken hearts in the world
And I what a lonely what a lonely day

And I what a lonely girl
Trying to find her way
In this mixed up messed up world
And I see so many faces just like her
So many broken hearts in the world
And I what a lonely what a lonely girl

And I what a lonely what a lonely girl

Got out of bed this morning, I didn't sleep at all
Today I'm makin' history, I'm pickin' up my call
I'm going into space, man, don't know when I'm coming down
But I'll send you all a message when I'm passing my ole town
So tell me, why is it we're never happy?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got
Everybody wants to be an astronaut

I can feel my body shiver, the lights are everywhere
They marvel at my heartbeats inside the atmosphere
And I'm looking at the world, in a way you never could
I knew I'd be a traveling man, but I misunderstood
So tell me, why is it we're never happy?

'Cause everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got
Everybody wants to be an astronaut (hey)

Don't you tell me that I never
I will show you what I'm made of
Ready for the E.V.A. Come on, let's go outside and play
What you say?

Everybody wants to be an astronaut
And take the long tall trail into the stars
Everybody wants to show a brother what they got
Everybody wants to be
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

Everybody wants to be an superstar
Rock the world and make the cover at The Times
'Cause everybody's happy when they're playing the guitar
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be
Everybody wants to be an astronaut

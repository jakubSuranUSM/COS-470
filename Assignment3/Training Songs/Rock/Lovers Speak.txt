When they whisper in the corner
When they're running in the rain
When they're holding hands and laughing
Tell me what they're really saying

Lovers speak is so much different
Only they can understand
Let's all share this coded secret
Let us in let's all join hands
Lovers walk a different tight rope
Lovers always speak in tongues

I wanna learn the language of love
I wanna learn how to flirt
I wanna hear someone call out my name
And wipe away all the hurt

When they're reckless with abandon
Nothing can get in their way
There's no natural disaster
Could dull their senses
Stop their play

Lover's world is so much different
Make me a native of that land
Let's all share this special feeling
That lifts you up beyond the heavens
Lovers walk a looser tight rope
With feathers thrown upon the ground

I wanna count all those blessings I'll get
When I gaze on that face
Who'll glamorize all my fantasies more
I tell you now I can't wait

I wanna learn the language of love
I wanna learn how to flirt
I wanna hear someone call out my name
And wipe away all the hurt

Lovers speaking
Lovers speaking
Everyone will listen
Everyone will listen
Everyone wants to learn

They wanna learn the language of love
They wanna learn how to flirt
They wanna hear someone call out their name
And wipe away all the hurt

I wanna learn lovers speak
I wanna learn lovers speak

I wanna learn the language of love
I wanna learn how to flirt
I wanna hear someone call out my name
And wipe away all the hurt
I wanna learn the language of love
I wanna learn how to flirt
I wanna hear someone call out my name
And wipe away all the hurt

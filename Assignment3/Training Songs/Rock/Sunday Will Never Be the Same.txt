La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la

I remember Sunday morning
I would meet her at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
Till it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk across the way to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same
I've lost my Sunday song
She'll not be back again

Sunny afternoons (Sha la la)
That make me feel so warm inside (Sha la la)
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes (Sha la la)
As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths (Sha la la)
For they have changed (Sha la la)
I must be home, the sun is gone (Sha la la)
And I think it's gonna rain

Sunday will never be the same
I've lost my Sunday song
She'll not be back again

I remember children
Feeding flocks of pigeons
I remember sunshine
And you were mine

La la la
La la la
La la la la la la la

Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same

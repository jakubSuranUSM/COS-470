You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and you don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off, off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

Off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and no prayer for the night
Come into our minds and you rush through our lives  
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off, off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

The only thing you've got (off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it 
The only thing you've got (off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it 
The only thing you've got (off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it 

Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right

Youngest fire, you decide
We decide what is right

Near yet so far, isn't it?
Near yet so far, isn't it?
Near yet so far, isn't it?
Near yet so far, isn't it?
Near yet so far, isn't it?

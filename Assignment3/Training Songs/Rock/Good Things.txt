In line I long to be
Inside your company
Good things are coming
I know they always have
In time, a far away place that we can go
I know we will someday
On our own, until then I will lay inside
Rest on a rising tide
Don't be so selfless
I'll wait on the same lines as you
Can't be so helpless
Good things are coming our way
Good things are coming, I'll wait
In line, I long to be
Inside your company
Maybe you know
We'll go wherever you wanted to
I'm through wishing I was somewhere else
Drive along to escape
Good things are coming
Don't be so selfless
I'll wait on the same lines as you
Can't be so helpless
Good things are coming our way
Good things are coming, I'll wait
Drive along to our escape

One more time
I wake and I'm anywhere
Well, I'm feeling lonely when
You look like you're coming after all

All that time
And laugh only when you're still around
Thought I'd feel something else
When love keeps me climbing up the wall

A little heat and I lose some more sleep
A little sleep and a little more heat
In other ways, I keep waking up
A little heat and a little more

Oh, that's fine
Relax, will you? While you're still around
But I'll be your only friend
When off running things into the ground

You're alone with me
Nothing wrong with me

It's still hard
A little heat and a little more sleep
[Unverified]

In other ways, I keep waking up
Lose some heat and a little more, one more

One more time
And that's coming on again
One more day of loneliness
That's you incapacitating love

One more time with me

Tell me all, and I'll try to piece it together
I've got a photo-fit mind, but I'm a first rate forgetter
Your face will fall, but let's try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips, 
And keep your hands on the hips
And I'm supposed to know
And I'm supposed to know
The way you stick out your lips, 
And keep your hands on the hips
And I'm supposed to know what that means
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be

I punched the fence last night
Another act which you thought pathetic
Despite this love, I can't forgive when you say forget it

Your face will fall, but let's try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips, 
And keep your hands on the hips
And I'm supposed to know
And I'm supposed to know
The way you stick out your lips, 
And keep your hands on the hips
And I'm supposed to know what that means
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be

You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be

Your face will fall, but let's try to keep it together
The blade withdraws before the knot starts to sever

The way you stick out your lips, 
And keep your hands on the hips
And I'm supposed to know what that means
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be
You're a puzzle to me, and you always will be

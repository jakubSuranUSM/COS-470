Fireworks, blue and green
I can see what they sing
But you are away
You always smile
Boxing ring
The back of mules
You can really see, from the inside

Across the room
There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle

Where I see the sun from
There's a horror in my head
When the blanket is gone
From the floor in my castle
Where I see the sun from

In the comfort of this room
The challenge died
Remember you and me
We laughed 'til we cried

I have a feeling that's been goin on in your country right now is very much like the 60s. [Another man speaks Russian.] This song has been going around and around and my head since I've been here. [Another man speaks Russian.] This is called The Times They Are A-Changing. [Another man speaks Russian.]

Come gather 'round people wherever that you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
& accept it that soon U'll be drenched to the bone if your time to you is worth savin' 
Then U better start swimmin' or U'll sink like a stone 4 the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophecise with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheels still in spin
And there's no tellin' now that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win for the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers & fathers throughout land & don't criticize what U can't understand
Your sons & your daughters R beyond your command your old road is rapidly agein'
So get out of the new one if U can't lend your hand 4 the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast, the slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last for the times they are a-changin'

Doop, do, do, do, do, doop
Doop, do, do, do, do, doop

Don't be angry
And drive me away
I know I was wrong, dear
Please let me stay

Well I've been a fool, dear
For you I know
But I realize now
That I love you so

If you will forgive me
For causing you this pain
I promise you, my darling
I won't hurt you again

Don't be angry
Please hear what I say
Well, give me a chance, dear
Don't drive me away

[Instrumental Interlude]

Give me just one more chance
To prove my love is true
And you won't regret it dear
'Cause I'll make it up to you

Don't be angry
Please hear what I say
Well, give me a chance, dear
Don't drive me away
Don't drive me away
Don't drive me away

Aaaaaaaaaah, well

"Sit tight and listen keenly while I'll play for you a brand new musical biscuit"

There's been a brainwave at the radio station
Old idea from the woodstock generation
Calling all the kids from across the nation
In some it brings out love in others termination
Love and unity
Don't worry bout the power we got a generator
And publicity
Batteries for rent you can pay us later

Get your digital watches in synchronization
Producer of the shows got a selfish motivation
It's the place to be and we got a location
Another gold disc for an album compilation
Bring the family
Everybodys' welcome there will be no discrimination
Take a tip from me
In case there's a problem bring identification

c'mon every beatbox in the place to be
c'mon every beatbox we got a ramellzee
c'mon every beatbox let's party and how
c'mon every beatbox let's party right now
Party right now!

Watch me
I got it 
Watch me

So the holy smokes are coming we got a confirmation
Centre of the city been a major transformation
Gandhi got a shock and he took a vacation
Check the wild life it's a real fascination
Hope they stay in line
Raiders PossÃ¨ British born but still they're Jamaican
Dailing 999
Salt 'n pepper people stirred not shaken

c'mon every beatbox in the place to be
c'mon every beatbox we got a ramellzee
c'mon every beatbox let's party and how
c'mon every beatbox let's party right now
Party right now!

"Hold it right there"
"The white man left me nothing out here but the underworld 
and that's were I dance, where do you dance?"

The knights of Saint George dressed for aggrovation
Heard about the party and they sent a delegation
The bulldog crew don't need no provocation
Got a strange idea about the country's liberation
B.A.D. and little Sipho
Help keep the peace don't need no lawbreaker
No one can stop the show
The promotor didn't book no undertaker

c'mon every beatbox in the place to be
c'mon every beatbox we got a ramellzee

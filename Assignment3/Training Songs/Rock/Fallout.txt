I pissed you off again
So that you'd leave me
Alone in Leeds again
And I got my stuff and left
'Cause I got this friend see
Who put me up again

Oh but no, you still had to call
Oh but no, you still had to come

But we just always
Seem to just fallout
When I'm most in need of it

So I spent my yesterday
Ducking your calls
And in fear that things would change
So I tidied up my place
'Cause you always told me
It got me thinking straight

Oh, but no, you still had to call
Oh, but no, you still had to come

But we just always
Seem to just fallout
When I'm most in need of it
And you just always
Seem to just call out
When I'm up for leaving it

You see now
I'm sorry if I drove, your matches to my clothes
But you know how I can get sometimes

You see now
I'm sorry if I drove, your matches to my clothes (Woo!)

You see I
I was a test-tube baby
That's why nobody gets me

You see I
Struggle to sleep at night
But it's fine, she never lets me

You see I
I was a test-tube baby
That's why nobody gets me

You see I
Struggle to sleep at night
But it's fine, Mary don't let me

Nobody gets me

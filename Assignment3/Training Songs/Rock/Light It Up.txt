Got a feeling it's a fever, it's a fire
Talking trouble, take it down into the wire
Once chance, two chance, it's a lie
It's old, and old, and old, and worn out

Light it up for real and watch it work a way
Got no memory of ever being made
We'll take heart, take heart anyway
Your own, your own, your own are not now

Hey
Light it up
Hey
Light it up

Taking comfort in the promises of pride
A blade incision, it will never help decide
We're growing up, growing out of a life
It won't, it won't, it won't fit anyone

Got a feeling, it's a fever, it's a fire
Marking territory, a faction for a fight
Take heart, take heart cos the lie
It's old, it's old, it's old, and worn out
It's old, it's old, and worn out

Hey
Light it up
Hey
Light it up
Light it up for real, light it up and we'll see (hey)
Light it up
Light it up for real, light it up and we'll see (hey)
Light it up

Hey
Light it up
Hey
Light it up
Light it up for real, light it up and we'll see (hey)
Light it up
Light it up for real, light it up and we'll see (hey)
Light it up

One buck in the jukebox gets you two
I wouldn't pick track nine if I was you
The easy way gets harder all the time
The easy way gets harder all the time

Big deal, a little ache 
In the city of hate
Deep in the big black heart 
Of the lonestar state
If you are a good old boy
They're gonna do you fine
The easy way gets harder all the time

Speaking of love
Speaking of love

Two times shame on you exponentially
Fool me again baby
And you can say "shame on me"
How can I love you
When you won't be mine
The easy way gets harder all the time

Speaking of love
What will you do 
When this is done
Will your run
Will you stay
Met me at the easy way

How can I love you
When you won't be mine
The easy way gets harder all the time
Time, time, time!

And the love you give
Is enough to stay
It's so hard to live
Meet me at the easy way

Meet me in your room
Meet me in your car
Meet me on the moon
What would you do
If I told you I loved you
What would you do
If I told you I loved you

Speaking of love
Speaking of love
Speaking of love
Speaking of love

Tell you what I want
Essence
'Tell you what I need
Essence
What I'm looking for
Essence

Sit in silence close your eyes, feel the magic everywhere inside you
Fingers toes head heart and soul, connected deep to every living thing
Not just the taste, the touch, the smell
Or the face you know so well
Not the 400 word description
The book, the film, the faithful depiction
Get out of here
Get out while you can
Choose life, strive for essence

Choose life, Choose living
Choose life, Choose living
Go digging, Go digging
Go digging, Go digging
Go digging for essence
For Essence
For Essence

Sit in silence and watch the sky
Feel the magic deep inside you
Every woman and every man
Turn off your mind and you'll understand

Sit in silence and watch the sky yeah
Feel the energy inside outside

Ain't one damn thing means a thing in this life
Til you get close to Essence, til you try
Every man and woman listen to me, hey
Live in the moment or you'll never be free

Essence
Essence
Essence.

Choose life, Choose essence.

You tell me not to call you up 
Cause it ties you down 
Don't tell your friends 
You've been hangin' round 
You must be crazy for me

You say you'll see me once or twice 
Every week or two 
There's more important things 
That you've got to do 
You must be crazy for me

Cause when I kissed you last night 
In my own backyard 
You ran so fast 
And you fought so hard 
You must be crazy for me 
You must be crazy for me

You don't like my hair 
You don't like my car 
You don't like my friends 
You met at the bar 
You must be crazy for me

I see you shake you head 
And you roll your eyes 
Your firm remark 
To remove my thigh 
You must be crazy for me

Cause when I kissed you last night 
In my own backyard 
You ran so fast 
And you fought so hard 
You must be crazy for me 
You must be crazy for me

Do not expect you to wait 
Do not expect you to phone 
Do not expect anything 
When I catch you alone 
You must be crazy for me

Cause when I kissed you last night 
In my own backyard 
You ran so fast 
And you fought so hard 
You must be crazy for me 
You must be crazy for me

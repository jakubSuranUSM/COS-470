Well the lord must have had his day off when I was born 
He went to bed closed his eyes had some fun 
Mummy said she wanted me and I was welcome 
Daddy gave his sperm and it was done 

Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 

the first thing that I saw was white 
The nurse came with the scissors and said : it's a boy 
The doctor hit my ass, said come on cry 
And then I started to scream and I was alive 

Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 

And now I'm here and I don't know why 
'Cause I wasn't asked at all 

Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born 
Ohh ohh I was dead before I was born

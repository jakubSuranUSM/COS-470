She had a Nova that was tinted green
He took a Greyhound that was a bus
From the city of New Orleans
The only light that shined in their eyes
Was that of a simple screen
In a one Bal Harbour bedroom apartment
With a vision and a dream

Feeling like they sunk already
Feeling like they're done
Knowing what's been done already
Has been done by everyone

Deep in Nevada they played it straight
They stayed in Reno inside a casino
With a two, four rate
The only life that was in their eyes
Was burning like the sun
It is this sundowner hellroom confinement
Where they remained as one

Feeling like they sunk already
Feeling like they're done
Knowing what's been done already
Has been done by everyone

Back in Miami
Back in Miami, back to the sand
He took to running that was illegal
She ran a peanut stand
The only night he closed his eyes was his last one
In a one Bal Harbour bedroom apartment
Where his drean begun

Feeling like they sunk already
Feeling like they're done
Knowing what's been done already
Has been done by everyone

Now they're living in Miami
Trying to get down to the Keys
Is it lost, is it such a cost
When you try to aim to please

Down for the dirt now
They took it down for the dirt now
They took it ...

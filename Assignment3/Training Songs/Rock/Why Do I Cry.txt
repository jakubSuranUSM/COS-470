I would lose all my blues 
if you promise that your love was true now	 
And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do now	      'Cause you leave me alone	   	
To cry on my own	   
I swear you got a heart that's made of stone	
Made of stone

And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do	
But I do now	
I cry, you know why, I would die if you left me again	
The tears and the years would have all surely been in vain, now	
But you keep on leavin' me alone	
To cry on my own	
I swear you got a heart that's made of stone	
Made of stone

And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do
You say you tell me no lies
Then why, why do I cry
Oh, tell me, why do I cry, now	
Tell me, tell me, tell me, why do I cry, yeah, yeah	
Oh, tell me, why do I cry	
Oh, tell me, why do I cry

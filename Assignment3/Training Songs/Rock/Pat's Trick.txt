Creepy and sullen and running out of room
In my little tomb, my little tomb
I'll plant a seed there to remember you
at the may fair with your long ass curly hair

We had a pirate band, a tear for every grain of sand
and i was fighting with my hands. Oooooo

This came up wilted and looks like you
cause it never grew, it never grew 
This one is scrawny, it looks like me 
cause it's dirty and i'm so dirty too

We had a pirate band, a tear for every grain of sand
and i was fighting with my hands... OVER YOU
beautiful thing, you are the most beautiful thing
flower of life, bird of spring, you are the most beautiful thing

Locus flower -- grow out of bounds
Locus flower -- grouw out of (the under) ground 

Some say its like a beautiful flower
some say it is a terrible power
I'll meet you at the end of the hour
I want to use, i want to use that power

FEED ME, feed me, feed me
you are the most beautiful thing
you are the most beautiful thing
flower of life, bird of spring
you are the most beautiful thing..

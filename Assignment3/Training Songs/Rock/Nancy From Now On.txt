Oh, pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp where my organs scream "slow down, man"

Ooh, flowers and bows
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Ooh 

Oh, hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon I'll be breaking things I have of you

Ooh, flowers and bows
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Ooh, give me how it was
A place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
Run boy, run boy

Ooh

Well I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
Well I've been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you, oh love

Well when I read your loving letter, yeah
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us, baby
But they didn't mean a thing, no no

If I had to do it over and over and over
It's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
Still run all the way
Baby, trying to get to you
Hold on baby, I'm coming, yeah

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me baby
That you really loved me true, yeah no

Well I've just got to get to you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
When my way was dark as night
Lord of love would shine his brightest light
When I was trying to get to you, oh baby

Now I'm standing in his fool box
On a lonely dessert highway
And at 25 cents to get to you
No chance, no, no

When my way was dark as night
Lord of love would shine his brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
Well I've been traveling over mountains

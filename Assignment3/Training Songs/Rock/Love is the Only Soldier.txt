Love is a drink with a lit cigarette
Love is your mouth that's holding my breath
Love is your hand that covers my breast
Love is the only soldier left

Love is a man in a coat in the rain
Love's every little mistake that he's made
Love is the moment he has to embrace
Love is the only mercy left

Hide me inside your heart let me wash away
Hold me beneath your body all night and day
I pray that the morning comes and with me you'll stay 
Hide me inside your heart let me wash away

Love is a song that I sing when I'm sad
Love's what I give to the world when I'm glad
Love's every friendship that I've ever had
Love is the only soldier left

Hide me inside your heart let me wash away
Hold me beneath your body all night and day
I pray that the morning comes and with me you'll stay 
Hide me inside your heart let me wash away
Hold me beneath your body all night and day
I pray that the morning comes and with me you'll stay 
Hide me inside your heart let me wash away
Hide me inside your heart let me wash away
Hide me inside your heart let me wash away

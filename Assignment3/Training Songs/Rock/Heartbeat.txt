Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

Heart beat why does a love kiss stay in my memory?
Pitity-pat, I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be

Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

Heart beat why do you skip when my baby's lips meet mine?
Heart beat why do you flip then give me a skip beat sign?
Pitity-pat , and sing to me love stories
And bring to me love's glory

Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

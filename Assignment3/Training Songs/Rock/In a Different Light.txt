Don't cry for me
No, I've never been one to shoulder the weight of the world
'Cause I believe
This is here and it's now, but it's not my home
There's a hope beyond what my eyes can see
And there's a place that He's preparing for me

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna keep us here
We'll go a different way
It'll be all right
From the other side we'll see it clear
On a different day
In a different light

Don't be afraid
Of the twists and the turns of the road that we're on, justbelieve
There'll come a day
When our faith turns to sight, and we'll see His face
While we're here the heartache's hard to ignore
So for now, we'll keep our eyes on the Lord

[Chorus]

Though for now, we see things dimly
There's a voice that speaks within me
Leading me to a different light
In a different way (in a different way)
In a different light

[Chorus: x 4]

You tell me this town ain't got no heart (well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark (well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe that's cause it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides

Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes!

Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around

You think you've seen this town clear through (well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothin' here that could int'rest you (well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start

Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over played your part

Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town.
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around.

Since I'm passing your way today (well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped in 'cause I want to say (well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud

Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud!

Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around

I caught a train 
I met a dame 
She was a hepster 
And a real gone dame She was pretty
From New York City
And we trucked on down that old fair lane
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go

Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well, be on your way
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well, be on your way
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go

Well, the train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept me movin' all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go

We made a stop in Albuquerque
She must of thought
That I was a real gone jerk
We got off the train at El Paso
Our lovin was so good, Jack
I couldn't let her go
Get along
Well, I just couldn't let her go

Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well, be on your way
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well, be on your way
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go

The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept her movin' all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldnt let her go-oh-oh

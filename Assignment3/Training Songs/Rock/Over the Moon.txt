There's a pain I cannot kill 
And I guess I never will 
Bluebird of love has knocked me down 
Sang her songs then left town 

Oh the lady sang so sweet 
Had the kids up on her feet 
Playing the town hall she took her bow 
Left me this letter I'm reading now 

Chorus I was over the moon but my 
Poor heart came back soon 
There was only a rainbow left to see 
Left to see 

Oh she said it gets so tough 
Airline schedules can be rough 
Wanted to stay here and live with me 
One more show and she was free 

So I waited here at home 
Played some Stills and got myself stoned 
And as I lay in that empty bed 
Bluebird of love flew above my head 

Chorus 

Stay with me stay with me 
Lay your head upon my shoulder 

Chorus

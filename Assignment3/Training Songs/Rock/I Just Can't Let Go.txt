Oh, what's the matter, baby?
Is the truth too hard to hear?
Well, I think you know I'm not the one who lied
Now, it's all behind us
And we both play out our lives
But the years don't change the way I feel inside
So, I'll play the game now
Though it feels the same now
Are you missin' me?
Well, baby, just be aware
Of how much I still care
Oh, I need your love

[Chorus]
I gave to you my heart and soul
Now, I just need to let you know
You're part of me that I just can't let go

Well, tell me something, baby
Is there still something inside
To remind you of the way it used to be?
And how the years - they go by
Still there's something I must say
No one ever could have loved you more than me
So I'm passin' time now
Wishin' you were mine now
Are you missin' me?
Well, you know it's not too late
Oh, how long must I wait?
Oh, to hear you say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I need your love
And I need your love
Everywhere I go there's a memory
If you can't decide on me
Well, you gotta make up your mind
'Cause some day you're gonna find 
You just might need me

Well, baby just be aware
Of how much I still care
Oh, I need your love

[Chorus]

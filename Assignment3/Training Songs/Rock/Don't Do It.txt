Oh, baby, don't you do it, don't do it
Don't you break by heart
Please don't do it
Don't you break by heart
I sacrificed to make you happy
Kept nothin' for myself
Now you want to leave me
For the love of someone else

I cried in my song
Whether I'm right or wrong
I need ya baby
Fer ta keep on keepin' on
You know I was tryin' to do my best

I tried to do my best
Don't do it
Don't you break by heart
Please don't do it
Don't you break by heart
My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much

And lettin' ya know
Now you got me where you want me
And a-you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass
Well, then you'd surely see
How much heartaches and misery
Girl, you been causin' me
But I been tryin' to do my best
But I've tried to do my best

Don't do it
Don't you break by heart
Please don't do it
Don't you break by heart
I go down to the river
And there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, girl
But you don't care about me
Open up your eyes
Can't you see I love ya
Open up your heart, girl
Can't you see I need ya
Oh, baby, don't do it, do it, do it

Don't you break my heart
Please don't do it
Don't you break by heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' ya know
Now you got me where you want me
And a-you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass
Well, then you'd surely see
How much heartaches and misery

Girl, you been causin' me
But I been tryin' to do my best
A-you know I've tried to do my best
Don't do it
Don't you break by heart
Please don't do it
Don't you break by heart

I'd rather not go 
Where the people i know 
Have no hooks to hang from, 
Now she wears fake-fur, 
It's speakin' volumes for her, 
It's a freak-show for Mother Nature. 
 
(Aaaaa- I can see you) 
If the star impales a world from its pew, 
It don't subscribe to its point of view. 
(Aaaaa- I can see you) 
Some time is lost imprinting my mind 
And so i honestly can see you. 
 
Pope John-Paul's had a fall, 
They won't take 'no' anymore, 
Their God will die before i can, 
If the city is filled, 
Then build a bridge outta here, 
But you've no 
Hooks to hang from. 
 
(And now, Aaaaa- I can see you) 
If the star impales a world from its pew, 
It don't subscribe to its point of view. 
(Aaaaa- Try seeing if i can) 
(i can see you) 
(You shout it out and-) 
(You can see) 
Have some bills, 
You fill collection tins, 
You got no vision 
You got no vision 
You got no- 
I'll see if i can feel you. 
 
Take a little while 
Before you speak out, 
Reap it sweet, My lines, 
And note it is. 
There must be something good 
In this tumbled up world, 
This shook up world. 
 
And if you're one of the boys, 
With your irrelevant ploys, 
You're too close for comfort, 
It might keep you amused, 
To leave the restless confused, 
You'll have so much more 
To run from.

(You can see) 
Have some bills, 
You fill collection tins, 
You got no vision 
You got no vision 
You got no- 
I'll see if i can heal you. 
 
Shh, Shh, 
The elephant man is sleeping.

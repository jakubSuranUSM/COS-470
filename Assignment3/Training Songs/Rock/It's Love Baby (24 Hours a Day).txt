Baby, I don't know why I love you 
I don't know why I feel this way 
Baby, I don't know why I love you 
I don't know why I feel this way 
That's why I'm thinking 'bout you baby 
24 hours every day 

Baby, my days and nights are lonely 
I need your lovin' everyday 
Baby, my days and nights are lonely 
I need your lovin' everyday...oh, yeah 
That's why I'm thinking 'bout you baby 
24 hours every day

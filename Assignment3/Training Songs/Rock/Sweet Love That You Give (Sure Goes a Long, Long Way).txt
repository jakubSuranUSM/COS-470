Well, the road seems so long before me, I'm feeling confused and
hungry, dark clouds are blocking moonlight -- time is sleepin road 
signs are all against me, daybreak sorta seems to take forever cars
pass and put me down, I'm tired and freezing

*Well I'll find you and I'll hold youin my memory and once again
I'm living in those harmonies, the sweet love that you give sure 
goes a long long way and I, I, won't forget it*

I'm trying to be an honest injun, slow walking down a noisy
sidewalk, cruel words from rowdy cowboys here in boomtown seems
everybody's shooting six-guns I'm sick of trying to please 'em all I
heard tell that it can't be done and I don't deny it
 train coming rolling down the track now, click clack and I can't go

back now, hot kettle on your mama's stove and I've ...heard it 
whistle I don't wanna see no fortune teller, I'd rather do without
prediction I'll see it when it's all around me, hey, what's the
hurry? *

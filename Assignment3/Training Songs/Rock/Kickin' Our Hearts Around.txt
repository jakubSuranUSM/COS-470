So let's stop kickin' our hearts around and let's love one another
You called me on the phone but I hang up on you
Then I called back to apologize for doing things I do
You can't understand the things I do or things I say

And I can't accept the way you change from day to day
So let's stop kickin' each others hearts around it's not the thing to do
Let's pick them up and dust them off and start our love anew
Let's be fair let's don't dare try to hurt the other
Let's stop kickin' our hearts around and let's love one another

We've said goodbye a thousand times then make up again
Always coming back for more to see which one will win
I love you and you love me on this we can agree
So let's stop kickin' our hearts around and go on lovingly
Now let's stop kickin'...

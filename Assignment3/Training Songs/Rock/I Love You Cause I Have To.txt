I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you

Green are my eyes
They've seen so much compassion
I couldn't have changed but too much suffering inside
So now I'm said and done

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
And now I spend most of my time playing computer games
And wishing I was loving like most of my friends
Oh I am so ashamed
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to)

I love you 'cause I have to make everything okay
I love you 'cause I have to go away

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
And now I make too much noise reading, flicking
Through rubbish contribution is the solution
To an endless black hole and through the malice
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you)

Green are my eyes
They've seen so much compassion
I couldn't have changed but too much suffering inside
So now I'm said and done
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to)

Whoa, oh, I love you 'cause I have to make everything okay
I love you 'cause I have to go away

Oh, I love you 'cause I have to make everything okay
I love you 'cause I have to go away

Oh, I love you 'cause I have to make everything okay
I love you 'cause I have to go away

Oh, I love you 'cause I have to make everything okay
I love you 'cause I have to go away

Green are my eyes
Green are my eyes
Green are my eyes

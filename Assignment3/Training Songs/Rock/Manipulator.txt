Cheap love, I’m wrapped in milk
Drug rug that’s smooth as silk
You are the bloodline guilt
Manipulator

Ooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)

I use your telephone
To sneak inside your home
My finest bred
Manipulator

Ooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)

Ooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)

(Manipulator, manipulator, manipulator, manipulator)
(Manipulator, manipulator, manipulator, manipulator)

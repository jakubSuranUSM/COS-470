Ducks on a pond, ducks on a pond
Very pretty swimming round
The lion and the unicorn journey very far
The answers are the question, sir
The lady soothes the lion's fur
Meek as a lamb he follows her
Wherever angels are
Sing me something

I asked the ice it would not say
But only cracked or moved away
I thought I knew me yesterday
Whoever sings this song

Ducks on a pond, ducks on a pond
Very pretty swimming round
Greetings on you kings in the sky
Who'll buy me a mynah bird
Play me a magic word
Speak of hopes with thoughts absurd
Thoughts floating by
Little ducks, pretty birds
Clouds across the sky
Sing me something

I asked the ice it would not say
But only cracked or moved away
I thought I knew me yesterday
Whoever sings this song

Moving pieces on the plains of troy
Carving faces on the rocks of joy
Pretty lady washing the tiles
Soapy pictures like crocodiles
Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly winds blowing
Lovely spring coming soon
Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly winds blowing
Lovely spring coming soon

I wear my body like a caravan
Gypsy rover in a magic land
Misty mountains where the eagles fly
Lonely valleys where the lost ones cry
I had a little letter full of paper
Inky scratches everywhere
Always looking, looking for a paradise island
Help me find it everywhere

Peacocks talking of the color gray
Awaking soundly in darkest day
A howling tempest on a silent sea
Lovely Jesus nailed to a tree
I had a little letter full of paper
Inky scratches everywhere
Always looking, looking for a paradise island
Help me find it everywhere

Mad as the moon when merlin falls
Silver castles and silver halls
Taking lessons from the piper's son
Learn to play while the world is young

Boys and girls come out to play
The moon doth shine as bright as day
Leave your sorrows and leave your sleep
And join your playfellows in the street
Come with a whoop or come with a call
Come with a goodwill or not at all
Up the ladder and down the wall
A ha'penny loaf will serve for all

Following my fortune now the holy grail is found
And the holy bread of heaven it is given all around
Farewell sorrow, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world any more
I ain't got no home in this world any more
I ain't got no home in this world any more
Farewell sorrow, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world any more

Poor as the birds but to give their songs away
Gathering possessions 'round to make a bright array
Dark was the night, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
Farewell sorrow, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world any more

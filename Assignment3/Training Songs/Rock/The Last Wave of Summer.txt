On the last wave of summer
I lost my soul to you
The last wave of summer
I lost it all to you
Every thing has a time
This I know is true
I could live forever
This perfect day with you
There's a cold winter comin'
I can feel the change
It's the last wave of summer
We'll ever see again
Lets ride...
There's a cold winter coming
Can you feel the change
It's the last wave of summer
We'll ever see again

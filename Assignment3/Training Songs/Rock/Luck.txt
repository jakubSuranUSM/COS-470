How can we make amends when we said all we said?
I call and you don't pick up
How can I say instead that I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up

I'm sorry, Mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town

How can we push aside all the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up
I'm sorry, brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

How can we both pick sides when we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride and drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrow's filling up my cup

I'm sorry, father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how I up and left this town
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough?
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck

I'm sorry, mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry, father
I didn't stick around
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man, I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just won't see the light of day

Please forgive me I can't remember
Please forgive me, no one is calling
Please forgive me, I can't believe it
No

Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ever grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay
It's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck
Please just listen 'cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man, I make my own luck

I was in the water, I was half a human
I looked into the clouds for war solutions

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

I was like a wave, I didn't show emotion
I was a hundred years out on the ocean

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

Everything's illusion
And I flatter to deceive
My life is going fast
It's make believe

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

I was in the water, I was half a human
I looked into the clouds for war solutions

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

I was like a wave, a pulse across the ocean
I was a stone I didn't show emotion

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

Everything's illusion
And I flatter to deceive
My life is going fast
It's make believe

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

Everything's illusion
And I flatter to deceive
My life is going fast
It's make believe

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind

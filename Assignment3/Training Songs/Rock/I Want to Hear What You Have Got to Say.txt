Another day is here and I am still alive
I'll say these words aloud they speak from the inside
And every time i see you, you just walk away
Still the world is turning

I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say-hey-hey-hey hugh!

My mind is all made up I'm doing all I can
I'm trying hard to think but I can't understand
Why every time I see you, you just walk away
Still the world is turning, I will not complain

My head is spinning around I don't know what to do
If I'm so happy I got everything to lose
And every time I see you, I can't stand to stay
And now it's always raining, you're the one to blame

And every time I see you, you just walk awa-a-ay
Still the world is turning

I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say
I wanna hear what you, what you've got to say-hey-hey-hey

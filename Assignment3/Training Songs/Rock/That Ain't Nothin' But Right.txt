Well, I work hard and I draw my pay
So when work's done I like to play
I'd like my woman to hold me tight
Well, that ain't nothing but right

[Chorus]
No, that ain't nothing but right, baby
That ain't nothing but right
Don't rub me wrong and I'll string along
That ain't nothing but right

Well, I like my coffee black and strong
I like my auto big and long
Well, I love my woman both day and night
Well, that ain't nothing but right

[Chorus]

Now, I like to dance to the rock 'n' roll
I like to cuddle up when it's cold
I'd rather make love than fuss and fight
That ain't nothing but right

[Chorus]

Since the time that Adam made love to Eve
He made the whole wide world believe
Well, a man needs a woman to hold him tight
That ain't nothing but right

No, that ain't nothing but right, honey
That ain't nothing but right
Don't rub me wrong and I'll string along
'Cause that ain't nothing but right

I was crawlin' on the way home that morning
I was shot down and tired, you were strong and high
Just when I thought it was over, when I thought I might win
You slammed the door to make love to your old lady heroin

It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
It's pissin' down, I'm gonna drown again
It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
And I ain't gonna drown too slow

And now the whole world's going crazy 'cause I thought that it was love
But I found it was a monkey, ain't no angel from above
I can't fly, I got a broken wing
I guess I ain't no rival for your old lady heroin

It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
It's pissin' down, I'm gonna drown again
It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
No I ain't gonna drown too slow

Now every time you fall, you're fallin' into me
See you try to let her go but she won't let you be, no
And I wonder if there's any hope in hell but I hear time will heal
So I guess time will tell, it's pissin'?

It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
It's pissin' down, I'm gonna drown again
It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
No I ain't gonna drown, no I ain't gonna drown

It's pissin' down, it's coming down again
And I ain't gonna drown too slow
No I ain't gonna drown too slow

Got myself in this situation
I'm not sure about
Climbing in where there's temptation
Can I get back out?
I never can quite find the answer
The one I want to hear
The one that justifies my action
Says the coast is clear

Something on the outside
Says to jump on in
But something on the inside
Is telling me again

Better wise up
Better think twice
Never leave room for compromise
You better wise up
Better get smart
And use your head to guard your heart
It's gonna get rough
So you better wise up

Take a look at your intentions
When you have to choose
Could it be that apprehension
Might be telling you
To back off now is better
So take your heart and run
But get your thoughts together
Before they come undone

Better wise up
Better think twice
Never leave room for compromise
You better wise up
Better get smart
And use your head to guard your heart
It's gonna get rough
So you better wise up

You got to wise up
You got to think twice
You got to wise up
You got to, you got to

To back off now is better
So take your heart and run
But get your thoughts together
Before they come undone

Better wise up
Better think twice
Never leave room for compromise
You better wise up
Better get smart
And use your head to guard your heart
It's gonna get rough

So you better wise up
Better think twice
And never leave room for compromise
Oh, you better wise up
Better get smart
And use your head to guard your heart
It's gonna get rough
So you better wise up

You got to wise up
You got to think twice
(Hohh!)
You got to wise up
(Oh, yeah!)
You got to, you got to

(So you better wise up, now)
You got to wise up
You got to think twice
(Better wise up, y'all!)
You got to wise up
You got to, you got to
(Oh, yeah!)

You got to wise up
You got to think twice
(Better think sharper)
You got to wise up
(Oh, you better wise up, now)
You got to, you got to
(Ohh, yeah!)

You got to wise up
(Hoo! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo!)
You got to think twice
You got to wise up
You got to, you got to
(Oh, got to show yo', yeah!)

You got to wise up
You got to think twice
(Hoaa! Ooww!)
You got to wise up
You got to, you got to

A mirror, is a negative space with a frame,
And a place for your face 
It reveals, what the rest of us see
It conceals, what you'd like it to be

(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)

Pretty girls, have a love affair
With their eyes, and their shining hair
Fantasize, that the world adores
Tantalize, like the cover girl

Mirrors, are the basis of beauty 
They arise, to sell love their self
Then they are tries, if a woman is pretty 
She tries, like a super star Hollywood girl

(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)

Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in
Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in

Pretty girls, have a love affair
With their eyes, and their shining hair
Fantasize, that the world adores
Tantalize, like the cover girl

A mirror, is a negative space with a frame,
And a place for your face 
It reveals, what the rest of us see
It conceals, what you'd like it to be

(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)

Vanity's a deadly sin
It's what the flesh is packaged in

(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)
(pretty girls they know the way)

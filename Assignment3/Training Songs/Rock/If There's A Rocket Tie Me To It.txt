I've got this feeling that there's something that I missed
(I could do most anything to you)
Don't you breathe, don't you breathe
(I could do most anything to you)
Something happened, that I never understood
(I could do most anything to you)
You can't leave, you can't leave
(I could do most anything to you)

Every second, dripping off my fingertips
(I could do most anything to you)
Wage your war, wage your war
(I could do most anything to you)
Another soldier, says, ?He's not afraid to die?
(I could do most anything to you)
Well I am so scared, I am so scared
(I could do most anything to you)

In slow motion, the blast is beautiful
(I could do most anything to you)
Doors slam shut, doors slam shut
(I could do most anything to you)
A clock is ticking, but it's hidden far away
(I could do most anything to you)
Safe and sound, safe and sound

I could do most anything to you
I could do most anything to you
I could do most anything to you
I could do most anything to you
I could do most anything to you
I could do most anything to you

Generation sex respects the rights of girls
Who want to take their clothes off
As long as we can all watch that’s okay
And generation sex elects the type of guys
You wouldn’t leave your kids with
And shouts “off with their heads” if they get laid

Lovers watch their backs as hacks in macs
Take snaps through telephoto lenses
Chase Mercedes Benz’ through the night
A mourning nation weeps and wails
But keeps the sales of evil tabloids healthy
The poor protect the wealthy in this world

Generation sex injects the sperm of worms
Into the eggs of field-mice
So you can look real nice for the boys
And generation sex is me and you
And we should really all know better
It doesn’t really matter what you say

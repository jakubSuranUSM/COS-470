I'm going to the hardware store
And buy you a great big hammer
Girly won't you pull these nails out of my heart
And I'm goin' to the sporting goods store
And buy you a really heavy baseball bat

Girly won't you knock these thoughts out of my head 
Beat me till I'm black and blue
And I'm hangin' by a thread
And I can get back up
And we'll do it all over again

I'm goin' to a liquor store
And buy you a really big bottle
Girly won't you pour some light into my life
Then I'm goin' to the firearms store

And buy a really big hand gun
Girly won't you blows these thoughts
Out of this head of mine
Beat me till I'm black and blue

And I'm very nearly dead
And I'll get back up
And we'll do it all over again
Again Again Again

First verse is the same as the first!
I'm going to the hardware store 
And buy you a great big hammer
Girly won't you pull these nails out of my heart

And I'm goin' to the sporting goods store
And buy you a really big baseball bat
Girly won't you knock these thoughts out of my head
Beat me till I'm black and blue

And and my body's bloddy red
And I'll can get back up
And we'll do it all over again

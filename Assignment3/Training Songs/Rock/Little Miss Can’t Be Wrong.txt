Been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town
Been a whole lot happier without her face around
Nobody upstairs gonna stomp and shout
Nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out
She holds your shotgun while you dote-se-doe
She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano
Been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't no body gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha go'n do to get into another one of these here
Rock 'n' roll songs

Other people's thoughts they ain't your hand-me-downs
Would it be so bad to simply turn around
You cook so well, all nice and French
You do your brain surgery too, mama, with a monkey wrench

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't no body gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha go'n do to get into another one of these here
Rock 'n' roll songs
(Hell you can't be wrong, no, no, no, you can't be wrong)
(Oh you can't be wrong, you can't be wrong, you can't be wrong)

I hope them cigarettes are gonna make you cough
Hope you hear this song and it pissed you off
I take that back, I hope you're doing fine
And if I had a dollar, I might give you ninety-nine

Little miss, little miss little miss can't be wrong
Ain't no body gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha go'n do to get into another one of these here
Rock 'n' roll song

Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Oh you can't be wrong, no you can't be wrong, you can't be wrong
Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong, no
Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong, oh

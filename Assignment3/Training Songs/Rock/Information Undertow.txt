I turned on my T.V.
Put in a CD
Opened up the morning news
I tuned in the radio
To hear the latest video
A seven second sample of blues

I'm everywhere I wanna be
Nowhere especially
Somewhere in between
I'm faded, and jaded, and way overrated
I read it in a magazine

[Chorus]
Information undertow
Everybody's in the know
I think I'll hide my head up in a cloud
Superstardom overload
I need to get back on the road
Tune it all out, and turn it up too loud
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?

I picked up a new toy
To get me some quick joy
It's got all the whistles and bells
My friends are all jealous
That's what they tell us
So why do I feel like hell?

I lit up my Apple
Surfed through the shrapnel
Accessed my online babe
She reads Aristotle
Says she's a model
But I've never seen her face

[Chorus]

Oh, I can feel the ocean
Oh, it's calling out my name
I'm gonna get all wet
Just as soon as I get
My fifteen minutes of fame

Information undertow
We're dying to be in the know
We better off when our heads were in the clouds
Superstardom overload
We need to get back on the road
Tune it all up, and turn it up too loud
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?

If we found the time
If we found the merriment
If we found the words
We'd scratch them in new cement
But those days are gone and we've got only pictures now
A rotary wheel and some leftover shotgun shells
Nobody told us that the bastards were here
All the rogues and the scoundrels are shedding their tears
No, nobody told us that the cameras were here
All the flashes and cables
Won't someone please save us
So by our request please turn in your uniforms
The medallions and pins for the Aries and Capricorns
And file your complaints with this rookie officer
He'll lend you a smile, he'll lend you his deafest ear

Who said It's my year was it you there - can't go wrong
I see a new way you'll be in my play - sing my song
Where is the reason I keep teasing - if I knew
Now to see the new year not being blue here - all year round

Alright somethin's happening
Hold tight it might be lightning
Turn up the lights somethin's moving
Can't sleep at night my heart keeps missing a beat

I know it's my year ain't got no fear - hold me down
Take it easy if not for me - sing my song
Where is the reason I keep teasing - if I knew
Now to see the new year not being blue here - evermore

Alright somethin's happening
Hold tight it might be lightning
Turn up the lights I feel like dancing
Can't sleep at night my heart keeps missing a beat

Ooh baby, don't ever let it bring you down
Ooh baby, that's not the way I want it to sound
Ooh baby, don't catch me when I'm runnin' around
Ooh baby, I'll pick you up if your on the ground

Alright somethin's happening
Hold tight it might be lightning
Turn up the lights I feel like dancing
Can't sleep at night my heart keeps missing a beat

Ooh baby, don't ever let it bring you down
Ooh baby, that's not the way I want it to sound
Ooh baby, don't catch me when I'm runnin' around
Ooh baby, I'll pick you up if your on the ground

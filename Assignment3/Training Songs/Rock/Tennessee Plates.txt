Woke up in a hotel and I didn't know what to do 
I turned the T-V on and wrote a letter to you 
The news was talkin' 'bout a dragnet up on the interstate 
Said they were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates 

Since I left California baby, things have gotten worse 
Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse 
Tell that judge in Bakersfield that my trial will have to wait 
Down here they're lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates 

It was somewhere in Nevada, it was cold outside 
She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride 
Three bank jobs later, four cars hot wired 
We crossed the Mississippi like an oil slick fire 

If they'd known what we was up to they wouldn't 'a let us in 
When we landed in Memphis like original sin 
Up Elvis Presley Boulevard to the Graceland gates 
See we were lookin' for a Cadillac with Tennessee plates 

Well, there must have been a dozen of them parked in that garage 
And there wasn't one Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge 
And there wasn't one Japanese model or make 
Just pretty, pretty Cadillacs with Tennessee plates 

She saw him singing once when she was seventeen 
And ever since that day she's been living in between 
I was never king of nothin' but this wild weekend 
Anyway he wouldn't care, hell he gave them to his friends 

Well this ain't no hotel I'm writin' you from 
It's the Tennessee prison up at Brushy Mountain 
Where yours sincerely's doin' five to eight 
Stampin' out my time makin' Tennessee plates

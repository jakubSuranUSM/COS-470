It was you Darlin' not I
Who said we would 'part Bye and Bye
When you left I broke down and cried
And my tears just rolled from my eyes
I was more dead than alive
When you waved your last Good-Bye
Please come back Darlin' please try
'Cause my heart is bleeding inside
Please come back please come back
Oh I can't live without you you know
Change your mind and be kind
For I'm in love with you so
I was wrong and you was right
Oh I can't sleep day or night
So my Love I'm lost in this fight
And everything will be alright

I've got it all most
I've got it all almost all figured out
But always when I get there
Always when I get there all the pieces they just fall apart

I cant hear you
I cant hear you talk about your dreams involving me
I don't believe
I don't believe that they are any sort of prophecy at all

What a shock its Mr. sweet and awful
Don't look so pissed off we all lose the plot occasionally

How consistent
How can someone so consistently mess up as much as
Every instance
How can someone inconsistent mess up so consistently

What a shock its Mr. sweet and awful
Tell your gods I want to speak to their fathers
Look right now I'm standing on my haunches
I got caught stealing from the lost and found

Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
Are you going somewhere
Or are you just walking through my walls

Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
This is not a party this is a crowd

Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
You've got it easy I've got my needs
You say what you got
Wanting what you please

Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
Hey there Mr. sweet and awful
Carry yourself away with a delicious disease

I've got it all most
I've got it all almost all figured out

Way back when I was young
A minute from yesterday
They said to me "Son be strong
You're going to be something someday."
They bought me some clothes to wear
They gave me some books to read
Took me to see Santa Claus
Of love I was never in need

But they never said things burn
Or that I would have to live and learn

I'd love to go back and undo
A few things that I have done
Got a handful of bitter regrets
Like when I betrayed someone
Who helped me when I was down
I was young and dumb at the time
Believe me I don't feel good
When those days are on my mind

They're gone now
Not to return
And we move on
Trying to live and learn

raise the shade
Look outside
Leave your dreams back in bed
Find your shoes
Walk outside
Shake the clouds 
From your head
Like the morning headline
In the newspaper read
It's your turn
Yeah it's your turn
To live and learn

So that's enough for now
Enough talk about the past
Life's just beyond the gate
We don't have to move to fast
We don't have to pass some test
We don't have to get with the grade
Yesterdays years away
They flicker and then they fade
They're gone now
Not to return
Still we move on
Trying to live and learn

raise the shade
Look outside
Leave your dreams back in bed
Though the forecast said sunshine
It's raining instead
Like the morning headline
In the newspaper read
It's your turn
Yeah it's your turn
To live and learn

but they never
Said things burn
Or that I would
Have to live and learn

find your shoes
Walk outside
Shake the clouds from your head
Though the forecast said rain
You've got sunshine instead
Like the morning headline
In the newspaper read
It's your turn
Yeah it's your turn
To live and learn
Live and learn
Live and learn

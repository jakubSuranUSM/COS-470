I can't make up my mind
Someone has to help me
I never seem to know what to do
I just can't decide for myself

She has told me in so many words
That she's still in love with me
And she wants me back
She wants me back with her again

She said
"Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back
Come back where you belong?
I need you here"

"Why don't you come back home to me?
Why don't you come back
Come back where you belong?
I want you by my side"

Someone show me which way to go
I need guiding in my choice
Of what to do, someone has to help me

No compromise
But willing to sacrifice
Believe what you want
Go on and be who you are
Go out and get what you want
Full of life

The stone is thrown, it's coming fast
The next thing you know
It's crashing thru the glass
Now we're down on our knees picking up the scraps
Whatever it takes we're gonna build it back

If you don't speak out
We can't hear it
Our love is always here
Here in spirit
And all those who came before
Here in spirit
And all those who came before
Here in spirit

No compromise
But willing to sacrifice
If the means to an end's in sight
And once the work is done
Go celebrate what you like
Go on and dance through the night
Go on be one with the light
Full of life

The stone is thrown
It's coming fast
The next thing you know
It's crashing through the glass
Now we're down on our knees picking up the scraps
Whatever it takes we're gonna build it back

If you don't speak out
We can't hear it
Our love is always here
Here in spirit
And all those who came before
Here in spirit

Here in spirit

And don't you know you can call on me
Here in spirit
And don't you know you can call on me
Here in spirit
And don't you know you can call on me
Here in spirit
And don't you know you can call on me
Here in spirit

Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Call on me
Yeah

It's gonna be ok
It's just another way
Of being unhappy
Tomorrow I'll be fine
Please don't waste our time
You're not lucky to be free

Now I know
I was wrong about you
I still can't be without you

Spending time
Away from everything
Only missing you

But it's gonna be ok
It's just another way
Of being unhappy
Tomorrow I'll be fine
Please don't waste our time
You're not lucky to be free

Now I know
I was wrong about you
I still can't be without you

Spending time
Away from everything
Only missing you

When I thought I had everything
Then I was better off
I feel bad as I realize
There is no love

But it's gonna be OK
It's just another way
Of being unhappy
Tomorrow I'll be fine
Please don't waste our time
You're not lucky to be free

It's gonna be OK
It's just another way
Of being unhappy
Tomorrow I'll be fine
Please don't waste our time
You're not lucky to be free

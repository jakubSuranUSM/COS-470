If you fed the rock then you reveal an ugly scene
But the strength of 10 000 will never weaken me
Witches like a razor blade you carve me halve and whole
Oh I'd better wait to kill the time

Didn't you read it in the detail?
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing you're a dancer
The devil takes care of his own

Do you dare to speak his name there's evil at the roof
Crueler plan it's on your mind, go on and give the dice a roll
Never did believe in saying fortunes are for souls
Easy come and easy they will go

Didn't you read it in the detail?
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing you're a dancer
Didn't you read about it?
The devil takes care of his own

Didn't you read it in the detail?
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing you're a dancer
Didn't you read it in the detail?
That if you're idle in your welfare
Now you wanna know an answer
But if you're dancing you're a dancer
The devil takes care of his own.

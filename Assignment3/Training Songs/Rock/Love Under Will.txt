I need to be alone tonight
Smother me or suffer
Lay down I'll die tonight
Smother me or suffer
When I'm gone, wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile

If you pass through my soul tonight
Gather all his troubles
Tomorrow's long eternal night
Gather for tomorrow
When I'm gone wait here
Discovers all of earth's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile

Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good,the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good,the earth is good

Lay down, lay down, lay down for me
Lay down, lay down, lay down with me

When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good bye

Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good,the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good,the earth is good

Hey embrace me, someone's gonna suffer
Lay lay lay it on lay lay lay it on me
Someone
Hey embrace me someone's gonna suffer

Sweet dreams my angel
At last good bye

Sweet dreams

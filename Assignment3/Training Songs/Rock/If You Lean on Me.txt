They say it gets so hot that you could almost scream
This world can be so cold that sometimes
You just don't know how your gonna survive
Listen baby

[Chorus]
I'll always be there for you
Pick you up when you fall
You never needed anyone
You couldn't swallow your pride
Now your back's to the wall

If you lean on me I will lean on you
Put your hand in mine we can make it through
I'll be your backbone girl shelter from the storm
When it's cold outside I can keep you warm

If you lean on me

The skies get so grey
You think there's no way the sun will ever shine
Trouble resting on your mind with nowhere to find
Listen baby

[Chorus]

You think you're the only one to get kicked around
There's been a lot of hearts broken in this dirty old town

If you lean on me

Lean on me
Lean on me
Lean on me
Lean on me

I'll always be there for you
Pick you up when you fall
Everybody needs a helping hand
You've gotta swallow your pride
Yeah and kick down the wall

If you lean on me I will lean on you
Put your hand in mine we can make it through
I'll be your backbone girl shelter from the storm
When it's cold outside I can keep you warm
When it's cold outside I can keep you warm

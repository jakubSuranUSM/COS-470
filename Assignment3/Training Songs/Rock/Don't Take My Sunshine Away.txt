Your face is like the sun sinking into the ocean
Your face is like watching flowers growing in fast motion
All your kisses I swallowed
Brightened mornings and hollows
My vines and tree knots will come unwound
Baby you are my sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away

The grounded fireflies are little stars that are dying
Returning to the earth I can hear them crying
Like Christmas bulbs that I swallowed
Slept in a tree that's gone hollow
And never a brittle wintertime
Baby you are my sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away

Sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away

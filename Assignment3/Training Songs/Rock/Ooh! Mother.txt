Get smart, leave school, grow hard, be cool
Keep it in your head
Don't get in debt, don't fret or forget
To wish your neighbor well

Small talk, small folk, converse, tell joke
Tell it like it aint
make it, make out, pull through, fall out
Take it round again

Ooh mother it aint like the way you said
Ooh sister well it seems we've been misled
Ooh baby is it worth it, is it hell
Old lady you could tell us
So tell us well

Get smart, leave school, grow hard, be cool
Keep it in your head
Don't get in debt, don't fret or forget
To wish your neighbor well

Ooh mother it aint like the way you said
Ooh sister well it seems we've been misled
Ooh baby is it worth it, is it hell
Old lady you could tell us
So tell us well

Ooh mother it aint like the way you said
Ooh sister well it seems we've been misled
Ooh baby is it worth it, is it hell
Old lady you could tell us
So tell us well

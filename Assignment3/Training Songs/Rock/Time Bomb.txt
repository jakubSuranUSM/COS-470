The minute I'm at the back door, 
That's the minute there's complication
The second I'm in the action, 
Another bonafide bent creation

When it goes down, 
The come around, money, greed, the faces
When it falls down, 
They won't be found, the spotlight queen, chasin'

It's coming for you, it's coming for me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Nothing to loose, nothing for free
Can't stop now, I've got bitches and money
It's a time bomb, it's a time bomb, hit it! 

The minute I hit the bedroom, 
That's the moment I'm activated
The token I spent to floor ya, 
The less I want to know ya

When it goes down, 
The come around, money, greed, the faces
When it falls down, 
They won't be found, the spotlight queen, chasin'

It's coming for you, it's coming for me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Nothing to loose, nothing for free
Can't stop now, I've got bitches and money
It's a time bomb, it's a time bomb, hit it! 

The longer I get before ya, 
Puts out a blast like a supernova
And if you want a roller coaster, 
Just take a slow ride on my shotgun

When it goes down, 
The come around, money, greed, the faces
When it falls down, 
They won't be found, the spotlight queen, chasin'

It's coming for you, it's coming for me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Nothing to loose, nothing for free
Can't stop now, I've got bitches and money
It's coming for you, it's coming for me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Nothing to loose, nothing for free
Can't stop now, I've got bitches and money
Bitches, and money! 

Hey! 
Bitches and money, bitches and money
Bitches and money, bitches and money
Bitches and money, bitches and money
Bitches and money, hey! 
Come on! Hey!

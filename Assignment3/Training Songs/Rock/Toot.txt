My baby's got the cutest little 
Yeah she really got the greatest little  Oooo Oooo
She picks me up at night I hear her 
She takes me out a ride with her 
She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound
Be careful when you hear that little 
Oh Yeah
She don't know how to steer that little 
And though I really love her little Oooo Oooo
I've gotta run for cover from her 
She's got a little scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound
She said that if you love me true
are ya gotta love my tooter too
No matter what I say about it
I can't live with it and I can't live without it
You know I really hate that little 
Someday I'm gonna break that little 
And though she drives me crazy with her  Oooo Oooo
I've gotta take my baby with her 
She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound
Yeah
(Instrumental Break)
Umm my baby's got the cutest little 
Yeah she really got the greatest little  Oooo Oooo
She picks me up at night I hear her 
Yeah
She takes me out a ride with her 
She's got a motor scooter
With a little rubber tooter
And I fall to the ground
When I hear that sound
whistle .... fade

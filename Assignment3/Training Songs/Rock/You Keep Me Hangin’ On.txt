Set me free, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh
You really don't want me, you just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me, you just keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep comin' around playin' with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me try to make a new start?
Let me get over you the way you've gotten over me
Set me free, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you now? Oooh
You really don't want me, you just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me, you just keep me hangin' on

You said when we broke up you just want to be friends
But how can we still be friends
When seein' you only breaks my heart again?
There ain't nothin' I can do about it
You know I really love - set me free, why don't you babe?
Talkin' 'bout love - get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh
You really don't want me, you just keep me hangin' on
You really don't need me, you just keep me hangin' on
Get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh
Get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh
Get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh
Get out my life, why don't you babe? Oooh

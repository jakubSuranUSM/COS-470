Never thought I'd have a worry
Or need to be alone
Playing near are far too many
Time I should have known

[Chorus]
It can loose you all your sleep at night
Twelve bar blues is now alright
Now it's up to you, try and find a reason too
Rock'n'rollin' every song
Rock'n'rollin' everyone
It's rock 'n 'roll 'n 'rock 'n 'rock 'n 'roll
It's rock 'n 'roll 'n 'rock keeps rollin' on
Waiting to the time to find
Radio plays on Caroline
They say you'll get there in the end
We can pray, what we say makes a difference in the end

Rushin' always in a hurry
I tried to give it up
Everything we do is funny
It's never good enough

[Chorus]

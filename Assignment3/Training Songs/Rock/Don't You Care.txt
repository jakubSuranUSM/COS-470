If you don't love me
Why don't you tell me
Instead of runnin' around
With all the other guys in town
Can't you see
You're hurtin' me
Don't you care (don't you care), don't you care
If you don't want me
Why don't you tell me
Instead of tellin' lies
And makin' me cry
Whatever happened to all the good times we used to have
The times we cried and laughed
I want to know, I want to know
Will you ever love me again
Or will I find out that this is the end
Don't you care
You said that you'd believe me
Then why'd you ever leave me
I'm standin' here all alone
Without a girl of my own
Don't you care (don't you care) don't you care

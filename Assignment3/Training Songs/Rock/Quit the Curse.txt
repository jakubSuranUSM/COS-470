Seeing you again could only make me
Kissing you again would probably break me

And all the time we had to run around
And all the trips we took to settle down

It's not worth what you thought
You think I'm cursed but I'm not

Knowing that it's not about the waiting
Don't even know what I'm anticipating

You've got all the power once again
I try to fight but I'm stuck in your spin(?)

It's not worse than what you thought
You say we're cursed but we're not, we're not

And you, gave up the first time
And you, thought you read my mind
And you, thought I cared more than you did

But did you have to quit even if I did?

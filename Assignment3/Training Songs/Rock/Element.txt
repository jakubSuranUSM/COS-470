The wind was stained
Orange clouds laid out for a toxic view
Of endless time, endless time
Let it wash over your body

The wind was stained
Orange clouds laid out for the last time
There would come a time, radar flashed
Indoors we go

And he said, "Do you go?"
(Elemental, elemental)
Completely gone
(Elemental, elemental)
Element (Elemental)
Element (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)

Comes a time
Reborn until you die
Lay these plans out on the paper
They said he was gone
Never coming home
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Cancer words
Laid out in lines
The road was wide
The road was silent
Curtain call for all those lives
Expensive lighting for that final day

Come on down
(Elemental, elemental)
Fire, wind, water
(Elemental, elemental)
There will be time to see
(Elemental, elemental)
Just watch me shocked

It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move

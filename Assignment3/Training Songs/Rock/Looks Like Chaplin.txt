I feel the wash close down the street 
Yet Chaplin walks feet nine fifteen 
And I hear them call his name and I see him turn away 
They take him in and clean him up 
They take him in and strip him down 
Dry his skin and feed him wine 
And I hear them call his name and I see him turn away 
Asks to use the phone yet he lives alone 
He lives alone there's no one home to phone 
Sits alone home alone calls 
His home, his own wife is still unknown

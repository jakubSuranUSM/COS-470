Hold on
When the train is speeding through the midnight storm
And tell those boys back in town there will be a call

Train is comin'
Train is comin'
Train is comin' your way
And it sound like it's namin' (naming) the reasons
For forsaking (forsaking) stations
That we passed in the dark
You'll hear your name being called when the whistle starts to blow
Just like that train in that film Dr. Zhivago

Train is comin'
Train is comin'
A train is comin' your way
Hear the track fade in
And awaken the sleepers

And breaking the promises that were made in the dark
You'll hear your name being called when the whistle starts to blow
Just like that train in that film Dr. Zhivago

Train is coming
Train is coming
Train is coming
Train is coming

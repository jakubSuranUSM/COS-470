Down, down in my bones
Somewhere I'd never ever known
Right at the back of my head
It hit me like a beam of light
Hit me like a hook with a right
And I could have fell to the floor

'Cause you talk to me and it comes off the wall
You talk to me and it goes over my head
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you, I always, always knew
Oh, I always knew, oh, it's you

I try my best to unwind
Nothing on my mind but you
Oblivious to all that I'll owe
I'm hanging on to what I don't know
So let's go to bed before you say something real
Let's go to bed before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you, I always, always knew
Oh, I always knew, oh, it's you
Yeah, it's you, I always, always knew
Oh, I always knew, oh, it's you

Well, it's you, I always, always knew
Oh, I always knew, oh, it's you
Oh, I knew, oh, I always knew
Yes, I always knew, oh, it's you

You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I will not beg you please
I want your picture, but not yours
You know they want it
But there's no firsts
On your own
You cannot count your all

We always want our heads too much
We know the reasons but such and such
On your own
You will not let your arm go

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy the devil's plan
On your own
You cannot call me your own

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Crying all the time
'Cause I'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
You cannot, you are not the beast

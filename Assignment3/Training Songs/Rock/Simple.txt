Flawless light in a darkening air alone and shining there
Love will not elude you, love is simple
I worship this tenacity and the beautiful struggle we're in
Love will not elude us, love is simple
Be sure to know that all in love is ours
That love is a philosophy, is simple
I am calm in oblivion, calm as I ever have been
Love will not elude me, love is simple
Be sure to know that all in love is ours, is ours 
That all in love is ours
That love is a philosophy, is simple
And ours

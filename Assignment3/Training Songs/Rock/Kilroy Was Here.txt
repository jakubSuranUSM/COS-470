Kilroy was here. He cashed a check and checked out.
His asphyxiation was such a mess when he was found.
Did I do you wrong? I did you no wrong. 

I'm selling you what you sold me.
Suffocate in the air you breathe.
I'm selling you what you sold me.
Suffocate in the air you breath.

I wish you were here to tell everyone I got your car.
In all this doom was the guilt in satire.
Did I do you wrong? I did you no wrong.

I'm selling you what you sold me.
Suffocate in the air you breathe.
I'm selling you what you sold me.
Suffocate in the air you breath.

Falling off the world is the last thing I would do.
I'd do the same if I was you. You used to be so cruel.
It's the last thing that you'll do.

I'm selling you (Kilroy) what you sold me. (Was Here)
Suffocate in the air you breathe.
I'm selling you (Kilroy) I'm selling you. (Was Here)
I'm selling you (Kilroy) I'm selling you. (Was Here)

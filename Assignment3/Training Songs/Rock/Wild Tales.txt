You came over here with wild tales from the East
About the floods that are rushing 'round your door
About your old lady who up and walked away from your feast,

So you flew your bike over Highway 1
You were lucky to land on your feet
And you started crying 'cause you bent the key,
But it was your lady that landed underneath.

And it is alright
Take it as it comes
You will find a way
To get there.

So tell me your company's being reviewed,
By the people that sit on the stand,
And you tell me your factory's been renewed,
With computers instead of hands.

So you filmed Old faithful in super-8
And you monitored all of her calls
Cause you caught the milkman with double-cream
He was delivering down your halls.

But its all right
Take it as it comes
You will find a way
To get there.

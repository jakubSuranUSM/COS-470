Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo 
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo 
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo 
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo 

I wanna knock knock down your door
Wanna steal your bicycle
Wanna rock your rocking horse
Wonder what's the time now, Mr. Wolf

Dancing in the street
With my suit and my big white teeth
And my shirt and my big white shoes
And almost nothing left to lose

In a minute, I mean it, you lose your grip 
'Cause you're hanging, by a fingertip
I'm gonna huff you and puff you and shake your tree
Gonna make you, fall in love with me

Oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh

This is the beat beat beat of my heart
It overheats every time we're apart
With the sweat dripping off my chin
Honey you don't know the shape I'm in

Oh, struck down in the street
Staring up, up at the swings of your feet
Nobody knows the way that it is
Come on baby, baby please

A minute, you lose your grip 
'Cause you're hanging, by a fingertip
And I've been waiting, impatient, down underneath, 
Just to catch you, when you fall for me

I want to eat with you, sleep with you, 
kiss you and listen to you
Get you what you want, give you what you need
I want to sing to and cling to 
and wait and see
Gonna make you fall in love with me

'Cause they don't know 
They don't know
In a minute, a minute, you'll fall for me
In a minute, any minute, wait and see
In a minute, I mean it, you'll fall for me
In a minute, any minute, oh wait and see

Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo do doo

'Cause I've been waiting, impatient, down underneath, 

just to catch you when you fall for me
And in a minute, I mean it, you lose your grip 
'Cause you're only hanging on by a fingertip
I'm gonna huff you and puff you and shake your tree
Gonna make you, fall in love with me
Gonna make you, fall in love with me
Gonna make you make you fall in love with me

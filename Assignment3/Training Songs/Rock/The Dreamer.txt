She saw that he closed the door
She stole a look in the guarded book
His prose was a line of crows
On a washing line in the summer time
And the wind blew the crows around
Some made the sky, some hit the ground
She never heard a fuller sound
It comes as no surprise;

She's in love with the dreamer,
So in love with his world.

He had songs you could sing along to
In any time, in any key.
They were jewels in Elysian pools
In eternity for all to see
And the water helped the jewels to shine,
Some like the stars and some like wine

In the eyes of earthbound angels
It comes as no surprise

He makes her close her eyes, 
He helps her paint the skies blue.

And the seventh dream was, so surreal
When the dreamer broke the seventh seal
And butterflies all lost their wheels
It comes as no surprise

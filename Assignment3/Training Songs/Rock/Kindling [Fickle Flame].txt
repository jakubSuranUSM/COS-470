Had a circular saw blade
Where I should have had a heart
(You kept your boat afloat for so long)
I was trusted, I adored her
And I tore it all apart
(I saw you try and stop the sunset on your own)

Twin moons on a millpond
From a tumbledown barn
(Are forever wrought in ancient silver gravity)
I can still taste the heat of the sun on her skin in my arms

I could fold to the cold of these
January streets
(Keep a hand around the fickle flame of morning after)
But your smile in the half-light is
Pure pillow print cheek
(An angel tangled in the very cloths of heaven)
We'll be far away for a while
But my heart’s staying put
Warming and guarding and guiding
The one that I love

The silence and the waiting and the rush of all aboard
Fifty souls to a carriage I’m trying hard to be ignored
Then my telephone shakes into life and I see your name
And the wheat fields explode into gold either side of the train
And the wheat fields explode into gold either side of the train
And the wheat fields explode into gold

Comin' to you across country
Hoping boogies still allowed
You ask do we play heavy music
Well are thunderheads just another cloud, we do
Not fragile, straight at you

Then we vanish to the night
Still in your ears but out of sight
Not fragile

Don't think we feel hurt or wounded
Or our egos are showing thru
It's our world that's been disrupted
And our strength reflects from you
Well its true
Not fragile, over you

Try us when you're getting down
Feelin' high or just hangin' round
Not fragile

The times we travel in our lives
Are hard and give us drive
We may seem distant most of the time
But many thoughts are still on our minds
Not fragile

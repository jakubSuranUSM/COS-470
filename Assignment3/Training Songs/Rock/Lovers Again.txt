I got pictures of you in funny poses
Letters from you with pressed yellow roses
I've got souvenirs of fun times together
And I'll cherish those years and you can bet I'm forever

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm,
The one in the end, I was your friend
Lovers again,

I got pictures of you with stolen kisses
We looked so young and so full of promise
And we had those dreams
But they're not forgotten
'Cause I'll build that house with the yellow rose garden

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm
The one in the end, I was your friend
Lovers again

There's a picture of you in yesterday's paper
With that smile I knew and the new name you've taken
And I'll live each day without being bitter
'Cause we weren't that way
And I know it's not over

I know we'll be lovers again, darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that I'm
The one waiting there and in the end
We'll be lovers again

Caught between the bed sheets
I'm clinging on for my life
And now I know I can't sleep
I'mma laugh so much I cry
I stepped into the night
I'm not coming back no time soon
Gimme something to feel, gimme something to hold

Don't be standing on the sidelines
When we show up
Come along lets live together this is our town

We are just souls roaming
But you're not alone
Sinking my staggered heart
I was only trying to get home 
I was only trying to get home

I lost a friend but more than that
She lost her head and it brought me back
Ratta tat tat like that in the middle of the night
The ways [rays?] of the mirror and the shining gold
The words take the mirror and they go back home
Ratta tat tat like that in the early morning light

But how are you supposed feel when you got none, no
How could you be so cold?
Gimme something to feel, gimme something to hold

Don't be standing on the sidelines
When we show up
Come along lets live together this is our town

We are just souls roaming
But you're not alone
Sinking my staggered heart
I was only trying to get home 
I was only trying to get home

Please, please, please
Just live for the day
And take my praise
They can never say you don't try

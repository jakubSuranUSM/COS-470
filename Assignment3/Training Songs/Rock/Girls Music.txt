If you're gonna bite down, don't bite so hard
Did you know your vagrant smells like tin?
When my back is turned, when I've had one too many
When your word means absolutely nothing
And her grandad came that granted shit
How can you sit, I hope you don't sleep
I hope you like listening to music made for girls

If you're gonna bite down, don't bite so hard
Did you know your vagrant smells like tin?
When my back is turned, when I've had one too many
When your word means absolutely nothing
And her grandad came that granted shit
How can you sit, I hope you don't sleep
I hope you like listening to music made for girls

Hey

If you're gonna bite down, don't bite so hard
Did you know your vagrant smells like tin?
When my back is turned, when I've had one too many
When your word means absolutely nothing
And her grandad came that granted shit
How can you sit, I hope you don't sleep
I hope you like listening to music made for girls

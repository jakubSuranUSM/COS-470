When I hear the sound of laughing
It takes me back to forever
Where the sunset sleeps across the fields
Awoken by my dreams racing

With such a long goodbye
You knew it would make you cry

The twilight comes to quieten our hearts
My good friends we were scared of nothing
Lamplight stretched across my bed
I'm awoken by cars racing

With such a long goodbye
You knew it would make you cry

With such a long goodbye
You knew it would make you cry

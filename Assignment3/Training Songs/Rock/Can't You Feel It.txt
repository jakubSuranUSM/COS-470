Outside the window, I'm tryin' to get in
Can't ya feel it, baby?
You know that my love goes deeper than sin
Can't ya feel it, baby?

The shock of ya, ow, make me feel so fine
Lightenin' flashin' up my spine

If I can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown
If I can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown

Can't ya feel it?

You know you give me fever, you're out of control
Can't ya feel it, baby?
You're looking like I'm never wanna let you go
Can't ya feel it, baby?

The shock of ya, ow, make me feel so fine
Lightenin' flashin' up my spine

If I can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown
I can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown, yeah

Outside the window, I'm tryin' to get in
Can't ya feel it, baby?
You know that my love goes deeper than sin
Can't ya feel it, baby?

I guess ya got me under your magic spell
Right between heaven and hell

And if I can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown
Can't make ya happy
I'll jump into the river and drown

I can't make ya happy
Gonna jump into the river and drown, yeah

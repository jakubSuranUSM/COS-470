Why does everybody hurt 
Every bitter sickening word breaks my heart 
Why can't anybody hear 
When the thunder disappears and the sun breaks free 
It's time for mercy 
It's time for mercy 
Mercy me 
Every color every shade 
Everyone an angel made from the breath of God 
I'm your mother IæŠ¦ your son 
I am not the other one that you love to hate 
It's time for mercy 
It's time for mercy 
Pretty please... 
When the fires all burn down 
When they open up the ground and put you in 
I'll lay flowers on your grave 
It's a little too late for sorry now 
It's time for mercy 
It's time for mercy 
It's time for mercy 
Mercy me

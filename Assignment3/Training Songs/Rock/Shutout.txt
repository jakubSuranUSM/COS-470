Throw off
Those gimmicks 
To the boys
Let them 
Send it all up 
In the air	 
There is 
Crouching and wailing 
On stones
Down here
We must freeze off 
This atmosphere 
Scraping out noise 
Across night wires
Runs for the distant cities
There is never
A lock
In the fall 
Down here 
As the 
BIG FULL 
Pours away 
In the shutout 
In the shutout 
How will we know 
The great doll 
Something attacked 
The earth last night 
With a
Kick that man habit 
Eye
Cut the
Sleep tight boys 
Who dreamed 
And dreamed 
Of a city
Like the sky
There were faces 
Bobbing in the heat 
For some rising 
From her zone 
Moving, hitting, 
Holding on
For the promise 
To carry us home 
In the shutout
In the shutout 
Never a lock 
In the fall
In the shutout 
In the shutout 
How will we know 
The great doll

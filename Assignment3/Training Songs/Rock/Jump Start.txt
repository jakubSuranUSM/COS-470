Sometimes I've seemed tired
And I feel I could sleep all the day
Yes, I lack a little motivation

But I wake up sometimes
And I see that the sun really shines
But I have a couple reservations now

Because I think I feel a little strangely today
Yes I think I feel a little spark
Hey, a little jump start

Never will regret this, I
Never will, never will, never will regret this

Never will regret this, I
Never will, never will, never will regret this

I'm fearless today
And I'm not scared to say I'm afraid
Yes I have a couple hesitations

And I open the door
And I wonder if she might come in
Do you really need an invitation?

Because I think I feel a little something
Yes I think I feel a little spark
Hey, a little jump start

Never will forget this, I
Never will, never will, never will forget this

Never will forget this, I
Never will, never will, never will forget this

It's a doll completely made of socks
It's a cover for a tissue box
It's a clothespin duck and a Funfur cat
And a crazy yarn and beercan hat
Earth to Grandma
What the hell is that?
It a painted rock with google eyes
It's a matchstick cross where Jesus died
It's a plaque that says 'I Heart My Home'
It's toothpicks, felt, and styofoam
Earth to Grandma
What the hell is that?

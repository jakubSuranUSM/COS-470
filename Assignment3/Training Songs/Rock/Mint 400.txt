Come and hold me, waitin' for too long.
Gonna find out, a reason what went wrong. 
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.

Gonna see you and I want to see you smile.

Sounds older but all the money's gone.
Time for handouts, the passion's all but gone. 
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.

Gonna see you and I want to see you smile.
Gonna see you and I want to see you cry.

want to see you and I want to see you smile.

Gonna kill me, waitin' for so long.
Friends will leave me, tell them what went wrong.
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.
Gonna find out, no difference anyway.

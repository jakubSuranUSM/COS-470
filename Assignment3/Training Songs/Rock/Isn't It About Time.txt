Don't look now, don't heed the warning
It's really of no concern
Don't mind the sound
They're only just bombing
Anything left to burn

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Fire flood familiar famine
The jungle so far away
Blood baked into blackened soil
How many tons a day

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

Does it have to take so long
Is it easy not to care
Seems to me that enemies are fantasies
Somebody elses living nightmare

Who gonna live, who gonna die
Do you want to know
Does it give you a sense of power
To say yes or no

Isn't it about time
Isn't it about time we learned

I want to walk you home, please let me walk you home
I want to walk you home, please let me walk you home
You look so good to me, oh-ooh-ee 
I wish I was the lucky guy who could walk you right on down the aisle

I love the way you walk I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk I love to hear you talk
I'm not tryin' to be smart, I'm not tryin' to break your heart
But if I ask you for a date, will you tell me that I'm not too late
 
I want to hold your hand, please let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand, please let me hold your hand
You look so good to me, oo-ooee

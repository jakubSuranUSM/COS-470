Well, I woke one morning, found you staring down at me
You said "I'll take my share now, father please"
And you took your money and you took your leave
You drilled my heart and turned your back on me

And you hit the town and you hit the bottle hard
You race 'round in your fancy cars and you blow all your money
On brothels, beds, and bars
Before you know your broken times get hard

I still stand here waiting with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been, so please come home

And now you've hit bottom, all those open doors have shut
And you're hungry stomach's tied in knots
But I know what you're thinking, that you troubled me enough
Nothing could ever separate you from my love

I still stand here waiting, with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been
Yes and I'll be right here waiting, 'til you come around the bend

And I run to you and hold you close, won't let go again
So please come home, please come home
Don't you know son that I love you?
And I don't care where you've been, so please come home

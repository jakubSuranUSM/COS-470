They don't even know
There's no place to go
Their judging your concepts
When taking their first steps
And swaying to and fro

[Chorus]
They don't even know
Hiding hole
Hiding hole
Hiding hole
They don't even know
About me and me and 

You don't even know
You got no place to go
You're judging my concepts
When taking my first steps
And pacing to and fro

You don't even know
Hiding hole
Hiding hole
Hiding hole

You don't even know
Like me and me and '

You don't even know
Hiding hole
Hiding hole
Hiding hole

You don't even know
Like me and me and

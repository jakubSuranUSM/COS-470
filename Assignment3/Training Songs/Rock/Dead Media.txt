We don't need this dead, dead media,
We're not mourning any more,
The analogue image hits our poor tired retinas,
We killed the digital whores last Thursday.
Put on your red, red jacket and come over,
I need some real company,
We'll be the art-deco clowns,
We'll watch the foreign language films,
Every Thursday.
The dead, dead cinema

And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly
You and your emotion
I'm on your side
I say a prayer
And you and you're devotion
You're locked away
Alone in there

Cause I don't want you to feel forgotten
And only you can choose your fate
Remember that all the pain that crossed here
And there's no space to place the blame

And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly
And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly

You and you're addiction
Inside your face
The truth comes back
Cause you know there's something I've forgotten
And notes I left to fault the blame

And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly
And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly

Cause you and me we're gonna be special
You and me we're gonna be special

And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly
And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly

And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly
And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly

And I love it when you fall
And I love it when you fall
And I love it when you fall to me
Suddenly

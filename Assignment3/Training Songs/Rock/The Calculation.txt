You went into the kitchen cupboard, got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces of these strangers in the pages
Till we knew 'em mathematically

They were in our minds until forever but we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings and divided them up even
And it called that calculation perfect love

Didn't even know that love was bigger
Didn't even know that love was so, so
Hey, hey, hey

Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up

So we made the hard decision and we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones, saw our hearts were little stones
Pulled them out they weren't beating and we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on the granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard until they sparked

Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up
Hey this fire, it's burnin', burnin' us up

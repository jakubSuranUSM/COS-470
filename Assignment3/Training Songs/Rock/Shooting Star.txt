Johnny was a schoolboy
When he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do' I think it was
And from there it didn't take him long

Got himself a guitar
Used to play every night
Now he's in a rock and roll outfit
And everything's all right
Don't ya know

Johnny told his mama
Hey, Mama, I'm going away
I'm gonna hit the big time
Gonna be a big star someday

Momma came to the door
With a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said "Don't cry Momma,
Smile and wave goodbye."

Don't you know

Don't you know
That you are a shooting star,(don't you know, don't you know)
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are?

Johnny made a record
Went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing his song
Watching the world go by
Surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him
And said "Well I made the big time at last."

Don't you know
That you are a shooting star,(don't you know, don't you know)
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are?

A shooting star

Don't you know
That you are a shooting star,(don't you know, don't you know)
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are?

Johnny died one night
Died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets
By his head

Johnny's life passed him
By like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind
You can still hear him play

Don't you know

Don't you know
That you are a shooting star,(don't you know, don't you know)
Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you
Just as long, as long as you are?

Would you give blood if you had any
would you say i'm good or are there far too many
fish in the sea 
won't you please say that again
shame on you  
there's something in my head  
and it's got it's back to me   

one day i'll make you sing my praises  
but at the moment i'm far too lazy
to get down on your knees 
i'm begging please say that again
i'll carry on for as long as i have to  
come round to my house  
and i'll show you how to  
get down on your knees 
i'm begging please say that again  

shame on you  
there's something in my head  
and it's got it's back to me     

would you walk near me  
if you knew how to  
could i ever see you and  
do you know how to  
get down on your knees  
i'm begging  please say that again  
shame on you  
there's something in my legs  
and they never walk to me     

would you give blood if you had any  
would you say i'm good or are  there far too many
fish in the sea  
won't you please say that again  

shame on you  
there's something in my head  
and it's got it's back to me  
shame on you 
there's something in my legs  
and they never walk to me  

shame on you 
there's something in my mouth  
and it never talks to me  
shame on you 
there's something in my head  
and it's got it's back to me

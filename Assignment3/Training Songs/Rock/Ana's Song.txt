Please die Ana 
For as long as you're here we're not 
You make the sound of laughter 
And sharpened nails seem softer 

And I need you now somehow 
And I need you now somehow 

Open fire on the needs designed 
On my knees for you 
Open fire on my knees desires 
What I need from you 

Imagine pageant 
In my head the flesh seems thicker 
Sandpaper tears corrode the film 

And I need you now somehow 
And I need you now somehow 

Open fire on the needs designed 
On my knees for you 
Open fire on my knees desires 
What I need from you 

And your my obsession 
I love you to the bones 
And Ana wrecks your life 
Like an anorexia life 

Open fire on the need designed 
On my knees for you
Open fire on my knees desires 
What I need from you 
Open fire on my needs designed 
Oh, and open fire on the needs designed 
On my knees for you

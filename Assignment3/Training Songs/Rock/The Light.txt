And do you remember
The blackest moment
Those blackest thoughts that rush

And do you remember
When too much time
When too much time was mine

OHH - these days
OHH - they're all mine

And do you recall
When you walk
Talk to yourself
In the street
In your autumn, In your winter
In your wintertime - TIME

And do you recall
When you fall
I can't help notice
No light in our eyes
In our eyes

I give you my armour
I give you my glory
I give what's truly mine
And if you want
"Give me" (oooh) heaven
Because heaven should be mine

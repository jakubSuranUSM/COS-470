Wipe the blood from your lip
With the flesh of your hand
Theres no thorn in the side left to grow
So lets cherish the names that we lost for an age
With the rue now the supper must go
Where traditions they blend lives a home on the mend
The grass glistens now for alls eyes
So lets sever the shame we have come to reclaim
With the waters retreat feel the shore for us
Woth the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

[Chorus]
Don't look back
For whats dead now is safe
The exiled, a home where the soul kept safe
Take me back on the crest of a wave
No more tears for you paddy's lament
No more tears
No more paddy's
Lament

Rip the greet from his heart
Theres no sorrow tonight
For once banished dreams sleep divine
Where the silence you hear is the prosper we shared
The only blade is a razor sharp smile
Still the church bell rings the collective sings that still roam
But the only thing left is the pain of nothing once more

[Chorus]

Grab the leaf of the branch from the tree in the ground
Where the roots claimed the earth many tioled
To a land that now stands under no-ones command
And her beauty let no man destroy
So remember the gun and the damage it's done
The last drop as been spilled for you and I
Let there be no despair for the rule we once shared
Brush the tear from the eye that still shines

Where the red rose pales lay a thousand graves many more
Where the ghost still haunt for the day we come to the fore

[Chorus: x2]

No more tears
No more paddy's
Lament

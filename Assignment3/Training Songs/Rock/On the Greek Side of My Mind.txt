At night the forest does not sleep ...
And lo ... A tree was taught to speak ...
There is a tree .... And there is an island ...
On the greek side of my mind ...

On the Greek side of my mind ... 
Storm uprooted the tree ...
And it lay dead on the sand ...
But in truth it did not die ...
Come with me, come with me and have no fear ...
And to its stories lead an ear...
For the tree spoke about ways that walk ...
On the Greek side of my mind ...

It dreamed about a godness ...
dyin'on a star ridin'high ...
It roamed up the mountains beyond,
Where you may see ...
You may see people shall be as masters free ...
On the Greek side of my mind ...

I've drawn signs on the sand ...
And through the pebbles...
A light was streaming...
I do not know whence came the gleaming ...
Who lives within' ... ?
Devils that sleep sound below the seven seas ... ?
A prisoner ... ? A man set free ... ?
A part of you ... 
Somethin' ... just somethin' of me ...
Those may you find ....
Those may you find ...
On the Greek side of my mind.

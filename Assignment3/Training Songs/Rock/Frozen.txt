Misted windows
Hide your empty eyes
Every moment, every whisper
Separates you from me
I’ve been screaming
Won’t you let me in?
Let me see a trace
Of the places hidden
Under your skin

I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
unknown emotions
Repel your embrace
I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
afraid of your embrace

Needles sting me
When you look away
And your silence
Sounds like deafening screams to me
I’ve been waiting
Won’t you open your heart?
And let me in
Please let me in

I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
unknown emotions
Repel your embrace
I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
afraid of your embrace

Free your mind from doubt
All you have, is now
Free your mind from shame
It will only bring you pain

I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
unknown emotions
Repel your embrace
I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
afraid of your embrace

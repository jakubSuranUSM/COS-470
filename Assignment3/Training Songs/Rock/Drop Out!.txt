Drop out with me, just live your life behind your eyes
Your own skies, your own tomorrows
Don't you worry now, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

Just be yourself, no one can step inside your mind
From behind, if you just walk and
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

They made the rules and they laid it on us all
Don't you fall 'cause then they'll own you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

They're using you to kill all the echoes still around
From the sound of calendars crumbling
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

They made the bomb, would they drop it on us all?
Great and small, but must we follow?
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

Drop out with me, just live your life behind your eye
Your own skies, your own tomorrows
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry
Whole world's in too big a hurry

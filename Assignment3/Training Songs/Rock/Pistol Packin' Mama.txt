Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Oh, drinkin' beer in a cabaret
Was I havin' fun!
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run

Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody!

Oh, she kicked out my windshield
And she hit me over the head
She cussed and cried and said I lied
And she wished that I was dead

Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Pappy made a batch of corn
The revenuers came
The draught was slow
So now they know
You can't do that to Mame

Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Oh, singing songs in a cabaret
Was I havin' fun!
Until one night it didn't seem right
And now I'm on the run

Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

Oh, pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down

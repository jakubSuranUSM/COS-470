Hey you watching as this light bleeds all over me 
Shadows rise and fall listen as I call is this reality 
I will be with you tonight 
and tomorrow be 1,000 miles away 
I will be with you tonight 
I will be with you as long as you say stay

One little piece of my soul 
One little piece of my whole life 
I give to you 
Take it now

I'm with you 
I'm not with my lover 
It's not for another broken heart 
It's for you 
Not just for some shattered dream I once knew 
It's for you 
It's for you

Hey you looking through a mirror to a cage 
I'll take you away this miracle you pray for on the stage 
I will be with you tonight 
I will be with you 1,000 miles away 
I will never leave 
Inside of you a piece of me will stay

One little piece of my soul 
One little piece of my whole life 
I give to you 
Take it now

I'm with you 
I'm not with my lover 
It's not for another broken heart 
It's for you 
Not just for some shattered dream I once knew 
It's for you 
It's for you

Come closer now

I'm with you 
I'm not with my lover 
It's not for another broken heart 
It's for you 
Not just for some shattered dream I once knew 
It's for you 
It's for you

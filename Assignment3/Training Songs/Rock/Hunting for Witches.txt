I was sitting on the roof of my house
With a shotgun
And a six pack of beers (six pack of beers, six pack of beers)

The newscaster says the enemy's among us
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time for liberal thought

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

In the '90s, optimistic as a teen
Now its terror
Airplanes crash into towers

The Daily Mail says the enemy's among us
Taking our women, and taking our jobs
The reasonable fool is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
And there must be accountability

Desperate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
And there must be accountability

Desperate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place

They must mean business
To say there's nothing worse
Then to let your precious love child
Leave the planet first

'Cause, oh whoa whoa
They've gotta just let her go

All the things that you swear you're gonna do
Reservations on the next train to the moon
Pack your things cause there ain't no time lose
And all the things you never

So I think we're gonna have to record her
Sometimes against her will
We're gonna keep her alive with black and whites
Color moving and still

And then, oh whoa whoa
We've gotta just let her go

All the things that you swear you're gonna do
Reservations on the next train to the moon
Pack your things cause there ain't no time to lose

Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go

All the things that you swear you're gonna do
Reservations on the next train to the moon
Pack your things cause there ain't no time to lose

All the things that you swear you're gonna do
Reservations on the next train to the moon
Pack your things cause there ain't no time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose
No time to lose

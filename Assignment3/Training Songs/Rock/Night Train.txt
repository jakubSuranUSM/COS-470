Out of the night burning with light
Train shining black, I won't look back, life is running
Hoping someday someone will say, I got it made
Pull up the shade, let the sun in

Down on the night train, I feel the starlight steal away
Use up a lifetime looking for the break of day

Border patrol looking through me
And towns without names all look the same, I hear crying
Paris to Spain, countries in pain
Caught up in flight, feel the sight, Europe dying

Down on the night train, I feel the starlight steal away
Use up a lifetime looking for the break of day

Rolling on, hear the wheels singing, fever keeps coming on so strong
My ticket paid, trying to fade
I hope I get there, not just somewhere I was leaving
Out in the dark all the wolves bark
And I close my arms, try to keep warm by believing

Down on the night train, I feel the starlight steal away
Use up a lifetime looking for the break of day

Hard rain holdin' on, cold wheels movin' on
Everybody, they're so alone down on the night train

Hard rain holdin' on, cold wheels movin' on
Everybody, they're so alone down on the night train

Night train
Night train, whoa

Hard rain holdin' on, cold wheels movin' on
Everybody, they're so alone down on the night train

Hard rain holdin' on, cold wheels movin' on
Everybody, whoa whoa, so alone down on the night train

Night train
Night train, whoa, night train

Saw you walkin' out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doin' out there?
Who you tryin' to be?

Know what you're thinkin'
'Cause I've been there myself
I've been kicked so many times
I don't know nothin' else

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares

And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out?
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Saw you dancin' out
At Madame Wong Two's
You did them same two steps
That I taught you back in June

Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Caf√©
Did you get your fill?
Did you think ya had to pay?

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again

And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're havin' too much fun
With your sudden romance

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out?
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out?
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out?
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Saw you walking out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doing out there?
Who you trying to be?

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us?
Guess I'll leave it up to you

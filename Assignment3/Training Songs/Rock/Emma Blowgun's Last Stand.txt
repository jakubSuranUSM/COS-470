Goodness knows its been a wonderful run
The autumn lakes where the children were swans
Your mothers convictions and your fathers predictions don't seem so insane
They laugh they say your treasures are fake but don't throw it away
You've been framed with a beautiful name
You've been saved but you've lost your head
With halos and friends the trinity saves but three is a crowd
You flirt you drink you can't stop your winking at the boys at the bar
All you need is a gun and a car
A country song if you don't have a heart
My cowboys and indians and the falls and aminions where the highways are far
When all you know your shadows a ghost don't let it scare you away

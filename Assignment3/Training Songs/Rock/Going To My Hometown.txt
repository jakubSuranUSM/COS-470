Mama's in the kitchen baking up a pie.
   Daddy's in the backyard,"Get a job, son,
   You know you ought to try".

   I packed up my bag, I headed down the road,
   I got me a job from Henry Ford.
   But I made a mistake, I moved much too far
   And now I know what the lonesome blues are . . .
   I`m getting lonesome, I'm getting blue,
   I need someone to talk to.
   I`m getting lonesome, I'm getting blue,
   Let me tell you where I'm going to . . .
   
   Yes I'm going to my home town,
   I don't care ever even if I have to walk.
   Yes I'm going to my home town,
   I don't care even if I have to walk.
   I gotta move on now baby, I got no more time left to talk.
   
   Yes I'm going to my home town,
   Sorry but I can't take you.
   Yes I'm going to my home town,
   Sorry but I can't take you.
   Only got one ticket, you know I just can't afford two.
   Take me home.
   
   The day I left,
   You know the rain was pouring down.
   The day I left,
   You know the rain was pouring down.
   I'm going home again baby,
   I believe the sun's gonna come on out.
   Let's go home, boy, let's go home.
   
   Yes I'm going to my home town,
   You know baby I gotta go.
   Going to my home town,
   You know I just have to go.
   I really love you, woman,
   I'll see you in a year, maybe no, maybe yes.
   
   Going to my home town,
   I'm going to my home town,
   Going to my home town,
   Going to my home town.

I know that it's getting late
But I don't want to go home
I am in no hurry baby time can wait
I don't want to go home
Listen to the man sing his song
I don't want to go home
I don't mind baby to stay alnight long
Cause I don't want to go home

Listen baby
I know we had to try
To reach up and touch the sky baby
What ever happened to you and I
That I don't want to go home

Look at all the people staying
Saying I don't want to go home
In the night
I don't want to go home
I know the words to the song I feel
I don't want to go home
I know it's talking about the way I feel
I don't want to go home

Listen baby
I know we had to try
To reach up and touch the sky baby
What ever happened to you and I
That I don't want to go home

I want to hear people laughing 
And having a good time
I want to know why she told me she had to go
Why did she leave me lonely

I know it's time to go
But I don't want to go home
You don't play the blues soft and low
Cause I don't want to go home

Listen baby
I know we had to try
To reach up and touch the sky baby
What ever happened to you and I
That I don't want to go home

Wonder why you don't like April
Wonder why you hate the spring
Wonder why you don't like April
Oh why won't you sing?

"My boyfriend he gets around, he does favors for Leo downtown
They didn't know it would be a set up, cops surround
That was when we started fighting, that was when I moved out
That was just the beginning, look at me now"

Oh my poor woman
Water is for for fish like air is for men
You can't fight against the law
Of good times never call
On you because the good times never call
When you're waiting by the phone
The good times never call
On you unless you do it too
Unless you do it too
Unless you do it too

I have given up explaining sorrow
Oh I have given up on my hotel
I'm up here dancing like a martyr
But I have given up on casting spells
Oh I have given
Miss Lonelyhearts
Miss Lonelyhearts
Dear Miss Lonelyhearts

Miss Lonelyhearts you've got to help me,
I have tried most everything
Short of my head in the oven
Short of drinking kerosene

Oh I have given
I have given
I have given

I got mad
Wasn't cool
Had a grip on myself
But I lost it like one big fool
I can beg
If I must
If I ain't got your love in my life child
It all goes bust
Uh, ya, yeah

Baby, please, please, please
Baby, please, baby, please
Hey baby, please, please, please
And baby don't, yeah, baby don't

I've been down
Pressure drop
Got a lot on my head lately, baby
My mind won't stop
There you were, looking sly
Hell, I felt like you wanted to lay
With that slick, smart guy
Ah, ya, yeah

Baby, please, please, please
Baby, please, baby, please
Hey baby, please, please, please
And baby don't, yeah, baby don't

Take a look at the man
With a heart that's been through
Take a look at the job
I keep working for you
Just to bring you the things
That you tell me you want…
Turn around, baby, talk…

I give her time
I come through
I can deal with the problems I got
If I still got you
See the sun sinking low
Hey, that just tells my poor heart sinks
When you turn to go

Baby, please, please, please
Baby, please, baby, please
Hey baby, please, please, please
And baby don't, girl, baby don't
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby don't
Baby don't

Girls like that
Girls like that don't go for guys like us
I wanna see the facts
And she says simply, "No, uh-uh"
The Julio Iglesias
He just ain't scientific

I'll keep on looking for that loving feeling
I'll keep on looking for that loving feeling
All of the chemists and witch doctors they know
(What I'll never, ever know)

Guitar

Now listen
Girls like that
Girls like that don't go for guys like us
I still wanna see the facts
But this time she's serious

She says there's too, too many worlds
Too many worlds wrapped up in science fiction
Tiny boys and tiny girls
I may well live to regret this in the morning
For I am considering a move to South America

To keep on looking for that loving feeling
I'll keep on looking for that loving feeling
All of the chemists and witch doctors they know
(What I'll never, ever know)

They know, they know, they know that loving feeling
They know the chemists and witch doctors know it
They know, they know, they know that loving feeling
That feeling
That feeling

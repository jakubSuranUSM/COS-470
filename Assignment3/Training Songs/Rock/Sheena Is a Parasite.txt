Sheena is a champion of self-reliance
As soon as she needs it she knows just where the knife is
Her fingers aren't so fast anymore
It's been 29 years since she came to these shores

Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite

Send her back to the sea, they cried
But Sheena spat bile 'til they let her lie
She claims she's working for the Lord
But you know what she's looking for

Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite

Sheena's ambition sneers at your routine
And behind that glass she sits, cold
If Sheena was buried, no one would care
She hates everyone, she knows no one

Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Sheena is a parasite
Send her back across the sea
Back across the sea

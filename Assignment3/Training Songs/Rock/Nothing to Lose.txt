Nothing to lose

Now I can really break it
Now I don't have to fake it
Forget it then I don't need it
If it ain't hot I'll leave it

Nothing to show but no one to 
Stop me I'm going away
I'm kicking my heels, rolling the wheels 
And I'm leaving today yeah, yeah

Nothing to lose

I gotta run for my life
Shoot out and shine those searchy lights
I'm really top cross that border line
I'm going to make it stick this time

Nothing to show but no one to 
Stop me I'm going away
I'm kicking my heels, rolling the wheels 
And I'm leaving today yeah, yeah

Nothing to lose

Sitting back I only wish
Today will turn out fine
And wash away the stain
The poison in my eyes
What do you recommend?
I feel my life descending
I'm falling out of reach
Catch me as I bleed (again)

I"m not insane
Can't reach the pain

If I could be all by myself
I could be me
If you could see, live with my pain
The thoughts that I keep

I hate the way they are
Their patronising thoughts
Tried to get inside my head
Ask the question I have read
But one thing makes it hard
Feel so fragile as I cry
So confused yet so alive
So abused the system lied
You lied to me

I'm not insane
Can't reach the pain

If I could be all by myself
I could be me
If you could see, live with my pain
The thoughts that I keep

Alone, alone

Hands appeared around my neck
Felt so hard to breathe I stared 
As my focus turned to haze
I could see them

I'm not insane
Can't stand the pain

If I could be all by myself
I could be me
If you could see, live with my pain
The thoughts that I keep

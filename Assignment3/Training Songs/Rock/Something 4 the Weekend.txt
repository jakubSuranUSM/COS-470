First time, I did it for the hell of it 
Stuck it on the back of my tongue 
And swallowed it 
Second time, things are
Getting easier 
Blow me down this wind
Is getting breezier 
Third time lucky, maybe feelin' fuzzy 
Oh my God! we're getting hippy-dippy!
5-6-7 man I'm in heaven 
And I'm growing my beard 
Until it gets sheared

You're on my mind 
Every day and every night 
And you'll never go away 
Cause I know you're here to stay 
For the rest of my mind

First time, I did it for the hell of it 
Stuck it right up and that
Was the end of it 
Second time, things are
Getting easier 
Hairs on the back of
My neck are getting stickier

Third time unlucky perversely bloody 
Doctor I'm ill please pass
Me the brandy 
5-6-7 I heard George Foreman say: 
Slow horses loose 
Fast women frighten 
You're on my mind 
Every day and every night 
And you'll never go away 
Cause I know you're here to stay 
For the rest of my mind

I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself

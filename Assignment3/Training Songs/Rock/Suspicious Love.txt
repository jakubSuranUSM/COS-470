In the last few hundred years
Some people lost their place on earth
They never had a chance
To stay just like they were
I can't understand why should this happen here
We should accept and learn
How to live together.
These are just some strangers thoughts
These are just some strangers thoughts
The reason for the pain
Is always based on history
The madness in some minds
Has started to do this all
I can't understand why should this happen here
We should accept and learn
How to live together.
These are just some strangers thoughts.

You see them everywhere they're counting their pesos
I took the bait and now I'm hooked on the line
I hope that when they get me in they they throw me back and they release this hook

I think maybe I was born a little late
Oh, I think maybe I was born a little late

I built a home because I know that we'd be alright
You made a promise and I knew that you were so right
But then you hesitate and you make us wait you motherfuckers

Yeah

I think maybe I was born a little late,
Oh, I think maybe I was born a little late

I think maybe I was born a little late
I think maybe I was born a little late

I said all I could say in 1981
About this shit I'm in I couldn't turn and run
The legs closed and I was
Sitting there and now I'm still sitting here

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't

I think maybe I was born a little late
I think maybe I was born a little late
I think maybe I was born a little late

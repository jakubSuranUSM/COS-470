No risk
No fun
I'm here
You're gone

I'm cool
You're hot
I love you not

Don't say
A word
Unless you're heard

I know
I hate
To see you rude

I think I'll let you down
You should've let me go
I think I'll make you leave
Cause you have lost control

You pushed 
The line 
Too far bye bye

Turn over
There's 
No need to try

You waste 
Your time
You're absolutely useless baby

(Brock Tait)
The spirit once lived
In all of our hearts,
A spirit of freedom,
Dance, music and arts.
We gave what we could,
But they wanted more.
We came in peace,
But left in war.
A society infiltrated from the inside,
Government instigators?
Nowhere to hide.
We have allowed it to happen,
It is so very sad,
Everyone is guilty,
Though not everyone is bad.
Those carefree days of summers past
At the time seemed too good to last.
But I thought that it would be destroyed,
From the outside... not from within,
By the closed minded fascists,
Not by our own "Kith and Kin".

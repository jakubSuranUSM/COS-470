First the mic then a half cigarette
Singing cathy's clown
That's the man that she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town

She appears composed, so she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll 

I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow 
Now she's done and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote

'Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune,
"You're no good,
You're no good you're no good you're no good"

Can't you tell that it's well understood? 
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow 
I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
I'm tired

I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO, mom

It's ok, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell mr. man with impossible plans to just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes 

I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow

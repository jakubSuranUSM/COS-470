Well, I gotta girl name Suzie
She knows just what to do,she's just a rockin'
She knows what to do
She knows how to love me
And rock it too, that's my Little Suzie
She knows what to do

She rocks to the left and she rocks to the right
She rocks all day and she rocks all night
When my baby gets tired of me, 
I'm gonna drown myself in a sea

Well come on let's go little Suzie
Tell me you'll be true
If I should loose you
Then what could I do?

He's got a house made of glass
Got his own swimming pool...what a gas
We've got a one-room shack
Five by six by the railroad track, well

What about us
What about us
Don't want to cause no fuss
But what about us

He's with a beautiful chick
Every night of the week, pretty slick
We're two poor hung up souls
Girls won't touch with a ten-foot pole, well

What about us
What about us
Don't want to cause no fuss
But what about us

He goes to eat at the Ritz
Big steaks, that's the breaks
We eat hominy grits
From a bag, what a drag

He's got a car made of suede
With a black leather top, got it made
If we go out on dates
We go in a box on roller skates, well

What about us

Don't want to cause no fuss

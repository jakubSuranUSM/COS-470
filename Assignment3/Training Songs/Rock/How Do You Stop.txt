Hard bodies, soft emotions
So fast, so smart
The world is at your feet
But what about your heart?
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late, late hours of the night

How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Oh, before it's too late
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on, oh and then it's gone
(How do you stop?)

You've had success
Lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the the "good life"
You thought it would never never end
One day you're too young
Then you're in your prime
Then you're lookin' back
At the hands of time

How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Before it's too late
Boy, you choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Before it's too late
You think love will wait so you don't hold on
And then it's gone

(How do you stop?)

How do you stop a runaway train? (How do you stop?)
How do you stop the driving rain?
How do you stop the ripening corn? (How do you stop?)
How do you stop the baby being born?

How do you stop?
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Before it's too late
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
You're lost if you hesitate
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Love from slipping away
How do you stop? (How do you stop?)
Before it's too late

When you're on your own 
You walk in the rain 
You walk around the house 
Then walk around it again 

You pretend you're happy 
That you've got it all 
But don't be upset 
If you fall on your knees
And beg like a dog

I've reached a low, 
Don't you know 
You're the apple of my eye 
I'm running low, with this show 
No matter how I try 
I'm sick of this angst, 
Don't need thanks
You're the apple of my eye 

I drink a lot of wine 
When I am alone 
I lose my track of time
My ideas turn to stone 
I pretend I'm sad 
That I'm still so small 
But I'm not upset If 
I fall on my knees 
And beg like a dog 

I've reached a low, 
Don't you know 
You're the apple of my eye 
I'm running low, with this show 
No matter how I try 
I'm sick of this angst, 
Don't need thanks
You're the apple of my eye

I've reached a low, 
Don't you know 
You're the apple of my eye 
I'm running low, with this show 
No matter how I try 
I'm sick of this angst, 
Don't need thanks
You're the apple of my eye

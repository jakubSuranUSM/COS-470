I've been thinking all night about this song
The music's ok, but I can't find words to sing
I could sing that I'm a virgin and show my tits
And prea how sex improves the world
And which masturbation is a thing of the day
I'm affraid I havenÂ´t got that much to say

I thought about "hello fool, I love you"
Or repeat a hundred times "how do you do?"
I want to dance with somebody, hey I like that sound
But there ain't nobody humpin' around

I want to meet the man who wrote these lyrics
He must be great,
I want to meet the man who wrote these songs
I want to meet the man, I want to meet the man

And while I sing these words to you
There is a rat in my kitchen, 
Don't know what I'll do
Forget about the rat and sing along
'Cause we feel so strong
And we can't hold on
We walk hand in hand
To the promised land

I think I met the men who wrote these lyrics
I guess I have ignored the things he says
I think that I have noticed how expensive perfume never covers up a smelly breath

I want to meet the man, I want to meet the man
Want to meet the man, I want to meet the man
I want to meet the man, I want to meet the man
I want to meet the man
Want to meet the man, I want to meet the man

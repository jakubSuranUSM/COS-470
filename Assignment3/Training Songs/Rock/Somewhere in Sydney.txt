Somewhere in Sydney there's a lady so pretty
When she crosses the harbour she's the queen of the city
Somewhere in Sydney there's a lady so sweet
She hides her tattoo when she's out on the street
Well it might look like Monaco
But it sure ain't Greece
They gave us Sin City on a million year lease
Ten miles outa Sydney
On Freeway Five
The radio's playin' just as fast as you drive

Somewhere in Sydney upon Bellevue Hill
There's a gay boy with a new toy
Movin' in for the kill
Somewhere in Sydney there's a boy with a hit
Who's shakin' the city and he just won't quit
Well it might look like Monaco
But it sure ain't Greece
They gave us Sin City on a million year lease
Ten miles outa Sydney on Freeway Five
The radio's playin' just as fast as you drive

Sydney sweet Sydney I love your red roofs
And I'm spendin' all my money in your telephone booths
So many people so many types
So much truth and so much hype
I get anonymous letters from the North Shore
They don't read like hard core
Name droppers on the road from my hometown
Bein' around just to be around
And there ain't no rats in the high rise flats
Where the clouds float by my window
And the sounds on the streets are so discreet
And they're all in their own special lingo.

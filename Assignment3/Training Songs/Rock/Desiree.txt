Desiree
In the shadow of the dawn he's turnin' to you
Your restless eyes haunted by the feeling of the night
He turns around to touch you but he knows
You've gone

You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry
You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry

Desiree
You first met your love in southern Italy
The Mediterranean winds have blown your love away
You're flyin' off to summer but you know
He's gone

You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry
You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry

Desiree
On sunset cliffs you watched the end of yesterday
The Californian dream has swept your love away
You're tryin' to remember but you know
He's gone

You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry
You've been travelin' Desiree
Since you were grown enough not to cry

Desiree
Desiree
Desiree

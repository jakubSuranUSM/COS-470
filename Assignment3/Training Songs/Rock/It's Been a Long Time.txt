It's been a long time
Since we stood beside the water
The sun goin' down
Was burnin' peaceful and slow
And the shadows of evening
Were creepin' around us
It's been a long time
It's been a mighty long time

It's been a long time
We used to find it all together
The new and the strange
Lotsa gambles and dares
And the road was a high road
It led to the hilltops
It's been a long time
It's been a mighty long time

Turnin' wheels, rollin' hard
Flyin' down the boulevard
Take it slow, let me breathe
I can't relate, I can't believe
Dirty snow, city lights
Tower clocks and lonely nights
Reachin' out, it's love in vain
I can't connect, I can't explain

It's been a long time
We used to laugh away the hours
The summer was kind
And we were kids in the heat
And the moon was a high moon
It rose in the twilight
It's been a long time
It's been a mighty long time

It's been a long time
I look around, I'm gettin' older
Rememberin' fun
And tryna find it again
Lookin' in through the doorways
And talkin' to strangers
It's been a long time
It's been a mighty long

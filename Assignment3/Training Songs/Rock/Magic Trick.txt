People come, people go
Sometimes without goodbye
Sometimes without hello

[Chorus]
She's got one magic trick
Just one and that's it
Oh she disappears

It's like, now you see her, now you don't
You think you're gonna get to know her now, well you won't

[Chorus]

It's like, easy come, easy go
Sometimes without goodbye
Sometimes without hello

[Chorus]

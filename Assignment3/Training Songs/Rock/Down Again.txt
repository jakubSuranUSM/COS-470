Wasted all that I desire.
Would bring me down again,
And I could keep it all inside.
Its just about becoming.
Now I'm under the sun.
Won't anyone see that I'm alive?
Through the days that I run with me,
All through the night,
And I'll be braving the winters.
The best that I know,
'Cause nothing's the same
When you wait for something.
I was alone, till I thought it was
Better that way.
Static draining in my eyes,
Its all that I could see,
And time would never sympathize.
It's just enough to send me.
Now I'm hoping to stay,
Seconds away,
From all that I could be.
Every time that I run from you,
I run from me.
Well, I'll be braving the winters,
The best that I know.
'Cause nothing's the same
When you wait for something.
And I was alone, till I thought it was
Better that way.
Now I'm under the sun.
Won't anyone
See that I'm alive?
Every time that I fall asleep
I still survive.
Well, I'll be braving the winters,
The best that I know.
'Cause nothing's the same
When you wait for something.
I was alone, till I thought it was
Better that way.
Nothing follows me down again.
Nothing follows me down again.
Nothing follows me down again.

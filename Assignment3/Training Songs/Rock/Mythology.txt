Fragile featured little girl
Just stepped out into the world
White cotton summer dresses, hair tied in lace
Pearly button eyes in her girly little face

She married a man, what a louse like a bull
In her China dream house, with confetti in his pocket
And ice in his heart he tore that little girl's world apart

So don't go to her like the others before
With some worn out line from a film that you saw
No don't waste your time and your trouble you'll see
She don't believe in mythology

Now she's known voodoo in a kiss
And she's known witchcraft on nights like this
Like a fly in a spider's web or a rat in a trap
Whispers as lethal as a switchblade attack

No don't go to her like the others before
With some worn out line from a film that you saw
No don't waste your time or your trouble you'll see
She don't believe in mythology, in mythology

No don't waste your time and your trouble you'll see
She don't believe in mythology

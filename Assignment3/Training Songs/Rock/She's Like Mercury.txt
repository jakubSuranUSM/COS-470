You wouldn't put poison on your dinner table
She oughta come with a warning label
Stand back, you better stand back
She'll turn your head she's the eighth wonder
Take a breath boy you're going under like that
Just like that

She's like mercury, she'll burn you up so easily
Slip away if you try to hold on
She'll blind you if you stare too long
Go on believe what you wanna believe
She's like mercury

She's bad for business, quicksilver
You're gonna love it but it might kill ya
So long - you're gone
I was the king heart breaker
I wasn't strong enough to take her on
Couldn't take her on

She's like mercury, she'll burn you up so easily
Slip away if you try to hold on
She'll blind you if you stare too long
Go on believe what you wanna believe
She's like mercury

I'm gonna pour ya a little luck
It's on me, drink it up

She's like mercury, burn you up so easily
Slip away if you try to hold on
She'll blind you if you stare too long
Go on believe what you gotta believe
She's like mercury

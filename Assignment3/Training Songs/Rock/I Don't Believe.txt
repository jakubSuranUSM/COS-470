I'm such an asshole
god I'm such a stain 
I just keep fucking up again and again
you crawled inside my mind 
when you crawled into my bed 
said everything I've ever longed to hear 
so perfect, so alive, 
once inside you sucked me dry 
you used me up and left me here for dead 
I crave it desperately, a cancer eating me 
an addiction too intense to be denied worthless, 
I'm a whore, crawling back for more 
it's pathetic how I feed off this abuse 
you told me that you love me and 
I believed you loved me 
but you swore that you loved me and I believed... 
now I know it was a lie 
I don't believe 
I don't believe that I could be so stupid and so naive 
I don't believe 
I don't believe that there is nothing, nothing left for me

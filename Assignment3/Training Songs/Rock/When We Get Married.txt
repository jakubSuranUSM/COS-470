And there'll be flowers baby, for you and me 
Just wait and see, and everyone is gonna come 
And there be sunshine baby, in every room 
That afternoon when we get married 

[Chorus]
When we get married (When we get married) 
When we get married (When we get married) 
When we get married (When we get married) When we get married 
And there'll be church bells ringing everywhere 
And this I swear it's gonna be for you and me 
And in the chapel baby you wear my ring 
And everything when we get married 
I know there'll be some happy tears that day 
When we are standing side by side 
And when your daddy gives his little girl away 
Your mama gonna break right down and cry

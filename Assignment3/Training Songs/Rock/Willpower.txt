What a lot of talk about it
Ooh such a lotta talk about willpower
Ooh talkin' talkin' talkin' willpower
Desire
Talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin' about willpower 
Tell the world how well it's workin'
Never say how much it's hurtin'
Easy sayin' what to do
Easy if it isn't you 

Willpower
What a lot of talk about it
Running head first down that slide
Burnin' up so bad inside
So much bullshit on the front
Give'm more of what they want 

Will power
Lady willpower
Will power
Lady willpower

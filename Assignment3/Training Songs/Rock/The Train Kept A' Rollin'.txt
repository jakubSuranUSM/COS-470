I caught the train, I met a dame,
She was a hipster, well and a real cool dame,
(She was handsome,)
She was pretty, from New York City,
Well and we trucked on down in that old Fairlane,
(Goin' on,)
With a heave, and a ho,

Well, I just couldn't let her go.
(Yes I did,)
Get along, sweet little woman, get along,
Be on your way,
Get along, sweet little woman, get along,
Be on your way,
With a heave, and a ho,
(Love the way you walk,)
I just couldn't let her go.
(Yes I do now.)

Well, the train kept a-rollin', all night long,
(Sweet little woman, get along,)
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
([You're my queen?])
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
(Sweet little woman, get along,)
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
(You're my queen?)
With a heave, and a ho,
(Love the way you walk,)
Well I just couldn't let her go,
(Yes I do.)

We made a stop at Albuquerque,
She must have thought I was a real gone jerk,
We got out the train in El Paso,
Lookin' so good, Jack, I couldn't let her go.
Get along, sweet little woman, get along,
(Oh, right,)

Well, the train kept a-rollin', all night long,
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
The train kept a-rollin', all night long,
With a heave, and a ho,
Well I just couldn't let her go.

When I get to heaven, it's gonna look familiar
I'm gonna get the feeling that I've seen the view
I'm gonna recognize the scenery
I see it every time you're close to me
'Cause heaven is being with you

When I get to heaven, I'm gonna hear sweet music
And I know when I hear it, the tune won't be new
I'm gonna recognize the melody
I hear it every time you're close to me
'Cause heaven is being with you

I won't be a stranger in paradise
Those pearly gates are gonna look like home, sweet home

When I get to heaven, the angels that I see there
Will have a way of smiling the way that you do
I know exactly how it's gonna be
Just how it is when you are close to me
'Cause heaven is being with you
My heaven is being with you

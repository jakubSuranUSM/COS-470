I need someone a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love 
Could it be you, could it be you
Situation gets rough then I start to panic
It's not enough it's just a habit
Hey kid, your sick, well, darling this is it

You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad they do it all the time
Yeah, yeah, they do it all the time, yeah, yeah
They do it all the time (do it all the time)
They do it all the time (do it all the time)
They do it all the time, do it all the time

I hope you know that this will go down 
On your permanent record
Oh, yeah, well, don't get so distressed 
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed

I take one, one, one 'cause you left me 
And two, two, two for my family 
And three, three, three for my heartache 
And four, four, four for my headaches 
And five, five, five for my lonely 
And six, six, six for my sorrow 
And seven, seven for no tomorrow 
And eight eight I forget what eight was for 
And nine nine nine for a lost God 
And ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything, everything

You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad they do it all the time
Yeah, yeah, they do it all the time, yeah, yeah
They do it all the time (do it all the time)
They do it all the time (do it all the time)
They do it all the time (do it all the time, do it all the time)
Do it all the time

Who was in the mood way above
Layin' down my money for love
She's the kind of lady
Wouldn't take a maybe from me

She saw the need on my face
Sitting outside of my place
I did all the talking
She did all the walking from me

I didn't come down with yesterday's rain
You're fooling nobody
I didn't come down with yesterday's rain
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're fooling nobody

I'll set a score but no higher
Single return on no mire
If you keep on accusing
Then you're gonna be abusing yourself

You've got to make your mind up
Or God only knows where I'll wind up
You know I earned my ginger
So baby, lay your fingers on me

I didn't come down with yesterday's rain

She gave me love on her fire
Up to my balls inside her
She's a kind of lady
Who won't been sayin' maybe to me

You truck it, baby
You'll find another sucker, baby
She's a kind of lady
Who's gonna take a maybe from me

I didn't come down with yesterday's rain

I didn't come down with (down with)
Yesterday's rain (down with)
(Yesterday's rain)
I didn't foolin'
I didn't foolin'

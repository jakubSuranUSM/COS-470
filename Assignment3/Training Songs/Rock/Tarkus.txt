The wall
On which the prophets wrote
Is cracking 
At the seams

Upon the 
Instrument's object
The sunlight 
Brightly gleams

Where every man
Is torn apart
With nightmares
And with dreams

Will no one lay
The laurel wreath
When silence 
Drowns the screams

Confusion
Will be my epitaph
As I crawl
This cracked and broken path
If we make it
We can all
Sit back
And laugh

But I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow
I'll be crying

Between the iron gates of fate
The seeds of time were sown
And watered by 
The deeds of those
Who know 
And who are known

Knowledge is
A deadly friend
If no one 
Sets the rules

The fate of all
Mankind I see
Is in
The hands of fools

The wall
On which the prophets wrote
Is cracking
At the seams

Upon the 
Instrument's object
The sunlight 
Brightly gleams

Where every man
Is torn apart
With nightmares 
And with dreams

Will no one lay 
The laurel wreath
When silence
Drowns the screams

Confusion
Will be my epitaph
As I crawl
This cracked and broken path
If we make it
We can all
Sit back
And laugh

But I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow
I'll be crying

Crying
Crying

Yes I fear tomorrow 
I'll be crying
Yes I fear tomorrow
I'll be crying

Crying

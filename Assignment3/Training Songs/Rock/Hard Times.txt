Hard times come to me no more
Hard times
The winter is upon you now
The wind is drivin' in, you gotta

Oh, your breath will freeze
On the ground is stone
And this holes become my jail

Hard times come to me no more
Oh, hard times come to me no more

You gotta give me somethin' back
You gotta
You gotta give me somethin' back

You gotta give me somethin' back
C’mon
You gotta give me somethin' back

You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all

You hear the flowers breathin'
Beneath the ice and snow
The winter skins, the frozen tears
These things we’ve come to know

Hard times come to me no more
I keep searchin’ but I wishin’ your poor
Oh, hard times come to me no more

You gotta
You gotta give me somethin' back
You gotta give me somethin' back

C’mon
You gotta give me somethin' back, hey hey
You gotta give me somethin' back, right now

You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
Hey

You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta give me somethin' back, c’mon
You gotta rise above it all

You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all

You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta rise above it all
You gotta give me somethin' back

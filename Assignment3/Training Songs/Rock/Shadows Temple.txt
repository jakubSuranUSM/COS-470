Shadow's dream of truth and false.
You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.
Naze eranda watashi o kono sekai ni
This stage is just like illusions you made.
Naze koroshita tozasareta kono sekai de

Lonely night, I hold a ceremony of darkness.
Changing mind is an omen of tragedy.
You are all mine.

Kagee no tawamure mayonaka no tousaku
Shinku ni somatta anata o dakishime kono te de

Cut off the whole things.
Nagareru chi ni
Set your reason free.
Kuchizuke shite
Follow instincts.

Shadow’s dream of truth and false.
Butai no tsuzuki o misete
Aozameta shitai o Daishi-tsuzuke
Such a thought inspires me.

You were selected to be on this stage by a stroke of fate.
Naze matta watashi no sekai o
This stage is just like illusions you made.
Naze kie-yuku sourei na kono sekai de

Kyouki no tawamure mayonaka no kousaku
Tsukiyo ni terasare anata to kono mama tokeai

Yoru no hate made
Shadow’s dream of truth and false.
Butai no tsuzuki o misete
Aozameta shitai o aishi-tsuzukete eien ni

Shadow’s dream of truth and false.
Kikaijikake no kokoro
Aozameta shitai ni tsumi no akashi o kizami

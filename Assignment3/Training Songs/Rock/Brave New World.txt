What a brave new world we live in
What amazing changes we're seeing
When science and man go hand in hand
What a brave new world we live in

Sometimes i think of the advantages we have
Over the people in the past
There is no end to all the choices we can make
And the miracles we use everyday

What a brave new world we live in
What amazing changes we're seeing
When science and man go hand in hand
What a brave new world we live in

Sometimes we look at all the problems we face
And we can only complain
But look around at the advances we've made
After all we used to live in a cave

What a brave new world we live in
What amazing changes we're seeing
We live in the sky and people can fly
What amazing things we try

Technology is a double-edged sword
Especially when it's used for the weapons of war
But when you think about the progress we've made
To cure a disease or travel into space
Or simply pick up the phone and talk around the globe
What amazing powers we hold

What a brave new world
When science and man go hand in hand
What a brave new world we live in

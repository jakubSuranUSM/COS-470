Where are you going with the long face pulling down
Don't hide away like an ocean
But you can see, but you can smell 
And the sound of your waves coming down

I am no superman not at all
But I have no answers for you
I am no hero, and that's for sure
But I do know one thing

Where you go, is where I want to be
Where are you going, where do you go? 
Are you looking for answers
For reasons under the stars

If along the way, you are growing weary
You can rest with me until a brighter day
I am no superman, that's for sure
And I have no answers, yeah

I am no hero, oh don't you know
But I do know one thing
Where you are is where I belong
Where you go, I do know, is where I belong

Where are you going, with your beautiful face 
Looking down, don't hide away
You are like an ocean that I can't see
But I can smell and the sound 

Of your waves coming down
I am no superman, that's for sure
I have no answers for you, I am no hero, oh not at all
I do know one thing, where you are is where I belong
Where you are is where I want to be

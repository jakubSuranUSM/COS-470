I am what I am in the back of beyond
A man with a fork in a world of soup
Maybe all this time, I begged for a spoon
But now I know what I have to do

I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in
I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in

Not long ago, I was a blue eyed fool
Not long ago, I was in love with you
But you've been fuckin' around through the danger point
And now I know what I'm gonna have to do

I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in
I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in

I am what I am in the back of beyond
A man with a fork in a world of soup
All this time, you played me for a fool
And now I know what I have to do

I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in
I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in

I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in
I'm gonna kick you out, let the sunshine in
Kick you out, let the sunshine in

Bless my soul maybe I should leave it alone 
I'm sure it would be safer to stay at home 
You've made your point it's pointless 
And it's all gonna burn 
I'm in no state to skate but I'm gonna take my turn 
I know you may never really understand 
Why I go through these motions with my hands 
It's a gesture at best but my body's in the right place 
To fall in your arms now and wait to save face I'll do 
It anyway no matter what they feel 
Ain't got all the facts but I got a hunch 
And I know the deal I'll do it anyway 
Shine what you might have heard 
There's something at hand it just ain't all planned 
It's still a beautiful world 
American men you know them they just gotta be right 
When it's left to me often times I'd rather not fight 
They make a big deal out of everything and they got too many guns 
And just to make 'em mad I'm gonna do it for fun 
I'll do it anyway over the barren plains 
I'm still a girl 
It's just a horse and I got the reigns

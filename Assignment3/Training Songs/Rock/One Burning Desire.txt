I'm gonna try and steal a car
Drive it off with you somewhere afar
I'll start a fire deep inside
Find a place where we can hide
And as life flashes by
You want to know the reasons why
I'll be there with words to take you higher
One burning desire
I'm gonna try to be a light
Set the world on fire day and night
We start an education here
The signs look good no need to fear
The other people come and go
Why play the scenes they only know
I'll be here to help you walk the wire
One burning desire one burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire
I want to get inside your head
Find your ma and pa and what got said
And as we get familiar too
Find every scar and small tattoo
And as we start to play the game
I'll confess and take the blame
But you're the one who poured fuel on the fire
One burning desire one burning desire one burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire
One burning desire

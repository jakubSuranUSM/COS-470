You've been keeping me lonely
You've been keeping me down
And I'm sitting here wondering
Why I'm still hanging around

The night's grown cold, babe
Can't you see the signs?
Ah, there's no use wasting
This precious time

Look out your window
Ah, can't you see?
That the sun is getting fast
For you and me

Ah, you've grown hard, babe
Can't you see the signs?
Ah, there's no use wasting
This precious time

Well, I should be out seeking
Instead of hiding
Yeah, I should be out laughing
Instead of crying, crying, crying

'Coz you've been keeping me lonely
You've been keeping me down
And I'm sitting here thinking to myself
Why I'm sticking around

When you no longer hear me
And your eyes can't see
What this precious time
Means to someone like me

Oh, I wanna start living
Life's for the taking
And I've gotta start living
If I wanna be tasting, tasting, tasting
This precious time

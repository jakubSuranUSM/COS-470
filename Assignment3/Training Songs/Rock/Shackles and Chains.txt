On a long lonesome journey I'm going
Oh darling, and please don't you cry
Though in shackles and chains they will take me
In prison to stay till I die

And at night through the bars, I gaze at the stars
And I long for your kisses in vain
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains

Put your arms through these bars once, my darlin'
Let me kiss those sweet lips that I love best
In heartache, you're my consolation
In sorrow, my haven of rest

And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
The plans that we made were in vain
A piece of stone I will use as my pillow
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains

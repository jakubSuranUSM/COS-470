I was waiting on the moment
But the moment never came
All the billion other moments
Were just slipping all away

(I must have been drifting) weâ€™re just slipping all away
(Just ego-tripping)

I was wanting you to love me
But your love it never came
All the other love around me
Was just wasting all away

(I must have been tripping) was just wasting all away
(Just ego-tripping) was just wasting all away
(Must have been tripping)

I was waiting on the moment
But the moment never came
(Must have been dreaming) but the moment never came
(Just ego-tripping) but the moment never came
(Must have been tripping) but the moment never came
(Just ego-tripping) but the moment never came
(Must have been dreaming) but the moment never came

But the moment never came

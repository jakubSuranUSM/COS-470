Damned we blow up and we break out
Like horses when the race starts
Open your eyes and clean up your mirror
Just do what you wanna do
We will rush into this at the hour of the wolf
When all the children will be born
Do what you have to do. 

There’s a trap that I won’t see covered up in the middle of my territory
Cause’ traps are made not to be seen, too thin to allow warnings.

There’s an hour when the most beautiful boys demean their beauty.
Girls are tough, girls wear gloves, demean their blood.

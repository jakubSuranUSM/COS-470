The bluest of blue 
that's what her eyes are 
that's what I am today 
And if I had it all to do 
All over again 
I wouldn't of waited to say 

Chorus


I can't live without you 

I don't want nobody else 

Baby listen very closely 

I Love you 


Chrous2 


I couldn't lie 

She couldn't wait 

I love you came too late 

I'd give my life for yesterday 

I love you came too late 


I should of seen the signs 

Paid more attention 

But I pushed her love away 

So if she finds someone to give her 

What she needed 

Somebody else not afraid to say 


Chrous1 

Chrous2 


I can't live without you 

Don't want nobody else 

My heart is in my head 

I took a good look at myself 

If I had another chance 

I'd shout it out to you 

The words I Love you 


Chrous2(till it fades out)

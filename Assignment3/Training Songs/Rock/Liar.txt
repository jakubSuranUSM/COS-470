Out of the woods you're stuck
You go no stop, hands are staring at me
I'm at the wrong head tricks
Once again, who want this piece of property?

I've got this taste in my mouth
Just like a burning tire
I forgot what I knew, did you?
Don't be a liar
(Don't be a liar)

When the night feels bad
With the full moon juggle
Tell me once again, how if you
Never land you never get hooked

I've got this taste in my mouth
Just like a burning tire
I forgot what I knew, did you?
Don't be a liar
(Don't be a liar)

Well, I got a taste in my mouth
Just like a burning tire
I forgot what I knew, did you?
Don't be a liar
(Don't be a liar)

When I'm outta here
Wouldn't you have now
It wouldn't have changed a thing
I still wanna love, I just wanna win
As now my body has its kicks

I've got this taste in my mouth
Just like a burning tire
I forgot what I knew, did you?
Don't be a liar
(Don't be a liar)

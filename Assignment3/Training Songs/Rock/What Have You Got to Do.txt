Here it comes that lonely feeling again
Well, I think I'll call up my nouveau friends
Met her at 'The Edge' on a Monday night
And I think that she'd be fun but she's not my type

We talking about the accident
All messed up and that's exactly what she meant
Inherit the wind and start over again

What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight

I don't want to talk about what's fashionable
I don't want to know about what is in vogue
I want to know about the way that you feel
I want to have fun, I want to know what is real

I feel like a bird was frying on a wire
Walking on coals to cool my desire
Inherit the wind but you're gonna get tired

What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight, oh

Ooh and I feel like a bird that's frying on a wire
Walking on coals to cool my desire
Inherit the wind but you're gonna get tired

What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off tonight

What have you got to do to get off tonight
Hey, what have you got to do to get off tonight
What have you got to do to get off, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, yeah

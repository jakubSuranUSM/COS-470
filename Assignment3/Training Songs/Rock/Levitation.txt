In the darkness I will shine
Cast not shadows or define
Walk on water float on air
There is no other to compare

[Chorus:]
I have this fascination
No cause for a deviation
It's called levitation

There is no cause to start and scream
Nor rub your eyes this is no dream
Although I sit upon this chair
I rise and float up in the air

[Chorus]

Magnetic force repel attract
Once it starts there's no turning back
I offer you this chance to learn
Take it now there's no return

[Chorus]

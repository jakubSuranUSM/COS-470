I used to search for the ideal girl
 The perfect little prettyness
 I used to search for the ideal world
 But frankly think it don't exist
 So many times I get so afraid
 So many ways I felt so betrayed
 We get together on a Saturday night
 And watch the whole world cave in

 Little girl I want to know
 What you look for in a man
 Is he tall, tough and handsome
 With a continental teint

 I just want to be around
 When the big world hits the ground
 I don't want to make a sound
 When the sky comes tumblin'
 Sky comes tumblin' down

 I used to worry about the job that I had
 I barely made enough to survive
 Oh man I'm worried about the life that I live
 Sometimes I barely made it home alive
 But now I don't need to worry
 There's no need to rush there's no need to hurry
 You don't need a new job you don't need a new wife
 You don't need to go far in your life

 Little girl I want to know
 What you look for in a man
 Does he have a lot of money
 Even more than you can spend

 I just want to be around
 When the big world hits the ground
 I don't want to make a sound
 When the sky comes tumblin'
 Sky comes tumblin' down

 I used to play in a dead end band
 I always ended up on my own
 But now I play in a skeleton band
 Nothing but skin and bones

 Oh no I don't need sedation
 I got my daily dose of radiation
 We get together on a Saturday night
 And watch each other's hair fall out

 Little girl I want to know
 What you look for in a man
 Does he sell a lot of records
 With his Californian band

 I just want to be around
 When the big world hits the ground
 I don't want to make a sound
 When the sky comes tumblin'
 Sky comes tumblin' down

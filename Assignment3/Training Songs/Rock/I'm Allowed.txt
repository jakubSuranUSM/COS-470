Waited for an answer
But I waited for twenty five years
They stopped my bleedin'
But could never stop all those tears

I waited for the day when
He came out from beneath all that weight
I tried to lift it
But it seems I got there too late

Just too late, just too late
'Cause I'm allowed

Came to the party
But I got my own signals crossed
Thought I was welcome
But I felt like I should get lost

I know that I'm older
'Cause I feel that everywhere
I could talk to no one
'Cause I knew not one person there

No one's there, they just stared
But they're allowed

Vivid as a car wreck
Watch them drippin' off highway ramps
Came to me smilin'
Her heart underneath both her hands

She spoke of a French boy
At least two times through the night
It could have been the liquor
Or the music, that is all right

That's all right, she's allowed
I'm allowed, I'm allowed, I'm allowed

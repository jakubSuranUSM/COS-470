Starting to get my head in your space
Starting to lose track of the weekdays
Starting to cook my brain in five ways
Trying to be cool

Starting to lose my inhibitions
Starting to make some bad decisions
I'm listening to all your crap opinions
Trying to be cool

Don't take me over
Just take me there.
Like I planned.

It's gone as far as I could go.
And now the feeling's starting to take hold.
But I'll death defy to make you cry
Find out what you know
Could you please death defy with me too?

Starting to tune into your station
Starting to lose my obligation
I'm talking in tongues
A celebration of trying to be cool.

Starting to get my head in your space
Starting to lose track of the weekdays
Starting to cook my brain in five ways
Trying to be cool

Don't take me over.
Just take me there.
Like I planned.

It's gone as far as I could go
And now the feelings starting to take hold
But I'll death defy to make you cry
Find out what you know
Would you please death defy with me too
Would you please death defy with me too

Don't take me over.
Just take me there.
Like I planned.

Its gone as far as I could go.
And now the feelings starting to take hold
But I'll death defy to make you cry
Find out what you know
Would you please death defy with me too
Would you please death defy with me too.
Would you please, would you please, would you please.

When you were a young girl
Did you have a rag doll
The only doll you ever owned
Well you can treat me 
The way you used to treat that rag doll
But hurry up cause I'm gettin old
And I get older baby, day by day
And it gets stronger baby, let me say
And it goes deeper baby,
Than you'll ever know
Stand back baby, and watch my love grow
And do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Bet your life, baby
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well you can treat me 
The way you used to treat that puppy, baby
I swear I'll never put you down, no I won't
And I get thankful baby, in every way
And it gets less painful baby, let me say
And I'm gona love you every night and day
Look out baby, my love way is comin' your way
Yes it is
And do I love you my oh my
River deep, mountain high
And if I lost you would I cry
Bet your life, baby
I love you baby like a flower needs the spring
I love you baby like Aretha Franklin needs to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his pie
I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Well take it higher...higher...

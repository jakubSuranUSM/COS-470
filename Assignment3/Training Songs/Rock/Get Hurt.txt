Sometimes I wake up in the morning
Sometimes I dream small
I keep my wounds without a bandage baby
As I come stumbling through the door
Spend my nights in this location
Talking to spirits on the floor
I think I came to find the feeling baby
Between what was mine and what was yours

And I came to get hurt,
Might as well do your worst to me, hey hey
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me, from me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

I think I'd better move to California (I think it's time to move)
Mama, can you say a pray for me? (Say a prayer for me)
I heard they don't get so low down, (All my friends get so low)
I heard they never bleed,
Not like we bleed

I came to get hurt,
Might as well do your worst to me, hey hey
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me, from me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And it gets pretty lame
And the stations would change
And the things once in order
Now seem so strange,
Once I quit town all the hurt apart from myself
Now all I can see is the need,
The need.

I came to get hurt,
Might as well do your worst to me, hey hey
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me
From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

Maybe you needed a change,
Maybe I was in your way
Maybe some days they stay
And some things go away
Maybe I was mine, maybe you were not the same!

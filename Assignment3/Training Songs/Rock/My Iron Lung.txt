Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen from my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are loosing it, can't you tell?

We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Iron lung

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out we'll just hum

This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung

If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay 

If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay

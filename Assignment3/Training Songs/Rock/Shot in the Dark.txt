Well, the joint starts jumpin' and your heart starts pumpin'
And you see a little girl and you know she's gonna tear you apart
And the room starts swayin' and you find yourself sayin'
"Will you take a little spin with me, baby, out on the floor?"

Well, it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the dark, yeah, just another way
Well, it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the heart, yeah, just another way

Well, your head starts spinnin' and your lines start winnin'
And you know she's gonna break your heart by that look in your eyes
Many rules start breakin' and your hands start shakin'
And there's a teardrop memory telling you to tell no lies

Well it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the dark, yeah, just another way
Well, it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the heart, yeah, just another way

Well it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the dark, yeah, just another way
Well, it's just another night, it's just another day
Just another shot in the heart, yeah, just another way

Well, the band starts playin' and your hands start strayin'
And there's fear that's stoppin' you, your world is droppin' away
Well, the world starts wakin' and the dawn starts breakin'
And you know that you're takin' her home and you want her to stay

Well, it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the dark, yeah, just another way
Well, it's just another night, well, it's just another day
Just another shot in the heart, yeah, just another way

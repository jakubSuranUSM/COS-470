Let me tell you bout two young lovers that lived on the coast
She was such a pretty thing, and man what a host
Come evenin time she sets the table for rour
Some friends are commin round tonight
He's out on the town, He's tryin to score
Woke up early this morning something's on his mind
Cursin the night before, breakfast at nine
She felt him restless oh all through the night
She senses somethings wrong with him
She doesn't want to pry, she just wants to know why

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh---Oh No, Not You Again

Don't own no smimming pool, not even a colour TV
He work awful hard some days and she lets him be
Things ain't looking to good for them no love no more
Some friends are commin round tonight
He's out on the town, He's tryin to score

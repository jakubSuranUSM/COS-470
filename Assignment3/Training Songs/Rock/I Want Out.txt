All we are is leaves in the wind
And all of our moments pass us by before they begin

And I know I can't deny
The burning in your eyes
I need a little more now
Wage against the dying light
It's burning me tonight 'cause I need it

'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)
I will light up the sky as we burn it down (oh oh oh oh)
I know you can't doubt it, but let me say
'Cause I know it's better this way
'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)

All we are is breath against the glass
Just like the ashes of a fire fading fast

Yeah, I know I can't deny
The burning in your eyes
I need a little more now
Will you dance the time left
Is burning me tonight 'cause I need it

'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)
I will light up the sky as we burn it down (oh oh oh oh)
I know you can't doubt it, but let me say
'Cause I know it's better this way
'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)

If this is love, baby, I want out
I will light up the sky as we burn it down

'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)
I will light up the sky as we burn it down (oh oh oh oh)
I know you can't doubt it, but let me say
'Cause I know it's better this way
'Cause if this is love, baby, I want out (oh oh oh oh)
I want out (oh oh oh oh)
I want out (oh oh oh oh)

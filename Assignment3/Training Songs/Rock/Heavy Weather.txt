Where you been lately
You used to light up the streets with your style
I've been here waiting
For less than a year
For more than a while
How well I remember
Its always A theme park tall tales and true
A time built of ribbons
A little girl dreams
Tattered and strewn

There's been some heavy heavy weather lately baby,
Will you tell me the news?

Cool smooth motion
The lighthouse is on
The keeper's not in
We'd light up the ocean
And never escape
The things that we've seen
I've got one photo
That's keeping me fond
Of who you might be
It's sure some notion
Like someone I'd know
Much better than me

Heaven knows I've done no wrong 
I only want to sing this song to you 
Why did it have to end this way 
Only a fool like me could say to you that 

If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'd call you there 
If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'll be there tonight 
  
Where would I be without you now 
Yet I have to make it through this life 
Somehow 
Only time will tell me so 
Of the things I need to know 
Somehow 

If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'd call you there 
If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'll be there 

How do I find the answers 
To all the questions I've been hiding inside 
And all the fun and laughter 
We've shared I'll have to set aside 

If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'd call you there 
If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'll be there 
If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'd call you there 
If I ever had a line to heaven I swear 
I'll be there tonight

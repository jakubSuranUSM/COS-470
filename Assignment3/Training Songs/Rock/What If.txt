The bandwagon starts rolling before you even reach your teens, 
Role models for a restless world and the fuel to fill your dreams

Where will you go, when you take your first step on your own? 
Where will you walk? What if they led the way and no-one followed?

They lead you out onto the catwalk like a dog upon a leash, 
They fix your feet upon the party line but there are places it won't reach

[Chorus]
What if you woke up one morning and weren't under the influence? 
What if you won back your independence?

Some routes will take you down the backroads some will take you down the main strip, 
Or you could head off through the undergrowth where the civilized image slips.

[Chorus]

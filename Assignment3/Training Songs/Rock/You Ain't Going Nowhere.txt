Cloud so swift the rain fallin' in
Gonna see a movie called Gunga Din
Pack up your money, pull up your tent in the wind
You ain't a goin' no where

Hoo wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my brides a'gonna come
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

Genghis Khan and his brother Don
Couldn't keep on keepin' on
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
After we're way past it

Hoo wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair, yeah

Buy me some rings and a gun that sings
A flute that toots and a bee that stings
A sky that cries and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks

Hoo wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

Hoo wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's a'gonna come
Hoo wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

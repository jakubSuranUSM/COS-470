Travellin' a distant land
I really enjoyed the days
It's always been my way to keep movin' on
Then the nights and the city lights
Showed me I was missing home
The reason I was feeling low
I was missing love

For your love,
Can I ever get enough of your love
For your love,
Can I ever get enough of you love

Travellin' here all alone
Looking back over my time
Thinking about you tonight, and how you changed my life
Now I realize at this point of my life
After tryin' the best that I can
That I am only a man
And I need your love 

For your love,
Can I ever get enough of your love
For your love,
Can I ever get enough of you love

Travellin' around the world 
I can almost hear you say
I want, I need, your love
It won't be long before I'm home
The times not far away
I want I need your love

For your love,
Can I ever get enough of your love
For your love,
Can I ever get enough of you love

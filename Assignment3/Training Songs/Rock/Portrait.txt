The time has come to face each other
Sister, brother, mother, father
It's time to stem the flow of blood
Lying frosted on these city walls
Burnt out cars in the parking lots
Are the tribal symbols of our streets
A young recruit still the age of innocence
Swears allegiance to his beliefs
So give us love and understanding
Give us hope that's never ending
And to the faithful, now departed
May you rest in peace, may you never be forgotten
To the children of tomorrow
May the final act and triumph of our will
Be your walk to freedom
A missing face in the family portrait
A hoard of memories on the mantle piece
Outside a patriotic speech
Falls upon the lips of angry men
So give us love and understanding
Give us hope that's never ending

[Chorus:]

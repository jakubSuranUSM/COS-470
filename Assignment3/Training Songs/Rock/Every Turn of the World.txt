We think about the loves we lost
Will it come again?
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win?

We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way?
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away

Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you
To the dream that's waitin' to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world

Is it gold or glory
A taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body?
There are all these things with every turn of the world

Human kindness - diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin, after all

When you find yourself alone
Missing tender magic touching you
Keep an open heart
Everything you dream can still be true

We all want a world we can live in
We all want a world full of love
It's never too late
It's never too soon
Whatever you can do is enough

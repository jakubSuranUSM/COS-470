Only wanted
Only to care
Only us
Only

In the dark days they jump a soul

Inside my magic mountain we don’t have to be with them
Inside my magic mountain our hearts are on
Inside my magic mountain i don’t have to be with them
Inside my magic mountain our hearts are on

Only to live for
Only get to
Only us
Only

And if they catch us both, a trunk got the hares

Inside my magic mountain we don’t have to be with them
Inside my magic mountain our hearts are on
Inside my magic mountain i don’t have to be with them
Inside my magic mountain our hearts are on

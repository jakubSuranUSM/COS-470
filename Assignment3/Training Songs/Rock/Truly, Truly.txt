I was hanging with some friends
In the parking lot one night near the summer's end
I leaned back against the glass
Of a car to watch all those speeding comets crash
Made me think about us
Made me think about us

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do
Truly truly truly I want you

You were lyin' by the pool
And the surface of the water was a lapis jewel
I dove in to make a splash
Woke ya from your dream nodding off out on the grass
Made me think about us

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do
Truly truly truly I want you

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do
Truly truly truly I want you

It's just been too long that
We set aside some time alone
I sure could use your point of view
And it's been a while
That we drop our guard, crack a smile
But don't you think it's overdue
Well how about you

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do
Truly truly truly I want you

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do
Truly truly truly I want you

Oh
Oh truly
Oh truly
Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do oh yes it's truly
Truly truly truly I want you

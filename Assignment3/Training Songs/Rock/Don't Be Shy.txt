Zeus?Aha
C'mon... Ah Ah

See you in the club, watching me, feeling me, wanting me. 
How about a little ... with me, I'll be your fantasy. 
Put your drink down come to me, do you really wanna get with me? 
You know you really wanna come to me; I can't take it no more. 

[Chorus]
I just wanna? 
Feel your body [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Touch my body [kangna tera ni]
Don't be shy my honey [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body 
I just wanna feel your body [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Touch my body [kangna tera ni]
Don't be shy my honey [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body 

Feel your eyes undressing me, temptations calling me. 
I can tell this is destiny, 'cause it feels like it's meant to be. [kangna]
One chance I'll make you see, no other girls as good as me. 
Say yes take my hand, so we can fly away. 

[Chrous]
I just wanna? 
Feel your body [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Touch my body [kangna tera ni]
Don't be shy my honey [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body 
I just wanna feel your body [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Touch my body [kangna tera ni]
Don't be shy my honey [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body

I just wanna, dance with you boy, don't you put me down [boy] 
Hold my waist and dance with me until the end of time. 

[Chorus ? x 4]
I just wanna feel your body [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Touch my body [kangna tera ni]
Don't be shy my honey [sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body

Feel my body [tera ni, sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body [kangna tera ni, sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body [tera ni, sanoo karey ye ishare]
Feel my body [kangna tera ni, sanoo karey ye ishare]

Don't be shy my honey.

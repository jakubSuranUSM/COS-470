I only ever want to see you
When someone tells me that I need to
Supposed to be your resurrection
You should have left it on reflection

Well there's something I'd like to say
Ooh hooo ho 
To you

You'll never be the same again
Standing in the rain again
You're feeling lots of pain again
December 28 again
Your famous boxing day again
You'll never be the same again

So you just tell the same old story (you just tell the same old story)
And strike another England's Glory

Well there's something I'd like to say
Ooh hooo ho
Yo you

You'll never be the same again
Standing in the rain again
You're feeling lots of pain again
You're pushed out of the frame again
December 28 again
You'll never be the same again

I saw you standing in the rain again
I saw you feeling all your pain again
I bet you want to go where people go
You're gonna leave a stain again
I saw you standing in the rain again
I saw you feeling all that pain again
Never be the same again
Never be the same again

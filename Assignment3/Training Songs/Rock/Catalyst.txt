I woke with a start today, determinations are set
Filled with expectation
I've sold to collide

But I am so fearful of the future
Ignorant of the present
I'm wary of the past

Through the door
I shuffle him quietly down the hall 
Identical corridors and artificial lights

The man in the box, born to set my world to right
Effortless to ignite, screaming in my head

With hope the catalyst will blow my joy away
But you thought that I'd have so much more to say

Can't save me now
Can't save me now

But I am so fearful of the future
Ignorant of the present, I'm wary of the past
When I awoke to a blue sky with a haze of red
True I __
Pissin', suck up to the man

No wonder I'm tired when I awoke with a start today

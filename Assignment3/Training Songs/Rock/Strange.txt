[Chorus]
You say it isn't your style to just ride the flow 
But if you'd like a little something and you've tried alone 
Here's a first-class ticket 
I know you're into strange 

Remember when we were so lost inside each other 
But we were not alone 
There were also many others 
I'm one who likes to believe that people never change 
Thinks back to the monument there in France 
Or the club in Italy where you did your dirty dancing 
I like to think that people never change 
Feeling like you made me feel 
Do it like you do, babe 
Playin' dangerous games 
Well, they tell me not to do it 
But the feeling is right 

[Chorus]

I think I still have the photograph 
The scars and the other half 
Of somebody's place we busted up 
Now here's to hopin' that you'll never change 
And everything that you said to me 
At times I was a little bit scared, you see 
So I wonder why it turns me on?
Do it like you do it
Baby, just don't ever change
Feeling like you made me feel 
Do it like you do, babe 
Playin' dangerous games 
Well they tell me not to do it 
But the feeling is right 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I know if we stop today 
We will forever be wishing for one more day of strange 

[Chorus]

A house up on the hillside, a hell hound in the yard
And there he's standing guard and watching
People look though the window, a casket inside
Today's the day he day, by roadside

Wind blows hard, the wind blows cold
Sun goes down, Sun goes down
I'll meet you on that lonesome dark road
Sun goes down, Sun goes down

I'll meet you in the evening, on the other side of town
The sun is going down, I'll see you
Standing in the graveyard, lit up by the moon
Beside your empty tomb, I'll see you

Day works hard and dusty, dirty yellow sky
The day that he died
I head you talkin to me, from another room
I heard you call my name, I knew that he came 
To me

Wind blows hard, the wind blows cold
Sun goes down, Sun goes down
I'll meet you on that lonesome dark road
Sun goes down, Sun goes down

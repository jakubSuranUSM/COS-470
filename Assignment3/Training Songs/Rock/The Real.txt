I found perfection, I found the perfect thing
Saw this walking nightmare, turned into a floating dream
Who drank your holy water in, who felt the cold againts your skin?
I am your true believer, I am the one who knows the way into your great divide
Into your mind and silent vibe
On and on and on we go
Where we hit the ground well no one knows
The game, the rules have changed and everyone is on their own
I've seen the real and it is good
It's made of mountains, gold, and burning wood
The time is right for you to open up and come inside the door
I felt you up and down, felt you up and down the wall
I saw your spirit growing, I saw you getting up and going down
I drank your holy water in, felt the cold agains your skin
I am your true believer, I am the one who knows the way into your great divide
Into your mind and silent vibe
I shout in harmony
You do the dance of the free
This is so fucking good, it's hard to see and hurts to be
On and on and on we go
Where we hit the ground well no one knows
The game, the rules have changed and everyone is on their own
I've seen the real and it is good
It's made of mountains, gold, and burning wood
The time is right for you to open up and come inside the door

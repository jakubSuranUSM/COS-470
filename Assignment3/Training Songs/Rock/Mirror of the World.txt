Sitting glued to the tube, you pick up everything
Fantasies, realities, you don't miss a thing
Even when the folks watch the news
You're right there
Take a step in violent shoes
No one seems to care

Mirror of the world right before your eyes
You can see it's got the child hypnotized
You are what you see watching the TV

Cluster bombs and high-powered rifles
How d'you like a knife in your side?
Details of a cheating husband
Hiding from his cheating wife
Seeing people getting drunk and stoned
You know it's okay
It's nothing that you don't see at home
Each and every day

Mirror of the world right before your eyes
You can see it's got the child hypnotized
You are what you see watching the TV

Mirror of the world right before your eyes
You can see it's got the child hypnotized
You are what you see watching the TV

Mirror of the world
Mirror, it's the
Mirror of the world

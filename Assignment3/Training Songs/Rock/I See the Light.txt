I can have your lovin'
Both day and night
My eyes have opened, Lord
And I see the light

And it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

You tried to fool me
But I got wise
Now I won't listen to
To none of your lies

And it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

From now on, baby
I'm gonna beware
I'll be sorry, baby
But I don't care

And it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

I see the light...

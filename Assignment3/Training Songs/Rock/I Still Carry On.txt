I'm lying in the sun 
longing for a place in the shadow 
I'm lying in the snow 
longing for a place by the fire 

And when I beg you for water 
you just drink the water yourself 
And when I reach my hand to you 
You just turn your face away 

But even though the cold from you still beating 
heart 
already kill me twice 
And even though the cold in your eyes 
makes me freeze all the time 

Chorus 
I still carry on and 
I still walk around 
I still feel the warming glow 
Shining somewhere in the future 
shining not so far away 

I'm climbing up the mountain 
mountain of society 
But every time I reach the top 
you just push me down again 

And when I look around me 
I can see I'm not alone 
There are a lot of people around 
climbing mountains next to me 

But even though the cold from you still beating 
heart 
already kill me twice 
And even though the cold in your eyes 
makes me freeze all the time 

Chorus 
I still carry on and 
I still walk around 
I still feel the warming glow 
Shining somewhere in the future 
Shining not so far away

There is nothing that is stronger than the feeling that you get
When your eyes are wide open
There is nothing like the feeling, you can never forget
When your eyes are wide open
Daytime was a feeling but it's not over yet
Are my eyes still open?
We come a long long distance and we're never goin' back
Got my eyes wide open

I got both doors open
I got both doors open
I got the back door open
I got the screen door open.

In another time
In another place
There's a train running through
Right through the middle of the house

Have i been dreaming, or have i been sick?
Are my eyes wide open?
Do i do it like that, or do i do it like this?
Are my eyes wide open?
Wearing' out the carpet doin' tricks with her hands
She's got her eyes wide open?
Think about this, "well i already have."
I got both doors open
I got both doors open
I got the back door open
I got the screen door open.
Oh i don't understand
Oh it's not just a sound
Oh i don't understand
It doesn't matter at all

See the little girl with the eyes rolled back in her head
She got a complication but she knows it'll work out fine
Naked as a baby, talking 'bout the feeling she gets
In another time, in another place

I got both doors open
I got both doors open
I got the back door open
I got the screen door open.
Oh i don't understand
Oh it's not just a sound
Oh i don't understand
It doesn't matter at all

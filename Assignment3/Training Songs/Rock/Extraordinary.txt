You think that I go home at night
Take off my clothes, turn out the lights
But I burn letters that I write to you
To make you love me

Yeah, I drive naked through the park
And run the stop sign in the dark
Stand in the street, yell out my heart
To make, to make you love me

I am extraordinary
If you'd ever get to know me
I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary
Average, everyday, sane, psycho, super-goddess
Average, everyday, sane, psycho

You may not believe in me but I believe in you
So I still take the trash out
Does that make me too normal for you?

So dig a little deeper 'cause
You still don't get it yet
See me lickin' my lips, need a primitive fix
And I'll make, I'll make you love me

I am extraordinary
If you'd ever get to know me
I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary
Average, everyday, sane, psycho, super-goddess
Average, everyday, sane, psycho (super-goddess)

See me jump through hoops for you
You stand there watching me performing
What exactly do you do?
Have you ever thought it's you that's boring?
Who the hell are you?

I am extraordinary (extraordinary)
If you'd ever get to know me (get to know me)
I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary (extraordinary)
Average, everyday, sane, psycho, super-goddess
Average, everyday, sane, psycho

Average, everyday, sane, psycho, super-goddess
Average, everyday, sane, psycho
Average, everyday, sane, psycho, super-goddess
Average, everyday, sane, psycho
Average, everyday, sane, psycho

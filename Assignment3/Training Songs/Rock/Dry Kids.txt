We're dry kid 
There's nothing you've got I want 
But you go and leave 
So you keep it locked in 
We murder each other each day 
Knowing we'd never be 
Crowbarred apart 
And we tried for so long 
To reach eleven on a scale of one to ten 
But we never get so far 
Undone,
you're out of my system learning how learning how to live with 
how it feels 
And we tried for so long 
To reach eleven on a scale of one to ten but we never get so far 
Me and you should have never left the start 
Me and you should have never got this far.

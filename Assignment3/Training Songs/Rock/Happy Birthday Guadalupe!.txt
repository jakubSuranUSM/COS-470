(Ouch!)

Well I woke up Christmas morning and what did I see?
I saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
Named Guadalupe, with big brown eyes
Boy what did you do this time?

Made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
She was beggin' and a-pleadin', screamin', "Por favor,
Mi cumpleaños, stay with me,
Baby it's cold outside"

We are livin' in a difficult time
We've been walkin' down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby, it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

(Our time will come)
(We both hold on)

She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
Prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
And blew the candles from her favourite cake
And we kissed beneath the mistletoe

I pulled her body close to mine and I had just one chance
I whispered, "Baby will you marry me for just one dance?"
Infatuation, the things you say
I got scared and I left that night

'Cause we are livin' in a difficult time
We've been walking down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby, it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

Deck the halls with rosaries
Wish upon a Christmas tree
Silent night please come to me
Bearing gifts from my... my Mexican angel

At night I wake up cold and lonely, burstin' at the seams
She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams
My Guadalupe, with big brown eyes
I wanna break the spell tonight

'Cause we are livin' in a difficult time
We've been walkin' down a difficult line
Put your feet up baby, it's Christmas time
Cumpleaños feliz
Happy Birthday Guadalupe

Happy Birthday Guadalupe

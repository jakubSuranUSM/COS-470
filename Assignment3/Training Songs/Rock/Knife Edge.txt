Memories come flooding back
The bitter pain of disappointment
Of once of having love but now I only feel loss

I'M LIVING ON A KNIFEDGE
AT THE END OF THE LINE
I'M TAKING ALL THE HARD SELL
I'M LOOKING FOR A LIFE LINE

Hey now now
Oh oh oh

When you ain't got no-one in this world
It makes you feel useless
It gives you nothing to live for nothing to die oh no no
For I'm burning up burning up burning up
I'm such a long way from home
I've got it all to give and no-one
To give it to

That's why I'm looking for you
For someone to whom I can prove
That I'm not through no no no no
I'm alive and I need love too

I'M LIVING ON A KNIFEDGE
AT THE END OF THE LINE
I'M TAKING ALL THE HARD SELL
I'M LOOKING FOR A LIFE LINE
ON A KNIFEDGE
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU NOW.
I*M LOOKING FOR YOU

Now now now

And the doors of love seem closed
No matter how hard I try to kick 'em down
It seems to all add up in my mind
Just going round and around and around
I'm fired up fired up fired up
'Cause there's nothing I can do to change it
I've just gotta sit back and wait for my chance to come

That's why I'm looking for you
For someone to whom I can prove
That I'm not through no no no no
I'm alive and that's the truth

I'M LIVING ON A KNIFEDGE
AT THE END OF THE LINE
I'M TAKING ALL THE HARD SELL
I'M LOOKING FOR A LIFE LINE
ON A KNIFEDGE
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU NOW

Memories come flooding back
The bitter pain of disappointment
Of once of having love but now
I only feel loss
There's a pointlessness about it all
I've gotta force that to the back of my mind
Ah the important thing now
Is just I've gotta survive

I'M LIVING ON A KNIGEDGE
I*M ON THE EDGE OF THE LINE
I'M TAKING ALL THE HARD SELL
I'M LOOKING FOR A LIFE LINE I'M LIVING ON A KNIFE EDGE
I'M LIVING AT THE END OF A LINE
I'M TAKING TAKING ALL THE HARD SELL
JUST LOOKING FOR THE LIFE LINE
I'M LIVING ON A KNIFE EDGE
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU NOW

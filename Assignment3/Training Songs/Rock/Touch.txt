You got the touch!
You got the power!
Yeah!

After all is said and done, you've never walked, you've never run
You're a winner!
Got the moves, you know the street. Break the rules, take the heat! 
You're nobody's fool!
You're at your best, when the going gets rough! 
You've been put to the test, but it's never enough!

You got the touch, you got the power!
When all hell's breakin' loose, you'll be right in the eye of the storm!
You got the heart, you got the motion!
You know that when things get too tough, you got the Touch!

You never bend, you never break! You seem to know just what it takes
You're a fighter!
It's in the blood, it's in the will! It's in the mighty hands of steel
When you're standin' you're ground!
And you never get hit, when your back's to the wall! 
Gonna fight to the end, and you're takin' it all!

You got the touch, you got the power!
When all hell's breakin' loose, you'll be right in the eye of the storm!
You got the heart, you got the motion!
You know that when things get too tough, you got the Touch!

You fighting fire with fire!
You know you got the touch!

You're at your best, when the going gets rough! 
You've been put to the test, but it's never enough!
You got the touch!
You got the power!
Yeah!

You got the touch!
You got the power!

Touch!

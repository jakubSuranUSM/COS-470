We almost got it together
And I'll be your favorite thing
Stand by the river with hard-luck eyes
And I'll just be open and sing

I was only trying to surprise
I wish I was like the frog-princess
And I'd never tell you lies
And down by the soil of the hard-life

They like to greet us with smiles
They like to tell us their good hostess
Had traveled a million miles
But you'd like it written closer

Yes, you'd like it written pure
If I told you this -
Would you miss my kiss?
No - you'd come right back for more

Oh, I'd like to be
What I want to be
But you want to carry on
But you need to take
What you have to take
But I'll still be here when you're gone

And there's a light by your window
And I'd like to capture you by there
And I'd like to hold you for all to see
But they don't really care

And if I said you're no peccadillo
Yes, I said you're a major thing
Would you stand by me?
At the corner dock
And say, "yes, this girl is the swing!"

Oh, I'd like to be
What I want to be
But you want to carry on
But you need to take
What you have to take
But I'll still be here when you're gone

And I'd like another cue
That's why I strain to see
And I'd like the best in you
'Cause you write the best in me

They were sure that I'd be burning
Yes -
So their tart swerve to here might be
But if I said "you're gold, inside",

Yes and if you were true to me
Would you hang around with that creepy smile
And crawl home back to me

Oh, I'd like to be
What I want to be
But you want to carry on
But you need to take
What you have to take
But I'll still be here when you're gone

So you'd sing a lullaby to get me to sleep
So it's no surprise my eyes are never heavy
For I've not seen you in the flesh for so long
That I'm not sure we would know each other at all 

Oh the weight it must be light wherever you are
And I know you don't think twice wherever you are
Oh the weight it must be light wherever you are
And I know you don't think twice wherever you are 

So I will hum alone, too far from you
All that I say now is nothing to you
We will lie under different stars 
I am where I am, and you're where you are
You're where you are 

Oh the weight it must be light wherever you are
And I know you don't think twice wherever you are
And I'd ask if you're alright wherever you are
And do you think of me, you might, wherever you are

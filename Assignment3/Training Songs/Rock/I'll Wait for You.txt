I'll wait for you through rain or shine 
I'll wait for you 'cause I know you're mine 
& though you're far away, you know I'll always say 
I'll wait for you 'cause I know you're mine 

I'll wait for you every day 
I'll wait for you when you're away 
'Cause when you're near me with your hand in mine 
I know I'll wait till the end of time 

Bridge: 
I know you're never far away from me 
No matter where you go 
I'll do my waitin' till you're back to me 
Because I love you so

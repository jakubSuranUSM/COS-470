I'll take the blame
If I ever want to
For what my little brain
Has been through
I know I say
Things I never meant to
To seem a little more sane
Cause that's what it takes

If I ever could win
If I ever could see
If I just could ever
Remember to think
About anything

Darling, give me a rope
I'll hang my self
It doesn't take a genius
To figure it out
Don't have to be fucking brilliant to see
I'm not as smart as I seem to be

I'm not as bright as I used to be
I'm not as sharp as I think I am
I'm not as smart as I seem
I'm not as bright as I seem

Darling, darling, darling
Darling, give me a rope
I'll hang my self
It doesn't take a genius
To figure it out
Don't have to be fucking brilliant to see

I'm not as smart as I seem to be
I'm not as bright as I used to be
I'm not as sharp as I think I am
I'm not as smart as I seem
I'm not as bright as I seem

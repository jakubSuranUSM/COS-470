Dawn of light lying between
A silence and sold sources
Chased amid fusions of wonder
In moments hardly seen forgotten

Colored in pastures of chance
Dancing leaves cast spells of challenge
Amused but real in thought
We fled from the sea whole

Dawn of thought transferred through moments
Of days under searching earth
Revealing corridors of time provoking memories
Disjointed but with purpose

Craving penetrations offer links
With the self instructors sharp
And tender love as we took to the air
A picture of distance

Dawn of our power we amuse
Re descending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as
To reveal passion chasing

Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean
Dawn of love sent within us
Colors of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age

As the links span our endless caresses
For the freedom of life everlasting
Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place

Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array, I ventured to see
As the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this moment, moment

The future poised with the splendor just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well?
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this, moment, moment
Moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons, fife flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion, clearly to be home
They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to

There's someone, to tell you and I just can't
Believe our song will leave you
Skyline teacher, warland seeker
Send out poison, cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past

Young Christians see it from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past

They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone, to tell you
A course towards a universal season

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this moment, moment

Past present movers, moments we'll process the future
But only through him we know, send flowered rainbows
A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights

Of songs to follow and show all we feel for
And know of cast round, you seekers of the truth
Accepting that reason will relive and breath and hope
And chase and love for you and you and you

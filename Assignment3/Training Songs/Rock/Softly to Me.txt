I could love you more and more each day for a million years
And I'd sit around all day just crying happy tears

[Chorus]
To dance and sing my life away (life away)
And laughing with you, my darling, softly to me

Orange, sugar, chocolate, hot cinnamon and lovely things and you
And darling, you know there was really nothing else that I could do

And my darling you will never know how elegant
You'll always be to me
And my darling I was so in love it was evident for anyone

To see, and I suppose they already do
And how come so suddenly everything depends on you

And if I kissed you once I'd probably do it again
But then that's not so inconceivable, my friend

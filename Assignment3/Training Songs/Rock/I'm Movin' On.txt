That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't commin' back
Because I'm movin' on
I'll soon be gone
You where flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland we're commin' to you
When we're movin' on
O' here my song
You had to laugh at me so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

Mr. fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty momma in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on
Keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a rollin'
Keep movin' me on

Mr. engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattle is the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' me on
Keep rollin' on
Your gonna ease my mind put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

I've told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You switched your engine
Now I ain't got time for a trifling woman on my main line
Because I'm movin' on
You done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice now you can settle the price
Because I'm movin' on

But someday baby when you've had your play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on
You stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad your blue
Keep movin' on

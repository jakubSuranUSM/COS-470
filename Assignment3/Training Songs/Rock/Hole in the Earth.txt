Can you explain to me how
You're so able (how)
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the earth (hole in the earth)
I'm out

There's a hole in the earth (I'm out)

Can you explain to me now
If you're still able (whilst)
I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

I hate all of my friends
They all accept our time
There's a hole in the earth (I'm out)
There is a hole in the earth

Let's think about
This is the end
(Somewhere)
This is the end
(Somewhere)

There's a hole in the earth (hole in the earth)
There's a hole in the earth (hole in the earth)
I hate all of my friends
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
(Somewhere)

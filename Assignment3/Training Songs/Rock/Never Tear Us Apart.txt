Don't ask me 
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you 
I love your precious heart

I... I was standing, you were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I... I was standing, you were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

Don't ask me 
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I... I was standing, you were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

You... you were standing, I were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I... I was standing, you were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

Never too certain what is to follow
Exhilaration, then comes the pressure
From to A to Z in

Cycles per second
Cycles per second

Talk in a riddle, several hertz
Some hypnagogic turn for the worse
Having a good time

Cycles per second
Cycles per second

Forging a neuronic aperture

Cycles per second, ahhh
Cycles per second, ahhh
ItÃ¢??s got a hold on you
Tell me how to make it stop

Call a depression transient thing
CanÃ¢??t move a finger, refuel a drink
From Y to B in

Cycles per second
Cycles per second

Gorging a neurotic appetite

Cycles per second, ahhh
Cycles per second, ahhh
ItÃ¢??s got a hold on you
Tell me how to make it stop

Cycles per second, ahhh
Cycles per second, ahhh

Hold on to that lead they sometimes pull so tight
And there's bad boy Oscar he been up all night
And if oxygen ran out 
You know he just won't care
It'll be like throw that stick one more time of there

And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby
Poodle rockin' my mind was a mess
Before you brought happiness
And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby poodle rockin'
You're chasing sticks and stones
Like you just don't care at all

Dear round Alice she been sick outta sight
She's just ate three whole boxes of Turkish Delight
Oh waggy waggy tail and chasing sticks and stones
Those victory laps and sgt pepper tones

And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby
Poodle rockin' my mind was a mess
Before you brought happiness
And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby poodle rockin'
You're chasing sticks and stones
Like you just don't care at all

Ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah 
Ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah 
Ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah ooh aah 

And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby
Poodle rockin' my mind was a mess
Before you brought happiness
And we went, woah poodle rockin' baby poodle rockin'
You're chasing sticks and stones
Like you just don't care at, you just don't care at all
Oh, like you just don't care
Like you just don't care at all
Oh like you just don't care and you just don't care at all

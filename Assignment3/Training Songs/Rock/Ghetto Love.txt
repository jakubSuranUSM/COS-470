Hey now, there now,
It's a game to be played out
Amongst thieves of the heart
And the whores of the ego

Hey now, there now
Kiss everyone's ailments
See them rise up,
Exalt and illuminate, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Humanity is a deer in the headlights
The road is covered in blood
Free yourself with a dagger from above
A crossbow of faith

You sold your heart for the primal experience
Gave up on love for a medal malevolent
You fill yourself with the fire of innocence
A karmic stain will bring back through the gates again

Oh how I wonder what will become, of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love
Oh how I wonder what will become, of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love

You want in me what you see is a testament
You never know when you love what you'll manifest
I'm Joan of Arc on a mission avenge loves death
I'm gonna win I'll never give in

Oh how I wonder what will become, of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love

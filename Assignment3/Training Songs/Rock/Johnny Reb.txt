You fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

Saw you a-marchin' with Robert E. Lee
You held your head a-high, tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost, they speak highly of your name

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they begin to fall
You had tears in your eyes, 'cause you couldn't help at all

But you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

I saw General Lee raise the sabre in his hand
Heard the cannon's roar as you made your last stand 
You marched in the battle with the gray and the red
When the cannon's smoke cleared, took days to count the dead

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song "Dixie"
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed

'Cause you fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb 
Yeah, you fought all the way, Johnny Reb

You fought all the way, Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

You fought all the way, Johnny Reb

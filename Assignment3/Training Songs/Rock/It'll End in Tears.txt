Human patterns
Wedding marches
Bouncing babies
Fallen arches
Oh let them fall, let them fall
Your guard and your clothes
Let them fall

It'll end in tears
I won't cry
I won't cry
I won't

I was looking for a nail
To catch my clothing
And my imagination
Oh let it pull let it run
To leave me completely undone
It'll end in tears
I won't cry
I won't cry
I won't

What time won't tell
The tolling bell
Say secrets won't be kept
The bus was late
We celebrate
The bus conductress weeping
At the terminus

It'll end in tears
I won't cry
I won't cry
I won't

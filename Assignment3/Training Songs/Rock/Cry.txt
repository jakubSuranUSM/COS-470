One more long and lonely night, left here on my own
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?
I lost my baby in the fight, I don't know where you've gone
Do you wanna make we wanna cry?

So I lie alone and I wonder where you've gone
And I dream you're mine wide awake

Don't you wanna make me feel like I'm a thousand stories high?
Don't you wanna make me feel I'll never fail, I'll never die?
Don't you wanna set me free, we'll override the history
Turn to find our destiny and never turn away

The devil was an angel once beautiful like you
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?
I don't care how far you fall, I'll catch you when you do
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?

So I close my eyes try to hold my head up high
And I pray my soul not to break

Don't you wanna make me feel like I'm a thousand stories high?
Don't you wanna make me feel I'll never fail, I'll never die?
Don't you wanna set me free, we'll override the history
Turn to find our destiny and never turn away

Do you really want to say goodbye?
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?

Don't you wanna make me feel like I'm a thousand stories high?
Don't you wanna make me feel I'll never fail no matter why?
Don't you wanna set me free, we'll override the history
Turn to find our destiny and never turn away from me

Don't you wanna make me feel like I'm a thousand stories high?
Don't you wanna make me feel I'll never fail, I'll never die?
Don't you wanna set me free, we'll override the history
Turn to find our destiny and never turn away

Do you really want to say goodbye?
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?
Do you wanna make me wanna cry?

Well, come on let's go, let's go, let's go little darlin'
And tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again, and again, and again

Well.... now swing me, swing me, all away darling
Come on, let's go little darlin'
Let's go, let's go again once more

Well.... I love you so and I'll never let you go
Come on baby so
Oh pretty baby I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go little sweetheart
And then we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again, and again, and again

I love you so and I'll never let you go
Come on baby so
Oh pretty baby I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go little sweetheart
And then we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again, and again, and again

I love you so and I'll never let you go
Come on baby so
Oh pretty baby I-I love you so

Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go little darlin'
and tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go and again, and again, and again
Come on, let's go and do it again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again
Come on, let's go and do it again

Love gets inside of you
It makes me invisible
And I will continue to hang on super love, a sonic bloom,
A total emotionless excuse
I can't believe it happened to me
The magic's in my heart
Believe me
Rushing through my electrical phase, I found a place to hide when you're away
Almost caught myself a breath
I touched your hand and lost myself instead
Swung my hands up through the air
Northwest skies I love the way you shine
I wanna be just as good
I wanna make it better
I wanna see you sideways
I wanna make it better
When love gets inside of you it makes me invincible
And I can't believe this happened to me

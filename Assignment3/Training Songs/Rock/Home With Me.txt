Your world, my world (Repeats)

San Christobal on New Year's Day
Sunny beach, L.A.
Blue and coral Kirkstall skies
Timorese sunrise
Fairfield Horseshoe in the snow
Clashing worlds in Tokyo
All the bars in County Cork
Heavy rain, New York

(Chorus)
I sailed the seven seas
Carved my love on trees
I brought the whole world home with me
Home with me

Your world, my world (Repeats)

Barcelona cobbled streets
Paris, 1968
Words along the Berlin wall
When it's just about to fall

(Chorus)
I sailed the seven seas
Carved my love on trees
I brought the whole viltti home with me
Home with me

Your world, my world (Repeats)

Gracelands, Memphis, Tennessee
Killing time, Napoli
Autumn Warsaw, grey and green
Kronstadt 1917

(Chorus)
I sailed the seven seas
Carved my love on trees
I brought the whole world home with me
Home with me(Repeats)

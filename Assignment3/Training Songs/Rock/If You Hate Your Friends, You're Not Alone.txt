All along
You wanted to see me fail
I'd never suspect you
In the middle of the circle

Hiding your cover
Does this city have enough
Air for both of us to breathe?
If it was up to you one of us would leave
I'm telling you there's no way it would be me

So talk yourself till your blue in the face
'Cause someone always wants to listen to hate
It's just too bad you're so easy to ignore
So oh no, oh no,

Here comes the girl with the ice cream cone
Who says she didn't get
A scoop as big as mine

Does it hurt to force a smile to my face?
Does it burn to wish you were in another place?
I won't look to you anymore
So what are you saying tonight? [x3]

Here come the cops
Hand me my sword
I got nowhere to run
I'm afraid of the whole

Who gave you the tip?
Was it someone I know?
Ain't it always the rats
Who bring the pigs to your door?

Who's got the fear
Of your little boy club?
Better watch what you say
Better come with your all

Turning the deadbolt
The chain's on the door
Now
Knock when you know that I'm home

Won't you give me one more try?
Gimme one more try
Or kiss my friends goodbye
Unless you gimme one more try

Let me borrow your car
Take it down to the shore
Lemme crash at your house
Is your mother still home?

Won't you give me a taste
'Til the heat cools down?
I just need enough
To get me around

Crawling out the window
Breaking down the door
It's a long fall
From the sixth floor

Turning the deadbolt
The chain's on the door
Now
Knock when you know that I'm home

Won't you give me one more try?
Gimme one more try
Or kiss my friends goodbye
Unless you gimme one more try

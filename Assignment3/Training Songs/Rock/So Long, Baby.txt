I see you're laughing and ah
Telling everyone in town
That you've made a fool of me
Well go and talk some more 'cause
Baby I don't care no more
You don't bother me at all

'Cause I got news for you
I was untrue too
And I don't care what you say
So go and laugh some more 'cause 
Baby I don't care no more
I've got another lover of my own

Step by step you put me down,
 Always calling me a clown
If you ever go away, promise me that you'll stay
Far, far, far, far, far from me

Now that we've played our game 
I guess we're both to blame
We tried to break each other's hearts
You had one jump on me but
I jumped twice you see
It's all over now be on your way

So long baby, be on your way-e-yay-e
I had a ball, you thought I'd fall
You had one jump on me but
I jumped twice you see
It's all over now be on your way

So long baby, be on your way!
So long baby, be on your way!
So long baby, be on your way!

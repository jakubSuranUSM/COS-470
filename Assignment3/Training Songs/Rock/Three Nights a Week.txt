Three nights a week, your'e gone
Three nights a week, that's too long
You know you're doin me wrong
Baby won't you please stay home.

I call you on the phone
Pretendin you were home
Although I knew you were gone,
Baby won't you please stay home.

When you're gone I'm such a lonely man
When you're gone, my heart doesn't beat the same

Three nights a week, you're gone,
Three nights a week, that's too long
Three nights a week, I'm alone
Baby won't you please stay home.

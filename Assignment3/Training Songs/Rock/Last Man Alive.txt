Look out
And the ship that you sailed now has gone
Without you, has left you all alone
And you just stood and watched

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, so long

As the ice around you starts to melt
Just don't panic 'cause I'm holding your life belt
Or I'll just stand and watch
Yes, I'll just stand and watch

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, so long

You were never meant to be
When you first put out to sea

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, so long

Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long
Look out for the last man alive
Don't you wonder how he has lived so long, it's goodbye
So long, it's goodbye

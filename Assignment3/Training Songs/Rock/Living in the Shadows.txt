Constant quick fixes, don't make no sense
Hop on bandwagons, you make me sick

Don't you tell me, what you think is right!
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows

Distant loud chuckles, keep me awake
Awkward in stances won't make you hip

Don't you tell me, what you think is right!
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows

We've said this all before, your shadows at the door,
We've said this all before, your shadows at the door,
There's darkness in the hall and we won't take the fall!

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

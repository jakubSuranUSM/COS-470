"We have time" she told me right when she was leaving 
As she kissed me and walked out for another week away 
"We have time" she wrote me when she wasn't in a place to call me 
When her family was around her telling her to stay 

Do we have time I wonder as I stand here thinking of her 
Because having time and timing are everything 
Will there be enough time? 
Will we be ready at the right moment? 
Will our heart and minds surrender to the forces in our way? 

No way to know 
Either way she's gonna go 

If this was science fiction 
I'd get myself a Delorean 
I'd travel to where you don't need roads 
And see if all her leaving leads to returning 
If in the future she and I have a happy home 

"We have real love‚Äù she told as we were waking in the morning 
As she touched me and kissed me and took away my pain 
"We have real love" she told me 
As we were packing her bags for traveling 
As I was getting ready to take her to the plane 

Will we ever be alone together without extenuating circumstances? 
She and I and time to be the people that we dream 
She would draw the world her mind sees 
I would sing her some bad poetry 
We would hide beneath the covers and not be afraid to sleep 

No way to know 
Either way she's gonna go 

If this was science fiction 
I'd get myself a Delorean 
I'd travel to where you don't need roads 
And see if all her leaving leads to returning 
If in the future she and I have a happy home

If this was science fiction 
I'd get myself a Delorean 
I'd travel to where you don't need roads 
And see if all her leaving leads to returning 
If in the future she and I have a happy home

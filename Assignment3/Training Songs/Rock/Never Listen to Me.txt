Follow my light
Follow my lead
Never listen to me
Never listen to me

Fall by my side
I only needed to see
Never listen to me
Never listen to me

Follow my light
Follow my lead
Never listen to me
Never listen to me

Fall by my side
I only needed to see
Never listen to me
Never listen to me

Follow the sound
Follow me down
Follow me down

Follow me down
Follow me down

I'll give you all that I have
I'll tell you everything
Love me all of my life
Never listen to me

I'll give you all that I have
I'll tell you everything
Love me all of my life
Never listen to me

Follow my call
Follow my voice
Like you know me
Like you know me

Fall in the sea
Fall in the noise
Like you know me
Like you know me

Follow my call
Follow my voice
Fall in the sea
Fall in the noise
Never listen to me
Never listen to me

Follow the sound
Follow me down
Follow me down

Follow me down
Follow me down

I'll give you all that I have
I'll tell you everything
Love me all of my life
Never listen to me

I'll give you all that I have
I'll tell you everything
Love me all of my life
Never listen to me

I'll give you all that I have
I'll tell you everything
Love me all of my life
Never listen to me

Never listen to me
Never listen to me

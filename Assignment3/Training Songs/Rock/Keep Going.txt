Well, I'm walking down the road
I ain't got no place to go
There's no one that I know
I don't know no one

Now loneliness ain't rare
It's what we all must bear
If no one has been there
That means no one's gone

And then she says to me
You've got to keep going, ah, ha
Keep going, mm, mm
Keep going
Don't stop, don't stop now

So I keep on moving on
Everything I had is gone
I've come my last come on
It's come and gone

My epitaph will be
In dazzling obscurity
He played his songs for free
And a royalty

And then she says to me
You've got to keep going, ah, ha
Keep going, mm, mm
Keep going
Don't stop, don't stop now

And as the flowers falleth away
The grass turns to hay
And all that I have left to do
I want to do with you

And then she says to me
You've got to keep going, ah, ha
Keep going, mm, mm
Keep going
Don't stop, don't stop now

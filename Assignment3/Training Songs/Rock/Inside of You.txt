I'm on a trip,
I can't get off,
I can't get over
I want it all, I want it all
Inside of you

I call you up
You're getting off I'm coming over

You're twenty one
I see your eyes you're barely sober
I hear your voice
You're calling out
From me to you
I pour a drink
You move in quick, you're moving forward

Then you said,
No, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said,
No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because, I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because, I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you, inside of you.

This fragile game
It's like a train that's headed nowhere
It never stops
And I can't see the exit sign
We're headed North
I see the cliff we're getting closer

So don't say that you just want to run away
Replay all the things that I tried to say

I'm 21
So you're getting off
I'm coming over

Then you said,
No, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said,
No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because, I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because, I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you, inside of you.

I'm on a trip, I can't get off,
I can't get over
I want it, I want it all
Inside of you

I call you up,
You're getting off, I'm coming over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Noooo, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said,
No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you
Because, I know, I'm gonna fall
Because, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you, inside of you.

I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because, I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you, inside of you.

I'm on a trip, I can't get off,
I can't get over
I want it, I want it all
Inside of you

I call you up,
You're getting off, I'm coming over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When you're standing by the road side 
And it's a long way to go 
Oh to carry me
To carry me 
Carry me 
Carry me friend 
Oh to carry me

And together in this mad land
Far from the truest of hands 
Well I'll carry you
If you'll carry me 
Carry me 
Carry me friend 
Oh carry me 

And we'll patrol bomb the state 
We blow away the hate
But we'll do it in our mind
If we can take the time 
We build ourselves a road 
From what we know 
Each take our parts 
But now's the time to start
Oh yeah it is 
Oh we must be 
Oh we must be 
Oh we must be

But Jane is takin' heroin 
And Paul is getting pissed
Steve is getting stoned
And to fucked to fight 
Sara's on the acid 
And Sean has blown his mind 
Someone's busy hiding 
To fucked to fight
Yeah some have found religion
And some have run away
And some they form a party to find a way

Yeah some they join the system
And some just look away
But some must bite their backsides 
To find a way 

And there is a way why
es there is a way 
Yes there is a way

When you're standing by the road side 
And it's a long way to go 
Well I'll carry you
If you'll carry me 
Carry me 
Carry me friend 
Well I'll carry you

When you're kneeling through the hours
And you're doubting your given powers
And when you're ready for her mercy
And you're worthy
It will come

When you're sneaking round the back door
And she's waiting for you no more
And when you're ready for her mercy
And you're worthy
It will come

When the birds are just tuning up still
And the dawn breaks on your windowsill
And when you're ready for her mercy
And you're worthy
It will come

It will come
When you're broken
When your heart is finally open
When you're down
Down and troubled
When you're lost among the rubble

Well, there's sugar on the old spoon
Let's do that two-step around your front room
And when you're ready for her mercy
And you're worthy
It will come

Mercy, mercy, coming to you
Feel her beauty flowing through you 
She will unbind you, set the word free
Mercy, mercy

Mercy, mercy, coming to you,
Feel her beauty flowing through you 
She will unbind you, set the word free
Mercy, mercy

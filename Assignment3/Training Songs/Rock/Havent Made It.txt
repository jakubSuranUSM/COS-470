You know the sky is blue
And the wind cuts right through
The sun shines on you alone
Every step takes you nearer, nearer home
And I love the river
That carries us on
In one direction
Bringing me nearer, nearer home
But you haven't made it yet
No you still haven't made it yet
The sky turns gray
And the river runs high
Running faster
Passes you by
Ghosts of life
Are following you
With a bit of luck
You can make it through
I thought I heard you sigh
When you thought that you were there
But the world turns for you alone
Every step takes you nearer, nearer home
But you haven't made it yet
No you still haven't made it yet
The sky turns gray
And the river runs high
Running faster
Passes you by
Ghosts of life
Are following you
With a bit of luck
We can make it, make it through
But you haven't made it yet
No you still haven't made it yet

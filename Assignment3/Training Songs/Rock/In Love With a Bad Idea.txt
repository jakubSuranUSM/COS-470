Line up crooked my eyes straight up at the sun
In and out of consciousness
Neither is much fun
Show down with that head of yours
And the book is ten to one

Ghetto rock for Princess Sticky Magazine
Five nights on the TV and two nights in between
To make out in the basement with the American dream

Take your time

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't it crazy just to want it
Arrogant to flaunt it
Since we fell in love with a bad idea?

Shine up crooked your eyes blazing like the sun
Make a little paradise for many to be one
Name it after liberty and build it running guns

Slumming it with Princess Sticky Magazine
Five nights on the TV, and for ten thousand dollars she'll agree
To do it on camera with the American dream

Take your time

[Chorus]

Take your time

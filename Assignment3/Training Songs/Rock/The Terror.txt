However long they love you
We are all standing alone
The terror’s in our heads
They don't control the controls

I turn to face the sun
We are still standing alone
At last we'll stand by the terror
It helps us take the controls

We’ll save the last sunshine
The way I long to go
We’ll save the love, you’ll still love
We’re searching through the dark

We’ll save the last sunshine
The way I long to go
We’ll save the love, you’ll still love
We’re searching through the dark

We’ve all tried to come through
We’ve always tried to come through
We all stretched to come to this

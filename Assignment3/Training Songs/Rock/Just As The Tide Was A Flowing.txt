On one morning
In the month of May
When all the birds
Were singing

I saw a lovely maiden stray
Across the fields at break of day
She softly sung her roundelay
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning
Her cheeks were red
Her eyes were brown

Her hair in ringlets haging down
Upon her face to hide the frown
Just as the tode was flowing
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning
A sailor's wife at home must bide
She halted heavily she sighed

"He parted from poor me, a bride
I'm widowed by the sea" she cried
Just as the tide was flowing
The tide flows in

The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning

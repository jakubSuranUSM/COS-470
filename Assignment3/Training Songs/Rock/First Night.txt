Last night you were so wonderful 
Well, you turned my whole world around 
And I, I just want to say, baby 
You make me, you make me feel 

Like I'm in love for the first time 
You don't know, you don't know what I'm going through 
And I long for you to tell me, honey, 
Tell me that you love me too 

First night, we spent together 
First night, in love forever 
So right, I'll always remember the first night 

One look in your eyes and you sold me 
Now see what your magic has done 
One night in your arms and you told me 
Baby, you, I know you are the one 

I'm in love for the first time 
You don't know, you don't know what I'm going through 
And I long for you to tell me, honey tell me, 
That you love me too 

First night we spent together 
First night, in love forever 
So right, I'll always remember the first night

Everything you said was true
Everything you did was you
Everything I started with her
Ended on an oily stage where
I wrote elegiac stanzas for you
I hope and pray that they come true

He found God
In a parking lot
And you did not
I, I headed for the coastal reef
Regions of mind
To see what I'd find
But I do understand
Why they're looking at you
As if you ever really cared

All across the Eastern Board
Languages were being lost
You look so elegantly bored now
Totally at ease with it all, yeah
Whilst you were drunk, oh, you let it all slip
I hope and pray that it's okay

He found God
In a Wiltshire field
Whilst you did not
I, I headed for the coastal reef
Regions of mind
To see what I'd find
But I do understand
Why they're looking at you
As if you ever really cared

He found God
In a Wiltshire field
And you did not
I, I headed for the coastal reef
Regions of mind
To see what I'd find

The end begins just as it starts
And leaves me wondering what we left behind.
Told me not to talk but please explain
My thoughts that float around my mind

So take a step back will you
Be alright feel alright?
And now

All this time when we walk we won't feel
But sometime in a box it won't steal you

(oh)

Up ahead i see it i can find it but i feel alive.
Followed me inside of a place
I felt like things would still be alright

And now
All this time when we walk we won't feel
But sometime in a box it can steal you
All this time when i talk its not real its not real not real not real its not real

All this time when we walk we won't feel
But sometime in a box it wont steal you
Oh this time when i walk i wont feel i wont feel
Oh this time when i talk its not real its not real not real not real its not real

Oh this time when i talk its not real its not real its not real

There comes a time when a man's gotta choose 
A time when you have to decide what to do 
Watcha' gonna do? Well I got better things to do with my time 
Than to sit on my ass and throw pearls before swine 
Gotta-gotta-go-go light up the ignition 
Gotta kill that sacred cow 
Please spare me all of your futuristic visions 
'Cause I gotta get some action 
Gotta get some action now! 

Things have been goin' on for much too long 
Yeah I've heard it all before and I think I know the song 
Careful now kid, you might just fall for their ruse 
Well I couldn't really bother 'cause I got nothin' to lose 

Gotta-gotta-go-go light up the ignition 
Gotta kill that sacred cow 
Please spare me all of your futuristic visions 
'Cause I gotta get some action 
'Cause I gotta get some action 
'Cause I gotta get some action 

Gotta-gotta-go-go light up the ignition 
Gotta kill that sacred cow 
Please spare me all of your futuristic visions 
'Cause I gotta get some action 
Gotta get some action now!

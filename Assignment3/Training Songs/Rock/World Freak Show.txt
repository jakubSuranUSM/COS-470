In the past fools would pay
To see the freaks of the day
Contradictions of the norm
The bizarre, the wonderful and deformed
No need for the tents
And the cages now
The world comes to my eyes
In front of my TV circus
A freak show in disguise

circles and roundabouts
How much did you know
Going round and coming back
The world freak show
Swings and revolutions
How much did you know
Going round an coming back
World freak show

Another tree is coming down
Another harponed whale is drowned
Another child's belly needs feeding
On land of the fast food chain is bleeding
And we bought our new green wool
And pulled it over our eyes
As the circus goes on
All around
A freak show in disguise

Henrietta we got no flowers for you
Just these three miserable c**ts
Sitting on the back seat banging on the off beat
We know you love us and you probably do
Although you're husband may cut us
He's such an animal though everything is possible

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us about
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us among the has beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk nice anyway you choose it , come on

Dear Henrietta we're just three lonely boys
Though the girls love us we're so
Into you incredibly we'd love to see you terribly
We'd love to hate you but we don't have no choice
Come be our wa ha ha ha
Honey, honey three four one time once more

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us about
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us among the has beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk nice anyway you choose it, come on

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us among the has beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk nice anyway you choose it, come on

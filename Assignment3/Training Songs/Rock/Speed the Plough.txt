The girl I love waits for me now
She'll be standing by the well
She may have to wait until it's dry
Because I am off to hell

Speed the Plough
I'll wait no more for fire from God
Listen to me now
Speed the plough, speed the plough

I counted lines a pretty face
From the tears she cried
Her cheeks were bleached as white as snow
As she kissed me goodbye
We heards the hounds we could not see
And knew our time had come
I turned my back on prison farm
And then began to run

Speed the Plough
I'll wait no more for fire from God
Listen to me now
Speed the plough, speed the plough

The girl I love waits for me now
She'll be standing by the well
She may have to wait until it's dry
Because I am off to hell

Speed the Plough
I'll wait no more for fire from God
Listen to me now
Speed the plough, speed the plough

Speed the Plough
I'll wait no more for fire from God
Listen to me now
Speed the plough, speed the plough

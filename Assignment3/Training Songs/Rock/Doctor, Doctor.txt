Doctor Doctor help me
Doctor Doctor help me
Try to, try to help me
Doctor Doctor help me

Welcome back to the Sunday before you cut me,
Thinking back to the Monday you tried to blame me,
Looking back remember your revenge attacked me,
Rush of blood to the head of your line that crossed me,

Looking out, taking cover in case you saw me,
From the top, taking note of the notes you wrote me,
Looking back remember your attention drew me,
Hear me out, double cross - just cross me,

Doctor Doctor help me (help me)
Doctor Doctor help me (when will I see?)
Try to, try to help me (help me)
Doctor Doctor help me (when will I see?)

Hope you die for the misery that you gave me.
Hope you die, hope you die - love from me.

Doctor Doctor help me (help me)
Doctor Doctor help me (when will I see?)
Try to, try to help me (help me)
Doctor Doctor help me!

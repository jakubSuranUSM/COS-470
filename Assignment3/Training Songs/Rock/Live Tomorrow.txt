Time stands still for no one
I'm behind again
I push and still I see
I'm getting nowhere quick
I'm staying late
Again

Worlds turn in the time
I catch another breath
I know a little more will
Surely do the trick
I can't delay
No I can't be late

I can't take the time
But I plan to when I'm done
I can't waste the day
Nothing ventured nothing
I don't think it's wise
To be idle when you're young
Oh I have to go
I'll have time to live tomorrow

Take a message for me
Tell the wife I'm sorry
Headline's almost here
And there'll be more recitals
Anyway there are bills to pay

I can't take the time
But I plan to when I'm done
I can't waste the day
Nothing ventured nothing
I don't think it's wise
To be idle when you're young
Oh I have to go
I'll have time to live tomorrow

I have to go
Angels spread my wings
And see the fences tumble
Ageless memories
They watch the strong man crumble at my feet
What is this I see

I can't take the time
But I plan to when I'm done
I can't waste the day
Nothing ventured nothing
I don't think it's wise
To be idle when you're young
Oh I have to go
I'll have time to live tomorrow

I have to go

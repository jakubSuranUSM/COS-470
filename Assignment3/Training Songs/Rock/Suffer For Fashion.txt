We just want to emote 'til we're dead
I know we suffer for fashion or whatever
We don't want these days to ever end
We just want to emasculate them forever
Forever, forever

Oh pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that, not like that

We've got to keep it physical
When our tele's are 6 hours away
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
Do they just want to emaciate them forever?
Forever, forever

Now pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that, not like that

We've got to keep our little click clicking at
130 B.P.M., it's not too slow
If we got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together

Together, let's go together
Let's do it together, let's go together

Forever, forever

Now pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that, not like that

We've got to keep our little click clicking at
130 B.P.M., it's not too slow
If we got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together

Together, let's go together
Let's do it together, let's go together

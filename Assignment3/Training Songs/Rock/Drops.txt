When you're so high you
When you fall from the sky you

So come down from the clouds
Come down on me
So come down from the clouds
Come down on me

I've been loving you too long
I've been loving you too long

So come down from the clouds
Come down on me
So come down from the clouds
Come down on me

When you're so high you don't think
When you fall from the sky you won't break

I've been loving you too long
I've been loving you for too long

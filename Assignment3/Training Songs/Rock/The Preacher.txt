Gather round the preacherman gather round here
If you're waiting for the word that'll make it all clear
When you look in the sky you can see what he sees
There's a fire in the Belt of Hercules
Well the man in the collar says come to the fold
Bible in his hand tassle of gold
Says heaven could be locked but he's got a set of keys
They fit the buckle in the belt of Hercules
We all gotta come to the light together
Put your dreams in your pocket boy
We all gotta come to the light together
Follow me
The preacherman's climbing up above a timberline
Bible in his hand praying for a sign
Says I'm tired of the devil - I'm down on my knees!
I'll fight the battle for the belt of Hercules
We all gotta come to the light together
Put your dreams in your pocket boy
We all gotta come to the light together
Follow me

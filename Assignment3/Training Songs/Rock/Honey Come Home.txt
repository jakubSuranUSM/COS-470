Honey come home
My stubborn ways are behind me now
They're behind me now
And there's nothing here
That will not break down
Like you never did

The kids say hello
To us in our separate homes
Darling please come home
I've cleaned out the fridge
Wiped the counters off
And put away my clothes

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young so many years ago

And I think of all this time
That we have wasted with all our fighting and I cry
Just want to die with the one I love beside me

'Someday,' you said,
Someday you will miss my head
Lying next to yours
In our marriage bed

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young so many years ago

Oh God I love my vices but they've taken me to places
That I never thought I'd go and I am ready to be home
And I think of every spark, every whisper in the dark, now it's time
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love beside me

Love, love, love

Honey come home
My stubborn ways are behind me now

Why do I think of You
Far beyond my reach
Why can't I comprehend
The love you have for me
God all of the universe
Of earth and sky and sea
Your desire to own my heart
Is such a mystery

[Chorus:]

You're not there
Way out there
Wandering in your great unknown
You are here ever near
In my heart you've found a home
You are living
You are breathing
I can feel your presence in me

All the prayers
To the saints
Every votive burned
But now I know
From within
Your loving voice is heard

You've sent your spirit
The promised one
To be with me forever

You are living
You are breathing
You are loving
I am needing

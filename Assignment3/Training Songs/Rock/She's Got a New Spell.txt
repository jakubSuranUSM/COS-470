What is that sound?
Where is it coming from?
All around
What are you running from?

Something you don't understand
Something you cannot command
That's how I know
She's got a new spell

Yes, that's how I know
That she's got a new spell 
What's going down?
Who's moved this room from round me?

Where has it gone?
I fear this night will drown me
So I lie awake all night
'Cause I can't sleep with something I can't fight 

The laws of gravity are very, very strict
And you're just bending them for your own benefit
One minute she says
She's gone to get the cat in

The next thing I know
She's mumbling in Latin
She cut the stars out of the sky
And baked them in a pie

She stole the scene and scenery
The script and the machinery

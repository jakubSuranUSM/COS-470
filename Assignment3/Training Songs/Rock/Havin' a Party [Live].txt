We're havin' a party
Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music
On the radio
So listen, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

We're having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the DJ
On the radio
Cokes are in the ice box
Popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby
Are out there on the floor

We're havin' a party
Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music
On the radio
So listen, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging
Oldies, doing the twist now
If you take requests
I've got a few for you
Don't forget the soul twist
Play that one called "I Know"
I got to hear what suites me
No other songs will do

We're havin' a party
Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music
On the radio
So listen, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

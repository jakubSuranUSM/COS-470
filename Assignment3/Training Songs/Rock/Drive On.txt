They took the man from out of town
They won't believe his alibi
And on that day the sky fell down
I swear I heard that young boy cry
He told them:--
I'm no ordinary
In your eyes I never will be
I'm strange and peculiar.
Drive on, Drive on,
I want to go to paradise
Drive on, Drive on,
The feeling cuts me like a knife
Drive on, Drive on.
The rains came late again this year
The crops won't grow without the sun
It's better there than over here
When will Dreamtime come?
He told them:--
I'm no ordinary
In your eyes I never will be
I'm strange and peculiar.
Drive on, Drive on...
I want to go to Paradise
Drive on, Drive on
The feeling cuts me like a knife
Don't lose your head
Just take your time
Can't you see if I'm worth having
I'm worth waiting for.

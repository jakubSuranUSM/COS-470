She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb
She'd just turned twenty-one
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing
That you had ever seen

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landside
In physical terms

With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp
When you'd go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not belive
That such a body was real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you come near the clouds would disappear
Because you lokked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landside
In physical terms

You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the ligt in hidden parts
You make the whole world wanna dance
You bought yourself a second chance

Go baby go go
We're right behind you
Go baby go go
Yeah we're right behind you
Go baby go go
Aw baby we're right behind you
Go baby
Go baby
Yeah we're lookin at you
Go

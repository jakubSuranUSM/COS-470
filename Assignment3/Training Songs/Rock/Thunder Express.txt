Put it in first and then I punch it, listen to the engine roar
Lay a patch of rubber for a block and half
When I push it on down to the floor
Do I roll? Well I guess, Thunder Express

I've got a LS7-454, with an Isky cam
I've got a voodoo head on a swifter shifter, pop the clutch, wham
Do I roll? Well I guess, Thunder Express
Run it home boy

Pull up beside a bad Mustanger, uh uh, no race, no
I pull up beside a bad Mustang
I got nothin' to fear, I can whack
My magic twanger

AMX and GTO and Cougar ain't touched me yet
Duster six-pack, Spring Little Cobra, Barracuda, no sweat
Ain't nothin' outrun my rock and roll Chevy Corvette
Bring it home Wayne

I'm gone in a second when I put my foot down on the accelerator
I'm gone in a second when I put my foot down on the accelerator
I said, "Bye bye Tah' Gay Paree, see ya later alligator"

I'm talkin' 'bout Thunder, Thunder Express
I'm talkin' 'bout Thunder, Thunder Express
I said, "I'm talkin' 'bout Thunder, Thunder Express"
I'm talkin' 'bout Thunder, Thunder Express

Do I roll well I guess, Thunder Express
Do I roll well I guess, Thunder Express
Do I roll well I guess, Thunder Express

I got a transexual feeling
It's hard to be true to the one that's really you
I got a scandalous feeling
It's hard to be true when they point and stare at you
Conditioned to portraying the mask of masculinity
Another blend of different shading
I am what I am
I don't give a damn

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know...
I wanna know, I wanna know
Are you man enough to be a...woman?

Footprints on my window
There's a man in my room; he's riding a broom
He took all my money
The jerk made me hurt; he looked like a baboon
XY, XXY
Gender identity, I got the power to be it
Voice in my head
Will not be dead

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know...
I wanna know, I wanna know
Are you man enough to be a...woman?
Tell me
Tell me

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know...
I wanna know, I wanna know
Are you man enough to be a...woman?
Tell me

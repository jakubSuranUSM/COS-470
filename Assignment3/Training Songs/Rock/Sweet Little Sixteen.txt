They're really rockin Boston
Pittsburgh, P. A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the guys wanna dance with
Sweet little sixteen

Sweet little sixteen
She's just got to have
'Bout a half a million
Famed autographs
Her wallet filled with pictures
She gets 'em one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch and look at her run, boy

Whoa mommy, mommy
Please may I go
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Whoa daddy, daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to mommy
It's all right with you

'Cause they'll be rockin' on bandstand
Philadelphia, P.A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the guys wanna dance with
Sweet little sixteen

They're really rockin Boston
Pittsburgh, P. A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round the Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the guys wanna dance with
Sweet little sixteen

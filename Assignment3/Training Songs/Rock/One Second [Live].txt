And for one second 
I lost my head 
and for one second
I wished that you were dead
and for one second
You wish that you were here all alone

Hold back the tears that could fall for me

And for one second
I lost my breath
And for one second 
I cherish what you said
And for one second 
it seemed that I was here all alone

Hold back the tears that could fall for me

And for one second 
I understand
And for one second 
My life was in your hands
And for one second 
You wish that you were here all alone

Hold back the tears that could fall for me

They fall alone

A friend went away to another town
Where you set your watch to the sound of a pound
The first girl I loved soon followed it seemed
And when the second one went we were choosing teams

And baby she got hers and I got mine
But somehow everybody seemed to get on fine
But we were losing friends over love
Losing friends over love

When I went out just the other night
I said, "put your hands up, cause were gonna fight"
But who am I to act so tough
When I learn so little and forget so much

Now the heart will break when it hits the ground
So wake up little girl you're a woman now
But we were losing friends over love
Losing friends over love

Alright now

Some move forward and some move back
Some buy a ticket and don't come back
How did everything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

Some move up and some fall down
Some buy a ticket and leave this town
How did evrything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

No one says a word but there lips are poised
But everyone's got an opinion of course
And we were losing friends over love
Losing friends over love

All the stupid things you do at night
When you been up for three days
And your so uptight
And we where losing friends over love
Losing friends over love
We were losing friends over love
Losing friends over love

Alright now

Some move forward and some move back
Some buy a ticket and don't come back
How did everything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

Some move up and some fall down
Some buy a ticket and leave this town
How did everything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

She could run away to London
She could run overseas
A merry-go-round in another town
It all seems the same to me

Alright now

Some move forward and some move back
Some buy a ticket and don't come back
How did everything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

Some move up and fall down
Some buy a ticket and leave this town
How did everything go wrong
We all just try to carry on

Some move up and some fall down
Some buy a ticket and leave this town
How did everyhint go wrong
We all just try to carry on

We all just try to carry on

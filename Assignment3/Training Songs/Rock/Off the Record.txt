Sorry 'bout the things that I had to say 
And I'll make it up to you right now at the penny arcade
In an open car wherever you are 
Push yourself too far and it might get hot.

Well I really don't need the confusion 
And you know I just ain't the type
To get all wrapped up in the illusion
Of doin' something that I know ain't right 
Right, right???

You've got to want to rearrange and keep it off the record. Off the record
You've got to know that we will change and keep it off the record. Off the record

In a crowded room near the box of boom
To an artificial tune, I see you swoon
Well you knw all this would turn to mist
If your idea wasn't kissed - why're you so pissed?

Well I know you don't need the confusion
And I know you just ain't the type
To get all wrapped up in the illusion
Of doin' that you know ain't right - right, right???
Right, right?? Right, right??? Right, right, right???

You've got to want to rearrange and keep it off the record. Off the record
You've got to know that we will change and keep it off the record. Off the record.
You've got to want to rearrange and it off the record. Off the record
You've got to know that we will change and keep it off the record. Off the record.
Come on

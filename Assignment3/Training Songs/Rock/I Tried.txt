You you you, you're determined to be a woman
Well show me
The pain is in your eyes but you can hide it
All the fun fun fun

It keeps me going
But then you know it
You won, you won, you won

Me me me, I'm determined to be a loser
And I know it
I seldom miss your lies but I keep believing
I see you come and go

And that's exactly like you
To say it's over
It's begun, it's begun, it's begun

And yeah I tried
Yeah I tried, yeah I tried, yeah I tried
All the life, all the life
Fell from my eyes

I let you have the final say
'Cause something died inside of me

You you you you you you you
You're determined to be a woman
The pain gets in your eyes
You say you hide it

And I seldom miss your lies
But I keep believing
But then you know it
And you won, you've won, you won

And yeah I tried
Yeah I tried, yeah I tried, yeah I tried
All the life, all the life
Fell from my eyes

I let you have the final say
'Cause something died inside of me
I let you have the final say
'Cause Something died inside of me

I've been doing some thinking over these last few days
And I've decided I won't spend any more time with you
I always feel like crying
Now I'd rather not see you again
You've made your own decisions
And you're not a friend

I have been thinking over these last few days
You might think that your lies are kind but they just stink
'Cause i always felt like crying
Now i'd rather not see you again
We've made our own decisions
And you're not my friend

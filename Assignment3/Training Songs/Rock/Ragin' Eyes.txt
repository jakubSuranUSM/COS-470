Well I know a little girl
Lives over there
She looks so square
But for a pair of ragin' eyes
Oh she's got ragin' eyes

Well she ain't such a beauty
Hardly a Juliet
But she can roll a Romeo
And then do his duty
With those ragin' eyes, ragin' eyes

She's got ragin' eyes
Who wants to tell her
Ragin' eyes, oh ragin' eyes
Not this fellow, ragin' eyes

Sometimes she's soft
Sometimes she's scaly
Her mama said that even
Back when she was a baby
She had ragin' eyes, ragin' eyes

She's got ragin' eyes
Who wants to tell her
Ragin' eyes, oh ragin' eyes
Not this fellow, ragin' eyes

Well she can work those lights
So they fiddle with the traffic
Sometimes she's mean
As an M-16 automatic

Oh she got ragin' eyes
She got ragin' eyes, ragin' eyes
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ragin' eyes

Kiss me, kiss me, under a glow star sky
If they're stuck on the ceiling I don't mind
It's a brittle world but it's soft inside
I'll make the milky way for you, only you
For you, only you

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.
Only you, with you, only you

Love me, love me, under a glow star sky,
It's a galaxy when we get high
And sleep to the junkies' lullabies
I close my eyes for you, only you
You, only you

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.

I touch your face, I'm flying over fields
I touch this moment, it's mine
I'm an angel, I'm a parasite
I'm a vessel, I shine

Kiss me, kiss me, under a glow star sky,
We'll be pushing up soil someday, sometime
So hold me now, hold me tight
I'll make the milky way for you, only you
For you, only you

And I will always ride far into the night with you,
And I will take my chances, far into the night with you.

And I will always ride, kiss me, kiss me, far into the night with you
And I will take my chances, kiss me, kiss me, far into the night with you
With you

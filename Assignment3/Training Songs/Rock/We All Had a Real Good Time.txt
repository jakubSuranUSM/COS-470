[GUITAR SOLO]

I don't remember how I got this way.
I don't recall what happened yesterday.
I don't remember what I did last night.
But I know I was feelin' all right.

And we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
And we all had a real good time.
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine.

[GUITAR SOLO]

Got so loud that I couldn't hear the phone.
In the nick a-time I called, no one was home.
The girl was rockin', so I crawled across the floor.
I tried to make it, but I couldn't find the chord.

So we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
But we all had a real good time.
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine.

[GUITAR SOLO]

Here we are now, the time is right.
Feelin' good like I did last night.
I can tell, you're feelin' good too.
Come on with me, I wanna party with you.

And we all had a real good time.
Somebody told me I was out of my mind.
And we all had a real good time.
Don't try to stop yourself from feelin' fine.

And we all had a real good time.

You've gone and done it again
Taken everything I have and multiplied by ten
Here I'm the lepper you washed clean
1/9 of the citizens who never stopped to say a single thing
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Here I stand a blessed man
Back turned to my benefactor
And my only friend
How does it feel to be denied The friendship that you wanted so much
You would bow to me and even die
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Who Am I?
Who am I that you would bow and put your knees to dirty ground?
Who am I to meet the king and have him wash my soiled feet?
You met me here, whispered in my ear
Now I melt into you (x2)
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Jesus, I feel you changing me

This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is I'm sorry

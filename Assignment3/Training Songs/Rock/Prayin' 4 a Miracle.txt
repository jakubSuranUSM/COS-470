I've been flat out of luck
Spent my very last buck
Can't sink no lower than this
I'm so broken inside
Had to spit out my pride
This ain't no way to exist

Every place that I go, everyone that I meet
Sees me like I'm some dog in the street
And it's bringing me down to my knees

[Chorus:]
Now I'm prayin', prayin', prayin' for a miracle
I'm prayin', prayin', prayin' for a miracle
Prayin' for a miracle

Since I left you that night
Less than nothing's gone right
Living this hell that I made
So I'm back at your feet
I'm admitting defeat
Girl, I never felt so afraid

Just give back my life, I admit my mistakes
Now I'm willing to do whatever it takes
I'm begging you now, can't you see

[Chorus:]

Don't walk away
'Cause I know I'm still worth savin'
Can you forgive the way I turned my back on you?
I'm prayin', prayin', prayin' for a miracle

[Chorus:]

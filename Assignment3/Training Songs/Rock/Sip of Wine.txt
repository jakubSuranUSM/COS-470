On the road and I'm feeling low
Got a ticket for my way back home
I start to feel like a rolling stone
Without company 
Down in the bar talking to the trees
I found a lady hanging on my sleeve
I said, "I thank you but I have to leave"
She said, "Stay with me, I need company
Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
Come tomorrow, leave it all behind." 

I didn't see a warning sign
I held her breath and she was holding mine
I think I'll be here for a long, long time
If you stay with me, got to be

"Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
Come tomorrow, leave it all behind."

"Take a sip of my wine
It's gonna make you feel fine
Come tomorrow, leave it all behind."

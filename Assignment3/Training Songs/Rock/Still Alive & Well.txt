Did you ever look to see who is left around? 
Everyone I thought was cool is six feet under ground 

They tried to get me lots of times and now they're 
Coming after you I got out and I'm here to say 
Baby you can get out too 

I'm still alive and well 
I'm still alive and well every now and then its kind of hard 
To tell I'm still alive and well 

When I think about the past it only brings me down 
Make love in the grass while the sun is shining down so everyone will know 

I'm still alive and well 
I'm still alive and well every now and then its kind of hard 
To tell I'm still alive and well

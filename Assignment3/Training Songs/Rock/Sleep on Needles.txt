Ask me anything you like
I'll reveal everything
I will treasure the truth 
You could know anything
I am but a fool to play unaware of things 
If I'd treasured the truth

Sleep on needles
You'll believe you are hard
Sleep on needles
And hear only the truth

Am I likely to succeed with the way things are?
Judging by your smile

I'm sleepless around midnight
There's a change in the wind
The remembrance of things you used to hold back
I come around each time your notes are high
To tear you down and drag you up
To let you know what's going on while I

Sleep on needles
You'll believe you are hard
Sleep on needles
And hear only the truth

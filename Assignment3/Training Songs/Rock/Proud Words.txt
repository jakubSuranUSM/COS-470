Stand up and fight
Or you'll lose your right
Do you want to stand in a line
Fightin' hard to hold on to your mind

Seek and you'll find
Proud words on a dusty shelf
Find and you'll seek
Keep on keepin' on helpin' yourself

When the wind of trouble comes
Put away all battledrums
And stand up and fight
Stand up and fight
Don't stand in a line
Hold on to your mind

Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight
Don't stand in a line
Hold on to your mind

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

Atomic caress
A life in search of power
I found my test site
I made a ritual of emptiness

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

We walk to a walk-off
The edge of my own life
Due town a bright flash
My body is a souvenir

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!

It took so long for me see
Hopes are burnin' up, sets you free
I wandered through the thought of you
I wandered through the void of me
I've grown afraid of everything that I love

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!

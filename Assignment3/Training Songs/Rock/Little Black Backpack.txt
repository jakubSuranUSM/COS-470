Well I know it, it's a shame 
A shame I can't show it, 
I see it, I can see 
It now but I'm so far below it 

Don't want to, don't want to talk about it, 
I say why not, 
Don't want to think about it, 
I say there's got to be some good reason 
For your little black backpack up, 
Smack, turnaround he's on his back and

Don't want to tango with you, 
I'd rather tangle with him, 
I think I'm gonna bash his head in, 
And this shouldn't concern 
You except that just don't expect to get 
Your bloody black backpack back 

I can feel you, yes I can what about that 
Don't you understand, 
And I sense you, 
Its something sensual but its less than I 
Planned 

Don't want to, don't want to talk about it, 
I say why not, 
Don't want to think about it, 
I say there's got to be some good reason 
For your little black backpack up, 
Smack, turnaround he's on his back and

Don't want to tango with you, 
I'd rather tangle with him, 
I think I'm gonna bash his head in, 
And this shouldn't concern 
You except just don't expect to get 
Your bloody black backpack back 

You're trying to find a reason for the way you feel tonight, 
You're mind is lined with layers of lead, 
Have you heard one thing that I've said

Don't want to talk about it, 
I say why not, 
Don't want to think about it, 
I say there's got to be some good reason 
For your little black backpack up, 
Smack, turnaround he's on his back and

Don't want to tango with you, 
I'd rather tangle with him, 
I think I'm gonna bash his head in, 
And this shouldn't concern 
You except just don't expect to get 
Your bloody black backpack back (twice)

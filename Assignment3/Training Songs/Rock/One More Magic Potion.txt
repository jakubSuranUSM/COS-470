Once when we were returning from a battle, 
And we got lost in a gloomy forest.
In the middle of the woods we saw an old house,
With tired minds we knocked the door very loudly.
Old woman opened the wooden door, she asked us to come in with kind words.
From her pot arose a scent so weird.
Stunning and bitter but very summoning.

Bring me a magic potion; it will heal my achin' wounds.
A taste so bitter that makes my bleeding soul feel so good.
It will make us sing and dance in our endless feast.
Or it might even unleash the beast in me!

She filled our pints with the devils beverage.
And served another round with a hideous grim.
The world was spinning in a new light I saw,
Everything and everyone was singing this song!

With nature, trolls and spirits of the forest.
We are on; let our singing rise up into the stars.
The Witch's magic drum was still beating hard.
When a goblin brought me a new pint and together we roared!

Drink and dance!
People of the forest sing with us!
Who wants to brawl with me?
Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw?
Like the great One once did!

Close your eyes.
Calm your mind and drift away from the pain.
Beyond dreams.
Into the depths of the cauldron.

Like a rain it falls.
And mirrors natures healing powers.
Surrender this time.
And relief you shall find.

Catcher of souls.
Hunter of spirits.
Grant us a drop from the life's elixir.
I want to drawn all my misery.
Into the green trolls blood.
And brown swamp drink.
Fight against diminishing time.
Burden of a solitary warrior's life.
So catcher of souls.
Hunter of spirits.
Grant us the final drop from the life's elixir.

Bring me a magic potion; it will heal my achin' wounds.
A taste so bitter that makes my bleeding soul feel so good.
It will make us sing and dance in our endless feast.
Or it might even unleash the beast in me!

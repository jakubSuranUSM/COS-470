Tell me what you please
This place is a squeeze
Your guess is as good as mine
Sell me other dreams; oh, the summer's here
You know we're going down the line
You know we're going down the line

Taking all the pieces of the situation
Hoping we can work it out
With fate on your side, luck and some pride
You are on the right line
It'll be a sure sign

In fortune's hand
Where do we stand?
In fortune's hand

There isn't a noble or a humble person
Who isn't up or down a while
Throw caution to the wind
Leave your cares behind
You know we're going down the line
You know we're going down the line

Tell me what you please
This place is a squeeze
Your guess is as good as mine
Sell me other dreams; oh, the summer's here
You know we're going down the line
You know we're going down the line

In fortune's hand
Where do we stand?
In fortune's hand

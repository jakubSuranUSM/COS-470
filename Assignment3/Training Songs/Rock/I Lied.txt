Holding hands down by the shore
And I know, God knows it feels so fine
Holding hands down by the shore
And I know, God knows it feels so fine
I said I loved you, I said I loved you
Holding hands down by the shore
Leaned over and whispered in your hear
But I lied, I lied
I couldn't love you if I tried
Holding you in my harms, in my bed
God knows it feels so fine
Holding you in my harms, in my bed
God knows it feels so fine
I said I loved you, I said I loved you
Holding you in my harms, in my bed
I whispered in your hear
But I lied, I lied
I feel so dead inside
I couldn't love you if I tried, tried, tried, tried

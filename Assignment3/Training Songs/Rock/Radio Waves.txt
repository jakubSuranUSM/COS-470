This is K.A.O.S.
You and I are listening to KAOS in Los Angeles.
Let's go to the telephones now and take a request.
Hello, I'm Billy.
Yes?
I hear radio waves in my head.
You hear radio waves in your head? 
Is there a request that you have tonight for K.A.O.S.?

Radio waves, radio waves
He hears radio waves, radio waves
The atmosphere is thin and cold
The yellow sun is getting old
The ozone overflows with radio waves
AM, FM, weather, and news
Our leaders had a frank exchange of views
Are you confused?
Radio waves

Radio waves, radio waves
AM radio waves, FM radio waves
Radio waves, mind-numbing radio waves
Fish-stunning radio waves
Radio waves

Magic Billy in his wheelchair
Is picking up all this stuff in the air
Billy is face to face with outer space
Messages from distant stars
The local police calling all cars
Radio waves

Hear them radio waves, radio waves
Jesus saves radio, radio waves
Radio waves, AM radio waves, FM radio waves
All them radio waves

Radio waves, radio waves
He hears radio waves
Radio waves, radio waves
Hopeful radio waves
Dopeful radio waves
Radio waves
Russian radio waves
Prussian radio waves
Eastern radio waves
Western radio waves
Testing radio waves, one, two, one, two
Radio waves
Getting through to you
More code, radio waves
Tobacco road radio waves
South to Paloma radio waves
Oklahoma City radio waves
Sitting pretty radio waves
Nitty-gritty radio waves
Radio waves

All right, that's a song called Radio Waves. 
You are listening to K.A.O.S. in Los Angeles and we've got Billy on the line.
I'm from the valleys.
You're from the valley?
No, Jim you schmuck, the Valleys, male voice choirs, Wales.
Ah, you're from Wales! Now is this sperm or blue-tip?
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Jim.
Sorry.
Me and Benny went out.
Who's Benny?

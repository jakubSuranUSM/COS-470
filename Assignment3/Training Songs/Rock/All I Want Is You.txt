I've been hurt and I've been hurtful
Been used and I have used
Have been tired and I've been tiresome
I've lied and I've been lied to

Believe me when I tell you
I don't know where to start
(I don't know where to start oh-oh)
I've got a secret
But you have got my heart

I guess it may seem funny
Perhaps a little strange
To feel so close to someone
You've only known for a day

There's so much I'd like to ask  you
There's so much I'd like to say
Well I'm gonna miss your smile when you're gone
The one that got away 

Believe me when I tell you
I don't know what to do
I've got a secret
All I want is you

Believe me when I tell you
I don't know where to start
(I don't know where to start oh-oh)
I've got a secret
But you have got my...

Believe me when I tell you
I don't know what to do
I've got a secret
All I want is you

You are the most extraordinary person
You write the most peculiar kind of tunes
I met you floating as I was boating
One Afternoon

Wasn't it the most amazing meeting
Surrounded by those monsters from the deep
You started telling me a funny story, and I fell asleep

Oh Wot a dream that was

We went for a glide across the country

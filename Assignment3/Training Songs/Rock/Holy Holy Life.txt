In bad times, when it's dark and cold
You got no place to rest your soul
There's laughter behind your backs
Then it seems the devil rules the deck
Nothin' seems easy these days
Or do I see it in a different way
The world is spinnin', well that's OK
Tell me baby what's the price we pay
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Holy holy life, sometimes is sad
Holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
The sooner or later, they'll find you dead
Why don't you take me down to a rabbit hole
Where a man of peace can hide his soul
Thinkin' about pollution and a birth-control
Better talk to the rabbits, it's somebodies fault
And maybe sometimes I'm pessimistic
And maybe it ain't so bad, it ain't so sick
I know I'm not the man of constant sorrow
Ant tell me is it the path of evil to follow
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Holy holy life, sometimes is sad
Holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
Or sooner or later, they'll find you dead
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so sad
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so so sad
Holy, holy, holy

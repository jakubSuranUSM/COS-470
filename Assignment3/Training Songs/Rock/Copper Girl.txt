Remember that girl who changed your world some time ago
A butterfly soul, you tried to chase, but eventually let go
An inbetweener, would possibly beat her but I don't think so
Around she goes, stuck in your memory, her voice echoes
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl

Remember that girl who changed your world some time ago
A butterfly soul, you tried to chase, but eventually let go
An inbetweener, would possibly beat her but I don't think so
Around she goes, stuck in your memory, her voice echoes

Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl

Remember that girl who changed your world some time ago
Then she flew away, but she never did quite go

Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl
Oh oh I will wait for that copper girl

Here we are, face to face
It's been some time now, still feels the same
No one even said you'd be here tonight 
But seeing how you're smiling there just makes it right

Love is worth the wait/Times it felt so strange
I believe in fate

Where's your boy, what's his name?
Does he make you laugh girl, when you feel the pain?
I remember just where we stood, 
Said you didn't love me never thought you would

But now you say you've grown
So tired of being alone
Ask me did I wait
I believe in fate

I know what you believe
Love takes all you can be
I know what's on your mind
Fate comes leaving it all behind

Take my hand, let's leave this place
Time, time is such a waste
I always knew it would feel like this
Things that you do show me what I missed
I taste your lips when I dream your kiss

You go pick up your coat 
Stop to use the phone 
Ask me will I wait
I believe in fate

I know what you believe
Love takes all you can be
I know what's on your mind
Fate comes leave it behind

Days gone, lost in your mind
Change comes when you can find
Love takes all you can be 
I think you ought to leave with me

I can getaway I can getaway
I can see the world I can be happy
You could find yourself in a different world
In a foreign place appreciate something else
Don't you want to go don't you want to go
Fly away with me on a jet plane

I don't want to close my eyes
Even though I'm tired I do not want to sleep
I'm going on a trip when I've saved money
I'm so excited

up to you how far see how brave you are
End up in baja on the peninsula
You could take a chance
In the south of france
Maybe hosseger on a ferry

I don't want to close my eyes
Even though I'm tired I do not want to sleep
I'm going on a trip when I've saved money
I'm so excited

malaga for ?5
Easter for ?00
Holidays all of the 'round
Sweet kernow I am coming down

don't you want to go don't you want to go
Come away with me because I'm leaving

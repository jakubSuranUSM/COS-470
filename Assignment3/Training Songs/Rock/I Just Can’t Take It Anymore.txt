I've been thinkin' back on it, babe
I guess it's been useless after all
I'm tired of seein' all the days goin' by
Tearin' the numbers off my wall

You've been taking up my time and steppin' out-a line
And breakin' up the dreams I had before
And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore

You said once before you were lookin' for a friend
Who'd take the time to really get to know you
But you wanted me to kneel and forgot that I was real
And I guess I'm not per chance that far below you

You've been shakin' up my bed and breaking up my head
So I'm wakin' up an turning in my score
And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore

And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore

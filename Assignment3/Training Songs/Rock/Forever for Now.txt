Hush, hush
Don't say a word
The faint cries can hardly be heard
A storm lies beyond the horizon, barely

Don’t stop
Sweep through the days
Like children that can’t stay awake
Stay here untainted and say

Stay while the melody’s sung
Break like a wave on the run
I do be sure I can’t say anymore
I just know that it won’t last forever

Rush, rush
Take me away
Like hourglass sand that never escapes
Stars are born and then die, but carefree

A small clock that ticks without time
And watched by an ocean of eyes
Ending, ascending and then

Stay while the melody’s sung
Break like a wave on the run
I do be sure I can’t say anymore
I just know that it won’t last 
I just know that it won’t last forever

We tried to invade
But some of us in each
At least try hold the other
In the right light

Uh,  this sky is gonna break
Some of us dies heroes
At least they'll never suffer
At least they're always free

The ocean, I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free, my place in the sun,
I could go anywhere
You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
It seems like you're always traveling

We tried to engage
Softened up by piece
At least I have my taste
Of the nightlife

Be kind to the base
Some day you might need them
At least they'll never suffer
At least they're always free

The ocean, I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free,it's my nature to want
I could go anywhere
You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
It seems like you're always traveling

You know all about me
I won't be tying hard to leave
I should tie you up
It seems like you're always traveling
Always

The ocean, I could go anywhere
At least that's my only cure
So free, my face in the sun,
I could go anywhere

I met a man in New Orleans wore a half suit with dark blue jeans
Kicked his heals together winked at me real nice.
I saw him from a mile away,
But in my state of mind I let him make his play
"Hey boy, have you seen the other side"
Yeah, in this man I saw the devil's hand so I looked at him man to man said
"This time it's gonna be a fight!"

I do not have to justify,
The way I live my life.
I do not have to justify,
The reason I'm alive.

I saw her from across the room with diamond eyes she's heaven's jewel.
Dropped two aces smiled and threw my cards back.
Yeah I've been that man
Who lives deceit
Surrounds himself with worldly things.

So let me tell you a story
Let me feed it to you

We fly around like we were superman live in another trance
A different way to dance with dark romance
You get another chance to do that dirty dance without consequence.

I do not have to justify,
The way I live my life.
I do not have to justify,
The reason I'm alive.

Let me change the timber of this section
Add a little booze to ice
I guess you probably noticed
I've been living a double life

So fly around like you are superman given another chance
A different way to dance with true romance
You get another chance to tell your dirty, darkest secrets.

We fly around like we were superman live in another trance different way to dance with dark romance you get another chance to do the dirty dance without consequence.

I do not have to justify,
The way I live my life.
I do not have to justify,
The reason I'm alive.

No more.
It's just not me.
Not me.
I'm just like you.

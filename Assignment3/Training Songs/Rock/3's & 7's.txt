Lie, lie to my face
Tell me it ain't no thing
That's what I wanna hear
Take your lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me
Look what it did for him

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in
Heaven now

Run, you'll never escape
You see you'll go nowhere
So new you appear

Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet no things
Kiss you goodbye

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in
Heaven now

Keep going over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one's catching on
Callin' my bluff
The devil made me holier than I've ever been
What you do, say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
What you do, say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
Making us all forget
Making us all forget

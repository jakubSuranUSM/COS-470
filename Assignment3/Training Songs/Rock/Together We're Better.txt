Last night you know I couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep,
Tossing and turning about,
Thinking about the way it's been
Hey, it's been so hard to figure out,

We go on sneaking around smokey places all over town,
You go home and it's all over,
Baby you know it's getting me down:

'Cause we're one step short of our heaven,
And we won't stop short till we get there together,
Together baby we're better,
On our own we're fine but united we're dynamite

One step short of our heaven,
And we won't stop short till we get there together,
Together baby we're better, we're better together
Together we're better

You and me sneaking round, meeting in shadows hiding away,
Till we're free to stay together,
All of the time baby all the way,

'Cause we're one step short of our heaven,
And we won't stop short till we get there together,
Together baby we're better,
On our own we're fine but united we're dynamite

One step short of our heaven,
And we won't stop short till we get there together,
Together baby we're better, we're better together
Together we're better.

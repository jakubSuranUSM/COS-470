High tension line, step down 
Jeanette Fletcher is strange but not in a horrible way
And Michelle Spencer is this tight
Come and hear her today
And see 40-year olds in multicoloured shirts
It never used to concern me
But now it's making me say 

High tension line, step down 
Buying houses and doing them up far far away
Got at my shoulder CDTI and behind me TDK
You have to go far for the simple and unadorned
And please excuse my words, wandering 

High tension line, step down 
At my feet CDTI breakdown
And I pick up the phone, no-one
And am far too far fast for sampling
Just spend my time avoiding 

High tension line, step down 
Life is nothing more than a disposable
Facial tissue in a brass bin and spawn
Take it out, I notice face imprint
And please excuse my words, I'm wandering 

High tension line, step down

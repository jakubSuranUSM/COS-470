Lord don't let me go down, will my soul be turned
Don't wanna me leave the ground till I'm done reaping
Lord you let me down but I will still reach in
Don't wanna spit me out, might as well be eaten

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Lord don't hold me down while I'm still creeping
I wanna shake the ground till I am done reaping
Lord do you hear me loud; unto my soul speaketh
Oh won't you let me out, you got the wrong creature

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Why won't you let me love?
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love

Why won't you let me love?   
Won't you let me love?
I wanna flee your love
I want your creature love

Why won't you let me love?  
Won't you let me love?
I wanna eat your love
I'll be your peace for love

Why won't you let me love?
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love

Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)
Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)
Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)

(Be your love, your creature love)

(Be your love, your creature love)

(Be your love, your creature love)

Why won't you let me love
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love

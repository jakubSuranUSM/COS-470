Sometimes I still think of you.
Love that's gone bad and the things I didn't do.
Time heals hearts, so they all say.
Passage of years slowly takes the pain away.
There's still a lot of tenderness in ever little thing I do
Is what I learned from loving you.

But I had too much to learn to 
Hold on to someone like you.
And it took losing you too make me see
The woman you needed me to be.

Times have changed; I have changed too.
Even my eyes turn a different shade of blue.
I guess that's all from crying they went through
Is what I learned from loving you.

But I had too much to learn to 
Hold on to someone like you.
And it took losing you too make me see
The woman you needed me to be.

I don't cry, though we?re apart.
And someday soon, someone else will leave this heart.
And the next time I'm gonna know when love it is true
Is what I learned from loving you.
That's what I learned from loving you.

The hell inside me burns so bright 
Death of glory in the serpent's eye 
Kill the beast that would kill us 
Seek our vengeance beyond the dusk 

Through the shadows of the night 
Through the tempest 
Ride or die 

Through the darkness, through the fear 
Over the ramparts we will 
Through the shadows of the night 
Through the tempest 
Ride or die

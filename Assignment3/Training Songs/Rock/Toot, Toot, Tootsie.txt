Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye!
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The choo choo train that takes me
Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
Do it over again, watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail
Toot, toot, Tootsie don't cry
Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye
 
Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye!
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry
The choo choo train that takes me
Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
Do it over again, watch for the mail, I'll never fail
If you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail
Toot, toot, Tootsie don't cry
Toot, toot, Tootsie, good-bye

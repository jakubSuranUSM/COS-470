Come, sing a song of joy
For peace shall come, my brother
Sing, sing a song of joy
For men shall love each other

That day will dawn just as sure
As hearts that are pure
Are hearts set free
No man must stand along
With outstretched hands before him

Reach out and take them in yours
With love that endures
Forever more
Then sing a song of joy
For love and understanding

Come, sing a song of joy
Of freedom, tell the story
Sing, sing a song of joy
For mankind in his glory

One mighty voice that will bring
A sound that will ring
Forever more
Then sing a song of joy
For love and understanding

Come, sing a song of joy
Of freedom, tell the story
Sing, sing a song of joy
For mankind in his glory

One mighty voice that will bring
A sound that will ring
Forever more
Then sing a song of joy
For love and understanding

Sing, sing a song of joy
For mankind in his glory

Let's dig a hole in the sand brother, 
A little grave we can fill together, 
I got myself a problem,
That I've been lookin' to sell,

Some people die just a little
Sometimes you die by the drop
Some people die in the middle
I live just fine on the top

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

I never said we was equal
I never wished to be saved
If I'm a problem then preacher
Let's dig a little grave

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
Starve off the land for worse or better
Get right down to the bottom
If one goes I'll do the other

Some people die just a little
Sometimes you die by the drop
Some people die in the middle
I live just fine on the top

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
I'm gonna make you for worse or better
I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

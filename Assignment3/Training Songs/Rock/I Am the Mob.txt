I put horse's heads in people's beds,
'cause I am the mob,
When duty calls gonna bust some balls
'cause I am the mob,
Try to tell me it's not one for the money,
Two for the money, three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny come on,
I try my level best, my best to please
But I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees baby come on
Oh just tell them

Stop blowing the don put his keks back on
'cause I am the mob
Stop mucking around, with the brand new sound
'cause I am the mob
Don't try to tell me it's a one for the money, 
Two for the money, three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny come on, oh baby come on
I try my level best, my best to please but
I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees
Come on, just please tell them
Oh Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes 
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes 
Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes
Oh tell them, please tell them
Oh Luca Brasi ah he sleeps with the fishes 
I am the mob

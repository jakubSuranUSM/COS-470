Another night with your head in the oven
Simmering like a heat wave over you
Sweat drops hiss at the bottom
Blood droplets cook like glue

They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
Went out and lost your senses
Went out and lost my head

In deceit, disbelief, they're laughing
As we faint in these houses burning down
In the smoke and the heat we're gasping
For a breath of some fresh air in this town

So save for me, the pleasantries
How pathetic this must sound
To patiently still be craving
A taste of the good life in this town

They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
Went out and lost your senses
Went out and lost my head

In deceit, disbelief, they're laughing
As we faint in these houses burning down
In the smoke and the heat we're gasping
For a breath of some fresh air in this town

We'll make believe
That we still dream
Of one day finally getting out

They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
Went out and spent your senses
Went out and sold my head

They left you with nothing [x2]
They left you with nothing
And left me for dead
And they left us gasping
For one last breath

So save for me, the pleasantries
How pathetic this must sound
To patiently still be craving
A taste of the good life in this town

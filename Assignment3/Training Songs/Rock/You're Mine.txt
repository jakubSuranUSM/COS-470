Every night I see you girl
You promise me good things
But every time I see your face
You look the other way mmm

In due time I'll find you girl
I know that you will say
That every night you dream of me
And how I make you scream

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time

The way you taste at night
Forever paints my mind
My favorite wine
I'll drink you all the time

I die each time I see you girl
And wish for you the same
But when you go I promise you
I'll never take the blame

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time

All the while this honest urge
Is eating me alive
All the smiles I've sacrificed
You got me hypnotized yeah

Me and you, I wonder
What it's like with you
Me and you, I wonder
I believe it's true

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
You're mine!  yeah

All the boys and all the girls
Wonder where you are
Day and night they look for you
Searching near and far
Never will they find a trace
Or have a single clue
Inside me you're safe and sound
I'll always be with you

Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time
Yeah you're mine, you're mine
All the time ooh

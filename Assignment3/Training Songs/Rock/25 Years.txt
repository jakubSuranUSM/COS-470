I went to school and I studied
And I got my G.C.E. 
My City and Guilds and my Sky Diary
But it didn't do me no good
They didn't like my looks
I burnt my books
Twenty five years doesn't matter anymore
I stand around the streets
I lie around the floor
looking at the sky 
I watch the world go by

I started out one day
And I worked in a factory
My mind went blank
I needed a battery
Didn't do me no good
I got the sack
My work was slack

Twenty five years, twenty five years, twenty five years?
'Cause twenty five years doesn't matter anymore
I stand around the streets
And lie around the floor
Looking at the sky
I watch the world go by
They say there's life up there in the galaxy
The world's in collision
There's people with an allergy
Twenty five years of social reform
Ain't gonna make me change or make me conform
Twenty five years, twenty five years, twenty five years
Twenty five years of social research and

Twenty five years, twenty five years, twenty five years?

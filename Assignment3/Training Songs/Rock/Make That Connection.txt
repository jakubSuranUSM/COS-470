H what would I do
Oh what would I do babe
Honey I have this feeling
It's never ever ever explained
Yeah I'm afraid a part of my heart

Would always feel misunderstood babe
I would never know honey
I never meant to drive you away
What's wrong? 

I want to make that connection, that connection to you
I want to make that connection, that connection to you

What would I give if I could have you now
Baby what would I give to see your smiling face again
You know there's nothing I would not do
No river I would not swim, no mountain I would not climb baby
If I could have you right here once again

I want to make that connection, that connection to you
I want to make that connection, that connection to you

Tell me baby is it something I might have said? 
Is it something I might have done wrong to change your mind? 
Tell me baby is it something I've have said? 
Is it something I could've done? 
Honey somehow let me right all your wrongs

I want to make that connection, that connection to you
I want to make that connection, that connection to you

Oh what would I give if you would tell me just one thing
Honey what would I give if you would stroke my hand with your brow
Or whisper sweet things into my ear I would smile like a baby
I would be happy like a child if I could have you right here, right here, right here
Right here with me now

I want to make that connection, that connection to you
I want to make that connection, yes I do
I want to make that connection, that connection to you
I want to make that connection, what's wrong? 
I want to make that connection, that connection to you

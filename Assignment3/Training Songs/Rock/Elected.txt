I'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice
I wanna be elected
I'm your Yankee Doodle Dandy in a gold Rolls Royce
I wanna be elected

Kids want a savior and don't need a fake
I wanna be elected
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make
I wanna be elected, elected, elected

I never lied to you, I've always been cool
I wanna be elected
I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school
I wanna be elected, elected, elected

Hallelujah, I wanna be selected
Everyone in the United States Of America

We're gonna win this one, take the country by storm
We're gonna be elected
You and me together, young and strong
We're gonna be elected, elected, elected

Respected, selected, call collected
I wanna be elected

"And if I am elected
I promise the formation of a new party
A third party, the wild party
I know we have problems
We got problems right here in Central City
We have problems on the North, South, East and West
New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles
Detroit, Chicago
Everybody has problems
And personally, I don't care"

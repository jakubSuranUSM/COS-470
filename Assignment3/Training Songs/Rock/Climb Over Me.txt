‘Cause I need to feel your sun again
Shine, slide over me
‘Cause I need to feel your sun again

Climb over me
All you needed was a friend

I will shoulder you
‘Cause I’m older now and I’ll see it through
I will shoulder you
‘Cause I’m older now and I’ll see it through

Climb over me
All you needed was a friend
Climb over me
All you needed was a friend

Bring it on down bring it on down
Bring it on down bring it on down
Bring it on down

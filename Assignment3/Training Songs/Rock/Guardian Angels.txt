E7 a amaj7
Your guardian angels are looking down on you
D a
As they fold your wings and collect your things
E e7
And lift you into the blue
A amaj7
Your guardian angels they can't just fly away
D a
They're going to stay on earth their job to do
E e7
The task is not too great
D e
When the cup slips from your hand
C#m d
And the world slips from your mind
E
You can fall into a dream
Bm e e6 e7
You don't have to know that they're here all the time

Your guardian angels are not a distant thing
They're not celestial spheres, saints or seers
Or heavenly bells that ring
But they'll never let you down
We're all down here anyway
They might slip up now and again
But their love for you will never slip away (intsrumental)

(e7) a amaj7
Your guardian angels look at them look at them cry
D a e7
Cause they're flesh and blood they're not free to drift into the sky
A d a d a d
Your guardian angels your guardian angels your guardian angels

A little feeling in my gut that I get of late
When I think about these cats running the world with hate
I say: something's gotta give

Got the whole world fighting for the Texas tea
Got a little for you, I got a little for me
But the kettle's leaking like a sieve

There's a puddle on the floor
There's a puddle in the sky
The kettle's leaking so much man it's burning my eyes yeah
Can't you just throw that damper out

On the subject of throwing stuff away
I know some deaf men who can't hear a word we say
No matter, No matter how loud we do shout

And I say...

Something's gotta give right now boy
Something's gotta give right now for you
Something's gotta give right now man
Something's gotta give right now

I was reading the newspaper just yesterday
Got the headlines reading God bless the USA
And I thought: God Bless Everyone

God bless the people in New York when they were attacked
God bless the children being bombed there in Iraq
God bless the goddamn junkie with a monkey on his back
God bless everybody under the sun

Cause the world ahead will end if we don't got love
Do your job and pay attention to God above
But eventually the only guarantee will be that the tea in your tank will run dry

Because without love you know there ain't no life
You can duplicate it and bottle it up all you like
But it doesn't mean you're gonna get another try
Get another try boy

Something's gotta give right now boy
Something's gotta give right now P-Yoo
Something's gotta give right now man
Something's gotta give right now

I Said..
Something's gotta give right now boy
Something's gotta give right now (Yeah)
Something's gotta give right now
Something's gotta give right now.....

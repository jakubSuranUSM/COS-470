Don't let your mind do all your walking
Boy you'll stumble every time
That road I seen the devil stalking
Dealin' only with the dyin'

G'on let the door hitem
where my hound dog shoulda bittem
Leave him open, leave em there
I don't care

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me

Then he showed me how he caught ya
Like a fish upon the line
Slow reelin' in he brings you closer
Like a poison that takes its time

Roll over little lady
Back and forth and twice around
You're gonna bleed to get away
There ain't no other way round

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me

Hey, hey little baby
There, there little boy
Where, where little angel
Over here my joy

Hey, hey little baby
There, there little girl
Where, where little angel
Over here my pearl

But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me

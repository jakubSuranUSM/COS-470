Take my hand sweet darlin'
Wipe that smile off your face
I don't love anyone but you
No one can take your place
But sometimes I worry darlin'
The way you seem to hog my love.

Just take what you need
Don't empty out the store
Just take what you need
'Cause I ain't got much more.

Took a stroll in the country
Some peace of mind to find
Wire fences everywhere
No place to rest my mind
Seems like a shame to me
The way some people hog the land.

Just take what you need
Don't empty out the store
Just take what you need
'Cause I ain't got much more.

Took a look in the paper
While tryin' to eat a bite
You know I read the evenin' news
And lost my appetite
Some have the nerve to ask
For more respect from you and me.

Just take what you need
Don't empty out the store
Just take what you need 
'Cause I ain't got much more.

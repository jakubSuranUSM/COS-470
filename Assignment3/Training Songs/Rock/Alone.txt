Hung around here, just waiting to go home
The earth is dark and cold and I think I now know
You give yourself away, this ends alone
But I wonder, I wonder

Who gave you all your jewels, what made you sell your rights
(And you say that you have the right to turn your back on me)
When did you know you’d forget that once you tried to fight
(And you claim that this is not your responsibility)
We grow older in this skin, We grow older in this skin
(For the ones that you placed here)
But the day you say you know your own way
(For the ones that you left here)
Is the day the blood begins to drip from our fingers
As we cling to the earth
It’s Pitiful

But now I know what it’s like to be alone

Make it shorter for the radio
The song rides, the parasite
Make it shorter for the radio (she said)
Keep it clean don't be political
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Look in her eyes, she'll give you cataracts (she said)
Sell her your sole you get your money back
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

Just keep on walking on the side of the road that you started on
Questioning water, under the bridge is freezing
And eyeballs, facing the wind are bleeding
And why I'm, instinctively violent..
Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh

The song rides, the parasite
Maybe we really shouldn't let her go (He said)
Change your mind don't be so cynical
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

What were you thinking being ethical? (My friend)
Just close your eyes, get economical
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh

Were crossing over to the side of the road that the party's on
Questioning water, under the bridge is freezing
And eyeballs facing the wind are bleeding
And why I'm, instinctively violent

Wooh Wooh (x3)
Were crossing over to the side of the road that the party's on
Questioning water, under the bridge is freezing
And eyeballs facing the wind are bleeding
And why I'm, instinctively violent

Why I'm sadistically silent
Wooh Wooh (x4)

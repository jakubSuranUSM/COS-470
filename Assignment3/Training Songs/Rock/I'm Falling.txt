If I had the time to look hard at you
The things I know I'd find
The things I'd have to do 
And sometimes I wonder 
Oooh I'm falling
What else can I say
Oooh I'm falling
Fading away 
If I had the peace of mind
Oooh I'd catch a plane and move away
Far away from you and the things you say
And sometimes I love ya 
Oooh I'm falling
What else can I say
Oooh I'm falling
Fading away 
If I had your dreams 
Oooh I'd have everything
Time has taken mine 
And left me these songs to sing
And sometimes I wonder 
Oooh I'm Falling
What else can I say
Oooh I'm Falling
Fading away 
Can you see me 
Feet off the ground
Can you feel me
Head spinnin' 'round 
Oooh I'm falling
What else can I say
Oooh I'm falling
Fading away

Bite the thorn that pierce the skin
Come back down to earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
You disconnect the telephone line

Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Get away
Gotta get away
'Fore the Lord gonna make me stay

All that I know
Shoulda been
Coulda been
Mine

I killed the last way out of this
Persuaded by a deceitful kiss

That said you better stay
Said you better stay
Better stay
Said you better stay
'fore it's all gone
Gone away

All that I know...(repeat)

Bite the thorn that pierce the skin
Come back down to earth again
The cold is creeping deep inside
You disconnect the telephone line

Gotta get away
'Fore I lose my mind
Said you better stay
'Fore it's all gone
Gone away

All that I know 
All that I know

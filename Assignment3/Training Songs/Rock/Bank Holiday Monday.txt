Bank Holiday Monday
You don't have a lot to say
You're waiting for payday
You can't wait to get away
This boring town gets you down
There's no one to come around

Why wait in for someone
Who is not as good as you?

Railway station
Train on the eastbound track
Girls without make up
Keeping me coming back
When you're old you can't be told
That anywhere is paved with gold

Why wait in for something
That's not as good as you?

You must take heart
You're heading for the sky
You don't have to ask why
Wystan Hugh Auden
John Winston Ono Lennon 
Left middle England 
Where they suffocate everything
They got away and so could you
What else is there to do?

Why wait in for something
That's not as good as you?

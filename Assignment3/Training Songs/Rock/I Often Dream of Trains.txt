I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise, or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity, or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains till it gets light
Summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves falls so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock, exactly what I'm dreading

I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor, I'm waiting for you baby...

Oh you're divine
Oh you're divine
Oh, oh, did I tell you you're divine
Oh, oh, oh did I ever when you were alive
Did it hurt when you bled
Did it, oh lover boy I'll feed the head
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth my love was open wide
Singing oh you were going to be my life
Damn it oh, oh you were going to be my life
Did you sing happy day
Singing it
Sing it that time I went away
Got to ease my aching head
Do you know
No other way cut off your legs oh

Oh, 
Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy I'll feed the head
No you must no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again
And I, I might as well be dead
But I could kill you instead

Put the top down on this old Mustang
Buy us a bottle of wine
Head up north to see the old gang
I want to see some friends of mine
I want to see some friends of mine
True loving people whose hearts are kind
Find that little town that's in the back of my mind

[CHORUS:]
Oklahoma nights I will never forget you
Oklahoma, the wind comes sweepin'
Through a sky full of lights
While he's a singin' of an airless flight
Put the lamp in a window, lead me back
Lead me back to those Oklahoma nights
Oklahoma nights

When we get back to the old barn dance
We'll hear that Rock-a-billy band
Singin' about some long lost romance
And we'll know we're home again
Yes we'll know we're home again
With Panhndle people who understand
Dry a little tear from the back of my hand

Oklahoma nights I will never forget you
Oklahoma the wind comes sweepin'
Through a sky full of lights
While he's singin' of an airless flight
Put the lamp in a window mama, turn it up bright
Lead me back to those Oklahoma nights
Oklahoma nights
Oklahoma nights

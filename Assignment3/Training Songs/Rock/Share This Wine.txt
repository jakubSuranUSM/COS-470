From this chair I see the sun 
Bathe me in shadows of Commission flats
Though the cold does touch my arm
I turn to face the fire on telly
A generation with our hands in blood
Like all the generations gone before
And though we thought we learnt our lessons 
It seems we learnt them too well 
So darling share this wine with me
We'll be together on the eve of World War III 
And will the children that have grown so high 
In the back of our minds - slip through our fingers like oil
I think I must have seen a thousand films 
Where all the boys come back from Vietnam 
And when they said they'd purged their conscience 
For a second I thought they meant it 
So in the congress hear them plead
And try and carve their words in history 
Though we all fear the loss of life
Our leaders fear the rise in global petrol prices 
So darling share this wine with me
We'll be together on the eve of World War III 
And will the children that have grown so high 
In the back of our minds - slip through or fingers like oil
So darling share this wine with me
We'll be together on the eve of World War III 
And will the children that have grown so high 
In the back of our minds - slip through or fingers like oil

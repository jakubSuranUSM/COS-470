I've got the wherewithal to be impolite
If i come looking for you
Instead of being later in a mini for two
That car was never tested,
And neither were you
I can't believe you keep in touch
With computer brood
Even if we're so unanxious ,
What've you got to lose?
You were not arrested,
We were never that crude
Just interested,
But you've forgotten who's who

Chorus
But something's got to give,
It's up to me to build the bridge
While the season turns the screw
It's only heresay,
But who the hell are you?
Time to hang up the boots
Take the usual route
Ditch the suit
Slimelight... like they can do better than you
Run with the usual crew
Massive, a big up, to who?

Five stars is unsurpassable (three stars is undulating)
Four stars is unbelievable (two stars is uninspiring)
But you get no stars

Repeat chorus

Five stars is unsurpassable
Four is unbelievable
Three stars is undulating
Two stars is uninspiring
One star is unpalatable

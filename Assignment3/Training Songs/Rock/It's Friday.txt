There's a place in town where we all hang out
Where the country girls go and the boys get loud
Yeah when the whistle blows we make quite the crowd
When the sun sets low on Friday

From the pubs in Ireland to Tennessee
From the west coast down to myrtle beach
And every little town here in between
We know how to party on Friday

And the band plays on and the taps they flow
The boss man's yelling but we've all gone home
A come a Monday morning I will return
But tonight ain't Monday it's Friday

Well I like my job but I love my friends
So you know where I'll be when the work week ends
At the little country tavern just around the bend
When the sun sets low on Friday

And the band plays on and the taps they flow
The boss man's yelling but we've all gone home
A come a Monday morning I will return
But tonight ain't Monday it's Friday

There's a place in town where we all hang out
Where the country girls go and the boys get loud
Yeah when the whistle blows we make quite the crowd
When the sun sets low on Friday

And the band plays on and the taps they flow
The boss man's yelling but we've all gone home
A come a Monday morning I will atone
But tonight ain't Monday it's Friday
But tonight ain't Monday it's Friday
But tonight ain't Monday it's Friday

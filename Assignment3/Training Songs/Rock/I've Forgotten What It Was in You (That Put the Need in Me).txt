You wanna talk about devotion
You wanna talk about true love
After the moment of emotion
It?s kinda hard to keep the mood up

Well look into my eyes
And tell me what you see, darling
I've forgotten what it was in you
That put the need in me

Your arms were like a little paradise
But your arms have changed
And the flicker of a good love?s fire
Has seen brighter days

When we've said every line
And played out every scene
I've forgotten what it was in you
That put the need in me

Well honey you and I
We had the sweetest thing
And we can try and try and try
But somethin? ain't the same

don't look me in the eye
?Cause I'm the one to blame
I've forgotten what it was in you
That put the need in me

who'd ever thought that I
Would have the guts to change
We could try to live a lie
You'd hate me just the same

Oh, honey please don't cry
I'm sorry and ashamed
But I've forgotten what it was in you
That put the need in me

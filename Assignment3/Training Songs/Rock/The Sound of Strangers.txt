No more
Going for the more familiar
No more
The nervous anxious grin
No more
Turning away from the peculiar
No more
Afraid of letting anyone in
[Chorus]
Oh, the sound of strangers
Clawing at the door
Oh... The sound of strangers
Doesn't scare me anymore
No more
The fear of making the wrong impression
No more
Sitting on the edge of my chair
No more
Looking for approval on a quick decision
No more
Watching me from over there
[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]

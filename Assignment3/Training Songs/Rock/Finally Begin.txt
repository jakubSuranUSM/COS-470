Holding out, she knows what I'm about
I start to play the silent card
You make this easy or you play me like a shark
Arms folded, nose to the floor
If it's got to be a leap of faith

I wish somebody'd push me
That way I'd know who to blame
When we go out tonight
I'll be looking so far past the flashing lights

Finally open my arms wide
Finally I let you inside
Finally made it past the end
To finally begin

Weigh the pros but the cons come first
I've got a black belt in doubt
I get claustrophobic
All these open doors around
Still the pros are the hardest to ignore

I've never felt this light before
I took off my sunglasses
And waited for the words
When we go out tonight
I'll be looking so far past the flashing lights

Where and when
The hours we keep, the days we save
They add up to years, now face to face
With you by my side, now I can stand, to finally begin

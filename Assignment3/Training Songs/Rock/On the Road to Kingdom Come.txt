The Smoke Witch says, "Wahoo!"
And the Wise Man says, "Me too!"
And the Guru says, "Wazoo!"
So do what you do!

The priests stand in their pulpits
The Pope sits on his throne
The parishes are empty
And the choirboys on their own
Until the second coming
Yes, they're leaving us alone
And God in His heaven
Has decided to keep mum

'Cause He's just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Pity Mr. President
He can't do a thing
He says everywhere he went
We tried to make him sing
Our lonely White House resident
Says we should have made him King
Maybe then he could have saved us
From the truth we were hiding from

But he is just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one

The General's in his game room
But his Soldier won't salute
Ever since he was promoted
He can't pop his chute
His shrink says he is paranoid
'Bout communistic roots
So unfurl the flag boys
Start beating his drum

Yes we've got to get another straggler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one
He's another one

And the Smoke Witch says, "Wahoo!"
And the Wise Man says, "Me too!"
And the Guru says, "Wazoo!"
So do what you do!

Wow! The lead singers raucous
As he screams out the truth
Then the band hold a caucus
And decides to sell their youth

Our Manager he'll hawk us
As along as we're uncouth
And we'll call it revolution
But we'll crank out Bubble Gum
'Cause there's the margin doom for travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Grampa swung into the orgy
It was his last hope
He was dressed to the nines
In deodorant and scope
And they found him a woman
She brought vaseline and soap
Well it started out exciting
But it ended up ho hum
She said, "I thought that you could take me
All the way to Kingdom Come"
When all is said and done
He's just another one grampa

So Billy sells hot sermons
And cold wars through the mails
While Mr. Big is selling out
His business never fails
And King Kennedy like Chaucer's
Chasing Canterbury Tales
And though my brain is still a virgin
The rest of me is well done
Don't you know we're all just travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And just a, just a, just another one
When all is said and done
Yeah just another one

And the Smoke Witch says, "Wahoo!"
And the Wise Man says, "Me too!"
And the Guru says, "Wazoo!"
So do what you do!

Do what you do!
Do what you do!
Do what you do!

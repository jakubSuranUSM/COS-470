Away, away foul dreams
You're gonna listen now to me
No rules, or in-betweens
You're gonna listen now to me
Waste all your time on another kind of boy (whoa)
I faint up on the line, [?] are out of count

Come on along on an eastern show
Come on along, oh my
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, oh my (my)

Inside the drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

Your mind affection drew
You're gonna listen now to me
What's done, what's left as [?]
You're gonna listen now to me

Come on along on an eastern show
Come on along, oh my
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, oh my (my)

Inside, the drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
To [?]
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
No more, no more, no more

'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
(Don't you ever be afraid)
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
'Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
'Cause I will bang this drum

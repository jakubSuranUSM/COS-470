True love I hear them take you away But you could be home in a day 
And let the hammer fall 
Alone because my friends have places to go 
My people have people to know 
They'll never seem so alone 

I'm taking it easy if it comes to fate 
But for the time I've gotta wait 

Soothe your bones 
With the papers of a man that you know 
His kids are really gonna grow 
And leave their daddy home 
But it's an easy game 
Those clouds bring heavy, heavy rain 
And lifting is an awful lot of pain 
We're gonna be sore for sure 

I'm takin' it easy if it comes to fate 
But for the time I've gotta wait

Hello my friend
Can't sleep again
Got too much on my mind
It's half past three
You're calling me
Just to make everything alright
Can't see the light
Heat of the night
Tired of feeling so wrong
Well, I've been there
And it's not fair
But you just gotta live, live on
Yeah, you gotta live on
Another day
Well, your luck is bound to change
It might be cold out
But you just hold out
The sun is gonna shine your way
I know it's true
I'm living proof
The road is hand and long
If I could find a way
I'd take your place
But, you just gotta live on
Oh, live on
You gotta live on
Oh, another day
Yeah, your luck is bound to change
It might be cold out
But you just hold out
The sun is gonna shine your way
I know it's true
I'm living proof
The road is hand and long
If I could find a way
I'd take your place
But, you just gotta live on
Oh, live on, yeah, you gotta live on
Oh, live on

Like a jew in ancient Spain
And for Christ's name did pay with pain
Modern day inquisition 
What is the link between these cafts?
Doctors and thieves, they both 
wear masks
Overpaid meat magicians

Life is killing me

You doctorate and P.h.D.
Would wipe ass etched in fesces
Will not cure you affliction
Doctors Jeckyll and Mengele
And your face too, they're just a blur
Can't prove my condition

Life is killing me

Appointment made, waited three hours
Did not realize you had such power
I'd rather see a mortician
Your parents saved or had the bucks
Your education stems from luck
A Red Cross from hell? - the hospital!

Just let me die with dignity
It's not suicide, simply mercy

Just who do you think you are?
Medical school don't make you God
Now I don't care what you've been taught
Just get me off this life support

Just let me die with dignity
It's not suicide, simply mercy

Life is killing me

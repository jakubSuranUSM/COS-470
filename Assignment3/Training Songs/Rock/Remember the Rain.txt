E 
Angel that you are
          G#m
You still remember summer walks
          F#m          B                      E
And quiet talks we had before our clouds were broken
E
In the heaven of your mind
             G#m
Your hopeful heart has put behind
        F#m          B                     E
All the ugly jealous times our hearts were aching
Am                          E
Now that your pain has been mended
Am                     E
You're only seeing one side
Am                      E
Behind the bright easy laughter
Am                        E
Rivers of tears have been cried
E                F#m
So remember the rain
B7                    E 
When you think of the sunshine
       A
You've got to try and see
            G#m
That's it's gone for you and me
             F#m       B7            E
And there is no way to bring it back again
E                                G#m
In a sad unstable way I love you more than I can say
         F#m             B            E
But it's locked in yesterday and must remain there
E
The gentle prisoner in the stall
          G#m
Sometimes forgets the very walls
              F#m            B              E
That gave her shelter in the fall have also chained her
Am                       E
Drink from the spring of tomorrow
Am                        E
Yesterday's well has gone dry
Am                      E
All the good times are behind us
Am                        E
Whenever you ask yourself why
                  F#m  B7                    E
Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
       A                           G#m
On the ocean of a smile we floated easy for awhile
              F#m            B7                  E
But now we're drifted to the shore where beauty dies
E
It isn't easy to explain
        G#m  
I never dreamed you felt the same
         F#m                  B                  E
And even though you're not to blame we can't continue
E                                         G#m
Don't let yourself pretend that we've got something to defend
              F#m             B                   E
You've got to try to face the end with all that's in you
Am                  E
I can't deny that I love you
Am                           E
But my soul can no longer be bound
Am                       E 
Fly on the wings of your freedom
        Am                   E
But whenever you look to the ground
                  F#m  B7                    E
Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
A                           G#m
Try to understand that it's fallen from our hands
            F#m                B7                 E
And just be thankful that your soul is still your own

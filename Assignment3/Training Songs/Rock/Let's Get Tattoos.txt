Once in a blue, your dreams come true
If someone's looking out for you
So party on dude, let's buy some booze
Go downtown and get tattoos

Then go ahead and have good cry
Do it now before you die
Soothe your temper, wash your eyes
And give your lungs some exercise

Then get your brush
And we'll paint the town
A lighter shade of gray and brown
And it won't mean a thing

And in round two we'll fight like Ali
And by the end of the second round
We'll be singing, you and whose army
Are gonna stop us now

That's the way I felt today
I didn't feel it yesterday
Tomorrow, I just couldn't say
It never comes here anyway

And when the clouds obscure the moon
And normal service is resumed
It won't mean a thing

Because in round two we fought like Ali
And by the end of the second round
We were singing, you and whose army
Are gonna stop us now

Once in a blue, your dreams come true
If someone's looking out for you
So party on dude, let's buy some booze
Go downtown and get tattoos

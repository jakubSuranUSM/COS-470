Sarah
Oh
I need you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Sarah
Oho
Gotta have you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Another restless night without you
Secret feelings locked away
I close my eyes and think about you
I memorize each word you say.
Oh
Emotions tear me apart
Thoughts never spoken are here in my heart.
Sarah
Oh
I need you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Sarah
Oho
Gotta have you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Hey
You take my breath away.
Every day you pass beside me
Never once you look my way.
The inner conflict that's inside me
To try and find some words to say.
Emotions tear me apart
Thoughts never spoken are here in my heart. . . .
Sarah
Oho
Oh
I need you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Sarah
Oho
Gotta have you
Sarah
You take my breath away.
Hey
You take my breath away.

The first hand offers the hand the first hand
The second hand offers the hand the second hand

Door flew
Metal world melt down
Fortune
Metals and flag naps

In the fuze
I build myself up
From a language called real time
With physical flakes and molecules

Information machines
Closing the casket
How do you spell heaven?

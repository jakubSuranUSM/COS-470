Flying high at speed of sound
On the night bus, heading out
I'll call you now
We'll meet on streets, and we'll run around
Leave everyone behind
The name-droppers and the unkinds
And we'll meet our friends
Blue plastic bags, full of cans
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand

But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh superman
Oh superman
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no

Feel my guilt(?) when the light pulls in fast
Hopes for the days are gone, and the hour's passed
Not a fighting change
Comic ideas of the future
How to jump home now, with a single bounce
And we'll laugh out loud
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand

But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh superman
Oh superman
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no

I don't ever wanna stop
You could not have made it up
Who'll catch me when I drop
And stop me falling
Is this every gonna stop
Can you catch me when I drop
I know there'll never be no superman
Like hooded ghosts, we don't make a sound
Feel the earth pull us, hand in hand

But if I fall off this cloud
If I fall off, oh superman
Oh superman
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no
I don't wanna hit the ground
I don't wanna hit the ground
Oh superman
Oh superman
Oh no

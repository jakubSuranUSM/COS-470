Sometimes these words don't have to be said,
I know how you both feel,
The hurt can rule the head,
Jealousy is an essential part of love,
The heart in here bellow,
And the emptiness above,

There's always something left behind,
There's always something left behind,
Nevermind,
Oh nevermind,

The tender caress as love brings out the man
I can't still be drunk at five
Oh, I guess I still can
Slowly your beauty is eaten away
Buy the sense of someone else
In the blanket where we lay

There's always something left behind
There's always something left behind
Maybe next time

Uneaten meals
A lonely star
A welcome ride in a neighbors car
A long walk home
In the pouring rain
I fell asleep when you never came
Some rare delight in Manchester town
It took six hours before you let me down
To see it all in a drunken kiss
A strangers hand on my favorite dress

That was my favorite dress you know
That was my favorite dress

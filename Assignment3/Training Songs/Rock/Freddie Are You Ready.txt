Taking me home to my love one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her
And do I ever need her lovin'
Do I need it, yes indeed 

Oh, I got a problem
Think I know what's wrong
I think I picked it up in old Finnsp√•ng
You take a slice or two
It'll make you sigh
And just a second while I kiss this guy 

Inhibition, well you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky
It will mess your suit, it will make you cry
It doesn't matter, give me Mumdane pie 

None of my friends treat me mean
Hoping you know to change that scene 

Freddie are you ready 

Taking me home to my love one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her
And do I ever need her lovin'
Do I need it, yes indeed 

Oh, I got a problem
And I don't know why
I think I picked it up in old Shanghai
You take a slice or two
It'll make you sigh
And just a minute while I kiss this guy 

Inhibition, well you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky
It will mess your suit, it will make you cry
It doesn't matter, give me Mumdane pie Now that I treat my friends so mean
Hoping you know to change that scene 

Oh, I got a problem
And I don't know why
I think I picked it up in old Shanghai
You take a slice or two
It'll make you sigh
And just a second while I slapp this guy 

Inhibition, well you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky
It will mess your suit, it will make you cry
It doesn't matter, give me Mumdane pie 

None of my friends treat me mean
Hoping you know to change that scene 

Freddie are you ready 

Taking me home to my love one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her
And do I ever need her lovin'
Do I need it, yes indeed 

Do I ever need her
Do I ever need her loving

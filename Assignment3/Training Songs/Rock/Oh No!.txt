Don't do love, don't do friends,
I'm only after success.
Don't need a relationship,
I'll never soften my grip.

Don't want cash, don't want card,
Want it fast, want it hard.
Don't need money, don't fame,
I just wanna make a change.
I just wanna change, I just wanna change, I just wanna change, I just wanna change, I just wanna change.

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be.
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine.
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy.
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh.

One track mind, one track heart,
If I fail, I'll fall apart.
Maybe it is all a test,
I always feel like I'm the worst,
So I always act like I'm the best.

If you are not very careful,
Your possessions will possess you.
T.v. taught me how to feel,
Now real life has no appeal.
It has no appeal, it has no appeal, it has no appeal, it has no appeal,
It has no appeal.

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be.
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine.
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy.
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh.

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be.
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine.
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy.
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh.

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly,
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly,
I'm gonna fail, gonna die, die, die, die.

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be.
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine.
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy.
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh.

I know exactly what I want and who I want to be.
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine.
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy.
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh.

Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh-no, oh!

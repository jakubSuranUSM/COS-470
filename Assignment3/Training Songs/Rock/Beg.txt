There's a lit cigaretteâ?¦in the hand of my new angel
She's blowing smoke like halos, and now everybody wants her
But I shouldn't even bother
Because you made me so complete dear, but you left me so alone here
Hang a noose for my new sinner somewhere everyone can see it

Won't you beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure (risking failure)
Go run for cover (for how long)
You better start to love her so much you're moving on and on

Now there's a whole wide world...that wants to know
Have cheap hotels lost their turn-on? she's bathing in the neon
And she's polluting all the airways while I'm passed out in the hallway
And you left me so in love here, you left with so much hate dear
Was I creating only chaosâ??this world lives just fine without usâ?¦won't you?

Beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure (risking failure)
Go run for cover (for how long)
You better start love her so much you're moving on and on

Will it change your life if I change my mind?
When she's lit the whole wide world
I want to know if you will beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure, (risking failure) but I'd hope you set your levels (for how long)
So you can run for cover
You better start to love her
Now are we this pathetic? you made me finally see it
(Will it change your life when I change my mind, will it change your mind when I change my life)

Go run for cover
You better start to love her so much you're moving on
I'm so pathetic, you made me finally see it
Got what you want? I'm gone

For how long? for how long? for how long will it change your life?

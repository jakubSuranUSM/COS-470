I have spent some heavy nights
Like every sailor

And I know some seedy ways to spend my pay
I've been arrested in the streets

I've been drunk along the beaches of Marseilles
And you know that when I left
I said I loved you

But you think I've got a girl in every town
When the hidden harbor whores
Whisper softly from their doors

I turn them down
Mona
Will you help me to unload my contraband?
I've been saving it for you
I've ignored the crimson daughters on the quays of Amsterdam

And that's not an easy thing to do
I keep away from the girls in San Francisco

'cause I know my self-control won't last for long
And a man could lose his head
With a little help from the hookers of Hong Kong
And as I sail across these endless oceans
I think of you each mile along the way

And I tell myself this boat I am sailing on
Will bring me back one day
Mona will you help me to unload my contraband?
I've been saving it for you
I've ignored the crimson daughters on the quays of Amsterdam

And that's not an easy thing to do

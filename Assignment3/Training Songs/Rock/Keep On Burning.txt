You've given me a headstart
I'm brewing up a brainstorm
And we leave the grunges far behind
In the quagmire of the unkempt minds

'Cause its got no style, no elequence
No elegance no sexuality
All it takes is common sense for anyone to see

As the world keeps turning
You got to keep on learning
You got to keep on yearning
You got to keep on burning

As the world keeps turning
You got to keep on learning
You got to keep on yearning
You got to keep on burning
You got to keep on burning

You're throwing me a lifeline
The way you're looking so fine, sublime
From the youngsters who've just learned to shave
To the oldsters raving on their graves

Its the same old story, Englands glory
Claiming back the Union Jack, my arse
Got to prove it together now
To counteract this class

As the world keeps turning
You got to keep on learning
You got to keep on yearning
You got to keep on burning

As the world keeps turning
You got to keep on learning
You got to keep on yearning
You got to keep on burning
You got to keep on burning
Burning

You won't get far in a cable car
You reach the top then you had to stop
When you jump back down to the underground
You've a train to catch, you've plans to hatch
So lift the latch on the clubhouse door
There's a thousand souls out on the floor

Keep turning
And you got to keep on learning
And You got to keep on yearning
And You got to keep on burning

As the world keeps turning
You got to keep on learning
You got to keep on yearning
You got to keep on burning
You got to keep on burning

You got to keep on burning
Burning, burning, burning
You got to keep on burning
Burning, burning, burning

And by the way, I'm sorry for calling you loose
Oh, well, but look who you chose to seduce
OK, well, none of those things I said were true
Now I regret, continuing with the pretense
Because it just doesn't make any sense
Because I'd still like to be, well, friends with you
So please don't ignore me, that'd be really the end
I just lost a lover, I don't want to lose a friend
That would be careless
That would be careless
But I'm not still in love with you
No, I'm not still in love with you
And I'm sure that together we can make this work
As long as I stop being a jerk
As long as you stop indulging his every whim
Because I know I could put up with all of this mess
Just to see you wearing that dress
You know I'll be here when you're through with him
No please don't ignore me, that'd be really the end
I just lost a lover, I don't want to lose a friend
That would be careless
That would be careless
But I'm not still in love with you
No, I'm not still in love with you
That would be careless
That would be careless
But I'm not still in love with you
No, I'm not still in love with you

Late like the evening sun, I
I sink to the ground.
But I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down.

'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights
I am the beckon to your call.
And like the early morning headlines,
I am all too predictable.
I am all too predictable.

(Oh oh oh-oh.)

You're steady as I come undone, you
You're quietly bound.
But I'll keep my promises, I
I won't let you down.

'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights,
I am the beckon to your call.
And like the early morning headlines,
I am all too predictable.
Yeah, I am all too predictable.

True like the first born,
Weighed pound for pound.
I'll keep my promises, like
A thorn in your crown.
Yeah!

'Cause like a rabbit in your headlights,
I am the beckon to your call.
Just say jump, I'll say "How high?"
'Cause I'm all too predictable.
Yeah I'm all to predictable.

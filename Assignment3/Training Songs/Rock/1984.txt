Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life?

1984
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life?

Someone will be waiting for you at your door
When you get home tonight
Ah yes, he's gonna tell you darkness gives you much more
Than you get from the light

Classic plastic guards well they're your special friend
He sees you every night
Well he call himself the brother but you know it's no game
You're never out of his sight

1984
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life?

It's time you started thinking inside your head
That you should stand up and fight
Oh just where will you be when your freedom is dead
Won't you listen tonight?

Those classic plastic coppers, they are your special friends
They see you every night
Well they call themselves protection but they know it's no game
You're never out of their sight

1984
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run?

1984
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run?

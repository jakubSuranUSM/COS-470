Cast me adrift on a dream
I promise to sail it till I know what it means
And send me your name on the tide
I promise to wear it as a badge inside...
You know, now I know, you know, now I know
Further out, further in, further out, further in... further
Take me away from this place

I promise to leave you when I see your face
So please call my name when it's time
I know I'm impatient but is that a crime?
You know, now I know, you know, now I know
Further you, further in, further out, further in... 
Further... further...
Epiphany... wait on me... epiphany... wait on me, woooooh...
Cast me adrift on a dream
I promise to sail it till I know what it means
And send me your name on the tide
I promise to wear it as a badge inside...
You know, now I know, you know, now I know
Further out, further in, further out, further in...
Further... further... further... further...

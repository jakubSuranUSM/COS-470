Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who turn the fires and who still till the earth

When I see these crowd of faces
A swirling mass of black and gray and white
They look so real to me
But they look so much [Incomprehensible]

Raise your glass to the hard working people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay at home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
See the parading of gray suited grafters
The world is charming and they don't want to know

And when I see these crowd of faces
A swirling mass of gray and black and white
They look so real to me
And they look so much [Incomprehensible]

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

I would rather hide behind you
Or stand in your eclipse
The sun does not move me like it used to...
Neither do you

And Greenland I am with you...
I was once unwanted.
In the front seats all with strangers
I too was Earths ceiling.
I lost all feeling.

And now I'm in you shadow
I am motionless
I am black

I'll be a crash landing who can change
The landscape talking
And when I begin to stutter
The land will be shaking
God will be clapping

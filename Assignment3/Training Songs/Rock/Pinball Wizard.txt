Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist.
How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?

Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see lights-a-flashin',
He plays by a sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n never tilts at all.
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ.
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand.

Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!

Even on my usual table, he can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard, his score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!  He's scoring more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!  To him!

The girl in the chair with the long golden hair
Well that used to be me
A flirtatious smile unpredictably wild
Always trying to please

I was always walking one step ahead
Or so I thought until the monster crawled into my bed
Rewind and erase that shock look on your face 'cause your Mona Lisa is dead
A million words a thousand days

The girl I used to be has a terrible case of mistaken identity
And yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

The sun likes to rise and the moon likes to fall
And that's kinda like my life
I've played the role of the nice girl next door who gets cut like a knife

Now I'm not looking for apology eyes
And I don't want to spend a night on a bed of beautiful lies
Erase and rewind leave that sick girl behind and fast forward, fast forward
A thousand days

The girl I used to be has a terrible case of mistaken identity
And yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

That's not me, it's just not me
That's not me

The girl that I, the girl I used to be has a terrible case of mistaken identity
And yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

The girl I used to be has a terrible case of mistaken identity
And yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity

What good is it
If I can't even sing it to you
What good is it
If I can't even come out and sing it to you right now
'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along

'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along

What good is it
If I can't even bring it to you
What good is it
If I can't even come out and bring it to you right now
'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along

'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along

Do you miss me darlin'
Sunday afternoon,
Do you miss me darlin'
Monday, Tuesday too
Do you miss me darlin'
Friday morning, noon,
Do you miss me darlin'
Will you see me soon

What good is it
If I can't even sing it to you
What good is it
If I can't even come out and bring it to you right now
'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along

'Cause talkin' won't do it
And walkin' won't rush it along
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you miss me darlin'?

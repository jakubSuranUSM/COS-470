I'm spending my time,
Walking spirals in line,
Did I ever honestly believe,
A change of mind,
And then a change of position,
Only action no reaction no,
This time is mine, together we can't spend it anyway,
Nothing is gonna change nothing is ever gonna change

And I'm a trigger,
You're my gun
Don't you wanna come,
Don't you taste the times that come,
Back and forth in one,
Don't you wanna come,
If I could take you to a better place

She is a monument,
And everyone is talking,
Like a vision it's all crystal clear,
A change of mind and then a change of position,
Did we ever honestly believe,
Watching dead bodies and bombs falling from the sky,
Nothing's gonna change, nothing is ever gonna change

And I'm a trigger,
You're my gun,
Don't you wanna come,
Don't you taste the times that come,
Back and forth in one

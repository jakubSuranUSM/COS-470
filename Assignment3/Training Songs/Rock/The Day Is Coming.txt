You need it, that's for sure
You receive, but always want more
Take it for granted, this lifetime and what's up ahead
But the day is coming

The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has come

Bang bang, on the door
You opened, not knowing what for
If opportunity, rears its head
Will you answer, or stay home in bed

Hey babe
'Cause the day is coming
The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has come

Hey babe
'Cause the day is coming
The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has come

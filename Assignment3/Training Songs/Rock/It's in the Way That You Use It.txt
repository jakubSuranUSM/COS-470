It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

Nobody's right until somebody's wrong
Nobody's weak until somebody's strong
No one gets lucky until luck comes along
Nobody's lonely until somebody's gone

It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this

It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

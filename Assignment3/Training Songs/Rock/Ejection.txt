There's only one course of action
Left for me to take
I've tried every switch selection
That might control this state
I think for my protection
I'd better make it straight
Into ejection
Better tell base, ejection
That I think it's a case for ejection 
Blown into space, ejection
Protect my face, ejection

The radar screen's projection
Tells me I'm too late
To make a course correction
I'm about to meet my fate
No time for reflection
I'd better make it straight
Into ejection
Bust through the sky, ejection 
The air rushing by, ejection 
It's a case of goodbye, ejection 
I'm too fast to die
Ejection 

When a ship meets with destruction
The captain stays to drown
But no tin contraption
Is going to drag me down
My reference intersection
Tells me that I'm bound
For ejection 
Eight times my weight, ejection 
Got to escape, ejection 
Only one move to make, ejection 
Abandon this crate, ejection 
Abandon this crate, ejection

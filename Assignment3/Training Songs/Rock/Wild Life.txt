Save me 'cause I've been thinking 'bout you all the time
I feel there's a part of you that wants me wild
Taste you, do you dare to let me come inside?
Love you, yeah, I'll love you everyday tonight

I can't wait for your invitation
Yeah, I'm just here on my own vacation
And you don't need no explanation
It's my wild life

I don't care if you slept with millions
Or if you sing like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby the wild life
(Yeah, the wild life)

Hate me just because I want you really bad
Show me, I will be so good, I'll pay my share
Try you, yeah, tonight it will be you and I
Baby, I will love you till the day I die

I can't wait for your invitation
Yeah, I'm just here on my own vacation
And you don't need no explanation
It's my wild life

I don't care if you slept with millions
Or if you sing like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby, the wild life
(Yeah, the wild life)

I just want you, I just need you
You can't stop now, oh
No, you can't stop now

I can't wait for your invitation
Yeah, I want you to rock my nation
'Cause you don't need no education, baby

I don't care if you slept with millions
Or if you look like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby, the wild life

I don't care if you slept with zillions
Or if you sing like Paris Hilton
Yeah, I want you to show me baby, the wild life

'Cause I'll make, I'll make you understand
I'll make you understand
I'll make you understand
Sometimes I just wake up

I'm down and out now
Sittin' in a stupid chair
Seems that I've been swappin' crap for years

Just a little noddy
Chewin' on my bread
Little scmoozy-woozy want you dead

In a shitty mood
Go away man
Want no rocky talkin' coz I'm screwed
Gotta go gotta go gotta go gotta, gotta go gotta go gotta go

On a loner thing
Go away man
Coz what you say can't make the rock-bell ring
Gotta go........

I've heard your records
And I've read your zines
I've got it up to here but you don't know what I mean
Just a motor-mouthie
With a borin' twist
No-goodnik meant for nothin makin' me so fuckin' pissed

Wanna eat my cheese, wanna read my sleaze
Don't wanna analyze it , shut it coz I'm greased

Life's bitter falling down some
Took the bait I took the ride
Turned the world a lonely side
Found the only silence that he knows
Father will you please let me go
And nothing but love I say will show
Father will you please let me go
There's something before myself I know
You're so far, you're so far away
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me all the things inside
Tell me all the worlds that you've won
You think of me, you think of me so often
You think of me, oh!
You want me to believe it's true, yeah.
Father will you please let me go
And nothing but love I say will show
Father will you please let me go
There's something before myself I know
You're so far, you're so far away
Father will you please let me go
And nothing but love I say will show
Father will you please let me go
There's something before myself I know
You're so far, you're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far away
You're such a lonely man
You're so far away?

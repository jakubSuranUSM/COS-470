You and I are in danger
I don't stay in love that way
And the love of a stranger
Doesn't really make my day

And you know
You have a thousand things in front of you
Doin' anything you like
And takin' it easy
Is all you ever need to do

[Chorus]
You've no ambition and only ever sit around
I don't know why
And you know it's true and you never wanted anything
You're a lucky guy
You're a lucky guy
Oh oh oh, you're lucky

There's a time, and a reason
You could go a long, long way
And for you it's so easy
Yeah, and it's your lucky day

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know
You've no ambition

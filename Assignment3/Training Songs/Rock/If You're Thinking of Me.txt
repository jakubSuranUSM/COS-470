I'm waiting for a friend to come, to help me off the ground
Better come sooner than later, can't stop feeling down
Scattered memories drifting back from my stereo
Of how we dream this could be and how we let it go
If you're thinking of me, you've got to let me know
'Cause loneliness seems such a waste, I can't stop feeling low

I'm searching for the rights, that I've got in my mind
Sympathy and understanding then there is no better time
No one ever shows you how to learn
They'd all stand around and watch you burn

If you're thinking of me, you've got to let me know (Got to let me know)
'Cause loneliness seems such a waste, I can't stop feeling low (Can't stop feeling low)

Oh, ah, (You've got to let me know)
Oh, oh
Oh, ah
Oh, ah

I'm searching for the right reasons that I've got in my mind

Sympathy and understanding then there is no better time
No one ever taught me how to learn
They'd all stand around and watch you burn

If you're thinking of me, you've got to let me know
'Cause loneliness seems such a waste, I can't stop feeling low (Can't stop feeling low)

If you're thinking of me, you've got to let me know (Got to let me know)
'Cause loneliness seems such a waste, I can't stop feeling low (Can't stop feeling low)

Oh ah (I can't stop feeling low)
Oh ah

I'm waiting for a friend to come to help me off the ground
I'm waiting for a friend to come to help me off the ground (Got to let me know)
I'm waiting for a friend to come to help me off the ground
I'm waiting for a friend to come to help me off the ground (Can't stop feeling low)

(Got to let me know)
I'm searching for the right reasons that I've got in my mind
Sympathy and understanding then there is no better time

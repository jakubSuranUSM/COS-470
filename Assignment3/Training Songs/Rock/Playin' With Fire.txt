I could see a strange fire burning up in you 
The first time I looked in your eyes 
I could feel sparks fly dangerous and true 
Straight through this heart of mine 
Now, I ain't afraid to take the things I want 
I don't believe the world is gonna change for me 
So I'll take the love I need 
We were riding high 
Like flames against the sky 
Innocent and wild, we were playin' with fire 
Too hot to touch, you can't call it love 
But it's close enough to be playin' with fire 
We're playin' with fire 
I could see a dark side scratchin' at your soul 
The risk is sweet as the sin 
I feel your lips as they swallow me whole 
Strike like a match on my skin 
And I'm tired of wasting all my precious time 
I love the way I feel when you're in my mind 
It ain't no crime 
We were riding high 
Like flames against the sky 
Innocent and wild, we were playin' with fire 
Too hot to touch, you can't call it love 
But it's close enough to be playin' with fire 
We're playin' with fire 
In the long nights 
We were burnin' 
Caught in a wild fire 
Out of control 
We were riding high 
Like flames against the sky 
Innocent and wild, we were playin' with fire 
Too hot to touch, you can't call it love 
But it's close enough to be playin' with fire 
We're playin' with fire 
We were riding high 
Like flames against the sky 
Innocent and wild, we were playin' with fire 
Too hot to touch, you can't call it love 
But it's close enough to be playin' with fire 
We're playin' with fire

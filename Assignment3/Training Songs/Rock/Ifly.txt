It was a very normal night, I was attending a party
And I had many different drinks made of sweet fermented fruits
I convinced myself of certain little things
I convinced myself on a b-b-bed of strings

That home is just the rent where the goodie kids repent
And the Blu-Tack posters infiltrate my eye

I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
I fucking love you, all of the time
I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
And I wanna make you mine

Well, I remember the first time that I got to kiss you sober
I remember the first time as if it is right now
I was just myself, maybe I was less (Who knows?)
Now I have been both and I'm convinced

That home is on a bus seat, home can go without me
Home can reinvent itself today

I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
I fucking love you, all of the time
I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
And I wanna make you mine

And everybody's birthday signifies their first day
Going it alone in love (In love, in love)

I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
I fucking love you, all of the time
I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
And I wanna make you mine
I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
I fucking love you, all of the time
I fucking love you, I think you're pretty
And I wanna make you mine, all mine, all mine

Here I am
Open-eyed
Lost my mind
Say goodbye

In my mind
I see time
Hope to have
Some peace of mind

De de deh
I'm around this time
And I see
All around the world
And I hope
I'll get by somehow 'cause
I don't know how to fly

Clean out time
Open your eyes
There lies a place in the ground for me
I can wait to be there

We'll get by
Touch and feel
Promise me
For all times

De de deh
I'm around this time
And I see
All around the world
And I hope
I'll get by somehow 'cause
I don't know how to fly

I'm around I'm around
And I see all around this time
And I hope I'll always get by 'cause
I don't know how to fly

We get by
All alone
I'll be here
On my own
Here again
You don't care
We've been
On that road
All alone
And we tried
All the time
Every day
I don't mind
If we stay here
And I'll find
You by, by my side

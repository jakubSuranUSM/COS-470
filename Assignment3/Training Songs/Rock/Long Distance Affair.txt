Long distance affair, can't you hear my heart keeps calling for you 
It's hard to show that I care, it's hard to tell if you want me there 
I call your name, there's no reply, don't you feel the same? 
Can't you hear my heart calling you? 
I got love on the line but I can't get through 
Sometimes love don't seem fair 
Guess I was wrong, thinkin' you would always be there 
I must be dreamin', I thought I had you feelin' the same 
I'm callin' your name 
Long distance affair, with just a spark, you stole my heart from me 
No one ever compared, we'll never touch the memories 
I call your name, there's no reply, don't you feel the same? 
Can't you hear my heart calling you? 
I got love on the line but I can't get through 
Whatever your friends may say, what's it worth to you anyway 
You can listen to them and throw it away, yeah 
If you're thinkin' how it might have been 
Don't think of me like I'm one of them 
'Cause friends like that you got no one at all 
There's love on the line, baby answer the call 
'Cause you know that I love you, can't let go, baby can't you hear my heart 
I keep on calling your name, there's no reply, don't you feel the same? 
Can't you hear my heart calling you? 
I got love on the line but I ain't got you 
Can't you hear my heart calling you? 
I got love on the line but I can't get through to you 
Tell me it's true

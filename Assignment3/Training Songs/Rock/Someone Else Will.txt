So tired of your lying
Take it as it come
You've been hangin' round all weekend
I'm not the only one

If we don't f*ck you
Then someone else will

So had me in the kitchen
You love me in the hall
When you're in the dressing room
You'll f*ck anyone at all

If we don't f*ck you
Then someone else will

At the third stroke
It will be five

So tired of your lying
Take it as it come
You've been hangin' round all weekend
But I'm not the only one

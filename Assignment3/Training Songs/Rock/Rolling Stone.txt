Roll like a roll, like a roll, like a rolling stone
To the feeling of hot and cold

Roll like a roll, like a roll, like a rolling stone
To the feeling of hot and cold

You took my body, you took my body, you took my body home

You took my body, you took my body, you took my body home

It's quite a sight for my sore eyes
And break my heart back into pieces
A city blackout and a sea of white
When all I want is to be alone

Roll like a roll, like a roll, like a rolling stone
To the feeling of hot and cold

Roll like a roll, like a roll, like a rolling stone
To the feeling of hot and cold

You took my body, you took my body, you took my body home

You took my body, you took my body, you took my body home

I said, well, I don't wanna die in the middle of a city
So they wrote on my headstone
Well, I don't wanna die in the middle of a city
No

Well, I awoke in your arms
I awoke, in your arms
I thought I saw
For the very first time
I heard the cries of a child
With the hands of time, not satisfied
How my lungs became ears, became eyes

Well, I awoke in your arms
I awoke, in your arms
I thought I saw
For the very first time
Well, I heard the cries of a child
With the hands of time, not satisfied
How my lungs became ears, became eyes

Roll like a roll, like a roll, like a rolling stone
To the feeling of hot and cold

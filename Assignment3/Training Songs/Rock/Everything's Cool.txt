These eyes see only what they want to see
These ears hear only what they want to hear
These minds think only what they want to think
These lies, these lies

You will find no answers in this head
What you see is what you get
Watch as all the lights go out
Down and out, out for the count

Take your places, choose your sins
Everyone loses, no one wins
I have seen the future and this is how it begins

[Chorus]
In chaos and riots, the screech of machines
No right and no wrong and no in between
Fall one by one, the queen to her fool
Dos dedos mis amigos, everything's cool
Everything's cool

These arms hold whoever needs to be held
These hands take whatever they want to take
These words fake whoever needs to be faked
These lies, these lies

Look for clues inside the baby's head
Hear the words yet to be said
Cue the music, fade to black
No such thing as no payback

Take this line, know where it ends
No return, no make amends
Is this the future or this is how it will end?

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Everything's cool [Repeat x2]

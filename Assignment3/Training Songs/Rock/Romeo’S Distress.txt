Burning crosses on a n*gger's lawn
Burning dollars
What's a house without a home?
Dance in your white sheet glory
Dance in your passion
Talk about sugar on the six fingered beast
Conversation about the holes in your hands
Walking the garden of men's desires
Conversation about the kingdom of fire
Conversation about the kingdom of fire

What's that moving in the basement?
What's that moving in the attic?
Who's that walking in the shadows?
Who's that walking in the streets?

Kiss on my hand
After dark
Hand for a kiss
After dark
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand

Romance in sequence
Harmful to the blind
Burning hearts
Through the top of your skull
Dance in your white sheet glory
Dance in your passion
Your days are numbered
With pretense in your pocket
Your days are numbered
With the love in your eyes
Love in your eyes

Love?

What's that moving in the basement?
What's that moving in the attic?
Who's that lying on the altar?
Who's that lying in the streets?

Kiss on my hand
After dark
Hand for a kiss
After dark
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand

Pull down the sheets
Take off your clothes
Get out of bed
I'm so tired
I'm so tired

Pull down the sheets
And take off your clothes
Get out of bed
I'm so tired
I'm so tired

I'm so tired

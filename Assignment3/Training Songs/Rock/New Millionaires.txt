You can spend a cheque in a morning 
 And go hungry the same afternoon. 
 Sometimes the only quarters between you and a rainstorm 
 Are the quarters of the moon. 
 You know for every one way to sit up 
 There must be five hundred ways to beg. 
 And how can you ever be a man of standing 
 With a chain wrapped around your legs. 
 Just like Arbogast on the top two stairs 
 You're waiting for a carver to come cutting through your cares. 
 Living on your savings, saving up your prayers 
 Come on down, the new millionaires. 
 The famous say walk in their footsteps 
 But don't you go tread on their toes. 
 And if you wait for luck to open up 
 You'll be waiting there to see it close. 
 Well I think it was a viscount 
 Or it might have been a prince 
 When he said enjoy your leisure 
 He did nothing to convince us

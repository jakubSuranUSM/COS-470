We are fresh strawberries
Fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe, turning riper in the bowl
We will soon be rotten
We will all be forgotten
Half remembered rumours of the old

So wouldn't it be easy with
Something to believe in that could
Give us more
Than here's my work
So where's my pay
To buy what I don't need?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe? (To believe?)
To believe? (To believe?)

Thieves believe
Everybody steals
I believe there's nothing to believe
But I'd love the manual
The instruction manual
Oh, liars
Swear that they never lie

Wouldn't it be easy with
Something to believe in that could
Give us more
Than here's my years
So now they're gone
It's time for me to leave
Wouldn't it be easy to believe? (To believe?)
To believe?

Wouldn't it be easy to believe?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe?

We are fresh strawberries
Fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe, turning riper – so…

Wouldn't it be easy?
Something could give us more
But I don't know
No I don't know
I don't know what I need
Wouldn't it be easy
Oh couldn't it be easy
Shouldn't it be easy
To believe?

I met a man, he was a trader
And he did a cargo at 10,000
Over Jordan

Every woman and child in a border town"
For the right to be governed-
Waste them without mercy.
When you've decided - Meet me at the airport

Do it would for God - do it for Allah
Put your faith in Captain Muhmad and Al-Fatah
I met a man - he was a prophet
When you've decided....

Honey swept away her skin
Oh my god they're lining up
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythms
Sweet abandon smells expensive
Eat each finger eat each other
Watch myself there on the bed
Oh my god you're ugly now
Suck me from the outside in
I have changed my reflection
Hollow deep the food's so pretty
Silence is deceiving me
Close your mouth she is the victim
Honey swept away her skin
Watch myself there on the bed
Watch myself they're lining up
Have you everything you need
Oh my god you're ugly now
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythm
Oh my god you're ugly now
Watch myself there on the bed
I have changed my reflection
Hollow deep the food's so pretty
Silence is deceiving me
Close your mouth she is the victim
Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythm
Eat each finger eat each other
Watch myself there on the bed
Sweet abandon smells expensive
Oh my god they're ugly now
Oh my god you're ugly now
Oh my god
Honey swept away her skin
Spoonface Jesus....Spoonface Jesus spitting rhythms
Watch myself there on the bed

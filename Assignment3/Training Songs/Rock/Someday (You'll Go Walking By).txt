Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la
Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la
Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la

Someday you'll go walkin' by
With another guy
I'll try not to cry
(Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la)

You'll be all dressed up in fancy clothes
They'll see me but no one knows
That I'm cryin' for you

We were so happy together
Till you went and got tired of me
You said you'd love me forever
Yeah, but that's past history

Someday you'll walkin' down the aisle
You'll give me that same old smile
But I'll cry all the while
(Ooh we ooh)

Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la
Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la
Ooh we ooh, tra la la la la

Someday you'll go walkin' by
Someday you'll go walkin' by

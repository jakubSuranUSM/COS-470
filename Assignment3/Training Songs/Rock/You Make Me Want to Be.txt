[Chorus:]
You make me want to be a father
Trade my wandering path of freedom
For your soul
Oh and all I once defied
And locked so deep inside
Is on a roller coaster riding out of control

You make me want to be a teacher
Teach that love is all there is
And still there's more
Oh and everywhere I turn
And everything I learn
Shows me there's something new
I've never seen before

Words can only take a thought so far
And I've almost gone as far as I can go
To see each other as we really are
Exploring all around us
As we grow
And we grow
And we grow

You make me want to be a writer
Write this world a crazy love song
For today
Let me glide upon your smile
It beams for miles and miles
Catch it now before it sails away
Oh and words can only take a thought so far
And I guess I've gone as far as I can go
To see each other as we really are
Exploring all around us
As we grow
And we grow
And we grow

[Chorus:]

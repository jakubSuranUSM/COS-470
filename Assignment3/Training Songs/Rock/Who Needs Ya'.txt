Well, it's sunrise on the freeway as I get back from town
Find you standin' in my boots, kickin' my dog around
Oh, empty bottles on the floor, enough to build a monument
Then you've got the nerve to tell me, somebody took the rent

Who needs ya? Think about it baby, who needs you?
Now you can save your lip, just pack your grip
And leave a trail of smoke behind you

Who needs ya? Can you tell me baby, who needs you?
Who needs you? Think about it baby
Well, who needs you? Can you tell me please?

Last week you pulled another of your tricks
You let your brother move in here with a herd of freaks
Yeah, they ate us out of house and home, turned this place into a sty
Darlin' by tomorrow you'll be eatin' humble pie

Who needs ya? Think about it baby, who needs you?
Now you can save your lip, just pack your grip
And leave a trail of smoke behind ya

Who needs ya? Can't you tell me baby, who needs you?

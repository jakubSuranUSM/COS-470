Take me past this lonely truth and let me go beyond my skin
The walls that held me here before have no purpose anymore, let me enter 
In
Break me from my injured past and make me over in your arms
The pain that guided me before has no comfort anymore, let me enter in

From far away I hear my mother crying
The sky is gray, they say the earth is dying
I hear her voice and still I make a choice to stay
I leave a life behind me, I feel myself begin
I'm reaching out to keep you, falling farther in
I feel the light inside me, you go beyond my skin
I'm reaching out to keep you, falling farther in
Wake me with your dark embrace and make me open in your arms
I want to lose myself within, leave the person I have been, let me enter

From far away I hear my mother crying
The sky is gray, they say the earth is dying
I hear her voice and still I make a choice to stay
I leave a life behind me, I feel myself begin
I'm reaching out to keep you, falling farther in
I feel the light inside me, you go beyond my skin
I'm reaching out to keep you, falling farther in

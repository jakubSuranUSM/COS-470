So this is what's in store.
It doesn't hurt to try.
There is no pain in death,
it only hurts to die.
The cut that stings.
Look before you leap.
All blown apart.

A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
Did not expect this shit at all,
to go through this again.

What do you want from my life, I ask myself.
Loading my questions like a shotgun.
You can f**k every chance with one shot,
you think that's the answer.
The cut that stings.
Look before you leap.
All blown apart.

A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
All blown apart.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
All blown apart.

Did not expect this shit at all,
to go through this again.

You live on your knees.
So this is what's in store.
Pull your head up,
no one cares at all.
You fooled yourself in the past,
believing what you wanted to.

A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.
A landmine spring.

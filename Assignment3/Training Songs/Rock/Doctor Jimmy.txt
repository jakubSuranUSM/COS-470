Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you'll never see
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink 'til I drop down
With one eye on my clothes

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

You say she's a virgin
But I'm gonna be the first in
Her fellah's gonna kill me?
Oh fucking will he
I'm seeing double
But don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim 
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

I'm going back soon
Home to get the baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it
Got a bet there? 
I'll meet it
Getting high? 
You can't beat it

What is it? 
I'll take it
Who is she? 
I'll rape it

Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim 
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

Is it me? 
For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

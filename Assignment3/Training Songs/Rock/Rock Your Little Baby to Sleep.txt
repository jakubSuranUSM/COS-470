Well a when your baby is tired and she wants to sleep
Take her into your arms
Tell her you love her, tell her you care, tell her about
All her charms

A-hoo hoo, a-hoo hoo, a-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo

Well then you rock your little baby to sleep
Yeah then you rock your little baby to sleep

Tell her that you love her, tell her that you care
Tell her that you miss her almost anywhere
And a then you rock your little baby to sleep
Yeah you rock your little baby to sleep

Well a when you tire your baby with idle talk
Take her into your arms, tell her you love her
Tell her you care, tell her about all her charm

A-hoo hoo, a-hoo hoo, a-hoo hoo, a-hoo hoo

Well then you rock your little baby to sleep
And then you rock your little baby to sleep
Tell her that you love her tell her that you care
Tell that you miss her almost any where

And then you rock your little baby to sleep
Oh yeah you rock your little baby to sleep

A-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo
A-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo a-hoo hoo

Come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak,
Come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak,
Don't make me nervous, holdin' a baseball bat.
You keep on yappin', talkin' 'bout this 'n that,

Well you keep on yappin', talkin' 'bout this 'n that,
Got news for you baby, you're nothing but an alley cat.
Well it's hi-yo, hi-yo silver,

Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver away, yeah... whoo!
Honey hush!

Turn out the water works baby, they don't move me no more,
Turn out the water works baby, they don't move me no more,
When I leave this town, ain't comin' back no more, no.
So it's hi-yo, hi-yo silver,

Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver away, yea.

Well it's hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver,
Hi-yo, hi-yo silver away, yea.
I'm gone!

Yeah!
Turn out the water works baby!
They don't move me no more.
Honey hush,
Whoo!

Rollin over
Goodbye sunshine I'm on my way
I'll be long time gone by the break of day
Tell everyone that I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin' gonna stop me 
Rollin' over, rollin' over
Save all your lovin' till I get home
To the sweetest lovin' sunshine that I've ever known
Tell everyone that I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin' gonna stop me 
Rollin' over, Shack-do-way
Rollin' over, Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Neeson-Leib)
It's the nature of the beast
To satisfy his every appetite
He's never worried 'bout the cost
He never worries of he's wrong or right
And there's no method to his madness
You watch him step up to the firing line
She's almost close enough to touch
He feels the heat and reads the danger sign
And it's all a game
It doesn't matter who plays
It's the nature of the beast
To jump into the fire
Tell me can't you feel the heat
See you walking on the wire
At the crossroads of the night
Too scared of passion but too lonely to run
Nobody wants to lose control
Nobody wants to be the careless one
Throwing caution to the wind
'cause making love is like a trial by fire
And though you know you might get burned
You've got to go with what your heart desires
Between love and pain
It never knows any shame
It's the nature of the beast
To jump into the fire
Tell me can't you feel the heat
See you walking on the wire
And it's all a game
You never know any shame
It's the nature of the beast
It's the way of the beast
I know you've had the feeling
And it makes you lose control
And it makes wake up screaming
It's the nature of the beast

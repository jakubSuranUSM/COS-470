Here we are waking up by the fire light
Now you're worried cause it's four a.m.
And I'm wonderin' what you're gonna say to him

And as problems go
I'd say we got one year
Do you want to leave
Or do you want to get closer

Think you might have stayed
Just a little too long oh yeah
Oh don't let him know
don't show him what's in your eyes
Don't let him know

Does he know about you breaking the rules
Does he listen to your lies
What's gonna happen when
You run out of alibis
Is it easy when you're walking out
Do you smile as you're leaving
If I were you I'd be wondering
When he's gonna get even

Think you might have stayed
Just a little too long oh yeah
Oh don't let him know
Don't show him what's in your heart
Don't let him know, don't let him know

Think you might have stayed
Just a little too long oh yeah
Oh don't let him know
Don't show him what's in your eyes
Don't let him know
Don't show him what's in your heart
Don't let him know, don't let him know

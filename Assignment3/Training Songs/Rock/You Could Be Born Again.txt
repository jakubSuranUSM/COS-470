I'm beginning to get a new kind of feeling
Beginning to sing a new kind of song
I'm beginning to see that life's worth the living
Beginning to find the right ‘stead of just the wrong

There was a moon last night, a pretty bird in flight
And a quiet breeze gliding through the trees
I still can feel the ache in my heart
Showing my life to be in need of a brand-new start

Begin to sing again, I'll show you how
You could be born, born again now

I'm beginning to see that life's worth the living
Beginning to find the right ‘stead of just the wrong

It's pretty easy to love when love is given back
You think it's something special if you're white or black
But I find all love to be easy once more
Like a child who does not care who, how, why, what for

Begin to sing again, I'll show you how
You could be born, born again now

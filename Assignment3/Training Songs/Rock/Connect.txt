There’s a thousand miles between us
As I feel your breath on my skin
There are so many things I want to say
But I don’t know how to begin

I want to connect with you
Over the oceans and back to the truth
I want to connect with you

I’m standing right beside you
Screaming in my head
I don’t know how to reach you
I shut down instead
When all I want to do is connect with you

The silence is defining
Your heartbeat’s been heard from next door
I knock but no answer
You know I’ve never done this before

I want to connect with you
Over the oceans and back to the truth
I want to connect with you

I’m standing right beside you
Screaming in my head
I don’t know how to reach you
I shut down instead
When all I want to do is connect with you

Distance can be measured by
The pain you feel inside your heart
We could be together
Or be five million miles apart
But that wouldn’t stop me

I want to connect with you
Over the oceans and back to the truth
I want to connect with you

I’m standing right beside you
Screaming in my head
I don’t know how to reach you
I shut down instead
When all I want to do is connect with you

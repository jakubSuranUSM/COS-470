I fell down once,
You held my hand
And though we never ever
Talked about it,

I think you understand.
Everybody could fly,
But you better not try.
Doesn't matter who you talk to,

Everybody's going up.
Nude star.
I was a teenage drunken suicide
And I wrote poetry too.

Now it all kind of disgusts me
And two of them were about you.
Everybody could fly,
But you better not try.

Doesn't matter who you talk to,
Everybody's given up.
Nude star.
I'd desert you in a second but I

Don't know where you are.

I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
But what can you tell them
What can you say that won't make them defensive
Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that you're gonna lose the fight.
They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They chip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
But how can I say it
How can I come on when I know I'm guilt
Hang on to your ego
Hang on because I know that you're gonna lose the fight
And how can I say it
How can I come on when I know I'm guilt
Hang on to your ego
Hang on
Hang on but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

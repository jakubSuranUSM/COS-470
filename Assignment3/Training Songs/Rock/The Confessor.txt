If you look at your reflection at the bottom of the well 
What you see is only on the surface 
When you try to see the meaning, hidden underneath
The measure of the depth can be deceiving 
The bottom has a rocky reputation 

You can feel it in the distance the deeper down
You stare
From up above it's hard to see 
But you know when you're there
On the bottom words are shallow
The surface talk is cheap
You can only judge the distance by the company you keep 
In the eyes of the confessor

In the eyes of the confessor
There's no place you can hide
You can't hide from the eyes (of the confessor) 
Don't you even try 
In the eyes of the confessor 
You can't tell a lie
You cannot tell a lie (to the confessor) 
Strip you down to size
Naked as the day that you were born
Naked as the day that you were born

Take all the trauma, drama, comments
The guilt and doubt and shame 
The what if's and if only's 
The shackles and the chains 
The violence and aggression
The pettiness and scorn
The jealousy and hatred
The tempest and discord
And give it up

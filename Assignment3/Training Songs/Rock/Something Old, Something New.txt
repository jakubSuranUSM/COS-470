Something old
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
My love will always be true
Paula I love you
A book that's old
A ring that's new
A borrowed necklace
Of sapphire blue
My love is only for you
Paul I love you too
This is our wedding day
We have each other
Come what may
Joy and laughter
Sorrow and fears
Better are words
Through all the years
With this ring just for you
I take your hand and say I do
Our love to have and to hold

With this band of gold
With this band of gold

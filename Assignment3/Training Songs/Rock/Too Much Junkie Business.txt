Well you run down to the corner baby, see what you can cop 
You buy some for your sister and you take yours off the top 
Run into the bathroom, fixing up a shot 
Tie it up, shoot it up, bang your head and throw it up 

Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
I don't wanna f*ck around with you 

Your life becomes as sickening as that mess you call your face 
The pig you call your girlfriend is dead from shooting mace 
Climbing up the walls, you're shooting all my balls (/old moth balls?) 
Wrap it up, call it art, now your record makes the chart 

Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
I don't wanna f*ck around with you 

Too much junk, too much junk 
Too much junk, too much junk 
Too much junk, too much junk 
I don't wanna see her hanging out with you 

Well you're the coolest thing in town, with your face right on the ground 
Friends went through your pockets as the coffin went down 
You overdosed at last, spike stuck in your head 
Now you're deadâ?¦ dead! dead! dead! 

Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
Too much junkie business 
I don't wanna f*ck around with you 

Too much junk, too much junk 
Too much junk, in your head

Shouldn't we two be together

You know what I mean

To be with you is something like a dream (you know what I mean)

And if you want me to

I'll bring sunshine to you only
You better stop, take a look about

You know what I mean
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
Then you'd know the reason why
I would rather say "I do" than say
Goodbye and let you go forever

Wouldn't we two be together

Bridge:
Can't you see that I want you

I gotta feeling that you wanna come over
I get you here and 
I will make you roll over
Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
I got the flesh and 
I will make you scream, ohh
You're doing things that make 
My flesh burn hot, oh
I got to give in, 
Baby please don't stop, oh

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
Now look it baby, you're just nineteen

You know I love it 
When our bodies move closer
And when it's finished, 
Yeah it only starts over
I touch you there 
Because I know the spot
You know I'm everything 
That he's just not
And when I hear it yeah, you feel a shot
I'm comin' for ya baby, ready or not

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
Flesh so hot, ready or not
Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
You got the flesh 
That's gonna make me hot

I gotta feeling that you wanna come over
Ohh, I get it in and 
I will make you roll over
I touch you there 
Because I know the spot
You know I'm everything 
That he is just not
Ohh, you're doing things 
That make my flesh burn hot, oh
I got to give in, 
Baby please don't stop, ohh

Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
Flesh so hot ohh, ready or not, oh
Now look it baby, you're just nineteen
You're so hot, oh

Someone broke into my heart and stole a beat or two
The finger of suspicion points at you
Someone took away my sleep and never left a clue
The finger of suspicion points at you
Just as soon as they can make the guilty one confess
I know exactly what I'm gonna do
I'll take and lock her charms forever in my arms
Then who is bound to be the guilty, who?
The finger of suspicion points at you

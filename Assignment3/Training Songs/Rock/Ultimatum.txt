Student why do you dream of me
When you dream of your acre of trees
It was agreed
I came to burn leaves
It's all I ever claimed to do
A plow man I'll never grow into

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh

Blue in the broad light of day
Your claws are snagged on my face
Say it, I wish we were naked and
I wish that I could take it
When you turn on me

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope that I can keep seeing you
As long you as you don't say you're falling in love

Crave translates into slave
No one can harness the rain
And I can make myself into rain
You'll feel me on your cheek
And on your sleeve

My arms miss you
My hands miss you
The stars sing
I've got this song in my head
Oh I don't want my words twisted
I don't want you to listen too closely
Or wait for me impatiently
And I hope I can keep seeing you
As long as you don't say you're falling in love
But I can feel you about to forget
Yes I can feel you about to forget

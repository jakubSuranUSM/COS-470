Surfin' every day down at Malibu
'Neath the warm California sun
No more books, no more homework to do now
'Cause summer means fun

CHORUS:
Summer means fun
(Fun fun, summer means fun) summer means fun
(& the girls are 2 to 1) the girls are 2 to 1
(Lots of fun for everyone) yes, summer means fun
(Fun fun, summer means fun now)

Drive-in movies every night
Stayin' out till half past 1
Sleep in late & live it light now
'Cause summer means fun

(chorus)
(instrumental)
(chorus)

So everybody, grab your baggies & bikinis
'Cause it's only just begun
We're gonna have a ball until the fall now
'Cause summer means fun

(repeat chorus & fade)

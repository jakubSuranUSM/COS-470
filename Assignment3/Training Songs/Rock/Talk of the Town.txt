The sun goes down on a cloudless sky
The tide is in the waters high
The fisherman are back in town
Tonight they'll either drink or drown

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

If you're ever in that gulf country
Strangest land you've seen
Sun's so hot the ground's on fire
Thermometer won't go no higher

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

If you want to lose those lonely blues
You best put on your dancing shoes
The ringers make for the water hole
Tonight the town will rock 'n roll

Wait for rain to come down
Wait for rain all year round
It's the talk of the town, goin' 'round

Now, murray knows this ancient land
Like the back of his own hand
See the brolga on the plain
Thousands dancing, bring the pain

And that rain coming down
Hear that rain what a mighty sound
It's the talk of the town, coming down

And that rain coming down
Hear that rain what a mighty sound
It's the talk of the town, coming down

Momma she had complications
There's nothing very strange 'bout that
Nuns said "We can't kill that baby.
We'll have to let your mother die"

We are all just lilies of the valley
We neither reap nor sow
We need to get our hands a little dirty
To make our gardens grow

Way too many people on this island
Getting way too crowded on this boat
Need someone to bail some water
If we're gonna keep this thing afloat

I like a little sugar in my coffee
I don't mean Sweet 'n Low
You don't know what you want until you
find it
I believe you'll tell me so

I need a little water in my garden
I need a little sunlight on my head
I need someone to cover me with kisses
When I'm all alone & scared

We are all just lilies of the valley
We neither reap nor sow
We need to get our hands a little dirty
To make our gardens grow

I like a little sugar in my coffee
I don't mean Sweet 'n Low
Ahh...like to cover me with kisses
To make my garden grow

Gonna tell aunt Mary 'bout uncle John
He claim he has the misery, but he's havin' a lot of fun
Oh baby, yeah baby, woo baby
Havin' me some fun tonight

Well, long tall Sally, she's built for speed
She's got everything that uncle John need
Oh baby, yeah baby, woo baby
Havin' me some fun tonight

Well, I saw uncle John with bald headed Sally
He saw aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby, yeah baby, woo baby
Havin' me some fun tonight

We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Woo, have some fun tonight
Everything's all right
Have some fun, have me some fun tonight

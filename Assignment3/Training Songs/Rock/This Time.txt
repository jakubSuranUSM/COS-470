Why do the days
Go by so fast
If only time
Was built to last

If it could learn
To take it slow
Then maybe time
At last would know

That if Monday, Tuesday
Should go away
It'll be Wednesday, Thursday
Then Saturday
And when Sunday comes
It's just too late
It's gotta be this time

How come the days
Do what they do
Maybe if time
Time only knew

Could be that time
Don't really know
That it should try
To take it slow

Then maybe Monday, Tuesday
Won't go away
Then maybe Thursday, Friday
Could be like Saturday
And when Sunday comes
It's never too late
It'll be this time
It's gotta be this time

How come the days
Do what they do
Maybe if time
Time only knew

That if Monday, Tuesday
Should go away
It'll be Wednesday, Thursday
Then Saturday
And when Sunday comes
It's just too late
It's gotta be this time
It's gotta be this time
It's never too late
It'll be this time

Little girl let me walk you home
You shouldn't be walking all alone
Little girl let me walk you home
You know I won't do you no wrong

Come on and tell me what's your name
Little girl let me hold your hand
Come on and try to understand
I wanna be your candyman

Cause you ain't noting but fine, fine, fine
You ain't nothing but fine, fine, fine
You ain't nothing but fine, fine, fine
You ain't nothing but fine, fine, fine

And I wish you was mine, mine, mine.

You ain't nothing but fine, fine, fine
You ain't nothing but fine, fine, fine

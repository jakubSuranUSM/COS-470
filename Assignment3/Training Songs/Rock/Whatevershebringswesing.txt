I'm looking 'round madly
for something to find 
That might give se a front
To put something, something behind.

Just bouncing this ball
Up and down the hall
But it's full of best wishes
and suffocating fishes, and all.

So, let's drink some wine
And have a good time.
But if you really want to come through 
Let the good time, good time have you. 
It's what you've got to do.

You said it was foolish
for me to be sad;
But I'm very hungry, and you..
You're very well fed,
You're such a fat lady.

And I'm talking to you
just for something to do
'Cause I'd much rather kiss you 
But I know, I'm gonna miss you
Again and again, I know I'm gonna miss you.

So, let's drink some wine, etc.

I sing to the island
That sings in your head
'Cause I know you'd much rather be there 
Be there instead.
I know you'd rather be there...

But you won't find the answer 
Even when the wind blows;
'Cause the answer, my friend
is in front..
Right there in front of your nose 
Everybody knows, it's their nose.

So, let's drink some wine, etc. (repeat)

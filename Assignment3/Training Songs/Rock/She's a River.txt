Shadow let go there's something you should know
I Just found my new direction and I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it she's the wind that sucked me through it 
Ahe's a river and she's turning there in front of me

Stand back get back
She'll paint your blue skies black she gives bullet proof protection
She's got a resurrection feel when I'm scared, and bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me

And I go blind wasting my time the river is front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be

Shine on, get on twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the sprit of creation, she's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses, sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me

Shine on, move on 'cause when I find my state of mind
The river's front of me
Move on let it go

They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me to the freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon
My nerves feel electrified meet me on the staircase by a darker moon
Light me like a naked flame, the voice of mother nature states
All things must pass

Nothing here can remain 
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride

You raise me like a building to the very top, rush me to the end of time 
You fill me full of danger, you give me future shock 
Then you leave me wasted dying

Stand back, get back, move on
She's a river, she's a river

Rock and roll dream
Not what it seems
Who is the dreamer now?

When I see the faces from the limousine
No chance of our survival
Armed forces, the guardians of the law
Awaiting our arrival

They all are young
We all were young
And I've seen this place before
Open up the door
Let us in

All the things I've seen
Words I said, I didn't mean
Feelings, I took for granted
But now reality
One thing we could never see
Everything, we always wanted

They all are young
We all were young
And I've seen this place before
Open up the door
Let us in

Rock and roll dream
Not what it seems
Who is the dreamer now?

Rock and roll dream
Not what it seems
Who is the dreamer now?

If I had the choice
Words came through my voice
I should have left unspoken
Now it's obvious
Clear to all of us
The dream that now is broken

Take the stage tonight
Go face the lights
With this image you should keep
But you're crying in your sleep
Tonight

Rock and roll dream
Not what it seems
Who is the dreamer now?

Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
I'm worrying about my brother finding out
What’s the fun in doing what you're told?

I said no
'Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night I'll make you'
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

I said yo, I think I better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty year olds and you think you've made it
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I’ll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

I said yo, I think I better go, I can't take you
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

'Cause they're just girls

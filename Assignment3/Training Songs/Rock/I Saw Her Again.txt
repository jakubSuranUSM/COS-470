I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
To string her along's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't
But what can I do, I'm lonely too
And it makes me feel so good to know
You'll never leave me

I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her
Because that's what I said
Though I never think of her
But what can I do, I'm lonely too
And it makes me feel so good to know
You'll never leave me

Every time I see that girl
You know I want to lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Don't know why I'm livin' a lie
It makes me want to cry

I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
To string her along's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't
But what can I do, I'm lonely too
And it makes me feel so good to know
You'll never leave me

But what can I do, I'm lonely too
And it makes me feel so good to know
You'll never leave me

Every time I see that girl
You know I want to lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Don't know why I'm livin' a lie
It makes me want to cry

I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
To string her along's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't

I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her
Because that's what I said

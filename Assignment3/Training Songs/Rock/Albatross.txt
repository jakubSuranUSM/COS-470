One last cup of starlight 
Before I wake and start my day
A past so filled with promise
Before I lost, I lost my way

Ah that’s okay, and I’m alright
I guess I’ll be lost again 
For one more night
Ooh and that’s alright, I’m okay
I'll wear the albatross 
For one more day

As the past recalls the romance
Before the bets and what you make
I lost my friend in between them
And that was more than I could take

Ah that’s okay, and I’m alright
I guess I’ll be lost again 
For one more night
Ooh and that’s alright, I’m okay
I'll wear the albatross 
For one more day

Ah that’s okay, and I’m alright
I guess I’ll be lost again 
For one more night
Ooh and that’s alright, I’m okay
I'll wear the albatross 
For one more day
I'll wear the albatross 
For one more day
I'll wear the albatross 
For one more day

And because I know I'm alright

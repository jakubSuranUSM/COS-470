I've been workin'
I've been workin' so hard

Make love to you, make love to you 

I've been grindin'
I've been grindin' so long
I've been grindin'

Been up the thruway, down the thruway
Up the thruway, down the thruway
Up, down, back and up again

I said woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel so good
Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman , woman 
Make me feel alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

I said woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel so good
Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Make me feel so good
Set my soul on fire

Pulling down the blinds, blocks what's left of the
Stars
So I'm tripping over bottles, tracing footsteps in the
Dark
Tomorrow would be a great day for broken glass
There are men in this room, who would pay for this
Missed calls to say I missed the morning's most.

You can't talk about it, you can't talk about it
Keeping (we) secrets (we) playing (can't talk about it)
Witches
Our bodies stretched out, our bodies stretched out
Casting sudden spells is not the answer
We'll build ourselves on hope and progress
Wake in water says your eyes wide terrified
We'll build ourselves on hope and fortune
I wouldn't say
Wouldn't say it, to your face, I'm sure

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one (SURE!)
It talks about confidence, I'll give it a month if I'm
Lucky
I'm not that lucky, and these t-shirts don't fold
Themselves
But he falls asleep on her shoulder
Every shift they spend together, which is most nights

You can't talk about it, you can't talk about it
Keeping (we) secrets (we) playing (can't talk about it)
Witches
Your bodies stretched out, our bodies stretched out
Casting sudden spells is not the answer
We'll build ourselves on hope and progress
Wake in water says your eyes wide terrified
We'll build ourselves on hope and something
I wouldn't say
Wouldn't say it, to your face, I'm sure

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one (SURE!)
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
It talks about confidence, I'll give it a month if I'm
Lucky
You're jealous friends have gotta get laid
The only thing that's stopping you is more of the same
Yeah you get it, you feel it, emotions, attention

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one

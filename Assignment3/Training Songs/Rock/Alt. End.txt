Yeah it's a big bright beautiful world
Just the other side of the door
Six billion beautiful faces
I saw them all before
No this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone

[Chorus]
And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end
I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It for me and you

For all my dreams came true
I know I should care if you come with me
I should care if you go
I really should care about your love or your hate of me
I should care but I don't
And it's not about giving up on you
It's not a case of do or die
It's simply that it's over and out for me
There's no more room inside

[Chorus]

For all my dreams came true
It's a big bright beautiful world out there
Just the other side of this door
Six billion beautiful faces await
But I saw it all before
No this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone

[Chorus]

This to be the last we go through
This to be the end

For all my dreams came true...

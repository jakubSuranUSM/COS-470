I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly
Talk about when they leave me
Not that I notice when they're gone
It's eery and so scary
I don't know who to worry
Your sister came to beat me
Oh your sister came to beat me
But I'll love it when you blink your eyes
Oh I
I want to know my body
I want this out not in me
I want to know no secrets yet
I'll leave
Oh I'll leave care
It's saved me once too often
You'll never know her often
I've pictured you in coffins
My baby in a coffin
But I'll love it when you blink your eyes
Oh I'd
I want to know my body
I want this out not in me
I want no other leakage
I want to know no secrets yet
I'll leave
Oh I'll leave
No I'll leave care

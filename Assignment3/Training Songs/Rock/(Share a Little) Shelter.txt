Now and then I think about you
Smilling at my situation
You think it's funny
I can't smile anymore
Open your door, open your window
Spread your arms round my world
What's in stone?
Time will tell but let me in, let me

Share a little shelter
In your heart I'll hide away
There I'll find my peace of mind
Love in time, oh, let me stay

Share a little
Oh no, no, no, no,

Lost inside and now youve found
Taht home is always where the heart is
Turning to ashes
Flowing right through your hands
Tear down your walls
Tear down your fears
Here I'll wait through the years
But take me in, take me

Share a little shelter
In your heart I'll hide away
There I'll find my peace of mind
Love in time, oh, let me stay

Share a little
Oh no, no, no, no,

Now and then I think about you
Smilling at my situation
You think it's funny
I can't smile anymore
Open your door, open your window
Spread your arms round my world
What's in stone?
I don't know but let me in, let me

I want to be Santa Claus,
I want to get all the toys.
Just like Santa Claus I'd give them away
To all the girls and boys.

Then if I could be Santa Claus,
Coming through for everyone
And the gifts that I'd bring could make your heart sing,
We'd have so much fun.

Santa Claus is someone who comes just once a year,
But I could be there every day, bringing Christmas cheer.

I want to be Santa Claus,
I want to ride in the sleigh.
Then I'd fly through the air
And catch you a star tonight for Christmas day.

Santa Claus is someone who comes just once a year,
But I could be there every day, bringing Christmas cheer.

If I could be Santa Claus,
I'd make every dream come true
And sign every card exactly the same
With love from me to you.

Oo -
(i want to be, I want to be Santa Claus)
I want to be Santa Claus.
(i want to be, I want to be Santa Claus)
I want to be Santa Claus.
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (i want to be Santa Claus)
I want to be Santa Claus.

Merry Christmas everybody!!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

"What would you like for Christmas, little pudel?"
It's a waltz, it's a waltz and I'm happy.

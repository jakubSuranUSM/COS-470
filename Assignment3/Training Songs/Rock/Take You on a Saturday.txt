You were hitchin' a ride 
When I took you inside 
You were tremblin'
Out in the rain 
Just a face with no name 
In the cold 
And you cling to my side 
Like a desperate child 
As the thunder crashed high above 
Well now the storm is behind us 
It's time for some love 
Gonna take you on a Saturday 
Lovin' you till Monday mornin' 
Take you on a Saturday 
I've been waitin', waitin', waitin', yeah 
Now I don't know your past 
And I don't know your last situation 
All I know is the way that you feel 
In my arms, ooh my arms 
And your fire is so sweet 
And I'm feelin' your heat 
And this heart's got no time to lose 
So hold on tight babe 
I'm makin' my move 
Gonna take you on a Saturday 
Lovin' you till Monday mornin'
Take you on a Saturday 
I've been waitin', waitin', waitin', oh girl 
And my love will flow like a river 
And in gentle waves 
We'll come and go like the sea 
And the feelin' is makin' me shiver, ooh yeah 
A weekend of love 
Then it's back to the world, oh yeah 
Oh yeah 
Take you on a Saturday 
Lovin' you till Monday mornin' 
Take you on a Saturday 
I've been waitin', waitin', waitin', ooh yeah 
Lovin' you till Monday mornin' 
Take you on a Saturday 
I've been waitin', waitin', waitin'

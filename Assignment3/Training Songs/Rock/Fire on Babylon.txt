She took my father from my life oh
Took my sister and brothers oh
I watched her torturing my child
Feeble I was then but now I'm grown

Fire on babylon
Oh yes a change has come
Fire on babylon
Fire
Fire
Fire

She's taken everything I liked
She's taken every lover oh
And all along she gave me lies
Just to make me think I loved her

Fire on babylon
Oh yes a change has come
Look what she did to her son
Fire
Fire
Fire on

Life's backwards
Life's backwards
People turn around
The house is burned
The house is burned
The children are gone

Fire
Fire

Fire on babylon
Oh yes a change has come
Fire on babylon
Fire
Fire, oh
Fire, oh

Fire on babylon
Oh yes a change has come
Look what she did to her son
Look what she did to her son
Fire, haha
Fire, haha

Fire
Fire
Fire, aha
Fire on babylon
Fire on babylon

Round and round, slowing down.
From your finding that the world is so much colder
Than you knew.
All I know is it's you
That makes it all seem right
When there's no hope for me in sight.
All I know whenever I'm close to you;
There's just one hurt that would be too much
If you should walk away.

If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.
If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.
If you ever feel you've lost my love - I will help you find it.
If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.

Now and then, looking back,
I get the feeling, sometimes, you don't know the difference you have made.
So much more than you know.
As time goes by, just realize you're never out of my mind.
And out of sight does not mean that I'm not here.
I've got to do all I can to try and show you understand.

If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.
If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.
If you're ever gonna lose my love - I'll help you find it.

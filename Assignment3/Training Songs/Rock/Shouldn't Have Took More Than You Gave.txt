Shouldn't have took more than you gave
Wouldn't be in this mess today
I know we've all got different ways
But the dues we've got to pay are still the same
Trying to change the script for this old play
Reading and not feeling what you say
You' re coming on too strong for me to stay 
Interpret what you're seeing anyway
Seems the simple things are the hardest to explain
It's going to come too soon, there's another way
Footprints in the snow will show well things are still the same
Beneath the wall of sound someone helps to live again

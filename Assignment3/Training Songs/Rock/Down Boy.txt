No fame 
All there is 
All there was 
On the second lady
Canâ??t take a cent 
Take a cut of that
Kind of ran
Iâ??ll stand kind of bent 
Kind of pushed 
On that heavy land
Iâ??ll stand for the sake of my friends 
I will see him there

Down
Down
Count me down
Down
Down boy
Down
Count me down
Down
Down boy
Down
Down
Down 
Count me down
Down boy

The same
Not begin 
Not give up 
In a better way 
Again 
Kept the stain 
Off his bed 
Not to split them off 
Iâ??ll stand for the sake of my friends 
I will see them there 
Well I will see them there

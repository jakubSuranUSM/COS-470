Deep in the castle and back from the wars
Back with my lady and the fires burned tall
Hooray went the men down below
All outside was the rain and snow
Hear their shout, hear their roar
They've probably had a barrel of ale and much, much more
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Over the hill went the swords of a thousand men

We had to meet the enemy a mile away
Thunder in the air and the sky turned grey
Assembling the knights and their swords were sharp
There was not a hope in your English hearts
When you Hear our drums, hear them sound
We're gonna fight until we have won this town
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Over the hill went the swords of a thousand men

When the knights come along at the end of the day
Some were half-alive and some had run away
But Hear our triumph, hear our shout
We'll probably drink a barrel of ale and much, much more
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Over the hill went the swords of a thousand men

Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah - yeah

Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah - yeah

Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah - yeah

Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah
Hooray, hooray, hooray, yeah - yeah

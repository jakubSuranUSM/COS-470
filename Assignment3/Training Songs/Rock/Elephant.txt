Bet he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
You know that you're dreaming about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it’s not like Mr. Shock
To get shy when I ask who always is on top?
There must be something deep down in the middle down there
He’s not too easily scared

He’s got friends but they got the feeling
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh, look, see there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (yeah)
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
He won’t remember a thing 'til it starts again
That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)

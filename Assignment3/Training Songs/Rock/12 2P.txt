Three and
When our lips participate
Soon then my eyes precipitate
I hate to stop but I really have to go
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
When you call me ‘baby’
H-I-J-K-L-M-N
Oh no
When you call me ‘baby’
I need to find an alley
Your voice always makes me have to pee
Light up like a Christmas tree
I need to find an alley
Your voice always makes me have to pee
Your face makes my eyes run
Your face makes my eyes run
Gimme me that guitar!
Fa fa fa fa ??
When you call me ‘baby’
Your voice always makes me have to pee
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
H-I-J-K-L-M-N
Oh no
Oh oh you make me have to go
Light up like a Christmas tree
I need to find an alley
Your voice always makes me
Your voice always makes me
Your voice-
I really got to go now
Your voice makes me have to pee

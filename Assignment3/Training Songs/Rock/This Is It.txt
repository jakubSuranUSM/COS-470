Well, I've known this girl forever
From the playground to the dance hall
From the same old dirty housing 
I call her friend
All her friends I will call my friends
All the time we call our own
Well, we used to stand together
Now I stand alone 

This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, it's touch and go 

Well, I should've seen it coming
Well, I should've read the signs
She was gone in the morning
Left me with red eyes at night
Well, she couldn't even tell me
Didn't tell me I'm out of line
'Cause my courage must've failed her
Turning out the light 

This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, it's touch and go 

What if I should find you
Drag you to your room
That's the trouble you've been struggling go too soon

Well, I hope you make it big time
Well, I hope you got it right
That the way you got no heart to put up a fight
Maybe I'm new to this small town
But I still got more than you
Why don't you just try and call me
When you're passing through 

This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, it's touch and go 

What if I should find you
Take you to a movie
That's the trouble you've been struggling go too soon

This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, it's touch and go 
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, how was I the last to know
This is it, it's touch and go

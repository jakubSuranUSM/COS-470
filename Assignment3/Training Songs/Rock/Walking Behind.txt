She's running and he's walking behind
He's trying but he's last in her line
His love's dying but he keeps on tryin'
He lives in fear with a love that's clear
(He's walking behind)
He's got love that he needs to give but she's afraid to let him in

To her world with no together
She can't see him in her picture
She wants love but her heart won't let her let him in
He's walking behind, he's walking behind

The phone's ringin', is it her on the line?
Does he answer or is he wasting his time?
Her love's dying but she keeps on trying
She lives in fear of a love that's clear
(She's walking behind)
She's got love that she needs to give but he's afraid to let her in

To her world with no together
She can't see him in her picture
She wants love but her heart won't let her let him in
He's walking behind, he's walking behind

To his world with no together
He can't see her in his picture
He wants love but his heart won't let him let her in
She's walkin' behind, yeah

They've got a love to give but they're afraid to let it in
She's got a love to give and he's got a love to give
So let 'em in, yeah

In a world with no together
She can't see him in her picture
She wants love, so let him in

To his world with no together
He can't see her in his picture
He wants love but his heart won't let him let her in
He's walking behind, she's walking behind

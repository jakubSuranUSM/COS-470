Hey, tonight
It's gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flyin'
Tonight, tonight

Hey, c'mon
Gonna find my soul
Tonight, tonight

Gonna get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's gonna get religion
All night long

Hey, tonight
It's gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flyin'
Tonight, tonight

We're gonna get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's gonna get religion
All night long

Aah
Hey, tonight
It's gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flyin'
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

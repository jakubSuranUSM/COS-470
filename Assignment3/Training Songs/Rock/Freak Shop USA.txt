That backseat smells like mold
And the carpet is screaming
That white trash honey
Bet she fucks like a demon

Is that the reason
Is that the reason
Is that the reason I betray?

From years of doing bongs
And jerking off in my parent's place
I'm just a-popping my blackheads
In Freak Shop USA

The sun rises on me
All freaks go to hell

Is that the reason
Is that the reason
Is that the reason I betray?

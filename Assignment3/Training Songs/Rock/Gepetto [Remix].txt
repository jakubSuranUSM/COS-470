So he's lying on top again
Just like Gepetto with his doll
And he's right around the bend
And I can't get him out of this house
And if you bore him, you'll lose your soul to him

So that kid from the bad home came over my house again
Decapitated all my dolls
And if you bore me, you'll lose your soul to me

(sha la na, sha la na, sha la na)
Hey Gepetto, where'd you put it? Oh Gepetto whoa whoa (2x)

And if you bore him, you're gonna lose your soul
(sha la na, sha la na, sha la na)
Hey Gepetto, where'd you get to? Oh Gepetto whoa whoa (2x)

(sha la na, sha la na, sha la na)
Hey Gepetto, what'd you get me? Oh Gepetto whoa whoa

So he's lying on top again
Just like Gepetto

(sha la na, sha la na) (3x)

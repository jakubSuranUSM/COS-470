I feel like a world gone crazed
At the thought of you
Your hot ways still chill
I'm closing in on you
Temptation never leaves me
But leaves me every once and a while
And it's you, it's you
That leaves me dry every time

And I only need to take it so far
Before all these tears leave their smears
And the thoughts of you disappear

It's you, it's you
That leaves me dry every time

Torch my soul and leave the core
You take it all, you take it all
And you can take this and more
Just before you shut the door

All these tears leave their smears
And the thoughts of you disappear

We gotta go down south
Just about as far as you gotta go
Across the border
You know the way it goes

Two-three-four, oh
Gloria, oh, oh

And I try to sing this song, I
I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet
I try, I try to speak up
But only in you I'm complete

Gloria in te domine
Gloria exultate
Gloria, Gloria
Oh Lord, loosen my lips, loosen my

And I try to sing this song, I
I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there
You let me in

Gloria in te domine
Gloria exultate
Oh Lord, if I had anything
Anything at all, I'd give it to you
I, I'd give it to you, to you
Give it to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Hey, this is Red Rocks
Adam Clayton
This is The Edge
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Gloria in te domine

Gloria in te domine

The cloud is hanging over
Sucking all of us
Evaporate the red stuff
Still dead and bone

A zombie population
An infectious bunch
Chewing on the legs off
I give a royal shunt

Taste every swallow
Tied just like a poisoned arrow
My voice Is your toy
It's Time now for the hand of Horus

You saw a vulnerable suspect
Thought you'd cull it fast
But chowing down on that kind of punk
Is gonna give you a gnarly rash

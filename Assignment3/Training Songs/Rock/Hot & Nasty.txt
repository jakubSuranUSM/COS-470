Hot & Nasty
CHORUS:
Yeah they call me yeah Hot n Nasty
Yeah they call me uh Mister Fancy
Yeah when you ball me
Yeah you're hot n nasty
Oh when you ball me
You're Miss Fancy

When I come a knockin' at your door
Let me in and I'll tell you some more
No two men are ever the same
And they tell me

CHORUS

They say Jim Dandy is my name
They say Jim Dandy is my name
Always to blame
Always to blame
And always just the same
Yeah Hot N Nasty

CHORUS

Just pretend, I'm holding you
And whispering things soft and low
And think of me, how it's gonna be
Just pretend I didn't go
When I walked away, I heard you say
If you need me, you know what to do
I knew it then, I'd be back again
Just pretend I'm right there with you

And I'll come flying to you, oh yes
All the crying is true
Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, we'll just pretend

It's funny but I can't recall 
The things we said or why you're crying
But now I know it was wrong to go
I belong here by your side

Yes, I'll come flying to you, oh yes
All the crying is true
I will hold you and love you again
But until then, we'll just pretend

Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, until then, we'll just pretend
We'll just pretend

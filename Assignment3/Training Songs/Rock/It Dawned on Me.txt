As far as I know
Let it go
'cause it's never quite what it seems
You should know but you don't
'cause you dropped yourself to your knees
It dawned on me

See what I need to say please
And there's no one else there but me
You should know but you don't
As it slaps you upside the face
Now I see
I believe by the bruise that adorns your cheek
It dawned on me

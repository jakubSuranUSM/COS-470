Sometimes I get the feeling
That I won't be on this planet for very long
I really like it here
I'm quite attached to it; I hope I'm wrong

All I really want to say
You're the reason I want to stay
I loved you before I met you
And I met you just in time
Because there was nothing left

I sat here on my suitcase
In our empty new apartment
'til the sun went down
And I walked back down the stairs
With all my bags and drove away 
You must be freaking out

All I know is I got to be
Where my heart says I ought to be
It often makes no sense, in fact
I never understand these things I feel

Don't change your plans for me
I won't move to LA 
The leaves are falling back east
That's where I'm going to stay

You have made me smile again
In fact I might be sore from it
It's been awhile
I know we've been together
Many times before
I'll see you on the other side

Don't change your plans for me
I won't move to LA
The leaves are falling back east
That's where I'm going to stay

All I really want to say
You're the reason I want to stay
But destiny is calling
And I told them when my time is up
I'm out of here

All I know is I got to be
Where my heart says I ought to be
It often makes no sense, in fact
I never understand these things I feel

I love you, good bye
I love you, good bye

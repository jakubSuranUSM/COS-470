I haven’t felt this awake in years
Was too busy drying my tears
To feel the sun was shining on my skin
Locked up in my own cage
Filled up with a bitter rage
I couldn’t see the prison I was in

I walked across the line alone
To find a truth I’d never ever known
The truth was there all this time
The only one who couldn’t see was me

And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long
I gotta get a little light inside
And I’m here holding out for just one thing
And it’s your love, your love
It makes everything feel alright

I was slowly slowly dying, slowly dying
It’s like the first day I’m alive

Float through me like summer breeze
Put my twisted mind at ease
And all the troubles of the world just drift away
Jump out like a shooting star
I make a wish to be where you are
And underneath your glow is where I’ll stay
The only place I want to be
Is right here with you next to me

And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long
I gotta get a little light inside
And I’m here holding out for just one thing
And it’s your love, your love
Makes everything feel alright

I was slowly slowly dying, slowly dying
It’s like the first day I’m alive

I’ve been awakening for so long, so long
I’ve been awakening for so long, so long

And I walked across the line alone
To find a truth I’d never ever known
The truth was there all this time
The only one who couldn’t see was me

And I have been waiting for this awakening for so long, so long
I gotta get a little light inside
And I’m here holding out for just one thing
And it’s your love, your love
Makes everything feel alright

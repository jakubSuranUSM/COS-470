Quit acting so friendly. 
Don't nod don't laugh all nicely. 
Don't think you'll up-end me. 
Don't sigh, don't sip your iced-tea. 
And don't say, "It's been a while..." 
And don't flash that stupid smile. 
 
Don't ask me how I've been. 
 
Don't think I've forgotten, 
You never liked that necklace. 
So cordial, so rotten... 
Kiss, kiss, let's meet for breakfast. 
Don't show up so on-time 
And don't act like you're so kind 
 
Don't ask me how I've been. 
 
Don't sit there and play just 
So frank, so straight, so candid, 
So thoughtful, so gracious, 
So sound, so even-handed. 
Don't be so damn benign 
And don't waste my fucking time. 
 
Don't ask me how I've been.
 
Hey! Get over it!

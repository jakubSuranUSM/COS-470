When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

And I can be proud that I'm his girl
'Cause I know that I'm good all by myself
See I don't need his love
I really want him, right

And he can feel good that he's my guy
'Cause he knows
It don't mean that he's just mine
I don't wanna own him, or control him
I just want our souls to be aligned

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
He picked up for a walk around,
He's gonna put that down again

I'm the one he loves & trusts
He goes out on the town
I don't get jealous
It's all about affection
Not possession with us

And I do exactly what I want
When I'm with him,
And when I'm not
It's not a maneuvering
Just to deal with
What we've got

So, If you love someone
Let them be free
I know I don't want no one suffocating me.

Don't settle for ownership
Make it deep
If you love some one
You should feel good
To let them breathe

So,
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around
I'm his
When you see me walking around with him
I'm not just another chick
I'm his girl

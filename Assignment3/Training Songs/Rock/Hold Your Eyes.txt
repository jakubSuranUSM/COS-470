I got what cha want
I got what cha need

See me come along my baby
Going to give you some disease

I'm going to see you in the morning
want to feel you in the night
I'm gonna get me some love my baby gonna feel you over tonight

Close your breath and hold your eyes 
Till I enter super rise, you know what I mean x4

So I find you in the morning
Lying on the floor
The break up dress inside you, are gonna see you once a more
And I have you little dejects
Can I party all alone
I got something for you, baby going to leave you brats alone

Close your breath and hold your eyes 
Till I enter super rise, you know what I mean x4

Can you hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me, woo x3

Close your breath and hold your eyes 
Till I enter super rise, you know what I mean x6

I was waiting in the dark age
Searching for the ones in my life
I'm so far away
But I had hit the ground runnin'

Steady as you go, I don't mind
I'm still here today
Oh, spouting hymns and all's in them
And forever target when it ain't so kind

But it feels like forever
When your mind turns to fiction

And I had took the long way
And I was in the heat and I don't mind
I'm so far away

But it feels like forever
When you mind turns to fiction

Imagine the darks from the skull
In a night without sleep
Vibration comes
First suit I had in months without feet

Spouting hymns and all's in them
And forever target when it ain't so kind

But it feels like forever
When your mind turns to fiction

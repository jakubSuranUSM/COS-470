I went talkin' to my woman, I had to tell her where its at
I said you quit draggin' me around girl, I ain't that kind of cat
I said, I expect some respect, so what you think of that 

She said, I don't give a damn, I am what I am
I don't give a damn, I am what I am
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Because I don't give a damn

She said, now you listen to me babe,that's alright for you
You swarming around with that band of yours,
I don't know what you been up to
But you expect me to be sittin' here,
Like a good woman when you get home,
Well you got another thing coming 

I said, I don't give a damn, I am what I am
I don't give a damn, I am what I am
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Because I don't give a damn

She said, now you wait a minute buster, I'm gonna give you a clue
If you don't get your ass back home tonight, 
Then you and me are through
And if you don't take my advice, you know what you can do!

I said, I don't give a damn, I am what I am
Well, I don't give a damn, I am what I am
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Because I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn now baby!

I don't give a damn, I am what I am
Well, I don't give a damn, I am what I am
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Because I don't give a damn

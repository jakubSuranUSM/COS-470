You, Mister wearing a crown
Push me around
Dragging me down
You, Mister head of the class
Never come last
Pain in the ass

Look who's perfect now
Got my head in the clouds
Look who's perfect now
Got my feet on the ground
Look who's perfect now
Got my head in the clouds, got my feet on the ground
Look who's perfect now

You, Mister never to fall
Standing so tall
Knowing it all
You, Mister living a lie
Flying so high
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Look who's perfect now
Got my head in the clouds
Look who's perfect now
Got my feet on the ground
Look who's perfect now
Got my head in the clouds, got my feet on the ground
Look who's perfect now

Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Hush now baby, don't you cry
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Just for you and me 

Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Time will see your tears run dry
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Just for you and me 

Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sun
Bless the tears of love now gone
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Singing just for me

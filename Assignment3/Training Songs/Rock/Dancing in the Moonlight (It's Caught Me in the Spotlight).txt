When I passed you in the doorway
Well, you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should have been in by ten

Now I won't get out 'til Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the end

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

And I'm walking home
The last bus is long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

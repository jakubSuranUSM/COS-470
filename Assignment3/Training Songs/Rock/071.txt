Eighteen towers on a dirty sky
Seventeen ravens learned to fly
Sixteen ships on a river to the sea

Fifteen scars on a lovers wrist
Fourteen years and I'd never been kissed
Thirteen seemed so unlucky then to me

Oh seven one, seven one,
Seven one, seven one, seven one

Twelve long journeys on a tattooed train
Eleven conversations standing in the rain
Ten beats twist and a boy forgives a sin

Nine men say there's a bill to pay
Eight men can't find a place to stay
Seven girls throwing caution to the wind

Seven one, seven one, seven one
Seven oh, seven one, seven one
Seven one, seven one, seven one
Seven oh, seven one, seven one

Six I'm sorrys and an I understand
Five small fingers holding onto my hand
Four sweet kisses on

Three short days since I saw your face
Two long nights since I heard your voice
One day left Ã¢??til I leave this place behind

Seven oh, seven one, seven one
Seven oh, seven one, seven one
Seven one, seven one, seven one
Seven oh, seven one, seven one

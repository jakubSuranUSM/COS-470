I've laid this island sun a 1000 times
I'm on it
But I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock
And skies I've got yet to see
I tried
I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor
Cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn in the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes

I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin
Yeah, we're movin
This island's sun I've laid 1000 times
Fortune me
Fortune me
Of all my mistakes
I think I lent you late

But I've never seen a scarlet
Or a riot or the violence of you

I land to sail
Island sail
Yeah, we're movin'

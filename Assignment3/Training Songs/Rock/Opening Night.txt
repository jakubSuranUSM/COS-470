I dedicate a color to
My dearest friends and family who
So solemnly and nicely dressed
Come visit me, I must confess
I feel like Gena might
Upon her opening night

And so the hounding begins
A sudden crack on the shins
Whip stinging say oh hello
You look like someone I know

Fiery red I give my mom
My dad transparent he is gone
My sisters I give black and white
And guys I hate well f*ck 'em bright
My friends get shades of blue
And ginger green to you

While sniggering up your sleeve
A kid a joke just like wee
Guys in a schoolyard aged five
The baddest honcho alive
Track down your friends to a bar
Trace over steps in a car
Say that's a pretty excuse
Make mine a pineapple juice
Bugbears are plenty round here
Give him a clip on the ear
Says dad infront of TV
Decide channel randomly

I feel something coming on
A funny turn or a wrong
Decision made casually
Like dad in front of TV
Regurgitation and goo
Ten squillion eyes watch as you
Put up a pretty good fight

On this your opening night

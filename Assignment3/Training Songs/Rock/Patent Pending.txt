Bring your bored, bring your broken hearted
Got a vessel that we've chartered
Into the wide open sea
The two of us dearly departed

Bring a book with a happy ending
A remix of the message sending
Shining clean, this guillotine
New and improved
Patent pending

Place a curse on the hearse were driving
Cut the brake lines, end up dying
Glad to be traumatically
Against the ropes lost all hope trying
Finding ways to break the silence
And to quench our taste for violence
Shadow free monstrosities
Crafting the fine art, have patience

High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back in six minutes or so

Bring your bored, Bring your broken hearted
We've got a vessel that we've chartered
Into the wide open sea
The two of us dearly departed
Bring a book with a happy ending
A remix of the message sending
Headless dreams of guillotines
Sharpened clean, never ending

High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back in six minutes or so
High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back with 666 in tow

High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back in six minutes or so
High time we swore off everything we know
Sit tight well be back with 666 I know

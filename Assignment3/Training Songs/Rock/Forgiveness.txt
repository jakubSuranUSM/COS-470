Are these writers trying to teach me
What if I decide to listen
Learn about a newer meaning
Reconcile with my indifference

Do I deserve

Forgiveness
I need your
Forgiveness
Don't want for more
You got enough
For both of us
Forgiveness

All these triers trying to reach me
Hoping I can serve them meaning
Commit yourself to reason failing
Extreme comforts ever pleasing

Do I deserve

Forgiveness
I need your
Forgiveness
Don't want for more

You got enough for both of us
You got enough for both of us
Is there enough for both of us
Is there enough for both of us

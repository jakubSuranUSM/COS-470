A song called Highway Star, this one. 
Nobody gonna beat my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car

It's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power

Big fat tyres and everything 
I love it and I need it, I feed it
Yeah, it turns me on
Alright, hold tight

I'm a highway star, yeah 
Nobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna take my girl

She stays close on every bend
Ooh, she's a killing machine
She got everything
Like a moving mouth

Body control and everything 
I love it, I need it, yeah
Yeah, she turns me on
Alright, hold tight

I'm a highway star 
Nobody gonna take my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Nobody gonna take my head

I gonna beat my..., yeah, yeah
Ooh, I'm in heaven again
I got everything
Like an open road

All my friends and everything 
I love it and I need it, I feed it
Yeah, it turns me on
Alright, hold tight

I'm a highway star 
Oh, my soul 
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground

Nobody gonna take my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything

Oh, a moving mouth
Big fat tyres and everything 
I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah, it turns me on

Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star

Oh, yes I am, you mothers 
Thank you. That's a new one, taken off Machine Head.
This is a song about... 
Sweet child in time, you'll see the line

The line that's drawn between the good and the bad
See the blind man, he's shooting at the world
The bullets flying, they're taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have

And you've not been hit by flying lead
You've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
You'd better bow your head

Wait for the ricochet 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm cryin' for you day and night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

A-a-ah, a-a-ah
I want to hear you say
A-a-ah, a-a-ah 
Sweet child in time, you'll see the line

The line that's drawn between the good of us and the bad of us
See the blind man, shooting at the world
The bullets flying, they're killing everyone
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have

And you've not been hit by flying lead
You've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
You'd better bow your head

Wait for the ricochet 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want to be inside of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

A-a-ah, a-a-ah
I gotta hear you sing
A-a-ah, a-a-ah 
- You're only about four foot six, but don't worry about it, 'cause there's always someone smaller 

than you. You're about seven foot fourteen, don't worry about it either... [indistinguishable] ...there's always someone one million stone heavier than you... [indistinguishable] 
- Here's a song which is also from the last album. It tells the story of how we recorded it and what went wrong when we did it. It happened in Switzerland, the song, a thing called Smoke On The 
Water, this one. 
Alright, wooh 
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time, no 
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground, now 
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky

Smoke on the water
But burning down 
You know
They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
He was pulling kids out of ground 
When it all was over

We had to find another place
Swiss time was running on
It seemed that we would lose the race 
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky

It was burning
Smoke on the water
Down to the ground, it was 
You know

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there 

A few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget 

Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Everywhere
It was tumbling down
Everybody was crying 
- Thank you. 
Yeah, everything up here, please. And a bit more monitor if you got it. Ah?
-(...everything louder than everything else.)
- Yeah, can we have everything louder than everything else? Right. 
No one sees the things you do
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
You put evil in my mind
I used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
'Cause I listen to the mule
How can I change when my mind
Is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule
(...???..., yeah) 
- Ian Paice on drums, yes. 
Alright 
There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery 
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman, yes I have 
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on, baby, you're my star 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman 
Ooh, my soul, I love you 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman, yes I have 
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glow with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, ha ha ha
Ooh, I had a strange kind of woman, yeah 
She was so fat
She was the worst thing you've ever seen 
Ooh, my soul, I love you, baby 
- Hey, thank you, thank you. 
Here's a thing called Lazy, this is a song from Machine Head, and it's a song, a thing called Lazy, this one, Lazy. 
You're lazy, stay in bed
You're lazy, yeah, stay in bed
Don't want no money, don't want no bread, oh, shut up 
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live, don't want to cry no more, no 
My trying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no not like you should 
Lazy, stay in bed
Lazy, lazy
Want no money, you don't want no bread, oh 
- Yeah. 
- Come on, everybody, clap your hands. 
Well, we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We're meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We're dancing 'round the Borealis
We're space truckin' round the the stars 
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go Space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on 
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We moved to the Canaveral moonstomp
Every naut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' every day 
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on 
The fireball that rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, a freak said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in the solar system
Rock around the Milky Way
Dancing 'round the Borealis
They're Space truckin' every day 
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on 
Yeah, yeah, ye

When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.
 
My mama told me, "Son,when rumors spread 
That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head."
But I sure didn't listen to what she said;
Don't you know I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who lead you on and tell you lies, no, not my baby.
 
Tell me, baby, 
I don't believe what they're sayin', no.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
 
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby, not my baby 
Not my, not my sweet, sweet baby.
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby, not my baby 
Not my, not my sweet, sweet baby.
 
Not my baby, not my baby,
Not my baby, not my sweet, sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh no, not my sweet baby.
Oh, no, not my baby.

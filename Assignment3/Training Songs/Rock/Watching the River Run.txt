If you've been thinkin' you were all that you've got
Then don't feel alone anymore
'Cause when we're together then you've got a lot
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun, watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning to run, river, run

Winding and swirling and dancing along
We passed by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as we sing them our song,
Rejoicing together when we greet the sea

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun, watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning to run, river, run

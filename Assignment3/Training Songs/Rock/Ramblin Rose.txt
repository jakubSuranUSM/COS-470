Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it, the more it grows
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

Ramblin' Rose, I'm such a bore
Diamond rings and a Cadillac car
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

Ramblin' Rose, ramblin' around
Ramblin' Rose, I'm gonna put you down
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

Love is like a Ramblin' Rose
The more you feed it, the more it grows
Ramblin' Rose, Ramblin' Rose
Come on home

I need a Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose
Ramblin' Rose

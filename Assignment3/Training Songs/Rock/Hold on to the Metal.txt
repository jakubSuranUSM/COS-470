Don't forget to fold gifts close on the air above your nose. 
Let the wild colors bleed down the isle of sandy feet. 
And I'll cross the sugarcane through the mountain swelling veins. 
All of the earth is coming free, is a river running to the sea

Roll up the thunder, let's put some water in the ground. 
No hesitation, gotta push the air to make a sound

Hold on to the metal, collide with the other side. 
You don't be afraid of what's behind you. 
Get inside of what's inside you. (x2)

Don't you slip on the flatbad, you'll wake up on a rusty shoe, 
Sweating every vibration, choking on your cries. 
Bouncing baby, you're dancing to the rhythm of the rider 
Who had a conversation with the devil in his eyes

Don't you slip on the flatbad, you'll wake up on a rusty shoe, 
Sweating every vibration, choking on your cries. 
Bouncing baby, you're dancing to the rhythm of the rider 
Who had a revelation, we're never gonna die

Hold on to the metal, collide with the other side. 
You don't be afraid of what's behind you. 
Get inside of what's inside you. (x4)

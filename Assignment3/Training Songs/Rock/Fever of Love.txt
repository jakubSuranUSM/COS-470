You took the apple from the tree
And gave the fruits of love to me
But love is blind I couldn't see
Those neon nights you'd left behind
You should have laid it on the line
Procrastination stole my time

The day has come the years will go by
Things have changed have opened my eyes
And she tried to hide the feeling inside
But you know and you know and you know

The fever of love is like a hundred above
You are the one that turns me on

The fever of love is like a hundred above
I got you under my skin you are my adrenalin

I've got your love in my veins
It's gonna ease the pain in my heart
In my heart

Good vibrations came today
God only knows they're gonna stay
But psychic ways can fade away
You were the guardian of my soul
Who'll turn my memories to gold
I'll still be younger when I'm older

I'm feeling high on pure emotion
I know I could cry an ocean
And I can't hide my feeling inside
But you know and you know and you know

The fever of love is like a hundred above

The fever of love is like a hundred above

The fever of love
The fever of love . . .

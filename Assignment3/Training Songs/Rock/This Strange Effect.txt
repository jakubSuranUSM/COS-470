You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
You make this world seem right,
You make my darkness bright, yes,
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it, and I like it

And I like the way you kiss me,
Don't know if I should, but this feeling,
It?s love and I know it,
That's why I feel good.

You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it.
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like It.
You make this world seem right,
You make my darkness bright, yes,
You've got this strange effect on me,
And I like it, and I like it.

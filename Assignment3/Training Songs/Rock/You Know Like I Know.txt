To take a look and walk away
Isn't a stand, man
To speak the words that everyone's heard
Isn't the way, man

Everybody knows
All things must come and go but
You know like I know that
Everything's gonna be alright
People just come and go
They don't know what's right
Till they're gone

Your sun will rise and set today
Just don't you worry
And everything will come your way
Just don't you hurry

Take a little time
And find you some peace of mind then
You'll know like I know that
Everything's gonna be alright
People just come and go
They don't know what's right
Till they're gone

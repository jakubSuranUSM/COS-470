Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

She moved so well
'Cause she was a dancer
She went sliding through my questions
Gliding 'round the answer

Whatever it was, she knew it was holy
And each time I tried to hold her
Her smile came sad and slowly
She said, "No one knows me"

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

She had a dream
I had my typewriter
While I was hacking out such a heavy world
She was weaving one much lighter

But I'll never know
Just how much it cost her
But each time I slept beside her something turned and tossed her
And it did till I lost her

Bright times were brighter
Than they'd ever been before, I tell you
Night times were lighter
But they'll never, never be no more

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fa-all in love

People tell me love's for fools
So here I go, breaking all of the rules
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy) 
Oh-oh-oh, so doggone easy (Doggone easy, doggone easy) 
Mmm-mm-mm, it seems so easy 
(Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy) 
Where you're concerned, my heart has learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fa-all in love

Look into your heart and see
What your-our love book has set apart for me

Oh-oh-oh, so doggone easy (Doggone easy, doggone easy) 
Mmm-mm-mm, It seems so easy 
(Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy) 
Where you're concerned, my heart has learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fa-all in love

We-ell, it's so easy (It's so easy, it's so easy)

Well, where you're concerned, my heart has learned

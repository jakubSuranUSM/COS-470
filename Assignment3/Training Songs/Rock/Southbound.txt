Well I'm Southbound, Lord I'm comin' home to you
Well I'm Southbound, baby, Lord I'm comin' home to you
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues
 
Well I been workin' every night, travelin' every day
Oh, I been workin' every night, traveling every day
Oh you can tell your other man, sweet daddy's on the way
Aww, ya better believe
 
Well I'm Southbound
Whoa I'm Southbound
Oh you better tell your other man, sweet daddy's on his way
 
Got your hands full now baby, as soon as I hit that door
You'll have your hands full now woman, just as soon as I hit that door
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should have had before
 
Lord, I'm Southbound
Oh I'm Southbound, baby
Whoa I'm Southbound, yeah baby
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you for all the things you should have had before

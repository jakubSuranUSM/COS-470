If it seems that I'm too quite
That cause I'm missing you
My bud tells me I have to fight it
But I can't help missing you

[Chorus]
Better leave me alone
Better leave me alone
Until I can think about you
Without feeling sorry for myself
You better leave me be
Till I don't want you any more
I don't want you need you again
Until I'm sure I'm over you

Myself feeling tired and wondering
It's not like I thought it would be
Love just can not end up running
My world shot from under me

[Chorus]

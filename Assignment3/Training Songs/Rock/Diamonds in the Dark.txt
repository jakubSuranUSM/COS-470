Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Outside the school gates
We first met in a basement near the park
(Diamonds in the dark)
We danced all night and then we kissed
Your smile like diamonds in the dark

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

We would have little children
We would be together forever
(Diamonds in the dark)
We would live on Delancy Street
But then you cut your hair and it ended there

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Now I've nothing left to lose
I'm clinging to a cliff-face staring at your shoes
And tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me do you feel the same?
Or are we just waiting to a day we can't
A day that we can't change, we can't change?

And now there's this no man's land
Between you and me
(Diamonds in the dark)
But I still wander in between
The sheets and streets and other places we've been

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back again

Sour Pie
If I tell the truth, would you scold me 
If I came for you, would you hold me 
Does my nude blush you, 
I can't change me 
But my bridge still stands, she awaits me 
And would it bother you 
If I played by myself 
I honestly didn't mean to wake you up 
Mister five minutes,5 more minutes please 
'Cause i'm not finished, I'll finish myself

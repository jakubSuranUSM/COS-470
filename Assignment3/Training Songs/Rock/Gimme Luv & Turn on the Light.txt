Something has shot me through
Just like the livin' truth
Gimme love and turn on the light

How long has it been dark
Without the slightest spark
Gimme love and turn on the light

All light shines in darkness
Where else could it shine?
Could it?

We're the proper troglodytes
Everybody loves a fight
Gimme love and turn on the light

This is infinity
This is eternity
This is my destiny!

Foolishness and wisdom are practically the same
Indifferent to the opinions of the world
Of the world
Of the world!

Jumpin' out of room and life 
It's all struggle and strife
Gimme luv and turn on the light

When I come over the hill
With a folded dollar bill
It's "Baby where you been so long?"

Our shortcomings may be more
Than merely human after all
After all
after all
after all

After all.

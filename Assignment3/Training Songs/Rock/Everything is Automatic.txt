Miss my head
Miss my heart
Miss my lungs

Be what you want to be
Watch what you want to see
Killed for fun

Down a hole up a rope
Down some pills
Up some hope
This karma machine only takes quarters
New age soldier, New age soldier

Everybody's all right
Everything is automatic
Everybody's all right
Everything is skin deep me

Say, hey, say, hey, say how you doing
I miss my lazy boy
I miss my TV
I miss myself
Do you miss your lazy boy
Do you miss your TV
Do you miss yourself

Everybody's all right
Everything is automatic
Everybody's all right
Everything is skin deep me

And it's always what I wanted
Killed for fun
It's fucking funny don't you think
One day you decompose and you wake up
and those birds are singing
those birds are singing

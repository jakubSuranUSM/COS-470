I walked into the sea
Those waves they came for me
Egged on by scarlet sun
(But) I will never burn

My eyes stay liquid free
Not phased by chemistry
The whole ten yards i see
Striding through the haze

[Chorus]
Just let the sun
Shine on your face
Only the darkness blinds your way

You take it easy
You walk on your own
Look for the sunshine (you'll) find (your) way home

Just let the sun
Find your way home

Special these dirty deeds
That floods my pretty dreams
I snap awake from love
Relieved I'm on my own

Fearless and tacky free
Guided by empathy
Still your not lost on me
I still smell the sea

You'll make it

See the stars come joining down from the sky,
Gently passing, they kiss your tears when you cry.
See the wind of summer blow your hair upon your head,
See the rain, the falling rain, it's rain.
Still I'm sad.

Oh my flowers, my tears just falling two days, 
We are driving the night to find they are lost. 
Flower, flower the wind is blowing, 
Time into my heart. 

When the wind blows hard, we are apart.
Still I'm sad,
Still I'm sad.
Still I'm sad.

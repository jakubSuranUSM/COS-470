No, I'm not doing this to please you
Or trying to sound like something you can relate to
- Alright?
I got my friends right here beside me
- Yes, you got it what you need from us?
I need a direction, man, won't you guide me
- Sure, you need to sing this stuff

What if I do then Will I be alright?
- Oh yeah Sure
Then hold on tight
Please guide me, and my family through Stormy Weather

When I begin to get caught up in it
- Does something come to your mind
Yeah I remember who I needed to make it
- Just sing it baby you'll be fine

What if I do then will I be OK?
Oh yeah sure
Then I'll pray
Please guide me and my family through Stormy Weather

And when I'm stoned, right out of my mind
I got my friends right there to help me get my feet back on the ground

Please guide me and my family through Stormy Weather

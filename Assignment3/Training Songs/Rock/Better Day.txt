All I had to do was to be nice
But, no! no! no!
I just fucked it up
It's been like that for my whole life
And if I was born again
It'd be the same
One thing at a time
Yeah! I lied
Yeah! I'm scared

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Thirteen seconds left
It's the time I had to runaway
But I forgot and wake up late
Like everyday
One thing at a time
Yeah! I lied
Yeah! I'm scared

I just quit it all
I'm not ashamed
I would rather wait
For a better day
If you would have been
With me that day
I know things would be
A different way

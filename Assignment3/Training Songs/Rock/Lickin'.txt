Your eyes they look like two bullet holes
And you don't ever say "maybe"
You knock me out with the way you talk
I like the way you say "baby"
You want a mouthful of scorpio
Yeah, but my poison be tasty
You bite my finger and say "control"
You won't let me be lazy

[Chorus:]
Night and day like a mule I'm kickin'
Girl you gonna catch a lickin' yeah

Fire out of the mound of babes
Got you acting so crazy
Doorknob queen of the underage
You got me ranting and raving
See the bruise you left on my page
Now the game's getting tricky
Left alone in my own parade
While the bomb keeps on ticking

Do you want to do it all with me
Do you want to scream and bleed for me
You can have all of me, all of me
Your teeth they taste just like razorblades
Yeah you got my tongue ready
You fill me up with your politics
Then you leave me so heavy

Yesterday I had a baby
Now she's one day old
And looks just like her old lady

And last night I had a bad dream
That the world would end and would be forever ending
Now I know it's not that nice, but hey
It's just a dream, it's just a dream

And if I had just one more day
Here's all the things that I would say
To my baby

I can't explain the world to you
Can't explain the things that people choose to do
There's a thing called hate and there's a thing called love, too
Like the love I have for your mom and for you
And my baby, she looked at me and she smiled

Never had nobody else
No bestest friend until the end to talk about
But then I met this little girl
And I could see that she would be my whole wide world

And I know it don't feel right
But hey, nothing's ever as it seems

And if I had just one more day
Here's all the things that I would say
Before you came to take away
My baby baby baby baby baby baby

I can't explain the world to you
Can't explain the things that people choose to do
There's a thing called hate and a thing called love, too
Like the love I have for your mom and for you
No, I can't explain the world to you
Can't explain the things that people do
There's a thing called hate and there's a thing called love, love, too
Like the love I have for your mom and for you
Well, my baby, she looked at me and she just smiled

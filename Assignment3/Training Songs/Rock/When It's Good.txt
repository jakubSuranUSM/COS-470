You're a prison
I can't escape
You're a decision
I never make
Heard me laughing
You heard me weep and moan

When it's good
It's good
When it's gone
It's gone

They say time will 
Kill the pain
I say pain is gonna
Kill my time
Lord won't you save me
Or leave me alone

When it's good 
It's so good
When it's gone
It's gone

I hang your picture
Above my mind
Don't do anything
You can't deny
I could never
Be your pawn

When it's good 
It's so good
When it's gone
It's gone

Some drink to remember
Some to forget
Some for satisfaction
Some to regret
I hope a brighter
Day to you I've shown

When it's good 
It's so good
When it's gone
It's gone

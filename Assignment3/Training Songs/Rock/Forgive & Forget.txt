Don't say that I never moved you
Just because I saw the light before you did
And you say that I never showed you
All the rooms inside of my soul

Yeah
Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Walking up and down the hall
Frankie and his favorite lover
Speaking all the words she wants to hear
But that don't mean forever

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Sitting down by the fire
Frankie plays the guitar
To people playing make believe
They say, "can we get a little higher?"

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby
But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe

And it goes on and on
On and on and on

Packing her bags
She found somewhere to stay
And in the car to the station
You know the world looks a little brighter
And then there's no need for conversations
Tell me why

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby
But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you

Yeah
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Yeah
I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me
Yeah
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

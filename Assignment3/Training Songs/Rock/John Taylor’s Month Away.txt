I love to look
Out at the sea
From the swing park here
At Roome Bay Beach

Today John Taylor
Starts his month away
On a boat, one ten miles east
Of Aberdeen

A dozen men, thirty days
With twenty-four hours in each
Of shattered boyhood dreams
And not much sleep

I'd much rather be me
For once I'd much rather be me

A month at sea
And then they'll surely sleep
With their heads
Still stuck on land

A month on land
And then they'll surely dream
Of girls they can afford
But cannot have

And in a drunken haze
They're on the rolling wave
Once again I'd much rather be me
I'd rather be me

Once again I'd much rather be me

For once again I'd much rather be me

It's a load off my mind
Its no one that I can find
It's a load off my mind
It's no one that I can find

I am sick of the girl
Waiting in my shadow
I'm looking at the girl 
Changing to a sparrow
I'll be your edge when you go down

It's a load off my mind
It's no one that I can find
It's a load off my mind
It's no one that I can find
I can't say another word

I know where you are at
You're running down my back
I know where you are at
You're running down my back
I will be your edge when you go down

Aching
To be a victim
I'm aching
To be a victim
I'm aching
To be a victim
I'm aching
To be a victim

I know where you are at
You are running down my back
I know where you are at
You are running down my back

Everybody hazy shell-shocked and crazy 
Screaming for the face at the window
Jeans for the genies dresses for the dreamies
Fighting for a place in the front row  

Oh oh oh good for your body it's good for your soul
Oh oh let's go it's the golden age of rock and roll

Well you get a little buzz send for the fuzz
Guitars gettin' higher and higher
The dude in the paint thinks he's gonna faint
Stoke more coke on the fire 

Oh oh oh gotta stay young you can never grow old
Oh oh the golden age of rock and roll

The golden age of rock and roll will never die
As long as the children feel the need to laugh and cry
Don't wanna wreck, just recreation
Don't wanna fight but if you turn us down 
We're gonna turn you 'round
Don't mess with the sound
The show's gotta move everybody groove
There ain't no trouble on the streets now
So if the going gets rough don't you blame us

Oh oh oh gotta stay young you can never grow old
Oh oh the golden age of rock and roll

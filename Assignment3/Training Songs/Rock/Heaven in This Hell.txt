If love's a sweet passion, why does it torment
If a bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content
Since I suffered with pleasure, why should I complain
Or grieve at my fate when I know 'tis in vain
Yet so pleasing the pain is, so soft is the dart
That at once it both wounds me and tickles my heart

Yeah, yeah

I've been good for most of my life
Never struggled with a halo, wrong or right
Been around the world, crossed the stormy sea
I'm under your spell and I can't break free now

I gave my heart, gave it all to you
But the flames of love have burned right through

Baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell
Baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell

I could cut this stone from round my neck
And swim away from this shipwreck
Oh, you can't suck the life from me
I'm under your spell, don't wanna break free

Well, baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell
Baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell

Well, I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
Well, no

Well, baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell
Baby
Well, baby
Well, baby
Don't it feel like heaven, heaven
In this hell

Don't it feel like heaven
Don't it feel like heaven, oh no
Don't it feel like heaven
You make me feel like heaven, ooh
You make me feel like heaven, ooh, ooh
You feel like heaven

Im trying not to try
But this fire was it here before you and I
And ive seen it all before
Through a crack in the wall and umbilical cord, hide your love inside my head
The truth is ive tried
How to be the only thing on your mind
In trying to change
But you cut like a cold shoulder blade, hide your love inside my head
And tie my hands behing my back
Tell me which is which
Prepare my heart for this
(Call me out, quiet eyes)
Now I said
(Call me out, quiet eyes)
Now I said
Well I feel like a wrecking ball
With bottles of alcohol
When will the dawn break, even again
End

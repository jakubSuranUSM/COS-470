Speaking in degradation
A conversation can take a sudden turn
And reaching the point of violence
Because your silence left you without a hand to hold

Your past will lead you on to make

Making a final judgment
Based on your bias will never bring you forward
Terror should never guide you
For even the fearful can take a beating in the end

Suspicion gets you nowhere

Those who denounce a way of life
Will stand alone
Left to atone their social blunders
If you gun down the messenger
You guarantee that he will be made
Into a saint
The martyr of the free word

I will say what I think
I will do what I say
When liberty seems out of reach
We'll fight for our freedom of speech

Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine,
Et lux perpetua luceat eis

Missing a simple context
A mental weakness can throw you out of balance
Listen, respect each other

It's not too late for mercy

I will say what I think
I will do what I say
When liberty seems out of reach
We'll fight for our freedom of speech

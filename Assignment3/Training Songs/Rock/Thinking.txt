( spoken) 
Break his legs and give him thirty years in jail 

I was Just
Thinking about a girl
She meant to me the world, she meant the earth 

I was Just 
Thinking about time
Some are left behind, some think were wrong 

Thinking about your face behind my door
Thinking  about the love we made on the floor
Thinking I'd like too get back to before
Get back to before 

I was just
Thinking about the rain
The way the seas have changed, you just can't stop 'em. 

oooh I was just
Thinking about the sun
And you and me on the run, we had some fun 

Thinking about the world that it gets no better
Thinking about my love, I should have given more
Thinking I'd like too get back to before
Get back to before

(Guitar solo)

Thinking about the world that it gets no better
Thinking about my love I should have given more
Thinking I'd like too get back to before
Get back to before 

I was Just
Thinking about a girl
She meant to me the world, she meant the earth 

oooh I was just
Thinking about the sun
And you and me on the run, we had some fun 

Thinking about your face behind my door
Thinking  about the love we made on the floor
Thinking I'd like too get back to before
Thinking about the world that it gets no better
Thinking about my love I should have give more

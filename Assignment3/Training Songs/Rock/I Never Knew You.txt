Well I guess it's kinda funny how 
I loved you so way back when. 
You say I wouldn't know you now, 
Well I didn't even know you then. 

We take (we take) 
A lot (a lot) 
And no one here can stop 
That train (that train) 
Before (before) 
It gets to where it's goin'. 
And ah

Well I guess it's kinda funny how 
I loved you so way back when. 
You say I wouldn't know you now, 
Well I didn't even know you then 

I heard (I heard) 
About (about) 
The company you're keeping 
And from (and from) 
Someone (someone) 
Who didn't have much interest 
In keeping us apart. 

Well I guess it's kinda funny how 
I loved you so way back when. 
You say I wouldn't know you now, 
Well I didn't even know you then 

And so I go out Friday night and talk to anyone I can. 
If they can see me they can hear me run my mouth. 
I tell them all I'd love to see you once again 
Or maybe just run into you hanging out, 
Hanging out. 

You know (you know) 
I lie (I lie) 
So it comes as no surprise 
When I (admit) 
That I (that I) 
Don't really want to reunite. 

Well I guess it's kinda funny how 
I loved you so way back when. 
You say I wouldn't know you now, 
Well I didn't even know you then. 

So I guess it's kinda funny how 
I loved you so way back when. 
You say I wouldn't know you now, 
Well, I didn't even know you then.

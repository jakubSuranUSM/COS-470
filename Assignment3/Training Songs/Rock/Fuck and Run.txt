I woke up alarmed 
I didn't know where I was at first 
Just that I woke up in your arms 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
With or without my best intentions 
And whatever happened to a boyfriend 
The kind of guy who tries to win you over? 
And whatever happened to a boyfriend 
The kind of guy who makes love 'cause he's in it? 

And I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas 

You got up out of bed 
You said you had a lot of work to do 
But I heard the rest in your head 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
With or without my best intentions 

And I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas

I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend another year alone 
It's f*ck and run, f*ck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
F*ck and run, f*ck and run 
Even when I was twelve 

You almost felt bad 
You said that I should call you up 
But I knew much better than that 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
Without or without my best intentions 

I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend my whole life alone 
It's f*ck and run, f*ck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
F*ck and run, f*ck and run 
Even when I was twelve

Made it all up girl
Out of anger, out of passion

Turn yourself away
Make me lonely, love we only
Need a place to hide
Out of anger, out of love

Time crawls
There's like beyond the castle walls
Go, leave
I said I didn't mind
Did I believe it?
This time in my kingdom of lies
I'm alone

Turn the lights up girl
Turn your anger to conviction
All my shadows fade
They made me lonely
Lies that only
Turned your heart away
Out of anger, out of love

Time crawls
There's life outside these city walls
Go, leave
I said I didn't mind, did I believe it?
This time in my kingdom of lies,
I'm alone 

Time crawls

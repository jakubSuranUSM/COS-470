You know it's hard to be yourself,
Free yourself, to see yourself
When all around you there are lies just to get you,
Spies just to get you, to buy so they can get you

There are cameras in the sky, lasers in our living rooms
There are wolves watching wearing sheep's costumes

[Chorus]
It's enough to make you go crazy (whoa)
It's enough to make you mad
It's enough to make you go crazy (whoa)
And I'm amazed I haven't yet

Isn't it a shame the way we cheat each other, treat each other,
Beat each other?
It's a shame the way we use one other, abuse one another,
And screw one another, it's true.

They will lock you up in prison but they won't call it slavery
There are stolen children raised and trained in armies

[Chorus]

Don't hesitate to speak your mind (speak your mind)
Never hesitate to speak your heart (speak your heart)
They'll call you crazy when you speak your mind (when you speak your mind)
So never, never hesitate (never hesitate)

[Chorus]

Na sol them go lock you for prison
Na sol them go beat you for prison
Them no call it slavery
It's him that make me vex

Na sol them go lock you for prison
Na sol them go beat you for prison
It's him that make me vex
It's him that make me craze

It's enough to make you go crazy (Whoa)
It's enough to make you mad
It's enough to make you go crazy (Whoa)
And I'd be crazy not to care

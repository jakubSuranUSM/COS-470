Save it for your children
This love that you have got
Forget me now that I am sure
It's you that I want not

Save if for your loved
Ones who come to you each day
No matter what you do to them
They'll never have to say

That I don't love you any more
Still I don't care
Somebody else can love you more
I won't be there

Save it for another
Who's asking for your love
The only one who knows the truth
Will never know enough

Save it for the priest Then who might one day say to you
"Do you take this man for your husband?"
Answer him "I do"
And you'll be happy

Just like I was when I left you
There's only one thing
Left for me to do forget you
And I will so help me

Ever if it means that I'll have to
Take a trip abroad
Where it's thought perhaps the change
Might do me good from you it should

Save it for the morning
That starts another day
If you have learnt your lesson
Someone else won't have to pay

Save it and remember
Your carefree days are through
No longer can you take somebody
And break his heart in two

For everyone knows
That you treated me unfair
Although I think about you inside me
I don't care anymore

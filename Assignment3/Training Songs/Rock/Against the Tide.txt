Falling against what you know
Falling against the tide
Oh what you want
Is it what you want?
Is this what you want?

Because we are young
And things are wrong
We'll lose the chains
We'll make things right
Before the sun goes down on
And out of sight
We'll lose the chains
Cause you and I
We move against the tide

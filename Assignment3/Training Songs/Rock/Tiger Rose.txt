Tiger Rose got new clothes
The ladies love her so
They laugh at her connections
But they don't say no

Get down high, get down low
Get your heels in tow
We don't care what
Mama don't allow here anymore

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

There's the day breaking
Windows shaking at my cabin door
Love me like you did last night
Just one time more

I know it don't make sense
But then it don't intend
You keep coming by
We'll make it up again

Get up, Johnny, sing along
Get along now, get along
I could be right, I could be wrong
Pretty soon be long gone

Lay me down in worried sleep
Listen while the river weep
Thought I heard it sing a song
Delta Queen done come and gone

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

Come on, big eyed handsome moll
And be my party doll
We'll live in jive o county
'Neath the waterfall

If people say, "What can you play?
Just tell 'em, "Anything"
Cut glass spur or a silver chime
Can make 'em ring

Tiger Rose, heaven knows
I just love you so
Maybe that's the reason
That you don't say no

You get high, get down low
You my rodeo
We don't give a damn
What Mama don't allow here anymore

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin'
Come on and show me somethin'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

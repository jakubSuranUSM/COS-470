Love can give you everything
Then take it all away
She can take you to the water
She can make you thirst for days
Tell you what you want to hear
In the same breath she can steal
And that's why love don't come easy

Love can take you to the mountain
Love can make it move
Love can shine her burning torchlight
In the bed of fools
Love can be your witness
She is judge as she condemns

And that's why love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
Love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
It ain't over 'til it's over

Love can make your poverty
Seem rich although your poor
Love can be your honesty
When your conscience comes to call
Love can count you out in ten
When she's got you down on the floor

And that's why love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
Love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
It ain't over 'til it's over

Love can make the time move quick
Or torture time so slow
Love can heal a gaping wound
Or make the pain explode
Love can be the difference
Between life and the hangmans rope

And that's why love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
Love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all

And that's why love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
Love don't come easy
Sometimes love don't come at all
It ain't over 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til it's over

Everybody (love)
Everybody (love)
Everybody have a good time (love)

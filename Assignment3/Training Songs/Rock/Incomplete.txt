Haven't known you long enough
But now I'm seeing why
You're always on my mind
No one else has ever made me open up my eyes
You're the one that made me realize, realize

I've been incomplete
Missing a part of me
Blinded by the fear of something new
But now I see
All along what's missing has been you

Try to find a missing piece
To fill a hole in me
A lonely mystery
Thought I had it figured out
But then you came along
And with just a look
I knew that I was wrong, I was wrong

I've been incomplete
Missing a part of me
Blinded by the fear of something new
But now I see
All along what's missing has been you

I'm feeling things I never knew existed
And now I know I'll never be the same
This changes everything

Haven't known you long enough
But now I'm seeing why
You're the one that's always on my mind
You're the one that made me realize
Realize

I've been incomplete
Missing a part of me
Blinded by the fear of something new
But now I see
You were all that's missing
And you're here with me
I'm no longer incomplete
I can see the clear and simple truth
For me to be
Complete I only have to be with you
For me to be
Complete I only have to be with you

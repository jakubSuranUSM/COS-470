Sleepless hours and dreamless nights and far aways
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here
Heaven knows and lord it shows when I'm away
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here

Same old show in a different town on another day
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here
Even though you're far away, you're on my mind
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would
Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could
But I've got my job to do, and I do it well,
Change my life) So I guess that's how it is.

Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here

On the road it's a heavy load, but I'll be by
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here
Pay the price, make a sacrifice, and still I'll try
Ooo ooo ooo, wishing you were here

Woman I hear what you say. 
Now and then you've gotta get away. 
But when your now and then start to coming every day, 
I fall apart. 
Baby, have a heart. 
See what I'm going through, 
Afraid I'm losing you, 
Never knowing where you're going or what you might do. 
I'm in the dark. 
Won't you

[Chorus]
Have a heart. 
Stop my world from falling apart. 
Oh Honey, have a heart. 
Can't you see what you're doin' to me? 

Last night I had a dream. 
It was the strangest thing, 
'Cause in my dream my fears became reality. 
Oh Darlin', 
I watched you as you ran, 
To the arms of another man. 
And as I saw him touch the one you know I love so much, 
I fell apart. 

[Chorus]

Baby, 
Baby, 
Baby

[Chorus]

I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered 
To see how we're ending our last dance together 
Expectant too punctual but 
Prettier than ever 
I really believed that this time it's forever 

But older than me now more constant more real 
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence 
Turned to hair and contentment that hangs in 
Abasement a woman now standing where once 
There was only a girl 

I'm so glad you came 
I'm so glad you remembered 
The walking through walls in the heart of December 
The blindness of happiness 
Of falling down laughing 
And I really believed that this time was forever 

But Christmas falls late now flatter and colder 
And never as bright as when we used to fall 
All this in an instant before I can kiss you 
A woman now standing were once there was only a girl 

I'm so glad you came 
I'm so glad you remembered 
To see how we're ending our last dance together 
Reluctantly cautiously but 
Prettier than ever I really believed 
That this time it's forever 

But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder 
And never as bright as when we used to fall 
And even if we drink I don't think we would kiss 
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girl

These things made our love come to an end
Oh, these things
Hey, baby, thought you were my friend
Steppin' out, playin' around

All of these things, baby
Really let me down
Oh, and I know you're gonna miss me
One of these old days

Early one mornin'
I got out of bed
I thought about our happiness, yes I did
That we left was dead

I love you, I need you
Oh, these things, baby, still run through my head
Oh, and I know you're gonna miss my lovin' baby
One of these old days, yes you will

Early one mornin'
When I got out of bed, yeah
I thought about our happiness, yes I did
Long left for dead

And oh baby I love you
And oh baby I need you
All of these things, baby
Still run through my head

Oh, and I know
You're gonna miss me
One of these old days
Yes, you will

All because of these things
All because of these things
Steppin' out, dead love
Playin' around, hey baby

Thought you were my friend
It's all because of these things
These things, these things, these things
It's all because of these things, these things

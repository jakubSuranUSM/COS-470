Well, do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Squeeze me, baby, I'm your man
Oh, baby, do you want to dance?

Well, do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze and hug me all through the night
Oh, baby, do you want to dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?

Well, do you want to dance to a rock 'n' roll band?
Come on baby, give me your hand
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?

Well, do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze and hug me all through the night
Oh, baby, do you want to dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?

She move so quick
She move so fast
She move so quick
She make the good times last
She said that even in the morning said you know It's on
Even in the morning

[Chorus]
Free Love
Free love
Free love
Free love,love,love,love

She like it rough
She bending bones
She starts a screaming when she's ready to go
She said that even in the morning said you know that it's on
Even in the morning

[Chorus]

Pretty girl come with me
Two on two
Three on three
Passion is the flavor climbing up this tree
Make a fuss
Move around
Keep it on under the ground
Just beneath the covers
I can see the sea

She knocking knees
So full of pride
She made the move cause she's got nothing to hide
She said that even in the morning said you know that it's on
Even in the morning

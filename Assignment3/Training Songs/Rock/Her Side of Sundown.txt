I'm running out, like quiet from sunrise. 
I'm running out, sweet sounds keep on. 
Fate and tragedy, I'm calling you selfish begging men, 
Sweet sounds don't leave.
Because there's a world I've got to see 
And it silently Waits for me, 
Sweet sounds don't leave. 
Chance is in her glass house I know, 
And I know I'm throwing stones but
It's not enough to break love's law. 
Now hold your breath and hold your heart, 
A boy like you should know this
part, (and what sweet sounds bring) you've played it.
Boy, you gave me life, but I'll have my time. 
(When trumpets sing for me) 
Boy, you gave me life, but it wasn't mine. 
I'm running out, like quiet from sunrise.
I'm running out, sweet sounds keep on. 
Trading the highest love for a case of lockjaw, 
Five years gone but not for good, please believe. 
I guess we've both held our breath so long 
We've forgotten how to dream. 
We both knew this world would drop if we but breathed. 
Boy, you gave me life, but I'll have my time 
(When trumpets sing for me) 
Boy, you gave me life, but it wasn't mine.

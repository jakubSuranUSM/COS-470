Who am I? Where am I?
Where am I coming from?
I don't know
How far will I go?

Many lives passing by
All of them, once were mine
I can tell there's strings like Heaven

I'm the same
I'm headed out
Searching for identity

Who am I? Where am I?
Look what I've left behind
Why grow?
How far back must I go?

Who am I?
I don't know
I don't know, no

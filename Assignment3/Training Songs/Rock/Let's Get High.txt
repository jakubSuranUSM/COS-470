Let's Get High!
High on love

Bounce with the bigots in the North
Got me rocking back and forth
And the bigots in the South
Don't you know it make no difference to me
Ain't we all just Japanese
When we're high on love

Now march by the terror in the east by the terror in the west
God and Allah would be pleased
Don't you know it make no difference to Christ
We're all Jesus in disguise, when we're high on love!

I need Love!
I need your Love!
Yeah, yeah, I need your love!
Love!
High on love

Now march with the lonely one percent
All they wanted was a tent
To go marching with their friends, singing songs
I say we let 'em come along
There's no protest, they're just songs
When we're high on love!

Now march by the murder and the pain and the criminally insane
There's a grand ole' jamboree
Don't you know it don't make no difference to blood
It's all kung-fu in the mud
When we're high on love!

All this talk of who's to blame
For your heartache and your pain
Grab a mirror and some soap
Now let's do the criminal

I need Love!
I need your Love!
Yeah, yeah, I need your love!
Love!
High on love

Everyone love
Everyone love

Help me to love them
Everyone love
Help me to love them
Everyone love
Help me to love them, yeah
Everyone love
Bigots and Assholes
Everyone love

Man in the mirror

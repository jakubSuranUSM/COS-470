When I first met you
You were not house trained
A backwoods trier
The world's your oyster
Your time is mine
What's yours is mine all mine

There's no honour
Amongst thieves
So we worked together
A varied rich
and famous crime
You had your motives
I had mine
For a soul to find
Little piece rub off on mine

Trinkets, memorabilia
Diamonds for the taking
One mans treasure
never meant a thing
When I was housebreaking

Took a buckshot landing
From my most famous client
Must have lost it in the fall
Came away empty handed

When I first met you
I was not housetrained

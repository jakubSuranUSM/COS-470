When I hug my baby, ooh, what a thrill
When I kiss my baby, mmm, what a chill
She's got that love bug crawlin' down my spine

Well I know that she loves me
I know that she'll be true
That she loves me even more
When I whisper I ]ove you

When I hug my baby, ooh, what a thrill
When I kiss my baby, mmm, what a chill
She's got that love bug crawlin' down my spine

When I squeeze my baby, ooh, what a time
You know I'll please my baby, mmm, all the time
She's got that love bug crawlin' down my spine

Today, you're their best friend
But believe me tomorrow, they don't even know your name
Friendship is a word that has lost its meaning
And making friends a funny game

Tell me why, tell me why
It's always been the same
Tell me why, tell me why
Hello and goodbye

They came without warning, they won't leave when you want it
You wish you could beam 'em away
But when you really need them, they will never appear
And if you ask them they will never stay

Tell me why, tell me why
It's always been the same
Tell me why, tell me why
Hello and goodbye

Hello and goodbye

It's always been the same
It's always been the same

I can see by your eyes, you thought they'll never go
But tell me please where are they now
Remember me boy 'cause I told you so
But believe me you'll get through somehow

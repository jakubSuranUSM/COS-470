I should have reconsidered all those things I said I'd do
So now I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
Sweetheart I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
Because I made those changes when I thought you were untrue
But now you're gone, I've found I'm wrong
There's nothing I can do
That I made when I left you
Except to change up all those changes
I didn't stop to think, I just left without a care
And know I know you're gone and I can't find you anywhere
I should have reconsidered all those things I said I'd do
So now I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left you

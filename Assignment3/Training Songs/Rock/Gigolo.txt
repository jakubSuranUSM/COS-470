Some resurrection is no conclusion
Some poor pretension but no invention
In the night they become, just what they want
One imitation just like Roger Moore
Please tell us what they say
They tell us what to do
They're only fooling me and you

You know what I ain't
You know what I ain't
I ain't no gigolo aunt
You know what I ain't
You know what I ain't
I ain't no gigolo aunt

Ten secret agents, codes and deadly tricks
The prince of darkness from the horror flicks
The spiders web of intrigue a silent scream of dread
Oh where have they gone, lost in pity and despair
Please tell us what they say
They tell us what to do
They're only fooling me and you

You know what I ain't
You know what I ain't
I ain't no gigolo aunt
You know what I ain't
You know what I ain't
I ain't no gigolo aunt

She stands there on the stair
Nobody cares we know he's there
She's making coffee for two
Who does he fool
It's me and you
Please tell us what they say
They tell us what to do
They're only fooling me and you

You know what I ain't
You know what I ain't
I ain't no gigolo aunt

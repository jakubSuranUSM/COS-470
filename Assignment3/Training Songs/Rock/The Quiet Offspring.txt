A choice was made and it came clear to me 
The quiet offspring fucked it up again 
So I was brought up on the sunny side 
Got into fake from day one 
But I knew better then the rest of them 

Don't count the hours, don't count the days 
I don't look back in any ways 
Never cared for who or what or when or why 
Home is where I rest my head 
Never cared for who or what or when or why 
I carry on when all is said 

You said I should have learned by now 
A father's son so disobedient 
Such a burden I have been for thy 
Nothing good enough 
I packed my bags and now you wonder why 

Don't count the hours, don't count the days 
I don't look back in any ways 
Never cared for who or what or when or why 
Home is where I rest my head 
Never cared for who or what or when or why 
I carry on when all is said 

Never cared for who or what or when or why 
Never cared for who or what or when or why 
Never cared for who or what or when or why

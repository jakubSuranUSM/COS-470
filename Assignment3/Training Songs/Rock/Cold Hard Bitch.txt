Gotta leave town
Got another appointment
Spent all my rent
Girl you know I enjoyed it 

Ain't gonna hang around 'till there's nobody dancing
I don't want to hold hands and talk about our little plans, alright!

Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
Oh that was all that I need

Gonna check her out
She's my latest attraction
Gonna hang 'round
Want to get a reaction

Gonna take her home 'cause she's over romancing
Don't want to hold hands and talk about her litte plans, alright!

Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
Oh that was all that I need
I'm waiting give me
Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees

Yeah I'm waiting
Yeah I'm waiting
Yeah I'm waiting
Yeah I'm waiting

Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
Oh that was all that I need
I'm waiting give me
Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting give me.

Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light! White Heat!)
I can't stand that sound the second time around 
Met the sweetest girl
Sold me a pill
Tasted like shit
And it made me feel ill
Watch my body
Twist and jerk
I just wanna find a drug that works 

Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light! White Heat!)
I can't stand that sound the second time around 

I don't want a girl that's with the band
I just want a girl that's gonna hold my hand
No more songs about sex, drugs and rock and roll
It's boring! 

Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
Bang, bang, rock and roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light! White Heat!)
I can't stand that sound the second time around 

Once is enough!
Once is enough!
Once is enough!
Once is enough!

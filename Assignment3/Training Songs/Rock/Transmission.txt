There's no time like the present 
So face the facts and skip the legend 
All that you say 
Is a dead giveaway 
To another time 
Unobjective 
Just protective 
Of everything you find, it's fine 

I know the past is suspect 
The future hides from the public 
Out on the dancefloor 
They end the cold war 
And everything is aligned 
The soundsystem 
The latest rhythm 
At 125 

Digital recording heroes 

And I can get past all the zeroes 

Transmission

Well, rock a-baby rock rock rock
I just love the way you dance
Rock a-baby rock rock rock
Don't tell me that you can't
Rock rock rock
We're gonna rock the whole night long
Well, you dance in here you dance out there
You powder your face and you comb your hair
Oh rock - oh rock oh rock we gonna rock
Gonna rock the whole night long
Well, hit high on the floor and hold my hand so tight
I love you more and more when you dance with all your might
Ah rock rock rock gonna rock the whole night long
Put on your shoes and hit the floor
I'm telling you again like I told you before
Oh rock oh rock oh rock yes rock
Oh rock yes rock gonna rock the whole night long

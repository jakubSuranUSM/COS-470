Sometimes I feel like a Motherless Child,
Sometimes I feel like a Motherless Child
Sometimes I feel like a Motherless Child,
And I'm a long

Yes, I'm a long way from my home
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone

And I'm a long
Yes, I'm a long way from my home

Sometimes I feel like there's nobody there
Sometimes I feel like there's nobody there
Sometimes I feel like there's nobody there

And I'm a long,
Yes, I'm a long way from my home.

Married him in April, lost him in July;
Listen to my story and I'll tell you why,
They said that he'd been poaching and stealing wine,
They said I wouldn't see him for a long long time.
Chorus: They said he's gone to America,
To work the land that some called Virginia;
They said he's gone to America.
Married him in April, lost him in July;
They took him as their prisoner then told me why,
They said they had sent him where poachers go,
I asked if I could see him but they said no.
Chorus:
Married him in April, lost him in July;
Curse the men who took him, curse their wicked lie,
The night they saw him poaching and stealing wine,
Was the night he took comfort in these arms of mine.
Chorus:
Married him in April, lost him in July.

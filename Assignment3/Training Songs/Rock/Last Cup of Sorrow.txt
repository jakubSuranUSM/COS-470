This is getting old
And so are you
Everything you know 
And never knew
Will run through your fingers
Just like sand

Enjoy it while you can

Like a snake between two stones
It itches in your bones
Take a deep breath and swallow
Your sorrow
Tomorrow

So raise it up and lets propose a toast
To the thing that hurts you most

It's your last cup of sorrow 
What can you say?
Finish it today
It's your last cup of sorrow
So think of me
And get on your way

It won't begin
Until you make it end
Until you know the how the where and the when
With a new face you might surprise yourself

Like a snake between two stones
It itches in your bones
Take a deep breath and swallow
Your sorrow 
Tomorrow

So raise it up and lets propose a toast
To the thing that hurts you most

It's your last cup of sorrow
What can you say?
Finish it today
It's your last cup of sorrow
So think of me
And get on your way!

You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself

You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself

You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself
You might surprise yourself

Boring as bat shit, you people make me feel so curious
And I don't know why, you think you'll end up in the sky
Happy as Larry and riding sheep on clouds
Well, I'd prefer your enthusiasm while you're here with me

So stop, don't get carried away
Darling, don't you understand
That every time we wave our hands, we're cool
We're fucking amazing
We dropped down from some other dimension
Just to be with you

Don't stress, that's dumb
I'm here and it's nice to be alive
Chill out, it's alright
Kiss me, it's nice to be alive

Lovers need lovers and I'm impressed
By all the goods out on display, I don't know what to say
I'm thinking, I'm thinking more
I prefer your enthusiasm while you're here with me

So stop, don't get carried away
Darling, don't you understand
That every time we wave our hands, we're cool
We're fucking amazing
We dropped down from some other dimension
Just to be with you

Don't stress, that's dumb
I'm here and it's nice to be alive
Chill out, it's alright
Kiss me, it's nice to be alive
Don't stress, that's dumb
I'm here and it's nice to be alive
Chill out, it's alright
Kiss me, it's nice to be alive

It's nice to be alive
It's nice to be alive

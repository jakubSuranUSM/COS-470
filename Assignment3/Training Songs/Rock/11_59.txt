Once upon a time, 11:59, 
In a car, on a street, in a town
Solitary eyes staring back at mine 
We couldn't seem to make a sound

[Chorus]
Please, don't leave
This could be the best time of our lives, tonight
You and me
Don't let the moment pass by
Put the windows down and drive away.

The beat that my heart skipped
Was stolen by your lips
But I could never call this a crime
It's you I've been waiting for 
Like waves upon a shore
And your crashing into me
You're the only one I need

[Chorus]

She wears a locket with her name
She's waiting for the right one to give it away
She pulls the hair back from her face
She's looking at me and we're flying away

[Chorus]

This could be the best time of our lives
Best time of our lives
Best time of our lives
Best time of our lives
Best time of our lives

Once upon a time, 11:59,
In a car, on street, in a town.

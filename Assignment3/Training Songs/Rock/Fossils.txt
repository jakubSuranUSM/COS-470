I never lose my sight
The circumstances change I'll find
Another place to hide

Digging holes in fields
Telling me the truth
I need the fossils to be real

The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home
The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home

Taken back by me
Believing nothing feels like such a
Hollow way to be

I can try to hide
Everything I stand for but I
Leave it on the side

The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home
The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home

The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home
The one day I want something I just can't get
I'm a long way from home, I'm a long way from home

Hey, did somebody break your heart
With a careless word?
Did someone tear your life apart 
Never knowing you were hurt? 
Or did somebody try to break you in two
For a laugh, to see what you would do?
Well, if someone broke your heart
Let me fix it up for you. 

Anyone could look into your eyes (anyone...)
And see what you'be been through
But now you've got to realize
There's just one broken heart, not two
It's only happening to you, it's true
Don't you know what he would do? 
He's out having some fun 
While you stay at home, having none
He doesn't even know, he doesn't even care
It doesn't even matter if you're even there.

Step out, step out on him tonight
Step out, step out, step out with me now
Let me fix it up for you
Step out, step out, step out on him, girl
Step out, step out with me now
Let me fix it up for you. 

He doesn't even know; he doesn't even care
It doesn't even matter if you're even there
Tonight...
Step out, step out with me, girl
Let me fix it up for you
Step out, step out, step out...

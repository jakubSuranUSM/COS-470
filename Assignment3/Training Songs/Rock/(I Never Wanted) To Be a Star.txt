I was seventeen, 
You were working for Matthew and Son, 
The Beatles met the Queen, and I wrote 
I'm gonna get me a gun, yeah, yeah 
It was like a dream in the star machine, 
Oh, no, izitso, izitso? 

I never wanted to be a star, 
I never wanted to travel far 
I only wanted a little bit of love 
So I could put a little love in my heart 

I never wanted to be la-de-da, 
Go to parties "Avec le bourgeois" 
I only wanted to sing my song well, 
So I could ring a small bell in your heart 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

I was on the road, 
Sleeping between lorry lights, oh no 
Stone-drunk and cold, 
Heading into a bad night, yeah, yeah 
Just another bean in the star machine, hi ho, 
Here I go, here I go 

I never wanted to be a star 
Buy my mum a Ferrari car 
I only wanted to run my own race, 
So I could win a small place in your heart 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

Nature found a way, 
It picked me up off the dark side, yeah, yeah 
Showed me another day, it made me sing 
"I think I see the light" 
Not another bean in the star machine, oh no, 
This time I won't go 

I never wanted to be a star, 
I never wanted to travel far 
I only wanted a little bit of love 
So I could put a little love in my heart

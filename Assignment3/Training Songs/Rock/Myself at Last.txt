Light is slowly fading
And the night comes on so fast
I'm drowning in my dreams
It's so hard to fight the past
When all is said and done
It's so hard to count the cost

When I'm rolling down
This lonesome road
To lose myself at last

And the day that breaks before me
May never be surpassed
And the question haunting me
Is my future just my past?
So I'm screaming at the universe
Just enough to make her laugh

And I'm rolling down
This lonesome road
To lose myself at last

And with everything I've ever done
Well, I've tried to be my best
But everyone I've ever known
Has been some kind of test
When everything is said and done
It's so hard to find what's lost

I'm rolling down
This lonesome road
To lose myself at last

My dreams are only memories
But they've all gone by so fast
I was drifting on an ocean blue
Like a ship without a mast
And then you came and rescued me
And you saved my soul at last

From rolling down
This lonesome road
To find myself at last
I'm rolling down
This lonesome road
And I've found myself at last
I've found myself at last

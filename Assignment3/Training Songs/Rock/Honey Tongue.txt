My babe's got a temper but still she wants to dance
I'm not in that mood and still not ready for romance
She said, come along and dance to this song
Just don't take it too far

I said you must have dreamt
These words are heaven sent
And here she comes again
She's my honey tongue

Honey
I just made out with you
You're such a, such a honey
Who loves to see me dance

I don't need any attention, I don't want your misery
All I am is satisfaction that's my guarantee
She said, please, please I'll behave as you wish
Just don't take it too far

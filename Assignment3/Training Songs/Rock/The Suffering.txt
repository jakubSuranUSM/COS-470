Is there a word or right to say
Even in this old fashioned way?
Go make your move, girl
I'm not coming home
Would things have changed if I could've stayed?
Would you have loved me either way?
Dressed to the blues, say to day with my collar up
Decision sits, so make it quick
A breath inhaled from an air so sick
I cursed the day I had learned of the web you spun
You had your hold till bleeding

(Hey, hey) if it was up to me
I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out
Oh, I hope you're waiting
(Hey, hey) if it was up to me
I would've never walked out
So until the sun burns out
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Would we have lived as a child would care?
With this vial to drink, I dare
Only to cry all alone with your taste on tongue (oh, where have you been?)
(Oh where have you been? Oh, where have you been if it hurts to be forgiving? Bye)

Should we try this again with hope? (Bye, bye)
Or is it lost? Give up the ghost
And should I die all alone as I knew I would
Then burn in hell young sinner

(Hey, hey) if it was up to me
I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out (girl, well I know you now)
Oh, I hope you're waiting
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Listen well, will you marry me? (Not now, boy)
And are you well in the suffering?
(You've been) the most gracious of hosts
You may be invited girl, but you're not coming in

Listen well, will you marry me? (Not now, boy)
And are you well in the suffering?
(You've been) the most gracious of hosts
I may be invited girl, but I'm not coming in

(Hey, hey) if it was up to me
(You had your hold) I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out (girl, well I know you now)

(You'll burn, you know) I would've never walked out
So until the sun burns out (oh, where have you been?)
(Oh where have you been? Oh, where have you been if it hurts to be forgiving?)
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Listen well, will you marry me? (Not now, boy)
And are you well in the suffering?

I may be invited girl, but I'm not coming in
And you're not coming in

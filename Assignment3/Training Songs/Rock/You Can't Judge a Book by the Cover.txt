You can't judge an apple by looking at the tree
You can't judge honey by looking at the bee
You can't judge a sister by looking at her brother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see, oh, well, you misjudged me
I look like a farmer but I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond
You can't judge right by looking at the wrong
You can't judge one by looking at the other
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see, oh, well, you misjudged me
I look like a farmer but I'm a Lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane
You can't judge a woman by looking at her man
You can't judge a daughter by looking at her mother
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
Oh can't you see, oh, well, you misjudged me
I look like a farmer but I'm a lover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

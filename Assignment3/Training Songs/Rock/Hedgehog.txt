It's no fun, it's no fun
Reading fortune cookies to yourself
Are you a fox or a hedgehog
Do you care anymore

Wastin' time, wastin' time
Wastin' time all the while
I don't know what you're sayin'
But I hate it anyway

A celebrity friendship
And another fashion victem
He's annoying, she's a liar
I don't know how she picked him

Wastin' time, wastin' time
Wastin' time all the while
I don't know what you're sayin'
But I hate it anyway

Can you make time for me
Would you make time for me?
I will wait patiently
It's no good
It's no fun

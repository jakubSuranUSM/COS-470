The summer's here but I'm just sitting in my room
I sit and wonder if you think of me as I think of you
I'm lost without you, I don't know what I'm gonna do

When I had you around I never realized
I know I blew it and I'll never get another chance
Now the summer's here and you're with somebody else

And now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

I've got your number but I haven't got the guts to call
I know it's up to me but I just stare at the wall
I know it's useless and I should just forget it all

When I was with you I never took it seriously
When you told me you'd had it and that you would leave
I said well baby just go, I'm better off alone

But now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

The summer's here but I'm just sitting in my room
I sit and wonder if you think of me as I think of you
I'm lost without you, I don't know what I'm gonna do

Now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

Now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

Over 'fore it started
Over 'fore it started

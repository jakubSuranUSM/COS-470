When she walks out all the boys on the block start to yell out
They open up their mouths but they don't know what they're talking about
She's in little need of someone to hold tonight
But if you make a move I'm willing to bet that she just might
Everytime she looks away you look away too
I know what you're thinking you don't know what to do...

You got to say.... (x2)
I want you more than anything (x3)
I do I do I do!

Time is wasting opportunity knocks then it's gone
Makes sense to speak from the heart 'cause you can never go wrong
Too many people telling too many lies
Go with what you know when the feeling's inside
I know you can do it if you start thinking "Yes"
Yes I can, Yes I will, Yes I will pass the test..

You got to say.... (x4)
I want you more than anything (x3)
I do I do I do!

I really really do!

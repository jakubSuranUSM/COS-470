Somewhere in the end of all this hate
There's a light ahead that shines into this grave
That's in the end of all this pain

In the night ahead, there's a light upon this house on a hill
Living, living still, their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine, I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

Somewhere in the end we're all insane
To think that light ahead will save us from this grave
That's in the end of all this pain

In the night ahead, there's a light upon this house on a hill
Living, living still, their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine, I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

I am not afraid, I won't burn out in this place
My intention is to fade and I will, I will

In this house on a hill
The dead are living still, their intention is to kill and they will, they will
Keep your children safe inside, out of pocket, out of mind
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

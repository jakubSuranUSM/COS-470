I swear I've drunk enough for both of us tonight
But I'll buy another round before it's closing time
Cause I know oh oh, baby, I'm getting better
And you know oh oh, that maybe I'm feeling better

And if I leave this shitty pub without a trace
My brand of cigarettes will lead you to my place
So who knows oh ohs, maybe I'm feeling better
And you know oh oh, baby, I'm getting better

And I feel alive with you
Baby, I'm getting better
And I feel alive with you
Baby, I'm getting better
Do do do do do do do do do

I think I've seen enough to keep my big mouth shut
Before you can call me a man
How many songs does it take to understand?

And I feel alive with you
Baby, I'm getting better
And I feel alright with you
Baby, I'm getting there
Do do do do do do do do do

Its nothing to do with the weather
Now baby I'm getting better
Don't look so down,
So maybe I'm feeling better

Now I dream that I'm with you
Baby, I'm getting better
And I feel alive with you
Baby, I'm getting better
Do do do do do do do do do
Baby, I'm getting better
Baby, I'm getting there

Light it up

We've been a little more than just friends,
And in most cases that's just where it ends
But I took the time to stoke up your flame
Can I get a witness to back up my claim?
Now I'm standing so close to your fire
If I say that I quit ya, you can call me a liar!
Now we've been a little more than just friends
And where we go now I guess that depends
If I get myself caught up in your scene-
Black hair, black coffee, and hard nicotine
I can't sleep
I can't eat
Need you to hold my hand before I can cross the street!

Oh yeah, she's all that
Oh yeah, she's all that
Sugar, you're my comfort, whoa yeah, makes me me
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
I'm her silver dollar, she's my slot machine
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah why not? Come on she's my nicotine

That's right

We've been a little more than just friends
Where we go now I guess that depends
Uh huh 
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
Sugar, you're my comfort, whoa yeah, makes me me
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
She's my V8 motor, I'm her gasoline
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
I'm her silver dollar she's my slot machine
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah she's all that
Oh yeah why not? Come on she's my nicotine
Nicotine
My nicotine

Oh yeah she's
Yes she's
Yes she is!

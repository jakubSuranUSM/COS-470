Left home and kept on leaving
Walked off into this morning
Sunrise cuts the darkness
Steps and stares with well worn warning
Touch down, a perfect landing
Missing but he's still standing, barely

English sunset, sun in your eyes
Dusk sweeps over us tonight
Rainy Brixton holidays
Red brick parks and alleyways
Lion's Roar silenced and still
A test of strength, test of our will, waiting

I'll aim right for you (repeat)
A waiting van, a passing phase
Phone calls from you to pass the days
From caffeine highs to midnight lows
Punch drunk heartache blow by blow
I'll wait for you in hotel rooms
In rain soaked days we pass the gloom
The Northern Star tonight will set the course

English sunset, sweet goodbyes
The wind is in our sails tonight
Rainy Brixton memories
I pull myself closer to me
The Lion's Roar in vain tonight
A distant call, a distant light, someday

I'll aim right for you (repeat)
A waiting van, a passing phase
Phone calls from you to pass the days
From caffeine highs to midnight lows
Punch drunk heartache blow by blow
I'll wait for you in hotel rooms
In rain soaked days we pass the gloom
The Northern Star tonight will set the course

Well I'm so laid back, I'm my own worst enemy, keep it all inside bottled up bad energy,
Then I hear the sound of this musical amphetamine, 
Diggin' at my soul like the tracks full of ketamine 
Never slowing down fast forward's all I've ever seen, pockets never dry 
Man you can call me evergreen, two bottles of wine, three teas, and some Vicodin 
Every single night same thing until I'm one eying, 
Always keep my shit locked tight no oxygen
If you don't believe me, go kick rocks with some moccasins
Couldn't find a hipster to fix gears on my rockin' man
Everywhere I go I got the whole room talkin' man.

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through
So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be 
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally.

Said you wanna play this game with me but you got way too much lag 
Wish you had my gamer tag, wish I could be cut in half, half to write your songs for you
The other half to spit your raps, put this on my epitaph I don't give a rat's ass
I don't even rhyme I just whine really fast, and I ain't got the time, 
I'm just sand in the glass,
This time you shall not pass 'cause I'm the dragon smog, 
I'm a small axe move big trees you still play with Lincoln logs
Why don't you go take a jog better yet go kick some rocks
Let me guess you got a blog, follow trends like it's your job
I prefer to be myself you wanna be like everybody else
Like a ticket, need some help gonna get scalped Indian pelt.

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through
So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
And every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally

This is how it's supposed to be, carried by this melody
Exactly where I'm supposed to be, my feet walk steady to my own heart beat
And I will carry on through the sounds of my soul, 
The love that we give will be repaid in full
All that we are is under our control

So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be 
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally.

Endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be 
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally.

I've been going through hell
And it's starting to tell.
Want to stand up and yell
(I wish I had a soul to sell)

All I see is down on me,
I don't need down on me,
Everybody is down on me,
Get out of my tree, stop crowding me.

Ain't it always the way
How people treat you today
F*ck you over and say,
"Now go and have a real nice day!" 

They must be down on me,
Can't you see down on me,
I don't need them down on me
Let me breathe, stop drowning me.

They must be down on me,
He and she down on me,
My family is down on me, 
Even Mr. T is down on me!

'Cause IÂ´m doing it tough 
I thought of turning to drugs
But there is never enough
To keep my problems beneath the rug.

L-S-D down on me 
P-C-P down on me
T-H-C down on me
M-S-G down on me
X-T-C down on me
F-A-B down on me
R-I-P down on me
M-T-V go down on me

In the morning when you start your day, do you feel yourself quite lost?
In a world of countless millions, on the tide of your life you're tossed
Don't think you're getting nowhere, you know we all must start
From very small beginnings, off to a better part.

In the rush and hustle of your day, when all of your world seems mad
Do you look at everything you see, and know that it's not so bad?
Just take your time and work it out, you know what's in your mind
From very small beginnings, off to a better time.

Take your time and work it out, then maybe you'll see
You're not wasting your time going 'round
Just acting a play, you're finding your way
You're making it pay, you're making today.

In the darkness of a brand new day, when everything's hushed and still
Can you look at everything you see, and know that it's all worthwhile?
The dark of night is fading, back creeping up's the sun
It starts from small beginnings, full spreads to everyone.

Take your time and work it out, then maybe you'll see
You're not wasting your time going 'round
Just acting a play, you're finding your way
You're making it pay, you're making today.

In the darkness of a brand new day, when everything's hushed and still
You can look around at everything you see, and know that it's all worthwhile?
The dark of night is fading, back creeping up's the sun
It starts from small beginnings, full spreads to everyone.

In the morning when you start your day
In the morning when you start your day
In the morning when you start your day

In the morning when you start your day, do you feel yourself quite lost?
In a world of countless millions, on the tide of your life you're tossed
Don't think you're getting nowhere, you know we all must start
From very small beginnings, off to a better part.

Do, do, do, do do do
Do, do, do, do do do
Do, do, do, do do do
Do, do, do

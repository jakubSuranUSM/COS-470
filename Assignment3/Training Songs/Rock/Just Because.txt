I'd better watch out
When was the last time
You did anything
Not for me
Or anyone else

Nobody has to

Oh, you
I think you really should have known

Just because

And we passed around gifts
That was a long time, ago
And you're feeling fit

Oh, you really should have known

Just because
Just because
Just because

Oh yeah
Oh, you better watch out

I was there
When you shone as bright as Bethlehem from afar
I was there
When you were young and strong and perverted
And everything that makes a young man a star
Oh, you were a star

I was there
And I swear to God and on my mother's grave
On everything I have or ever will embrace
I was there
And I saw it with my own two eyes

And now it's all around me, it's all around me
I'm surrounded
And now it's all around me, it's all around me
You surround me like a circle

Do do do do do do 

I was there
Come on, tell me I wasn't worth stickin' it out for
Well, I was there
And I know I was worth it, 'cause if I wasn't worth it
That makes me worse off than you are

It's all around me, it's all around me
I'm surrounded
You know it's all around me, it's all around me
You surround me like a circle

But don't you lose sight of me now
Don't you lose sight of me now

Do do do do do do do
Don't lose sight of me now

'Cause I was there
When they dropped the bomb 
You know I remember the bomb
And I still hear the bomb 
And I still fight the bomb 
You know I still fear the bomb 
You know I still hate the bomb 
Sometimes I still get the call

So don't you lose sight of me now
Don't you lose sight of me now

You know you're all around me, you're all around me
(Don't you lose )
I'm surrounded
(Sight of me now)
You know you're all me, you're all around me
(Don't you lose )
I'm surrounded
(Sight of me now)
You know you're all around me, you're all around me
(Don't you lose )
I'm surrounded
(Sight of me now)
Now it's all around me, you're all around me
You surround me like a circle

I'm surrounded, oh

Ah ah, like a circle around me 

La la la la la la la la

All around me now

Oh

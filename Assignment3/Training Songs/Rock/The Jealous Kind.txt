Girl, don't be angry if I seem rude
Each time we meet
A boy that you once knew
[??] just to be so close to you
It's just that I'm so afraid
Someone might steal you away, I'd lose my mind
So please forgive me for the way I act sometimes
I'm the jealous kind
If you only knew where I lived
And didn't mind
[?] can't you see [??]
That I'm losing my mind
I want you all to myself
I don't want you shackin' with nobody else
I can't help it if it's the way I act sometimes
Because I'm the jealous kind
You know I love you girl
Just one more thing now,If you only knew
How much it hurts me just to hear you say
How, when we first met
I can't think that those were the good old days
Why must you hurt me so
I can't stand it no more, I'm tryin'
So please, I can't control these tears in my eyes
Lord I'm the jealous kind
I love you baby
You know you've got me baby
You know I'm the jealous kind

It goes over my head
It goes over my head
I don't understand I word I said
Just went over my head

I can stick around me
I don't want this to be
Walk right over and get it for free
I can stick around me

What a way for me to be myself
I'm a victory for my condition
I can pirouette to something else
I can get away or reposition

I'm astounded I can do it alone
You're around and I'm not ready to go
Too completely of my face and alone
It's all I lie around

I've got somewhere to go
I don't need you to know
Stop believing I'm going to slow
I've got somewhere to go

What a way for me to be myself
I'm a victory for my condition
I can pirouette to something else
I can get away or reposition

I'm astounded I can do it alone
You're around and I'm not ready to go
To completely of my face and alone
Its all I lie around

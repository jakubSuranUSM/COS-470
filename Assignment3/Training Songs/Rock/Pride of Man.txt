Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
Can't you see that flash of fire
10 times brighter than the day
And behold a mighty city
Broken in the dust again

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
Babylon is laid to waste
Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are all beaten down
Their kings are all fallin' in the ways

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
Terror is on ever sign
Though our leaders are dismayed
All those who place their faith in fire
In fire their fate shall be repayed

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
And shout a warning to the nation
That the sword of God is raised
Yes, Babylon backed by it's city
Rich in treasure wide in fame

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

And it shall cause your tower to fall
Make of you a pyre of flame
Oh, you who dwell on many waters
Rich in treasure wide in fame
You bow unto your, your god of gold
Your pride of might shall be a shame
For only God can lead his people
Back unto the earth again

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

The holy mountain be restored
Have mercy on the people
The people
Lord

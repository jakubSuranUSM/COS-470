If some guys tells you, I don't care
And tells you lies while I'm not there
don't talk to him
If he tells you, I'm untrue
Then darling, here what you must do
don't talk to him
And if he tells you I've been seen
Walking round with Sue and Jean
he's lying again (lying again)
Do anything that you want to
But darling, this I beg of you
don't talk to him

If you hear the words he has to say
Hell break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong
While we are far apart

So just remember whatd I say
(And) Trust in me while I'm away for Ill be true
And just remember my true love is
Brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes and count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him

(instrumental break)
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes and count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him

If you hear the words he has to say
Hell break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong
While we are far apart

So just remember whatd I say
Trust in me while I'm away for Ill be true
And just remember my true love is
Brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes, count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him

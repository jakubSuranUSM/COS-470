Fever days are here
Blackout memory encompassing
Glamour casts a light on what is secret
Limited to none on this sterile ground we walk
You remind me of
You remind me of something I’ve lost

I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I'm only a fleeting thought

Room of many bodies, still no one that I could talk to
A million faces here, but I can only pick out a few
Through the photographs, joy encircling
I found you down by the waterfront
Victim of underhand, so subordinate
All of your time is the only thing you've got
I'm a slave to odds, giving everything I've got
You remind me of
You remind me of something I'm not

I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I am only a fleeting thought

I can feel you breathing into me
Our existence separates
I can feel you now, near and hollowed out
Our existence separates

I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I can’t give anything
I'm only a fleeting thought

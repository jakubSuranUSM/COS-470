You ride on the swing 
In and out of the bars
Capturing moments of life in a jar
Playing with children, 
Acting as stars
Guiding your visions to heaven 
And heaven is in your mind
Take extra care not to lose what you feel
The apple you're eating is simple and real
So water the flowers that grow at you heel
Guiding your visions to heaven 
And heaven is in your mind

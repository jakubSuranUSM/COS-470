The cold in her eyes as she walks the hungry mile
The fear in her eyes small girl tears thinking
Of her hometown
Take my hand and as you close your eyes
And if we ever get back to the real world
I won't let the shadows near you

And I climb the mountain I stumbled
In the valleys
And if you should ever lose your strength
Be brave my little angel
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you
To fallen dreams and angels
I'll hold your head so close to me
Let all those years of frustration
Come flooding out and take
What you need from me
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you
For fallen dreams and angels

And I climb the mountain I stumbled
In the valleys
And if you should ever lose your strength
Be brave my little angel
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you
For fallen dreams and angels

I'll hold your hand gonna take you home

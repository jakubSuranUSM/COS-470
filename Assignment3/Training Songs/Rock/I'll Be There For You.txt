When you feel like you're drowning
And waves crash all around
I?ll be a rock you can stand on
I'm your solid ground

And love knows no reason
Love knows no rhyme
So just reach out
And I?ll be there, time after time

I?ll be there for you wherever
Whenever, whatever for you
I?ll be there for you, whatever you do

People call us a family
And some say that we're friends
But it doesn't matter to me
?Cause there's just no end

I?ll be there for you wherever
Whenever, whatever for you
I?ll be there for you, whatever you do

In your darkest day I?ll send you the sun
And take away the rain
And whenever life is too much to bear
Open your heart and I will be there

I?ll be there for you wherever
Whenever, whatever for you
I?ll be there for you, whatever you do
Whenever for you, forever

I?ll be there for you wherever
Whenever, whatever for you
I?ll be there for you
Here is my heart, I give it to you

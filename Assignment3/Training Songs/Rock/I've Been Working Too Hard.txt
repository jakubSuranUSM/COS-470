Now brothers and sisters gathered here today
I got something I want to share with you
Now let me warn you it's a sad, sad story
But I swear every word is true
Now, money and me don't talk too much
We never got along too well
But when I got some in my pocket
I seem to have a lot more friends
I pay the landlord and the taxman
And it's time to go to work again
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I need somebody
Let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I got to get just a little bit out of control
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
Gotta find somebody just to soothe my soul

I had a young girl back in Cleveland
My baby would not be true
It took a while to realize
The evil that some girls do
I told her mother and father what I did
They said what kind of work is that?
They said I just didn't have the fear of God
They could tell by the way I laughed
She ran off and married a preachers son
In a ragtop cadillac

Can I get a witness?
You know I need a witness
I need somebody
Let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I got to get just a little bit out of control
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
Gotta find somebody just to soothe my soul
Well people I've learned my lesson
And I've learned my lesson well
Some girls want your money
But your money is the Devil himself
But life can get confusing
Whether you're high, low, rich or poor
I swear when you get right down to it
There's only one thing I know for sure
Before this night is over
I'll be in trouble and I'm lookin' for more, more, more

Can I get a witness?
I got to find a witness
I need somebody
Let me hear you say 
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I got to get just a little bit out of control
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
I've been workin' too hard
Gotta find somebody just to soothe my soul

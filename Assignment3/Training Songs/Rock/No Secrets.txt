Amanda the actress waits at the station
She's drifting with nothing to do
With dilettante steps she's quick to accept
The weather and times turning screw
She lives in a tower with defences
She learned from her mother and friends
She walks like a pharaoh, dresses in day-glo
When she's in pain she pretends

That late in the night when the lights are all out
Then she slips off her stockings and shoes
She makes you her lover and lets you discover
The smiles she keeps, she keeps for you

She keeps no, she keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

Facing the morning, wearing her shadow
She throws her dice and I-ching
Success in Japan, a rescuing man
Knows she won't change anything

'Cause late in the night when the lights are all out
Then she slips off her stockings and shoes
She makes you her lover and lets you discover
The smiles she keeps, she keeps for you

She keeps no, she keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you
She keeps no secrets from you
She keeps no secrets from you
She keeps no secrets from you

Can you please tell me what the time is?

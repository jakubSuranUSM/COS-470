I used to think the world was flat 
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd 
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning 
Used to look in on the children at night 
In the glow of their Donald Duck light 
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning 
But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning 
The tide is turning 

Satellite buzzing through the endless night 
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights 
Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning 
Who is the strongest, who is the best 
Who holds the aces, the East or the West 
This is the crap our children are learning 
But oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning 
The tide is turning 
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning 

Now the satellite's confused 
'cause on Saturday night 
The airwaves were full of compassion and light 
And his silicon heart warmed 
To the sight of a billion candles burning 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the tide is turning 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the tide is turning 
The tide is turning Billy 

I'm not saying that the battle is won 
But on Saturday night all those kids in the sun 
Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the War Lords 
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning 
The tide is turning Sylvester 

The tide is turning. 

"That's it!" 

"Now the past is over but you are not alone 
Together we'll fight Sylvester Stallone 
We will not be dragged down in his South China 
Sea of macho bullshit and mediocrity"

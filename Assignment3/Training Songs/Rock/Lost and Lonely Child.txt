Lost and lonely child, living in a world of fear
Lose yourself in another day
Find out there's another way
Lost and lonely child, living in a world of fear
Lose yourself in another day
Find out there's another way

My oh my, you look so blue
Just turn and look my way, a smile will do
Catch it now, has to be soon
Or lonely hours will be your doom

Lost and lonely child won't you realize we're all the same
Realize it's just a game
Left in our rooms we're all the same

When your sad, feeling blue
Don't feel sorry 'cause it's up to you
Every man and boy spends a night alone
All the same alone in our rooms

My oh my, you look so blue
Just turn and look my way, a smile will do
Catch it now, has to be soon
Or lonely hours will be your doom

Lost and lonely child, living in a world of fear
Lose yourself in another day
Find out there's another way
Lost and lonely child, living in a world of fear
Lose yourself in another day
Find out there's another way

Lost and lonely child
Your a lost and lonely child
Look my way, and a smile will do
And I'll help you pull through
Lost and lonely child

Well of course I miss you, baby
I've been thinking lately
 That you don't need me anymore
You'd be better with Fred Astaire 
He could take you anywhere
If you ask him to

And God knows 
That its a common misconception 
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out for breakfast 
But he could take you 'round the world

Fred Astaire's the man for you

Well, he could buy you a diamond ring
Or he could get you anything
If you ask him to
He probably know how to dance
And he could fly you to France 
And you could do it all night long

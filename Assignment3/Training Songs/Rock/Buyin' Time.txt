Unless you believe in magic
There ain't much left you can be
A skeptic or a fool
Have you been watching your TV
Incredible is all I think of
Did I really see
Wordless faces double talkin'
A runnin' it down to me...
About buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time
People goin' hungry
Ain't no jobs, they's in the street
Nobody's got no answer
They're just staring at their feet
Ain't no doubt about it
Things are lookin' pretty bleak
An' everybody's scufflin' hard
Tryin' to make ends meet
About buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time
It happened once before, you know
In 1932
But now there's so many more of us
There's something we gotta do
Something radical, something different
Got to hit on something new
America, the dream is lost
And it's killin' me and you
About buyin' time
Brother can you spare a dime
Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time

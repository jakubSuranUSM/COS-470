All alone you say  
That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must  be part of one another
All alone you say
The power is perfection
Is the power of peace  or merely the connection
To the God of love  that powers the protection
From the tide of life that flows in each direction
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction
All alone you say

That you don't want no other
So the lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must  be part of one another
When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find the right direction

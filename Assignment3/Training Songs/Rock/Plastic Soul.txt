Didn’t I see you fighting in the war back in 1942?
Every time I shape shift into form
I’m standing there right next to you
I keep searching all these dying stars
Just to get a glimpse of you
And all I have to do to drift away
Is close my eyes and think of you

Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her

Didn’t I see you tearing down the wall back in 1989?
Didn’t you feel my hand against your heart
When I told you you were always mine?
The best days of all my lives were spent dreaming of the afterlife
The best days of all my lives were spent dreaming of the afterlife
The best days of all my lives were spent dreaming of the afterlife

Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her
Whenever I think of her

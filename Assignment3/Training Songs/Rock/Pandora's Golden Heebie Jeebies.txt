I have walked along the paths of dark and light
And I have seen the sunrise and I've seen the night
I've seen the calm before the storm and then the fight
And now I see the sparrows as they begin to fly
And all that's left for me to do
Is cry

I've had my view of happiness and my view of despair
I've cleaned out all the cobwebs and I've learned how to compare
I've seen all of the circles and I've had my last affair
And now I see the sparrows as they begin to fly
And all that's left for me to do
Is cry

Thinking that I was lost then finding the end to all beginnings
Gave to me the key, made of lead and golden
Freeing locks, Pandora's boxes, devils are expended

And I'm finally free

And when all the tears are finally cried
And I am finally clean inside
The gentle winds will come and they will dry my mind
And I will see the sparrow that need no longer fly
And all that will be left for me to do
Is die

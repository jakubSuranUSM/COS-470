If I only knew what I know
 I would not have done what I did.
 You said all along I was wrong
 But I went and did it anyway. Yes, I went
and did it anyway.
 But if only... (you should listen)
 But if only... (stop and think)
 I was in control (so I thought)
 With a foolproof plan - what a joke!
 Proving what a fool I can be
 As it all exploded in my face.
 Whatever made me do it anyway?
 But if only... (time's a-wasting)
 But if only... (Just move on)
 But if only... (No use chasing)
 But if only... (What is gone)
 Oh, you sentimental fool,
 You're finding out life can be cruel,
 You cannot bend the rules.
 Oh, you sentimental fool,
 You find some coal and think that you'll
 Create a precious jewel.
 You sentimental fool!
 But if only... (something ventured)
 But if only... (nothing gained)
 But if only... (You were captured)
 But if only... (By your game)
 Oh, you temperamental fool,
 You've got to keep your engine cool -
 You're burning too much fuel.
 Oh, you temperamental fool
 You think you'll find somebody who'll
 Be warm when you are cool.
 You temperamental fool!
 Picking myself up off the ground
 Everybody knows how that feels!
 To be wrong again, as I know I will
 It really doesn't matter anyway
 But if only... (time's a wasting)
 But if only... (just move on)
 But if only... (no use chasing)
 But if only... (what is gone)
 But if only... (catching rainbows)
 (can't be done)
 But if only... (fleeting haloes)
 (of the sun)

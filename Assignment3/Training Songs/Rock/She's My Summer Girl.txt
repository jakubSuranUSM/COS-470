11 bees, 4 wasps, a turtle
11 bees and a bumblebee

Well, I met her at the grad night party this year
(De dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, de dumb, dumb, dum)
I held her real tight and whispered in her ear
"Come on and be my summer girl"

She's my summer girl, you know we're havin' fun
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

I take her out surfin' with all the guys
(De dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, de dumb, dumb, dum)
And man, you oughta see them roll their eyes
At my sweet little summer girl

She's my summer girl, you know we're havin' fun
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

Ooh, de dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, de dumb, dumb, dumb
Ooh, she's my summer girl

She's my summer girl, you know we're havin' fun
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

I wonder how it's gonna be when summer's through
(De dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, de dumb, dumb, dum)
I have to quit all the groovy things we do
And forget my summer girl

She's my summer girl, you know we're havin' fun
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

She's my summer girl, you know we're havin' fun
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

She's my summer girl, ooh
She's my summer girl, to me she's no.1

Sing to the fallen eagle
Helicopters fly
Chase him 'round the mountains
Chase him till he dies

They say that it's good sportin'
Shootin' him on the wing
Above the roar and clatter
You can hear your rifle sing

His death song
It won't be long

Sing to the western rancher
The eagle takes his lamb
He's got a thousand others
He don't give a damn

He get up with the sunrise
Everybody gather around
Kill him with the first shot
He'll turn and bring you down

Down down
Crash on the ground

Sing to the noble eagle
Help is on the way
A government team of experts
Is a rushin' to your aid

I know you're not excited
An eagle is no waif
Fly on up to Canada
This country isn't safe

Anymore
That's for sure

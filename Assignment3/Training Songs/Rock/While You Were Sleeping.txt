While you were sleeping your babies grew
The stars shined and the shadows moved
Time flew the phone rang
There was a silence when the kitchen sang
Its songs competed like kids for space
We stared for hours in our maker?s face
They gave us picks said "go mine the sun
And go gold and come back when you're done"
Uh oh

While you were sleeping you tossed you turned
You rolled your eyes as the world burned
The heavens fell the earth quaked
I thought you must be but you weren't awake, no
You were dreaming you ignored the sun
You grew your power garden for your little ones
And you found brides for them on Christmas Eve
They hung young Cain from the Adam trees
And danced uh oh
While you were sleeping I tossed and I turned too
I closed my eyes but the future burned through
The planet turned a hair grey as I relived the day

While you were sleeping the money died
Machines were harmless and the earth sighed
The wind you swept sound and gravity brought my love
Around
The oceans rose sang about decay
The witches flew and the mermaids stayed
Full of dreams you overslept
In keeping with the quiet through the walls I crept
I walked on tip-toes sent darkness swirling over all
The kitchen
In the early morning
Uh oh uh oh

I'll never catch up to you who sleep so sound
My yawns are useless my heart beats too loud
To go to sleep my mind's too proud to bow out
While you were sleeping the time changed
All your things were rearranged
Your vampire mirrors face to face
They saw forever out into space and found you dreaming
In black and white
While it rained in all the colors of the night
Uh oh uh oh

I watched the tv?s memories champion ships vanish to sea
Can it be my honey between you and me
So I waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by
Sunrise
And I made a death soup for life
For my father?s ill widowed wife
Did you have that strangest dream before you woke
'Cause in your gown you had the butterfly stroke
Did it escape you like some half-told joke
When you reached for your plume of smoke

And it'll haunt you my honey bee
Anyone who's anyone has that same dream
Were you falling were you flying and were you calling
Out or were you dying
But thank god you're up now let's stay this way
Else there'll be no mornings and no more days
'Cause when we?re dreaming the babies grow
The stars shine and the shadows flow
Time flies the phone rings there is a silence
When everybody tries to sing
Uh oh uh oh

Just 'cause I ain't never â??ad, no, 
Nothing worth having
Never ever, never ever
You ain't got no call not to think 
I wouldn't fall
Into thinking that 
I ain't too clever
And it ain't not having 
One thing nor another
Neither, either is it anything, whatever
And it's not not knowing that 
There ain't nothing showing
And I answer to the name 
Of Trever, however

Just 'cause I ain't never said, no, 
Nothing worth saying
Never ever, never ever, never ever
Things â??ave got read into what I never sad, 
Till me mouth becomes me â??ead
Which ain't not all that clever
And it's not not saying 
One thing nor another
Neither, either is it anything 
I haven't said, whatever
And it ain't not proving 
That me mind ain't moving
And I answer to the name 
Of Trever, however

Knock me down with a feather
Clever Trevor
Widebrows wonder whether 
Clever Trevor's clever
Either have they got
Nor neither haven't not
Got no right to make a clot 
Out of Trevor

Why should I feel bad 
About something I ain't â??ad
Such stupidness is mad 
'Cause nothing underfoot
Comes to nothing less to add 
To a load of old toot
And I ain't half not half 
'Cause there's nowhere to put it
Even if I â??ad I'm a bit of a Jack the Lad

Knock me down with a feather
Clever Trevor
Widebrows wonder whether 
Clever Trevor's clever
Either have they got
Nor neither haven't not
Got no right to make a clot
Out of Trevor

Also, it takes much longer 
To get up north, the slow way

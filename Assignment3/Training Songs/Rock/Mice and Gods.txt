Silver women on the Omni magazine.
They got the future precisely laid out as I need.
That Lux Aeterna sound is so frightening.
Holding hands with Lucifer is never that enlightening.

So fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Fire it and the flesh be damned.
Fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Yeah, that's the ticket now kick out the jams.

Engineer the future now.
Damn tomorrow, future now!
Throw the switches, prime the charge.
Yesterday's for mice and gods.

Life inside the biosphere, dodecahedron fever's here.
Sporting scarlet letters of genetic imperfection, dear.
Love child in the reeds, take a sample for the breed.
Should have left him in the stream, cooing at the smitten queen.

So fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Fire it and the flesh be damned.
Fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Yeah, that's the ticket now kick out the jams.

Engineer the future now.
Damn tomorrow, future now!
Throw the switches, prime the charge.
Yesterday's for mice and gods.

Slowly, broken windows returning to the sand.
The economic factors are no longer relevant.
That empty city sound is so frightening.
Neolithic fear is such a motivating factory.

So fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Fire it and the flesh be damned.
Fire it up. (Fire it up, fire it up)
Yeah, that's the ticket now kick out the jams.

Engineer the future now.
Damn tomorrow, future now!
Throw the switches, prime the charge.
Yesterday's for mice and gods.

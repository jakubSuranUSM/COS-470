This winter is rising
And you're not here
Sweetly leave.
Scarlet red.

(So sweet so sweet!)

This winter is rising
And your not here
Sweetly leave.
Scarlet red.

The moon is dark
And I
I can't sleep

The moon is dark
The moon is dark
And we can't sleep

These conversations kill
You put me down for the last time
These conversations kill
These conversations kill
And you had me at point blank range
Square between the eyes
You let me go your feelings change
But I can't help mine
I can't help mine.

I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go

This winter is rising
And you're not here
This winter is rising
And you're not here

so just leave
Lets just leave
Don't pull us out
Don't pull us out.

These conversations kill
You put me down for the last time
These conversations kill
These conversations kill
And you had me at point blank range
Square between the eyes
You let me go your feelings change
But I can't help mine
I can't help mine.

(It just hurts my pride to say
You're alive)

I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go
I'm having to let go

and I was sweetly
Rejected
Oh I sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell through your hands
And I was sweetly
Rejected
Oh I sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell through your hands
And I was sweetly
Rejected
Oh I sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell through your hands
And I was sweetly
Rejected
Oh I sweetly
Sweetly fell
Fell through your hands

And there's a melody
That I long to hear
And that a melody
That goes like this,
Like this

Life is fast, life is strange
Every breath is filled with happiness or pain
The story goes till you reach the end
Why give up when there's a chance to start again?

How many times do we need to hear it?
There's a light out there, no need to fear it

Fading in, fading out, isn't that what life's about?
First you're here, then you're gone
Still the world goes on and on

But that's all right, I'm here right now
It takes so long sometimes to figure out
Fading in and fading out

Lightening strikes and shines so bright
But when it's gone, we're never left without the light

But I believe there's more than this
It all can't be just show biz

Fading in, fading out, isn't that what life's about?
First you're here, then you're gone
Still the world goes on and on

But that's all right, I'm here right now
It takes so long sometimes to figure out
Fading in and fading out

Tell me, why we're here?
All we really need is love
And when I disappear
I pray that I have left enough

Fading in, fading out, isn't that what life's about?
First you're here, then you're gone
Still the world goes on and on

But that's all right, I'm here right now
It takes so long sometimes to figure out
Fading in and fading out

All we really need is love
Fading in and fading out
All we really need is love
Fading in and fading out

All we really need is love
Fading in and fading out

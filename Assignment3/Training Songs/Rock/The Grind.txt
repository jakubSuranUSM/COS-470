I walked all day tryin' to find me work
I must have knocked on one-hundred doors
Would have swallowed my pride for some money
And be satisfied sweepin' the floors

Mister Broken-Glass
Mister Silver-And-Gold
Mister Bustin'-My-Ass
Mister All-You-Can-Hold

I spent last night sleepin' on a park bench
'til a copy came and moved me along
Told him I was botherin' nobody
Yes, he told me I was dead wrong

Mister Broken-Glass
Mister Silver-And-Gold
Mister Bustin'-My-Ass
Mister All-You-Can-Hold

Everywhere, I get the same kind of answer
"Not now" or "Maybe then"
Well, me time is runnin' out on me people,
Yes, me people
If you're down and without a friend

Mister Broken-Glass
Mister Silver-And-Gold
Mister Bustin'-My-Ass
Mister All-You-Can-Hold

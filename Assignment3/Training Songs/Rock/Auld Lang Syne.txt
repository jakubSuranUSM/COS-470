Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And days of auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne.
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
For the sake of old lang syne.

We twa hae run about the braes,
And pulled the gowans fine
We've wandered many a weary fit,
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne

We twa hae paddled in the burn,
Frae morning sun 'til dine
But seas between us broad have roared
Since auld lang syne.

Aye and surely you'll be your pint stowp!
And surely I'll be mine!
We'll take a right gude-willie waught,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne

And here's a hand, my trusty friend
And gie's a hand o' thine!
We'll take cup o' kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

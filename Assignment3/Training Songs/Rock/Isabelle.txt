Isabelle, 
You know me, Isabelle.
Please don't tell on me.
Isabelle,
You know me, Isabelle.
Please don't tell on me.

Well you can't concentrate,
Like a women in love.
Should the sky turn pale,
Up up up up above?
There's a distant correlation
In the lives that we share.
But a voice in the trees
Says, Ã¢??Pack up pack up and leave.'

I gave you this with confidence.
I've kissed your lips a thousand times.

Isabelle, 
You know me Isabelle.
Please don't tell on me.
Isabelle,
You know me Isabelle.
Don't you tell on me.

There's a knife in the road,
And I'm sure that it's grown,
To the point where we're all cutting drawing straws.
I've been distant and impatient, 
Not restrained like my lawn,
So turn me on and show me, show me some more.

Because I gave you this with confidence,
I've kissed your lips a thousand times.
Bow to the king, he knows you're keen,
He's telling everyone here.

Isabelle, 
You know me Isabelle.
Please don't tell on
Isabelle,
You know me Isabelle,
You know me Isabelle,
You know me.

So you were born in an electrical storm
Took a bite out the sun
And saw your future in a machine built for two.
Now your rays make me kind of go crazy
Shock and awe and amaze me
Just a ticker tape parade and me

But something was wrong,
Till you tap-danced on the air, in the night,
Screaming at the top of your lungs,
You said,
"Come on, come on.
Do what you want.
What could go wrong?
Oh come on come on come on,
Do what you want. 
What could go wrong?
Do do do do what you want, yeah."

Me I was raised,
Amid the trickle down days,
I woke up numb in the haze,
And saw my future in a machine built for two.
Now your light,
Give me some kind of fright,
How did wrong get so right, 
And lead me stumbling through the dark of night?

Oh something was wrong,
But you tapdanced on the air,
In the night,
Screaming at the top of your lungs,
You said,
"Come on come on,
Do what you want.
What could go wrong?
Come on come on come on, come on,
Do what you want. 
Oh come on come on.
What could go wrong?
Do do do do what you want
Yeah"

Thinking of a world in the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begun

Our little world turning in the blue
As each day goes there's another one new
Another one new

How many people will we feel today
How many lips will we kiss today
If we wake up

How many worlds will we ever see
And how many people can we ever be
If we wake up

Thinking of a world in the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begun

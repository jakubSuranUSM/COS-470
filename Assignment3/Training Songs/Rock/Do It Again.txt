Call my number
26 and three-quarters 
Turn down the lights now
Let's do it again

You were insatiable
I was more than capable
And you fought in my corner
Would you do it again?

You, you- you're walking around
Can you see tears on this clown?
I said one more time around
Let's do it again 

Said 'Call my number'
26 and 3/4
Turn all the lights down
Let's do it again

You were insatiable
I was more than capable
And you fought in my corner
Would you do it again?

You, you- you're walking around
Can you see tears on this clown?
I said one more time around
Let's do it again

Let's do it again

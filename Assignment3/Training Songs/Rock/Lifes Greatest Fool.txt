Some walk out winners of those who've lost
Can it be said at any price this is the cost
Hard is perception, easier is blame
Is this the only life for everyone
Isn't it the same

Children laugh and run away
While others look into the darkness of the day
Some streets are easy while some are cruel
Could these be reasons why man 
Is life's greatest fool

Do you believe when you're all alone
You held the key to your destiny gone
Do you believe in your soul
That too much loneliness makes you grow old

Words can be empty though filled with sound
Stoned numb and drifting, hard to be profound
Formed out of pleasure, chiseled by pain
Never the highest and not the last one to gain

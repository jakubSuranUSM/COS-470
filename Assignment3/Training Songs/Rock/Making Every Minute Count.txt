While you're hung up on yesterday 
You got nothing going today 
While you're hung up on tomorrow
All the good times are slipping away 
Life is right now and if you take it
The share will be the biggest amount
There's only one way to make it
That's making every minute count

Making every minute count
Making it groovy 
Making love, making it now
If you know a better way of goin'
You know you'd better show me how

With your nose pressed to the window
Life is just a mirror of your mind
You can find much more to get into 
Make up your mind, baby, now is the time
Time to live life like a lover
Time to keep time from keepin' you down
Time to get it all together
Making every minute count

Making every minute count
Making it groovy 
Making love, making it now
If you know a better way of goin'
You know you'd better show me how

Making every minute count

Time to live life like a lover
Time to keep time from keepin' you down
Time to get it all together
Making every minute count
Making every minute count
Making it groovy 
Making love, making it now
Making every minute count 
Making it groovy

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, hut hut
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, hut hut

Took a walk and passed your house
(Late last night)
All the shades were pulled and drawn
(Way down tight)
From within, a dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they ma-ade

Put his arms around your waist
(Held you tight)
Kisses I could almost taste
(In the night)
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouettes on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eye-eyes

Silhouettes silhouettes silhouettes
Ty-oh, oh-oh
Silhouettes silhouettes silhouettes,
Ty-oh, oh oh

Lost control and rang your bell
(I was sore)
Let me in or else I'll beat
(Down your door)
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong blo-ock

Rushed down to your house with wings
(On my feet)
Loved you like I never loved
(You my sweet)
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the sha-ade

Silhouettes silhouettes silhouettes
Ty-oh, oh oh
Silhouettes silhouettes silhouettes
Ty-oh, oh oh

Two silhouettes on the shade
Silhouettes!

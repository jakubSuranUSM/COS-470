Well I'm a ridin' down the highway
Just my baby n' me
Hoping for a kiss
Or two or three
Well, Holy smokes
This girl's so shy
All she does is sit
And stare and smile

Well, Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Oh, Babe-babe-baby
Pididdle, oh baby
Just want a kiss from you
Oh, let's peel out

Well a' down this a' road
There came a 'rod
With one lamp off
And one lamp on
This a' little car
Well a' can't ya' see
Means she gotta' kiss
Just a' lil' ol' me

Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Oh, Babe-babe-baby
Pididdle, oh baby
I just want a kiss from you

Let's drive now
First
Second
Third
Man, we're goin' now

Well, I ride this highway every night
And I'm a' getting kissed
Both left and right
But there's a' one little detail
That she don't know
The car with the one light
Is my friend Joe

Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Pididdle-a-diddle
Oh, Babe-babe-baby
Pididdle, oh baby
I just want a kiss from you

Pididdle-diddle --diddle-diddle
Pididdle-diddle
Pididdle-diddle --diddle-diddle
Pididdle

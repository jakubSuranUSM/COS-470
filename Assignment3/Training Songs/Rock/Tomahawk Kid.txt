Oh, the Tomahawk Kid,
Do you know what he did
On a cave on Treasure Island?
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest 
Didn't know where to find him.
When we set sail across the seven seas,
There was Captain Dan, Billy Bones, and me...
and the Tomahawk Kid.
Full fathom five, the Kid is alive!
And the crew was climbin' up the rigging,
Washed on land, on the silver sand,
We got no time for digging!
When we set sail across the seven seas,
There was Captain Dan, Billy Bones, and me...
and the Tomahawk Kid.
Yo Ho Ho,
Yo Ho Ho,
Yo Ho Ho,
Let me hold my captain,
And I'll hold your hairy hand,
Let's forget the treasure,
We can skip across the sand!
The Tomahawk Kid, you know what he did,
He hung his head in sorrow.
No treasure chest, he did his best,
He gonna come back tomorrow.
When we set sail across the seven seas,
There was Captain Dan, Billy Bones, and me...
and the Tomahawk Kid.

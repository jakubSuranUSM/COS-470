I felt my vocal chords weakening
I felt my concave thoughts
I felt my voluntary blindness
for staring straight into the sun
the romantic air of your eye patch
called me across the room
I clung there and danced with your silent
admired your divine tattoos

we slept in the shadow of a cedar tree
we made love on the rolling tide
we smelled the perfume of the waxing moon
we dreamt of all friendships kind
we touched the blood of the black cat
we pet the mammoth dog of tears
in the flickering light we were laughing:
"necessity conquers fear!"

don't lose yourself
don't let yourself be lost...

dreaming we were stones in black stillness
dreaming of the death of the sun
waking to a world of white blindness
painted eyes of the holy one
the death of the world was upon us
and the discipline of the wind
we see less and less all the time, dear
just look at this mess we are in

don't lose yourself,
don't let yourself be lost!...

staring at the entrance to the mine
I prayed for your wounds to close
tiger ointment and a cosmic collision
and the crucifixion of the rose
don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself...

don't lose yourself,
don't let yourself be lost...

Waking ten times to take a piss 
You can taste the cancer in my morning kiss 
Scratch the rash on my back it's perfect bliss 
You want a life companion and you're getting this 

Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times 
Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times 

You have to look away of every meal 
Inconvenient but that's the deal 
This it what, we become when nothing's real 
Mental wounds that never heal 

Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times 
Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times 

Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times 
Man, can get a few dimes 
And man can get it a few times

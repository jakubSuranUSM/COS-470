You are so good to me
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in heaven [Repeat: x 2]

You ride upon the clouds
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me [Repeat: x 2]

You poured out all your blood
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me [Repeat: x 2]

You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song [Repeat: x 3]
I will sing again

You are my strong melody
You are my dancing rhythm
You are my perfect rhyme
And I want to sing forever

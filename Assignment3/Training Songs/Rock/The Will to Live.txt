I met a girl whose heart
Was on the right hand side
And upon the left
An angel did reside
They told her mother
That she never would survive
But she kept the rhythm
And is still alive

We must all have
The will to live
You got to have
The will to live

Then I met a man
Who had to walk with his hands
Born into a world
He couldn't stand
Blessed with life
But cursed as a man
Still he walks taller
Than most of us can

We must all have
The will to live
You got to have
The will to live

Some are born with more
And some born with less
So don't take for granted
The life we've been blessed
It's hard to understand
That we're only a guest
And each one of us
Shall be put to life's test

We must all have
The will to live
You got to have
The will to live

Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughing
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get down
And we'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you
Way down here
And you'll start crying
Ninety-six tears
Cry
You're gonna cry

And when the sun comes up
I'll be on top
You'll be right down there looking up
I'm gonna get to you
But I know now

You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears

You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry cry cry cry now
You're gonna cry cry cry cry now

Too many teardrops
All night long
Too many teardrops
Cry cry cry cry now
You're gonna cry cry cry cry now
Ninety-six tears
All night long now
You're gonna cry cry cry cry now
Ninety-six tears
Cry cry cry now
Ninety-six tears
Cry cry cry now
Ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry cry cry cry now

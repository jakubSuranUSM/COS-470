Butcher's hand chops off
Surrealistic face-pack masque
For children with a hindread past.

Oh!
Collective ladies shine shoes for 10 cents.

Launderette swingers
Botulistic mummified corpses!
Lips grind at my wasting flesh
As my eyes see all, say nothing,

Nothing to this day grey gloom
Goosepimple forehead erecticus

Bop bopping for Tuesday's fishcakes
I know nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
Nothing nothing nothing nothing NOTHING
No more, not at all, anyrate

Bacofoil chickens spew forth blood!
A congealed society talk trash,

Talk trash, talk trash!
Castrated cannibals tug at my skin
Nearest mysterian to me!

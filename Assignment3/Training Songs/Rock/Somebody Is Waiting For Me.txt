You never needed them
You never needed anyone
The life of the party must decline
Your invitation to dine
And I'm sorry that I must go so soon
Please forgive me for finding something real
And pure and true

Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me

I never needed this
I never needed anyone
I meant every word that I said
It's true
I wasn't talking to you

And I'm sorry that I must go so soon
Please forgive me for finding something real and pure and true

Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me

And I'm sorry that I must go so soon
Please forgive me for finding something real and true

Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
Somebody is waiting for me
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me
For me for me for me for me for me for me for me.

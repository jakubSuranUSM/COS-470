(Brewster-Neeson-Brewster)
I've seen you in the moments when I lived before
And I've seen you in the courtyard of a thousand doors
When I thought that you were all alone
Love takes care of its own
Now it's a phoney situation you bring on yourself
When you start to think there's nobody else
Spread your wing the sun ain't meda of stone
Love takes care of its own
Looking at the skyline, it's so fine
This time with you
This time with you
Now let all the cynics laugh, they'll be the first to leave
Who can suggest to the truth of make believe
More than when I'm aching to the bone
Love takes care of its own
Well I've seen you in the moments when I lived before
And I've seen you in the courtyard of a thousand doors
When I thought that you were all alone
Love takes care of its own
Love takes care of its own

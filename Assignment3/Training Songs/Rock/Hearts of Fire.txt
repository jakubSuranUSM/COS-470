It was the summer of sixty-four
We ran the streets on to the shore
And in every game we played we knew we had it made
Like no other time before.
I was just a man
You were still a child
Two hearts that were running wild
There was no need to pretend
You became more than a friend
They were days without an end.
We laughed where we played
We made love where we laid
In the light again we'd run.
When the night called the tune
We'd shoot at the moon
And laugh at what we'd done.
We were hearts of fire
Do you remember it
My friend
We didn't think that it would end.
Together then we ran
This boy became a man.
They burn on those hearts of fire
They burn on those hearts of fire
Hearts of fire!
And by seventy-two I was running free
It was just the way I wanted to be
I thought I'd left our love for dead
But my heart it ruled my head
And I fell in love instead!
We fought where we played
We made love where we laid
Just like the time before.
And if the battle should start to tear us apart
We won't go to war no more.
We were hearts of fire
Do you remember it
My friend
We didn't think that it would end.
Together then we ran
Turn a boy into a man.
They burn on those hearts of fire
They burn on those hearts of fire
They burn on those hearts of fire
Hearts of fire!
We were hearts of fire

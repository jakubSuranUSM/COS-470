Crawl from the fire into the pan,
What we don't need, hell will demand,
Higher, higher, higher, higher.
Higher, higher, higher, higher.
Well I'm not in need therefore don't demand,
And what hell can sell you I can't defend,
Higher, higher, higher, higher.
Higher, higher, higher, higher.

And if another lover takes that love away from you,
Be careful with your mind and what you're bound to do.

Lovers in love.
Lovers in love.

Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving in love.
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving in love.

And if another lover takes that love away from you,
Be careful with your mind and what you're bound to do.

Lovers in love.
Lovers in love.
Lovers in love.
Lovers in love.

And if we make it, I'll come back.
And if we make it, I'll come back.

Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving in love.
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving in love.

Lovers in love. (Higher, higher, higher.)
Lovers in love. (Higher, higher, higher.)
Lovers in love. (Higher, higher, higher.)
Lovers in love. (Higher, higher, higher.)

Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long years 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 

I stuck around St. Petersburg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
Killed the czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 

I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name
What's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name
What's confusing you 
Is the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails 
Just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
(Who who, who who) 

So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
(Woo woo)
Use all your well-learned politesse 
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah 
(who who)
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down 

Oh yeah
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah, get on down 

(Woo woo) 

Tell me [x6]

Tell me baby, what's my name 
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name 

What's my name 
Tell me, baby, what's my name 
What's my name 

Woo, who, who 
Oh, yeah 
Woo woo 
Woo woo

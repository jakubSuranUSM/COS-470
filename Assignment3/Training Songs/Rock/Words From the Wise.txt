Words from the wise, encourage you, carries all your taking on,
Words from the wise, discourage too many people when things go wrong.

Words from the wise, encourage you, carries all your taking on,
Words from the wise, discourage too many people when things go wrong.
I have my doubts, as everyone. Little isle in a stormy sea.
Words from the wise, believe in you,  All I do is believe in me.

If the going looks to strong, And a little seems too long
Only darkness in the night, Turn the darkness into 
Light the fire inside of yourself
I'm the one it's nobody else
Listen out. But remember always
Your the wise, The wise.

REPEAT

When it feels so hard to try, Just a weight, a chain, a lie,
Even though you need to fight, make the changes into
Light the fire inside of yourself
I'm the one it's nobody else
Listen out. But remember always
Your the wise, The wise.

REPEAT...

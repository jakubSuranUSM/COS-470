The plan it wasn't much of a plan
I just started walking
I had enough of this old town
Had nothing else to do
It was one of those nights
You wonder how nobody died
We started talking
You didn't come here to have fun
You said: "well I just came for you"

But do you still love me?
Do you feel the same
Do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance
With someone I've been
Pushing away

And touch we touched the soul
The very soul, the soul of what we were then
With the old schemes of shattered dreams
Lying on the floor
You looked at me
No more than sympathy
My lies you have heard them
My stories you have laughed with
My clothes you have torn

And do you still love me?
Do you feel the same
And do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance again
Is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again

You lost that feeling
You want it again
More than I'm feeling
You'll never get
You've had a go at
All that you know
You lost that feeling
So come down and show

Don't say goodbye
Let accusations fly
Like in that movie
You know the one where Martin Sheen
Waves his arm to the girl on the street
I once told a friend
That nothing really ends
No one can prove it
So I'm asking you now
Could it possibly be
That you still love me?
And do you feel the same
Do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance again
Is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again

I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you

I take it all from you
I take it all from you

Please stop crying
I know you know I've been lying
Please stop crying
I know your love for me is dying

There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
To get myself back close to you
Please stop crying
I'm sorry I hurt you

I betrayed you
You trusted me and I betrayed you
If I obeyed you
I can't be me so I betrayed you
Oh yeah

I don't want nobody else
I just want you to myself
I betrayed you
I'm sorry I hurt you

I'm losing more than I'll have I feel bad
Feel so bad yeah
I messed you head but you still possess me
Baby, baby, baby have mercy have mercy on me

You've got a heart of gold
You can't be bought or sold
You've got a heart of gold baby
I got the blues for you 
I give myself to you
I got the blues for you, baby
You've got a heart of gold
You can't be bought or sold
You've got a heart of gold baby
I got the blues for you 
I give myself to you
I got the blues for you, baby
Oh yeah

Will you redeem me
Don't ya believe me baby

Don't ya believe me

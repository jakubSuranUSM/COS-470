Oh hey,
I wasn't listening
I was watching serial
Blinded by the sunshine strip
You, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mind was marked and wounded with the wounders whip
And that's how summer passed oh your,
Great divide and range of green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

Oh hey,
I wasn't listening,
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading up the wall
And as per usual,
You were skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door

Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours
The rest we'll just wait and see
Maybe you're right, babe, maybe

Oh no, and that's how summer passed
Oh your, great divide
And range of green green grass
Oh, maybe I hold on fast, to you

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were

I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were
I forget where we were,

Oh no, and that's how summer passed
Oh your, great divide
And range of green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew

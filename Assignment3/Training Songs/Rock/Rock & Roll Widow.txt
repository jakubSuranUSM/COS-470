Rock and roll widow, lover by trade
Lives to tell who's been made into love
Living her life, reds, beds, most every night
Widow carry on 'til the band is gone
Widow carry on 'til the band is gone
She wants no man give her his hand
She'd rather go out, rather go out, rather go out
With the boys in the band
Widow carry on till the band is gone
Widow carry on till the band is gone
Widow carry on till the band is gone
Sniff of snow to let you know
Her speed of life is in and free
She knows she pays the price to play
To share herself with fame
But when its time and faces change
She gives more love away, love away
She gives more love away
She gives more love away
Rock and roll widow, when we played last
A dose of your love, dose of your love, dose of your love
Was mine in the past
Need a taste of that magical stuff
LSMFT ain't enough
Widow carry on while the band is on

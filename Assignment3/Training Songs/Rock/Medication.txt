Every day I wake up
And I take my medication
And I spend the rest of the day
Waiting for it to wear off
Every night I stay up late
And make my state more desperate
Spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off

I'm waiting for the time
When I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time

Every now and then
I get the urge to drive around
Get into my car
And then I'll maybe go up town
Take my medication
Do my best to get it on
Spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off

I'm waiting for the time
When I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time

Every time I say this
I just know this time I mean it
But a feeling deep inside
Says "it's okay one more time"

I'm waiting for the time
When I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time

Makes me feel so good
Makes me feel so fine
Makes me feel so good
Leaves me fucked up inside

Medicate my days
Medicate my nights
Medicate my life
Don't it feel alright
Don't it feel so good
Lord don't it feel just fine
Don't it feel so good
Don't it feel so fine
Don't it feel so good
Leaves me fucked up inside

I can see clearly now the way it’s gonna go
I can see my world come and go
Though the road begins to wind
In the distance there’s a sign.
Don’t you know I've been away too long.

Gone are those hazy days that clouded up my mind.
All of those bad times left behind.
Can’t you see I have to roam?
But now I’m coming home
Don’t you know I’ve been away too long

I’ve seen faces, places,
You may never see.
Done most things I never thought I’d do
Making like those bright lights
Sleeping days and long nights

Now I know I must go where I belong
To the place that’s waiting for me
Don’t you know it’s waiting for me?
Oh, I know that I’ve been lonely too long.

I’m gonna get myself a place back in the sun
Don’t have to hide, just gotta run.
Though this life is getting older
And I’m seeing things much bolder
Don’t you know I've been away too long

So you fly, then you fall
Why'd you learn to walk, when you can crawl
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
You steal, and you scheme
You think therefore you are, and you seem
You seem a little nervous, just relax
Just give them all your innocence, you've got stacks
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
Now cool out and don't push
Sooner or later they'll give you an ambush
An ambush unexpected, from the blue
I like a little circus, don't you?
Every hour god sends some wings
Every hour god sends some stones
Every hour god sends some eyes
Every hour god sends some nerves
Every hour god sends some luck
Every hour god sends some love
Every hour god sends some light
Every hour god sends some prize
(Hey we're gonna have a jihad)

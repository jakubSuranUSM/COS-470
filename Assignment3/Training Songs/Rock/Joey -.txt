Joey, baby - don't get crazy
Detours. fences... I get defensive
I know you've heard it all before -
So I don't say it anymore

I just stand by and watch you
Fight your secret war.
Although I used to wonder why -
I used to cry till I was dry.

Still sometimes I get a strange pain
Inside
Oh, joey, if you're hurting so am i.

Joey, honey - I got some money
All is forgiven. listen, listen
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.

And when you said I scared you,
Well I guess you scared me too.
But we got lucky once before
And if you're somewhere out there

Passed out on the floor.
Oh joey, I'm not angry anymore.

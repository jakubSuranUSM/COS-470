Ah
Ah

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the color of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

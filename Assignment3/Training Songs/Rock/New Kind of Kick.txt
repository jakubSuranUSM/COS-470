Life is short filled of stuff 
Don't know what for 
I ain't had enough 
I learned all I know 
By the age of nine 
But I could better myself 
If I could only find 
Some new kind of kick 
Something I ain't had 
Some new kind of buzz
I wanna go hog mad 
Lookin' and lookin' and lookin' 
For something I ain't had before 
I'm lookin' and lookin'
I'm lookin' and lookin'
I'm lookin' and lookin'
To find some new kind of kick
To find some new kind of kick
Gimme a kick 
Like baby needs mom 
Like Susie needs dick 
This baby needs 
Some new kind of kick 
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick 
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' 
For something I ain't had before 
I'm lookin and lookin'
I'm lookin and lookin' 
I'm lookin and lookin' 
To find some new kind of kick 
Life is short filled of stuff 
Don't know what for 
I ain't had enough 
I learned all I know 
By the age of nine 
But I could better myself 
If I could only find 
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick

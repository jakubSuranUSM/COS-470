If I was a dolphin
Lost and lonely in the sea
Would you go swimming beyond the coral reefs
Looking for me
I need to know
'Cause I would always wonder
Could we be happy
If you were a dolphin just like me? 

We're dolphins in the sea
My dolphin girl and me
We swim from town to town
Two dolphins on the run 

Lalalala... lalalalala... 

If I was a dolphin swimming in the deep blue sea
No one could touch me or say to me what I should be
And i... wouldn't worry about rain or thunder
We could be happy 

If you were a dolphin just like me? 

We're dolphins in the sea
My dolphin girl and me
We swim from town to town
Two dolphins on the run 

We never have to speak
We never have to sleep
Tchiibapedodidong
This is a dolphin song

Has it always been hard for you?
Are you scared of the truth?
Is the wrong way just right for you?
'Cause I'm losing my mind sitting here watching you cry

Don't let the music die
We're playing songs from different times
I'll let you say goodbye on another day but not today
On another day but not today

I am always the one to give and you call me a thief
Say I'm stealing your time away
I'm just waiting to see if you'll wait for me

Don't let the music die
We're playing songs from different times
I'll let you say goodbye on another day but not today
On another day but not today

Don't let the music die
We're playing songs from different times
I'll let you say goodbye on another day but not today
On another day but not today

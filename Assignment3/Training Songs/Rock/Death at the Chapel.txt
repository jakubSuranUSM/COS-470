On a night of weddings he decides to change the setting, 
And as he feels himself start to sicken, 
Oh too late for Jimmy, 
Adjusts his goggles as the fog begins to thicken. 

Under shadow of the chapel he saw Jimmy run for cover, And pushing down on the accelerator, 
Oh too late for Jimmy, 
Ducking down as the young man flew over the bonnet.

With a heart as black as coffee he smashed into John and Betty, 
Screaming, "No one will ever love you!" 
Too late for John and Betty, 
And the realisation hit them like a fist, 
Like this. 

You know what's next for Eddie as he dives behind a pillar, 
Looking back on his motorcycle, 
Oh too late for Eddie. 
Turning around to face the cackle behind him.

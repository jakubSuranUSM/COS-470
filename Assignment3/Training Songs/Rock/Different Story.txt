As if you turned around, or disconcerting sound, replaces silence
And if you wonder why I wouldn't try to rhyme, my past with yours
But then you turn your eyes away

And when it's sleepy-time, the list is so sublime, I have to choose
The story's long enough and with the proper touch
How can I lose? But then you turn your ears away

And then you inch right in, but nothing you have is for me
â??Cause when we are skin to skin
A piece of your heart for mine, well, that's a different story

And when you want to try, I wouldn't tell you why, or whatever for
You needn't even ask why I'm not quite up to task for your revival
So then I turn my heart away

And then you inch right in, but nothing you have is for me
â??Cause when we are skin to skin
A piece of your heart for mine, well, that's a different story

And when I say goodbye, I won't shed a tear
I'm mad about you, but try? Well, that's a different story
I'm mad about you, but try? Well, that's a different story
I'm mad about you, but try? Well, that's a different story
Well, that's a different story, well, that's a different story
Yeah, yeah, yeah

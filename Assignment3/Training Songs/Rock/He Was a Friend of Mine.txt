He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
His killing had no purpose
No reason, or rhyme
Oh, he was a friend of mine

He was in Dallas town
He was in Dallas town
From a sixth floor window
A gunman shot him down
Oh, he died in Dallas town

He never knew my name
He never knew my name
Though I never met him
I knew him just the same
Oh, he was a friend of mine

Leader of a nation for such a precious time
Oh, he was a friend of mine

Company always on the run
Destiny is the rising sun
Oh I was born 6-gun in my hand
Behind a gun I'll make my final stand
That's why they call me bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Till the day I die rebel souls
Deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns
They all know our name 6-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say bad company
And I won't deny
Bad bad company
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Solo bad
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die
And I say it's
Bad company oh yeah---yeah
Bad company
Till the day I die oh yeah tell me that you are not a thief
Oh but I am
Bad company
It's the way I play
Dirty for dirty
Oh somebody double-crossed me
Double-cross
Double-cross
Yeah
We're bad company
Kill in cold blood

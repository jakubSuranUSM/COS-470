Rosanne, I gotta take it on the lam,
What do you think you been doin'
Rosanne, you need another kind of man,
What do you think you been doin'
I left my evil ways back in my burnin' days
Nights were spent just to hold you,
You left your lovin' charms in someone else's arms
What do you think you been doin', you're my ruin,
Rosanne.

The way a lovebird flies a foolish heart just dies,
Trapped in your situation,
There's nothin' I can say, I guess it's been that way
Since the dawn of creation,
Rosanne, I gotta take it on the lam,
What do you think you been doing'
Rosanne, you need another kind of man,
What do you think you been doing', you're my ruin, Rosanne.

Could have prevented all this, if we had taken the time,
Could have prevented all this, if we had made up our minds,
Rosanne.

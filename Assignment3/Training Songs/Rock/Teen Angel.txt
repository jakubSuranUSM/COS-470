Teen angel, 
Angel divine
Teen angel, 
Angel of mine
How I love you
How I need you
For my own

Teen angel, 
Open your heart
Teen angel, we'll never part
How I long
How I yearn
For you my dear
For you my dear

Hold me baby
Never let me go
Tell me you love me
Tell me that it's so

We'll be together
Forever and ever
On earth and 
In heaven above

Teen angel, angel divine
Teen angel, angel of mine
Our love is young
Now we are one
Teen angel
Teen angel

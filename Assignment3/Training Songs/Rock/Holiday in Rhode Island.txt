In your letter you didn't say
The weather would be so dreadful

But I'm so glad to be here
It's just you and me now honey
Far from the west coast
Where you've never been and
You long to see someday

Wo'd have thought I'd really visit
A holiday in Rhode Island

I'm so happy just to see you
You're all I dream of honey
Now we can be tgether
For a few days I am the only one

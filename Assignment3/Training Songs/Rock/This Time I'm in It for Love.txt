I heard the weatherman predict a sunny day
He did not mean to lie, I look outside it's raining
Anyway, I guess I can live with a rainy day

'Cause in the scheme of things you're gonna lose a few
Even your best made plans before you know it
They are falling through but that couldn't happen to me and you

This time I'm in it for love, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again, but how could I possibly lose?
How could I lose? This time I'm in it for you

My ma, she used to say, "Beware the tender trap
If you get caught in one make sure you notice where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things, things like that"

This time I'm in it for love, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again, but how could I possibly lose?
How could I lose, this time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love, maybe this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again but how could I possibly lose?
How could I lose this time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again, but how could I possibly lose?
How could I lose, this time I'm in it for you

I've got a memory 
A thousand years old 
And I know secrets 
I've never been told 

And I've got jewels 
I haven't found 
And they'll return me 
To the ground 

I'm the girl  I'm the girl  I'm the girl 
You know me 
I'm the girl  I'm the girl  I'm the girl 
You know me 

And I'm a siren 
I'll wreck you on my shores 
And I'm Godiva 
I'll call you back for more 

And I'm Medusa 
And I'm your favorite doll 
And I'm a Georgia O'Keeffe 
Hanging on your wall 

I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl 
You know me 
I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl 
You know me 

I'm Joan of Arc 
I'm the girl next door 
I'm the mother and the daughter 
Of the mother and the daughter before 

And I remember being born just sound and light 
And sound and light and light 
And I remember the first time, skin on skin in the arms 
In the arms of the night 
Well how many times have we looked up into the starry skies 
And how many times have we felt the passion rise 

Every ruby-lipped girl baby, old lady, squaw junkie, girl after girl after girl 
Every muse, whore, good witch, princess, back arching, year after year after year 

I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl 
You know me 
I'm the girl, I'm the girl, I'm the girl 
You know me 

I'm Joan of Arc 
I'm the girl next door 
I'm the mother and the daughter 
Of the mother and the daughter 
The mother and the daughter 
Of the mother and the daughter 
The mother and the daughter 
Of the mother and the daughter 
Before.

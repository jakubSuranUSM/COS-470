We love tinsel town
Plastic fantastic
I can feel it when you talk
See it when you walk that way

I'm gonna swim 'cross the ocean
In the black of night
You can never see the depths
Never reach the distant shore

Plastic fantastic
I really think it's cool
Children will be children
I don't wanna go to school

Plastic fantastic, do ya believe it?
Plastic fantastic
Something you just gotta see
I'm a sc-fi baby of the twenty-first century

Plastic fantastic, do ya believe it
Plastic fantastic, don't really need it

Look here right now
In my neighborhood
Yeah, got to do something
It's got to be something good

Burn, tiger, burn, run just as fast as you can
We're gonna build you a concrete jungle
Cause we don't really understand
It's a shame

Plastic fantastic, do ya believe it?
Plastic fantastic, don't really need it

I know you from another world
You're everywhere in general
And no place in particular
I can feel it when you talk that way

Plastic fantastic
I really think it's cool

Burn, tiger, burn, run just as fast as you can
Plastic fantastic, something you just gotta see
I'm a sc-fi baby of the twenty-first century
That's me

Plastic fantastic, I can feel it when you talk
See it when you walk that way, bye bye

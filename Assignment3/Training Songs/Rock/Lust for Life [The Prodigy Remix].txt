Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey, man, where'd you get that lotion?
I been hurting since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah, something called love

That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before

'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
I got a lust for life

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a G.T.O
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan

I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs

Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before

'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
I got a lust for life

I got a lust for life
Lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lot of lust for life

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before

I got a lust for life
A lot of lust for life
I got a lust for life
Lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another striptease
Hey, man, where'd you get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh, love, love, love
About something called love, called love
Oh, love, love, love

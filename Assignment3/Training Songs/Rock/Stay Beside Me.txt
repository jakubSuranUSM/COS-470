Stay beside me, here beside me
Stay beside me day after day
When I'm feeling blue, let me look at you
Oh my darling, please, won't you stay?

You'll stay beside me, help and guide me
Never, never leave me alone
Trust and love me, be proud of me
Let me keep your heart for my own

With your love, you make me strong
Come to me where you belong

Stay beside me, close beside me
You must know it's you I adore
You were meant for me, you will always be
My true love forever more

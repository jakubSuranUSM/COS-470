The one I love found another she ran away with my best friend
Came home last night for just an hour daylight came she's gone again
Well you can have her I don't want her she never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with but all I wanted was love to stay

Well if you get the wrong woman there's only one thing you can do
Just dig a hole crawl right in it and pull the ground in after you
Well you can have her

Life without love is mighty empty when you've got no one that you can hold
I'd rather have love I can cling to than have the world and all of its gold
Well you can have her,
Well you can have her

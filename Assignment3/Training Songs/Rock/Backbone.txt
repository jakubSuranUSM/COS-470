Said you believe in the absence of everything
Faith always leaves in the silence of morning
I don't pretend that I have any answers
But I defend all of your good intentions

Don't hold his broken heart
I don't belong with the things you're missing
Lost underneath your intentions are wallowing
Do me a favour and drift away slowly

Finding your heart in the river lonely
I said I don't have any answers
Just the obvious one
Your river is devoted

To find an open sea
I never trusted anger
To bring a good idea
Your rier is devoted

To find an open sea
I never trusted anger
To bring a good idea
Don't have to break your backbone

Saved for the lucky one
I don't pretend I have all the answers
Just the obvious one
You don't have to break it

You don't have to break it
You don't have to break it
You don't have to break it

Holiday, Get away
I feel Funny
Children's money

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Don't be late at Gods gate
Don't talk shit out with it!

Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Gonna get myself into it
Why not help me do it?

It's the chance of a lifetime

On the train feel insane
What the f*ck? Just bad luck

Gonna get myself into it

Why not help me do it?
Gonna get myself into it

Why not help me do it?

It's the chance of a lifetime

Don't you tell me that I'm fine
Cause I'll show you that you're blind
Don't you tell me that I'm fine
Cause I'll show you that you're blind

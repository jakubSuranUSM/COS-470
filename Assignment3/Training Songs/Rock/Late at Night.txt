I don't plan or conspire I don't want to get no higher it's your lack of ambition well they tell me, that's what it's missing All the guns out on the western front are quiet now well it's nice to hear the world breath a sigh It's like the colour of your skin you know it doesn't mean a thing nor do the clothes that we're wrapped in it doesn't matter if you're thin and though I lay awake at night I know your arms will hold me tight and I thank God we got it right here in this city late at night We are each like no other we are unique to our mother we are foals in the stable but we leave home when we're able but we all need someone like the earth needs the sun and our fate will be found in this life in the ground Don't you get it wrong It's like the colour of your skin you know it doesn't mean a thing nor do the clothes that we're wrapped in It doesn't matter if you're thin and though I lay awake at night I know your arms will hold me tight and I thank God we got it right here in this city late at night.

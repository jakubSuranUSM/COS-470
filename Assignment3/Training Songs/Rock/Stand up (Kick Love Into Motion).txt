I've got to know right now
It's got to be this time
I want to show you how
Gonna make you change your mind
There's an empty chair at my table
There's an empty look in your eyes

I just happen to be a man
And you just happen to be a woman
And we just happen to be together
Try to stop this thing comin'

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around
Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground

Down to the ground, baby, come on
Stand up for love

I want to play your game
I want to play with fire
I want to breathe your air
Baby gonna take you there
If you lay the cards on the table
I'll lay my love on the line til your mine

I just happen to be a man
And you happen to be a woman
And we happen to be together
Try to stop this thing comin'

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around
Stand up

Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground
Down to the ground, baby, c'mon
Stand up for love

You couldn't get it much better
You never had it so good
Stand up together
And when your ready to
You're going to get what you should

Little by little like a fine wine
My love is like a motor
Burnin' all the time
Step by step

Easy and slow
On the stairway to heaven
What a way to go
Stand up

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around
Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and show me what you found
Stand up

Kick love into motion
My love is like a motor
Burnin' all the time
Stand up

Kick love into motion
Step by step
Go easy, go slow
Stand up, yeah

Stand up
Kick love into motion
Stairway to heaven
What a way to go, stand up

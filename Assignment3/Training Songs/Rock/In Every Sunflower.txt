My book has more bookmarks than pages
Cause it take me ages
Or is everybody reading
Is everybody reading

Standing on a black Ulster hill
I never fear the chill
Cause everybody's holding
Everybody's holding

I wouldn't swap the pain
For never knowing you
I wouldn't swap the pain
It was worth it for the view

My book has more bookmarks than pages
Cause it take me ages
Or is everybody reading
Is everybody reading

Of a sparkling Medusa
With snakes of cerise and blue
And though we're all pillars of salt now
It was worth is for the view

I wouldn't swap the pain
For never knowing you
I wouldn't swap the pain
Cause it was worth it for the view

We're still watching
Your rainbow through the shower
And we still see you
In every sunflower
We're still watching
I make days from the hours
And I still see you
In every sunflower
Every screaming sunflower

And how they scream of you

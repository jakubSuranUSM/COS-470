Tell me what you want girl, you tell me what you need.
You know you just say the word I'll be right there,
Yes I'll be right there at your feet
Because you know you rock girl yeah,
And I love how we roll 
But I left you all alone,
All we got is the phone and it's never gonna be enough

Living in this dug-out
A million miles away, man, I wish
They'd pad these walls, like an institution, man,
I'm going crazy because when I'm away from you girl, I lose
Myself, you know my train jumps off tracks and all
My pots fall off the shelf.

Oh, I'd do anything, yeah, just to be with you,
Oh, I'd do anything,
Oh just to be with you girl,
Be with you

It's a little girl's birthday and yeah, we are apart 
Ain't gonna make a big deal out of it but it breaks my heart
You tell her "Papa loves her" yeah, and it won't be too long,
'Til we're all together again and yes you know we're all singing yes those songs.

I escape into my tv, yeah, I know you understand
Man they call that shit reality,
I'd like to see those fools in Afghanistan.
Living in this cold damn world,
Hell bent on self-destruction,
What I need right now is a little bit of love, a little bit of love and affection.

Oh, I'd do anything
Oh just to be with you,
Oh I'd do anything,
Oh just to be with you, girl
Just to be with you, just to be with you girl, Be with you

Tell me what you want girl, you tell me what you need.
You know you just say the word I'll be right there,
Yes I'll be right there at your feet

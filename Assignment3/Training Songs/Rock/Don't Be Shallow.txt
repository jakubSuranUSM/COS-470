Forcing my way out of sleep
I inhale the smell of spring and greens
And bucket loads of bees
Migraine's been all of over me
The softest meadow would've cracked my head
I'm easily mislead

And you're standing in my way
So give yourself a pair of hands today
My words to you are fake
Now you are my mistake
And I am yours

Don't be shallow
Don't be cheap
She prays for you
To grow up
Patiently

Don't be selfish
Nor un-managed
You're all I want
And nothing more
But that's not good enough
No no that's not good enough

Trouble at the hardware store
A funky foreign bodies interfere
We like you don't come near

But all that seems a waste of time
When you are said to take the final test
In the solemn quest

She'll tell you to stand and watch
The violent fields of praise so much
Their ears are falling from the sky
Where most of them now hide
And I am yours

Don't be shallow
Don't be cheap
She prays for you to grow up
Patiently

Don't be selfish
Nor unmanaged
You're all I want and nothing more
But that's not good enough
No no that's not good enough

She'll tell you to stand and watch
The violent fields of praise so much
Their ears are falling from the sky
Where most of them now hide
And I am yours

Don't be shallow
Don't be cheap
She prays for you to grow up
Patiently

Don't be selfish
Nor unmanaged
You're all I want and nothing more
But that's not good enough
No no that's not good enough

Stop, baby can't you see that I can't take it no more 
Stop, if you keep it up I'm gonna go through floor 
Never knew how good love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

Stop, hold it just a minute, â€˜cause I got to catch my breath 
Stop, every time you squeeze me you scare my heart half to death 
Thought I was the captain of my ship 
But your love has made me lose my grip 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

I never knew how good a love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

Stop, I think you're trying to take advantage of poor ol' me 
Stop, when you touch my hand I'm helpless as I can be 
Tell me baby, what are you made of? 
What you do to me sure must be made of love 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 
Yes, it will 

Stop, stop, stop

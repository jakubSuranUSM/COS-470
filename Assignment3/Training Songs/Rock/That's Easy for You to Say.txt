When you moved out this mornin' without any warnin'
You said my heart would mend
Then you told me goodbye and said I shouldn't cry
'Coz you and I can still be friends

Well, that's easy for you to say
Easy for you to feel that way
You think love's a place to hang your hat
But it's not like that for me

You told me our love was all wrong
That it's time for you to move along
Well, it's hard for me to feel that way
But it's easy for you to say

It never crossed my mind you were the leavin' kind
You really had me fooled
As you drove away I heard you say
You're sure I'll find somebody new

Well, that's easy for you to say
Easy for you to feel that way
You think love's a place to hang your hat
But it's not like that for me

You told me our love was all wrong
That it's time for you to move along
Well, it's hard for me to feel that way
But it's easy for you to say

Well, that's easy for you to say
Easy for you to feel that way
You think love's a place to hang your hat
But it's not like that for me

You told me our love was all wrong
That it's time for you to move along
Well, it's hard for me to feel that way
But it's easy for you to say

Well, that's easy for you to say
Easy for you to feel that way
You think love's a place to hang your hat
But it's not like that for me

You told me our love was all wrong

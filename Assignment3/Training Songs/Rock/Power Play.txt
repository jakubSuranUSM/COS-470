What gives you the right  hey you
To stand there and tell me what to do
Tell me who gave you the power
To stop me from livin' like I do

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

Just one time I'd like to be somewhere where
None of your clever lies fill the air
I'm tired of your frozen smile and voice of tin
Just might all gang up on you
Turn the knob and do you in

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

This never ending power play
'Tween Jealousy, greed and vicious hate
Is grinding us like giant millstones
But it can't be our only fate
It's time we got our heads together
And let 'em know that we're awake

Those in the dark, you know they're no longer blind
They're breakin' from your strangle hold on their minds
Those who can see don't need no one to cross the street
Be careful who you're pushin' round
They just might find you obsolete

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

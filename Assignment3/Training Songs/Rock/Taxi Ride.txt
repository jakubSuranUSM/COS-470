Lily is dancing 
On the table 
We've all been 
Pushed 
Too far 
I guess on days 
Like this 
You know who your 
Friends are 
Just another dead fag 
To you that's all 
Just another light missing 
On a long taxi ride 
Taxi ride 

And I'm down to 
Your last cigarette and 
This "we are one" crap 
As you're invading 
This thing you call 
Love - she smiles 
Way too much but 
I'm glad you're 
On my side, sure 
I'm glad you're on 
My side still 

You think you deserve 
A trust fund 
Just because you 
Want one 
Sure you talk the talk 
When you need to 
I fear 
The whole world is 
Starting to 
Believe you 
Just another dead fag 
To you that's all 
Just another light missing 
In a long taxi line 
Taxi line 

And I'm down to 
Your last cigarette and 
This "we are one" crap 
As you're invading 
This thing you call 
Love - she smiles 
Way too much but 
I'm glad you're 
On my side, sure 
I'm glad you're on 
My side still 

Lily is dancing 
On the 
Table 
We've all been pushed 
Too far today 
Even a glamorous 
Bitch can be in 
Need 
This is where you know 
The honey 
From the 
Killer bees 
I'm glad you're on 
My side 
Sure 
I'm glad you're on 
My side 
Sure 
I'm glad you're on 
My side still 

Got a long taxi ride

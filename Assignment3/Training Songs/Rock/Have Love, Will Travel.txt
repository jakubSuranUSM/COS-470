You never had a chance, did ya babe
So good lookin, so insecure 
And now you say you can't remember
When the line you drew began to blur 
Yeah, when all of this is over 
Should I lose you in the smoke 
I want you to know you were the one 

And may my love travel with you everywhere,
Yeah may my love travel with you always.

Maggie's still trying to rope a tornado,
Joe's in the backyard trying to keep things simple.
And the lonely DJ's digging a ditch, trying to keep the flames
From the temple

Oh if perhaps I lose you, in the smoke down the road
I want you to know you were the one

And may my love travel with you everywhere
Yeah may my love travel with you always

How about a cheer for all those bad girls!
And all those boys that play that rock 'n' roll!
They love it like you love Jesus

Yeah, when all of this is over
Should I lose you in the smoke 
I want you to know
You were the one

And may my love travel with you everywhere
Yeah may my love travel with you always.

Baby may my love travel, with you everywhere,
Yeah may my love travel, with you always.

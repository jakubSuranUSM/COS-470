Last night I had a dream
You were in it  I was in it with you
Everyone that I knew
And everyone that you know was in my dream
I saw a vampire
I saw a ghost
Everybody scared me but you sacred me the most
In the dream I had last night
In the dream I had last night
In my dream

It started out in a barnyard at sundown
And everyone was laughing and you were lying on the ground
You said  "Honey  can you tell me what you name is?"
"Honey, can you tell me what your name is?"
I said, "You know what my name is."

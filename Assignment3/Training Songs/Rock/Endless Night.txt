I see you right through the charade
No way I’m going back again.
Give me a name for all that’s bad
Seems to me it’s all I’ve got.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, it leads in vain.
Some people think that I’m the man
Because I’ve thrown away all that I had.

I don’t think no one learns
So many tries have come to help.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, it leads in vain.
Some people think that I’m the man
Because I’ve thrown away all that I had.

One last try before things fail
With my luck I’ll end up in jail.
I’m going to war, to war with myself
Putting my head, my head on the shelf.
I’m losing our battles all over again
I’m going to war, to war with myself.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, is in vain.
Some people think that I’m the man
Because I’ve thrown away all that I had.

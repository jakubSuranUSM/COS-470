Sail on down the line 'bout-a half-a mile or so,
and-a don't really wanna know-a where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time
I tried-a to, to hold on to what we got, but-a now you're goin'
and I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord,
I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay,
I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time
 
Sail on down the line, ain't it funny how the time can go on-a 
friends say they told me so, but it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me 
just-a wasn't your cup of tea,
It was wishful thinkin'
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy,
and you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, "Would you please just go away," yeah, yeah
I've thrown away the blues, I'm tired of bein' used
I want everyone to know I'm lookin' for a good time, good time, yeah
 
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy,
and you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, "Would you please just go away," yeah, yeah
Got nothin' else to lose, I'm tired of bein' used,
I want everyone to know I'm lookin' for a good time, good time, 
whoa, oh, sail on honey, good times never felt so good
Sail on sugar, good times never felt so good

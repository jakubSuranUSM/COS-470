They say you walk closely to the ground
To the ground
They say you hear voices
Singing wires ease your pain
Balancing on poles and chains
Distant waves on the radio
It's the sound of the weeping
Distant waves on the radio
And their calling out your name
They say you walk close to the ground
To the ground
So that you can always hear
Distant whispers in your ear
Distant waves on the radio
It's the sound of the weeping
Distant waves on the radio
And their calling out your name
And I'm leaving tonight
Gonna get what is mine
Voices lead to no good
Voices want to have you
Distant waves on the radio
It's the sound of the weeping
Distant waves on the radio
And their calling out to you

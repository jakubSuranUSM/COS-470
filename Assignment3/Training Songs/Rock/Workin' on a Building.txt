I'm workin' on a building, 
I'm workin' on a building,
I'm workin' on a building, 
For my Lord, for my Lord.

If IIIIIIIIIIIIII were a drunkard, 
Tell you what I'd do,
I'd quit my drinkin', 
And work on a building too.

Chorus:
I'm workin' on a building, 
I'm workin' on a building,
I'm workin' on a building, 
For my Lord, for my Lord.
It'a a Holy Ghost building, 
It'a a Holy Ghost building,
It'a a Holy Ghost building, 
For my Lord, for my Lord.

If IIIIIIIIIIIIII were a gambler, 
Tell you what I'd do,
I'd quit my gamblin', 
And I'd work on a building too.

[Chorus]

If IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII were a preacher,
Tell you what I'd do,
I'd keep on preachin', 
And I'd work on a building too.

[Chorus x3]

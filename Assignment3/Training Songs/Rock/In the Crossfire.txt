I don't see myself when I look in the mirror
I see who I should be
I don't see myself when I look in your eyes
Thank God for that

I don't see myself when I look cross the river
I see where I should be
I don't see myself when I look from the sky
Thank God for that

I hear them scream
On the radio
It's getting louder in the crossfire
Tryin' to find some hope
From the ashes of their broken home

I don't see myself when they fail to deliver
I see what I should be
I don't see myself when I look when I look at the flag
Thank God for that

I hear them scream
On the radio
It's getting louder in the crossfire
Tryin' to find some hope
Our day will come
Well find the sun
Well find the fire
Well set a fire the love we give
Our one desire

I hear them scream
On the radio
It's getting louder in the crossfire
Tryin' to find some hope

I hear them scream
On the radio
It's getting louder in the crossfire
Tryin' to find some hope
From the ashes of their broken home

I don't see myself when I look in the mirror

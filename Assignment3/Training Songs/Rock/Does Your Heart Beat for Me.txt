Is the moonlight tonight enchanted,
It fills me with longing for you;
Am I taking too much for granted,
Wond'ring if you miss me too?
 
Tho' we said "goodbye," when the moon is high,
Does your heart beat for me?
I wonder if I still linger 
In your memory.
When you hear my name, is the thrill the same
as it once used to be?
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart, 
Does your heart beat for me.

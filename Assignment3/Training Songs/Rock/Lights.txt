I still love the light on baby 
It keeps me awake but I don't mind 

Everything I ever wanted 
Is right here but soon it won't be 

Oh, if fortune favors the brave 
I am as poor as you come 

Well I've got a million things to say 
Well I've got a million things to 

I still love the light on baby 
It keeps me awake but I don't mind 

Well everything I ever wanted 
Is right here but soon it won't be 

If fortune favors the brave 
I am as poor as they come 

Well I've got a million things to say 
Well I've got a million things to 

I still love the light on baby 
I still love the light on baby 
I still love the light on baby 
I still love the light on baby 

Oh, if fortune favors the brave 
I am as poor as they come 

Well I've got a million things to say 
Well I've got a million things to 

Ah, a million things to say 
Got a million things to say 
Got a million things to say 
Got a million things to

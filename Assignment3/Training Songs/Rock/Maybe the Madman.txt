Study your affection 
Trace the minds and thoughts and untied wisdom
Trapped behind your eyes
How could you release the tension
Created by your imagination
Camouflaged  by knowing in the images you dwell upon
That conflicts with the reality of life

Maybe the madman was right
The sun travels on 'round the world and keeps shining while we sleep at night
Maybe the sky doesn't cry
The rain drops are just condensation our tears cry for children that lie

Building fairy castles in a hostile space of undiscovered skies
Expressing childhood fantasies and a sense of all security 
Explaining time and dreams of either life

Maybe the madman was right
The sun travels on 'round the world and keeps shining while we sleep at night
Maybe the sky doesn't cry
The rain drops are just condensation our tears cry for children that lie

Helplessly I, searching  name to find the reason of all 
And happiness a reason why we learned today 
A purpose and uncertainty of
Why we keep on living for tomorrow

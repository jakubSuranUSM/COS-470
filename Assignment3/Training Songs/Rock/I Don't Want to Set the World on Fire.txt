I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire
I don't want to set this great big world on fire
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

A flame in your heart

In my home I have but one desire
And that one is you no other will do

No other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I have reached the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just wanna start a flame in your heart

A flame in your heart

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I have reached the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just wanna start a flame in your heart

A flame in your heart

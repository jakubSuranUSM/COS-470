I asked the silver one on one
Tell me who I am
Lines on your finger says
You wouldn't understand
I asked the silver one on one
Tell me what's the score
Lies on your picture says
You wouldn't need much more
In the meadow
I asked oblivion just for fun
Tell me what to say
Climb up the mountain boy
And look the other way
I asked a million questions
Of the world I want to be
And the signs I remember
Who's the one they got to me
In the meadow,
Looking for life in the world
Everything's fine
In the meadow
Ceiling's so high
Life might be listening
So we better take our time
We asked a wonder one on one
Please tell me what to be
Call down the miracles
And save yourself for me
We asked a river one on one
Please tell me what you see
I see forever
And it looks like you and me
In the meadow
Looking for life in the world
Everything's fine
In the meadow
Ceiling's so high
Life might be listening
So we better take our time
In the meadow
Looking for life in the world
In the meadow
Everything's fine
In the meadow
Ceiling's so high
Life might be listening
So we better take our time
In the meadow
In the meadow
Looking for life
In the meadow
Feeling so fine
In the meadow
Seeming so high
Life might be listening
Life might be listening
So we better take our time
In the meadow

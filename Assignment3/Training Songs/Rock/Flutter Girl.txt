I'm drinking dust
With eyes of rust
Tonight my tears might stain your wings
So flutter home
'Cause you're better off alone than with me

So hide your face
And tie your lace
And butterflies across your cheek
Forget how soon you become a fool for words when I speak

Flutter girl you don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

My hands are rough
My fingers cold
And your heart so young and so naive 
To ever feel for a moment that I might dare to believe

Flutter girl you don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

I'll tear your wings as I melt in your smile as I run all your colors away

Flutter girl you don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
'Cause I give nothing for free

You don't want to know what I live
Flutter girl

(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Cars and girls are easy come by in this day and age.
Laughing, joking, dreams, weed smoking, till I've spent my wage.
When I was young, people spoke of immorality.
All the things they said were wrong are what I want to be.

(Hey!) Over, under, sideways, down,
(Hey!) I bounce a ball that's square and round.

When will it end? (When will it end?)

(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I find comments 'bout my looks irrelativity.
Think I'll go and have some fun, 'cause it's all for free.
I'm not searchin' for a reason to enjoy myself.
Seems it's better done than argue with somebody else.

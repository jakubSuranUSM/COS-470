Midnight
One more night without sleepin'
Uuh, Watchin'
Till that mornin' comes creepin'
Green door
What's that secret you're keepin'?

There's an old piano and they play it hot
Behind the Green Door.  (Green Door)
Don't know what they're doin' but they laugh a lot
Behind the green door! (Green Door)
Wish they'd let me in so I could find out
What's behind the Green Door! (Green Door)

Knocked once
Tried to tell them I'd been there
Door slammed!
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder,
Just what's going on in there.

Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door. (Green Door)
When I said 'Joe sent me' someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door. (Uuh Green Door)
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door! (Green Door)

Midnight,
One more night without sleepin'
Watchin'
Till that mornin' comes creepin'
Green door,
What's that secret you're keepin'?

There's an old piano and they play it hot
Behind the Green Door.  (Green Door)
Don't know what they're doin' but they laugh a lot
Behind the gren door! (Green Door)
Wish they'd let me in so I could find out
What's behind the Green Door! (Green Door)

Saw an eyeball peepin' through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door. (Green Door)
When I said 'Joe sent me' someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door. (ha, ha ha, oh)
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door! (Green Door)

Wish they'd let me in so I could find out
What's behind the Green Door! (Green Door)

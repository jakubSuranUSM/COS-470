If some of ya'll never been down south too much
Some y'all never been down s-
I'm gonna tell you a little story so's you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods, and the fields
And it looks somethin' like a turnip green
Everybody calls it polk salad
Now that's polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there and she'd go out in the evenings and
Pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
Because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Because her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
A mean vicious woman

Everyday before supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Because her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it

Sock a little polk salad to me

Her daddy was lazy and no-count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealin' watermelons out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Because her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Yeah, sock a little polk salad to me, you know I need me a mess of it
Sock a little

Sock a little polk salad to me, you know I need a real mess of it (chick-a-boom)

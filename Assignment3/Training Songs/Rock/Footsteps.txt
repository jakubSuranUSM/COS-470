Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps. 

Why did you say goodbye to me? 
Now I'm as lonely as can be. 
And as I feel a teardrop fall, 
I hear your footsteps down the hall, 

Walking away from me - 
Why did you say goodbye? 
Why did you make me cry? 
Now everyday I wonder why, why, why oh why oh, 

Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps. 

You're such a haunting memory. 
I pray that you'll come back to me. 
But as I say my evening prayer, 
I hear your footsteps on the stairs, 

Walking away from me - 
Why did you say goodbye? 
Why did you make me cry? 
Now everyday I wonder why, why, why oh why oh, 

Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps, 
Footsteps,

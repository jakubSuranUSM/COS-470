I was hanging upside-down from the overpass
Waiting to discover something about the world
I couldn't get with the program
And I couldn't listen to them
It was like trying to think in reverse

And I don't want to slide into apathy
And I don't want to die in captivity
But these monsters
Follow me around
Hunting me down
Try to wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out
Wipe me out

Yeah I was hiding away underwater
Waiting for distance and buying some time
Trying to be two hundred thousand years younger
So I could excuse myself from human kind
Coz I don't want to be a container
Or a bastard with a ten page disclaimer
But these monsters
Spin me around
Get me down!
Just try to shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out
Shut me out

Hold it in your hand
Hold it in your hand
Hold it in your hand
Believe it me, believe in it, believe

(Shut me out)
I was hiding away underwater
Waiting for distance, waiting for time.
And I don't want to slide into apathy, and I don't
And I don't want to live in captivity

Ohh ohh ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohhhh 
(Shut me out)

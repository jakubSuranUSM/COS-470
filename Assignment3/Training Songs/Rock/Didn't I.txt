There are times to remember and times that I wish to forget
Our time together was tinged with love and regret
Oh my girl, my sweet, sweet little girl

Didn't I try to tell ya
That life was for living
Oh, didn't I?
And wasn't I the guy who said
Stay away from that tribe
Oh, wasn't it?
And didn't I try to tell ya
That stuff's gonna kill ya
Oh, didn't I?
But you thought it was cool
And I was just an old fool
Oh, look at ya

You left home for the city with Hollywood stars in your eyes
Now your mother God bless her cries herself to sleep every night
Oh my girl, my sweet, innocent girl

Didn't I search the streets
For the biggest pimps and cheats
Oh, didn't I?
And didn't I try to guide ya
To a baptism of fire
Oh, didn't I?
And didn't I try to warn ya
Bout that folk in California
Oh, didn't I?
But you said daddy, please, don't worry
I got friends out there who love me
Now look at ya

Oh baby come back home, we can work this out
There is not blame
I wanna hold you close and stroke your hair
And share your pain, yeah

Didn't I do the best for you
Try to make you stay in school
Didn't I?
Once I was your hero
But I went from 10 to 0
Oh, didn't I?
For a roll on the dice
To really pay the ultimate price
Oh, didn't ya?
Now I stand by your bedside
Watching you fight for your life

Where's the innocence? (where's the innocence?)
Where's the future? (where's the future?)
Where's the beauty? (uuh)
Where's the promise?

There are times to remember
And times that I wish to forget

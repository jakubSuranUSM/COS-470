Baby, I been thinkin' about you 
I couldn't get to sleep last night 
Maybe I been too long without you 
I'm tryin', but it just ain't right 
I know that I did you wrong 
I can't get it out of my mind 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Baby, I heard all about him 
But I don't want to know his name 
And maybe you got reason to doubt him 
I know his lovin' ain't the same 
I think about you at night 
I can't get you off of my mind 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Baby I know you can hear me 
We gotta give it one more try 
Maybe we thought it was over 
But this love's too strong to die 
I need you to come back home 
I'm layin' it all on the line 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Don't give up

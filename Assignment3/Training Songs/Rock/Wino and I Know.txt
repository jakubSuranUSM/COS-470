The ice cream man he's a hillbilly fan,
He's got seventy-eights by Hank Snow,
Walks down the street, shufflin' his feet,
To the rhythm that only he knows.
And I've seen him in so many places,
I saw him the night I was born,
In a Bourbon Street bar I received my first scar
From an old man so tattered and torn. 

And the Wino and I know the pains of street singin'
Like the door-to-door salesman knows 
The pains of bell ringin'
It's a strange situation,
A wild occupation,
Living my life like a song. 

Well the coffee is strong 
At the Cafe do Monde,
And the donuts are too hot to touch,
But just like a fool, when those 
Sweet goodies cool, I ate 'til I ate way too much.
Cause I'm livin' on things that excite me,
Be they pastries or lobsters or love,
I'm just tryin' to get by being quiet and shy,
In a world full of pushin' and shove. 

And the Wino and I know the pains of backbustin',
Like the farmer knows the pain of his pick-up 
Truck rustin'.
It's a strange situation, a wild occupation,
Living my life like a song. 

Sweet Senorita, won't you please come with me?
Back to the island, honey, back to the sea,
Back to the only place that I want to be. 

And the Wino and I know the joys of the ocean,
Like a boy knows the joys of his milkshake
In motion.
It's a strange situation, a wild occupation,
Living my life like a song.

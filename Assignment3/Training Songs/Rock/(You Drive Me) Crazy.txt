Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me, the earth is movin', it's easy to see

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue
And I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Every time I look at you, my heart is jumpin', what can I do?

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Every time you look at me, the earth is movin', it's easy to see
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy!

Please, crawl across the sea
Please, crawl across to me
You can take me anywhere
Please, take me, I don't care

Please, crawl across the silent door
Forty smiles, five hundred miles

Can you take this trip?
Can you take this leap
Into my life, one big heap?
Please, crawl across to me

Please, crawl across the silent door
Forty smiles, five hundred miles

But you won't find me there
For I cannot be found
'Cause I'm just a lying son of a bitch
And I don't need this town

Can you take this trip?
Can you take this leap
Into my life, one big heap?
Please, crawl across to me

Please, crawl across the silent door
Forty smiles, five hundred miles

But you won't find me there
For I cannot be found
'Cause I'm just a lying son of a bitch
And I don't need this town

Please, crawl across to me
Please, crawl across to me
Please, crawl across to me
Please, crawl across to me
I can't see
Please, crawl across to me
I can't see

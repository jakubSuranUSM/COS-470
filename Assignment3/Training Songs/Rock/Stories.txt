Tell me a story I've got hours to kill 
It's an easier drive when you're here in my ear 
I liked the last one about those two guys 
Who both had your body though it seems 
They never had your mind 
Or the heart that was beating inside 

I know a place I'd like to go the next time I see your face 
Could it be possible for me to be one of your stories 
You tell somebody someday 

Show me your movie or show me some skin 
I just wanna know everything about you that I can 
The scene you're writing is where I come in 
Enter the man who can't figure out what to do with his hands 

Hey, I know a place I'd like to go the next time I see your face 
Could it be possible for me to be one of your stories 
You tell somebody someday 
I heard what you said about all of the books by your bed 
I'd like to fill up the pages with a tale for the ages 
About a girl I know who looks good well read

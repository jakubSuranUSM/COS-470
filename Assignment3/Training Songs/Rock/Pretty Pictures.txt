You wanna know the future,
My answer wouldn't suit ya,
So, I'd better be a charmer,
'Cause, I didn't mean to harm ya!

So wait one second 'til daylight's low,
Let old time sentiment begin to flow,
I'm oh so sorry I wanna make amends,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

I've been painting pretty pictures,
Sold a promise that I'd fix ya, But I'm just a fool for
action,
And soon got pulled off by distraction.

So hold that tongue before I pull it out,
So bored of bullets coming out of your mouth,
I got money only me my friend,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.

There's nobody in the bed clothes,
Just impressions where my head goes,
So, I'd better be a chamer,
'Cause, I didn't mean to harm ya!

So wait one second 'til daylight's low,
Let old time sentiment begin to flow,
I got no money only me my friend,
Give me one more chance to let you down again.
Ah! Yeah!

Ten times up and three times down 
Everybody knows that's the way to drown
And then it's too late to swim into the shore
And this'll be the third time you left me for her
And there ain't gonna be no another time 
There ain't gonna be no another time
Where ain't gonna be no another time
When you leave you'd better pack cause you ain't comin' back
There ain't gonna be no another time
Before we explain what I'm a talkin' 
About three strikes baby and then you're out
You've already had two swings at the ball
There's just one more and I'm afraid that's all
'Cause there ain't gonna be no another time...

I've always heard about the third time charm
And this is the strip number three you've made to my arms
I hope you'll find what you're looking for
'Cause I'm changing the lock on my front door
And there ain't gonna be no another time...
There ain't gonna be no another time...

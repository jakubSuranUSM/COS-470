I've been wandering early and late 
From New York City to the Golden Gate,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

My daddy was an engineer, 
My brother drives a hack,
My sister takes in laundry 
While the baby balls the jack,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

I've been in the army, 
I've worked on a farm
And all I've got to show 
Is the muscle in my arm,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

My ma, she died when I was young, 
My daddy took to stealing and he got hung,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

Snakes in the ocean, 
Eels in the sea, 
I let a redheaded woman 
Make a fool out of me,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

I've been wandering early and late 
From the New York City to the Golden Gate,
And it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.
No, it don't look like I'll ever stop my wandering.

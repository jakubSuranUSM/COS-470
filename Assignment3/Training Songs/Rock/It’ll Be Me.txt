If you hear somebody knockin' on your door
If you see something crawlin' all across the floor
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll been lookin' for you

If you see a head peepin' from a crawdad hole
If you see somebody climbin' up a telephone pole
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll been lookin' for you

Gonna look on the mountain
And in the deep blue sea
Gonna search all the forests
Gonna look in every tree

If you feel somethin' heavy on your fishin' hook
If you see a funny face in your comic book
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll been lookin' for you
Oh, look a here now

Gonna look in the city
Where the lights are blue
Gonna search the countryside
And all the haystacks too

Well, if you hear a voice callin' out in the night
If you see somebody hangin' from a lampost bright
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll been lookin' for you
Oh yeah

Gonna look on the mountain
And in the deep blue sea
Gonna search all the forests
Gonna, gonna look in every tree

Well if you see a new face on a totem pole
If you find you a lump in your sugar bowl
Baby, it'll be me
And I'll been lookin' for you

I'll be lookin' for you
And I'll be lookin' for you

I'll be lookin' for you
And I'll be lookin' for you

I'll be lookin' for you
I'll just keep looking for you

I'll be lookin' for you
I'll be lookin' for you
I'll be lookin' for you

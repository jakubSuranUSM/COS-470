Ah here's a dance you should know
Ah baby when the lights are down low
I say grab your baby then go

If you don't know how to do it man you're out of luck
Push ya baby out then you hunch her back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake wobble like a duck
That's what you do when you do the Hucklebuck

Oh, workout

Ah here's a dance you should know
Ah baby when the lights are down low
Ah won't ya grab ya baby then go
A little bit of Twist a little bit of this
And if you don't know how to do it ask my little sis
Push your partner out then you hunch her back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake wobble like a duck
That's what you do when you do the Hucklebuck

Oh, move

A little bit of Twist a little bit of this
And if you don't know how to do it ask my little sis
Push your partner out then you hunch her back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake wobble like a duck
That's what you do when you do the Hucklebuck

Here's a dance you should know
Ya ya ya ya when when the lights are down

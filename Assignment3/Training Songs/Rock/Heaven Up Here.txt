Where are you now?
We're over here
We've got those empty pockets 
And we can't afford the beer
We're smoking holes 
And we've got only dreams
And we're so damn drunk
We can't see to steer

The applecart upset my head's little brain
This little moon in the sky upset my head's little brain

I saw, yippee, I did, I swear
Walking through the hallway
Crawling on the stairs
Abebe baby, Bekila
I'm giving up on whiskey
Taking up with tequila

I'm on my own in my blind alley
I turn myself around so it's swallowing me

Groovy groovy people
We're all
Groovy groovy people

F-F-Faustus
You've got nothing to fear
It may be hell down there
'Cause it's Heaven up here
I'd have given forever
For a few good years
But too much of a muchness
Is too much you hear?

The hammer on my chest was an abominable pain
The anvil on my belly was an abdominal strain
You got the bottle
Gonna take the bottle
Gonna take a sip

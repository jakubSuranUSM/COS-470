What can I say, what can I do
To my poor heart when I'm feeling blue
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

Yes I've been true to only you
Now tell me little darling what you want me to do
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

You took my heart away, left me all alone
Why did you go away
Please my little darling won't you come back home

Don't leave me here all alone
Please my little darling won't you come back home
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

What can I say, what can I do
To my poor heart when I'm feeling blue
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

Yes I've been true to only you
Now tell me little darling what you want me to do
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

You took my heart away, left me all alone
Why did you go away
Please my little darling won't you come back home

Don't leave me here all alone
Please my little darling won't you come back home
'Cause I'm a fool in love and I still love you

And I still love you
And I still love you
And I still love you

I woke up late this mornin'
In an empty bed
It's that same old lonesome song
Ya know my baby's gone
Oh I, oh, I'm hurtin' so bad, yeah

I got tear drops, I got tear drops on my pillow
Thinkin' 'bout the good times that we had
My friends, oh, all say be strong
Ya just got to carry on
But I, oh, I'm hurtin' so bad

You know I got me
I got me two or three part-time lovers
But that don't do me no good
I believe it takes a good woman
To love a bad, bad man
If ya try I believe ya really could, ooh

Your lovin' ways, so warm and tender
Your worst was the best I ever had
So come on back home
It's so hard to live alone
I, oh, I'm hurtin' so bad

Yeah, I got me two or three part-time lovers
But that don't do me no good
You know, it takes a good woman
To love a bad, bad man
If ya try I know you baby could, ooh

Your lovin' ways, so warm and tender
Your worst was the best I ever had
So come on back home
It's so hard to live alone
I, oh, I'm hurtin' so bad

You know I'm hurtin' so bad, babe
Sometime I just feel like, sometime I gotta sit down and scream
You know at least once in a while, at least once in a while
I gotta talk to you, baby, I gotta talk to you, baby
Your love, baby, if this is why I couldn't tell you now
But I, I, I, I'm hurtin' so bad

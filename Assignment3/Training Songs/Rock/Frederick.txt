Hi hello
Wake from thy sleep
God has granted
Thy soul to keep
All of the power
And all of the gain
Is entwined
In a single
Name

Frederick
Name of care
Fast asleep
In a room somewhere
Guardian angels/up above
On the one I love.

I am calling
As the young thrush
Caught in the crest
Astonished tie death
On this night of wonder
On this night I know
I would give all
If you called
To say hello.

High! high!
Hey hey
Rejoin to me as
The light fades
My soul surrenders
In my glove
Take this message
My dove
To the one I love.

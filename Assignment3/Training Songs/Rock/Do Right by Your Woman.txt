Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Well you always gave me loving, 'though I treated you so bad
I've changed my mind
About wasting my time
Spending money and drinking wine

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Well you always loved a loser, but it's different from now on
I've changed my plan
Gonna be a better man
I tell you so you'll understand

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

He put her heart into his pocket
He didn't think to give it back
She didn't do a thing to stop it
Just one less thing now to unpack

Oh, now she's home
And since he never calls her
Then he'll never have to know

He drove away to watch the sunrise
She only saw it set away
He doesn't think of her the way she thinks of him
He fell asleep, she stayed awake

Oh, now she's home
And since he never calls her
Then he'll never have to know

She tries to write him a letter
All she can write is "I love you"
This envelope will never make it to the postbox
She's feeling stupid and confused

Oh, now she's home
And since he never calls her
Then he'll never have to know...

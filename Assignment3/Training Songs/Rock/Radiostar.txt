This morning you love me 
And tomorrow you will see that nothing's changed 
Sometimes you wonder 
Do you really love a voice without a face 
And your boyfriend hates me 
I find myself waiting 
To get you on the phone again today 
I will colour your morning 
The one who make the smile and save your day 
And your boyfriend hates me 
How I wish you could see me 
Playing my part as a radiostar 
How I wish you could feel my invisible star 
I'm your radiostar 
I'm a radiostar 
The story's so easy 
I'm on air but down to earth is where you are 
These honeydewfeelings 
Only distance keeps them alive 
And your boyfriend hates me 
How I wish you could see me 
Playing my part as a radiostar 
How I wish you could feel my invisible star 
I'm your radiostar 
I'm a radiostar 
And your boyfriend hates me 
You only know my voice 
And your boyfriend hates me 

How I wish you could see me 
Playing my part as a radiostar 
How I wish you could feel my invisible star 
I'm your radiostar 
As a radiostar 
As a radiostar 
Oh a radiostar 
Radiostar

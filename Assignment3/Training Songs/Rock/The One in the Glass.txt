When you get what you want In the struggle for you 
And the world makes you king for a day 
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself 
See what that person has to say 

Now some people call you a straight shooting man 
They think you're a wonderful guy 
But the one in the glass says you're only a fool 
If you won't look him straight in the eye 

For it isn't your lover, your father or mother 
Whose judgement upon you must pass 
No, the verdict that counts the most in your life 
Is the one staring back from the glass 

Now the one you should please never mind all the rest 
Who is with you clear to the end 
And you've passed the most dangerous difficult test 
If the one in the glass can be your friend 

You can fool the whole world down the pathways of years 
Get a pat on the back as you pass 
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears 
If you cheat on the one in the glass 

For it isn't your lover, your father or mother 
Whose judgement upon you must pass 
No, the verdict that counts most in your life 
Is the one staring back from the glass

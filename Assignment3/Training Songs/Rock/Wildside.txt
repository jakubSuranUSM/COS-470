I'll try to tell you cause
I know you'll understand
The pleasure you measure
Comes from my first command
Everybody gotta listen to me
Cause it's time that we hit the streets
It's like no other place girl
You'll have me whole world at your feel
Out on the wild side
Yeah, livin' all your fantasies
On me wild side
You can come, but you can't leave

With one shot you feel hot
No one can slow you down
Our days are bound to change
And tonight we're gonna hove it all
You are wild and you are willing
But are you ready to sacrifice
Now you're headin' in the right direction
But you're gonna have to pay the price

On the wild side
Livin' all your fantasies
On the wild side
Yeah, you can come but you can't leave

You're wild and you are willing
But are you ready to sacrifice
Now you're headin' in the right direction
But you're gonna hove to pay the price

Out on the wild side
Yeah, livin' all your fantasies
On the wild side
You can come but you can't leave
On the wild side
Yeah, livin' all your fantasies
On the wild side
Oh, you can come but you can't leave
On the wild side, wild side
Wild side, wild side
Wild side, wild side
Wild side, wild side

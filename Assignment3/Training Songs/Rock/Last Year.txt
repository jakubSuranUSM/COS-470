Seasons change and there they go 
It's not over, give me hope 
It don't seem like it was before 
It's time I told you that I need more 

Today the wine is not sweet enough 
And there's no flavor to your vintage love 

[Chorus]
You don't give me the words I want to hear 
If you want me to stay baby make it clear 
You're not showing me love like you did last year 
Like you did last year 

Chase the moon across my sky 
Save the picture of you and I 
Lovers race, was won too soon 
Looks like you've given up and running out 
And I won't wait for you 

The stars ain't shining bright enough 
And Venus doesn't seem to favor us 

[Chorus]

Just come here and we'll talk all about it 
Well it's much too precious to lose so easily 
Just go back to where we used to be 

Give me the words I want to hear 
If you want me to stay baby make it clear 
You're not showing me love like you did last year 
Like you did last year

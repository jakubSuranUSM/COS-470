Promise me
A lifetime of love and laughter
Promise me
Happiness is what you're after
And this, my darling, I will promise you
For every kiss you give me
I'll give two

Promise me (promise me)
You'll do your best to make this last forever
Oh, my love (promise me)
We can spend a lifetime together
And this, my darling, I will promise you
For every year you give
I'll give you two

'Cause I just 'came disillusioned 
And relationships filled with confusions
Oh lord, the end in sad conclusions

Ooh, ooh (promise me) oh yeah (promise me)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Promise me (promise me)
Give me your word and I'll never doubt you
Run to my arms (promise me)
They were made to wrap about you
And this, my darling, I will promise you
For every step you make
I'll make two

Promise me (promise me)
Give me your word and I'll never doubt you
Oh love (promise me)
I won't wanna stay here without you
Ooh

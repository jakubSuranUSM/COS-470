I feel dizzy, all laid back and I'm too blind to see
What's going on outside my lonely window
I'm turning on the TV screen, watching news for a while
Then I fall back to sleep again

And I'm dreaming 'bout times, times that are gone
Times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
That place was everything to me, the world I made it up, you see
It's all there in my fantasy and I believe it

I'm waking up again and see that war on screen again
And it makes me want to go and hide
This world is full of misery, the anger is too big to see
That's why I had to dream this dream

I was dreaming 'bout times, times that are gone
Times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
That place was everything to me, the world I made it up, you see
It's all there in my fantasy and I believe it

Now they come again, all these soldiers without shame
Dressed in black and equipped with fire
They can stop our happy days and put us in the graves
But never reach the Ochrasy

I was dreaming 'bout times, times that are gone
Times when I lived alone in my own land called Ochrasy
Oh that place was everything to me, the world I made it up, you see
It's all there in my fantasy and I believe it

I'm waking up again and see that war on screen again
And it makes me want to go and hide
This world is full of misery, the anger is too big to see
That's why I had to dream this dream

You want to climb up the stairs
I want to push you right down
But I like you inside
So you can push me right now

If I kneel before you
And I won't go unknown
Keep your hands to yourself
When you follow me home

I don't want love
I don't want love

You wake up with open hands
?
I should have helped ?
You slept in my home

So if I see you again
Desperate in stone
Keep your prison lock dead
And I will leave my god at home

I don't want love
I don't want love

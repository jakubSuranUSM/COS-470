You're my, 
You're my underscore, 
My kite, 
In a thunder storm, 
Let me call, 
I will keep you warm, 
You're my, 
You're my autumn cold, 
Anagram, 
Of a dirty road, 
Best joke, 
That I heard, 
Best joke, 
That I heard, 

You're my, 
Compass, 
My Magnetic North, 
You keep this whole ship on course, 
Without you we would all be lost, 
So I'm begging you, 
Stay true, 

When I lie, 
You're the perfect verse, 
Send it out, 
Through the universe, 
Steal a star, 
Just for the two of us, 
See all, 
All the things we've made, 
Take or tame, 
And the note again, 
Dip a toe, 
Into our middle age, 
Dip a toe, 
And along we'll go, 

You're my, 
Compass, 
My Magnetic North, 
You keep this whole ship on course, 
Without you we would all be lost, 
So I'm begging you, 
My compass, 
My Magnetic North, 
You keep this whole ship on course, 
Without you we would all be lost, 
So I'm begging you, 

Stay true

Girl, I see you in my dreams
It happens every day and night now
Got me going to extremes
Don't seem to care what's wrong or right now

Make ya mine someday
Somehow, somewhere, someway
You say I'm really not your kind
Guess I look a little rough now

If I could give you everything, girl
Would it ever be enough now
You'll be mine someday
Somehow, somewhere, someway

Makes me wonder what's goin' on
When the night rolls in
Something happens that feels so strong
And I just can't pretend

Don't you wonder what's goin' on
When the night rolls in
Something happens that feels so strong
And it will happen again

So, you can turn and walk away
But I know you would regret it
If I ever had my way
Do you think you could forget it

Goin' happen someday
Somehow, somewhere, someway
You'll be mine someday
Somehow, somewhere, someway

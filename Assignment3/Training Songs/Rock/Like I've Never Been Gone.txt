Don't give your love to someone while I'm away,
I want you to think about me each night and day,
And when I come on home after being gone so long,
I want it to be like I've never been gone.

I'll feel your tender kisses before I go to sleep,
I'll feel your arms around me, just promise me,
You'll keep all your love and your kisses until I come home,
And then it'll be like I've never been gone,

I don't ask much of you, do what you want to do,
But, don't make me be a fool for loving you-ooo-ooo.
I'll feel you tender kisses before I go to sleep,
I'll feel your arms around me, just promise me,

You'll keep all your love and your kisses until I come home,
And then it'll be like I've never been gone.
Can't you hear me, like I've never been gone.

CHORUS
It must have been
It must have been
It must have been a happy time

CHORUS

The sun would shine
The candy bars
Kool Aid flowing like wine
The comic books

The TV shows
The bubble gum
The kitty cat

I was a time traveler
Listening to the heavenly laughter
Laurie was always with me
Ever after for ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

CHORUS

The picture drawing 
The pretend heroes
My favorite was Captain America
The little girl
The flowers in the yard
The dog and cat
The welcome mat

God told me to go out
Singing my songs and what not
Led me to the holy river baptism
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

CHORUS

The GI Joes
The plastic monsters
My dad's model airplanes
Life magazines
The Bible stories
Simba the Lion
The King Kong

I was a cosmic child walking the second mile
I had to defeat the aliens
Bloody battle, fight to the finish
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

CHORUS

It must have been
It must have been
It must have been a happy time
Time, time, time, time, time

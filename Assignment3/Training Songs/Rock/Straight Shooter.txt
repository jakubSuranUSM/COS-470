Oh baby
I got to tell you something
Your lies and your alibis been driving me crazy

Oh shoot it
Rock and roll that's my game
Fast cars, pretty women, fortune and fame
Who when it comes to live music and you playin' no games
Shows how to play the game
To prove a point
Don't hesitate
Call you like you see it
Shoot straight

The only thing I want from you
To be a straight shooter too
I've never said I was better than you
I'm a straight shooter, straight shooter
No doubt about it you can be one too
Be a straight shooter, oh yea.
I've never said I was better that you
I'm a straight shooter, straight shooter
Come on babe, be one too
Be a straight shooter
You'll never be one too
Keep it movin', make it hot
Out on the road
You sit on the rock
Even when we are playing we don't get to stop
You'll never come to far

Don't ask no questions
Don't tell no lies
Sick and tired of hearing your alibis
It matters to me does it matter to you?
To be a straight shooter too

I've never said I was better than you
But I'm a straight shooter, straight shooter
No doubt about it you can be one too
Yea baby
You got to be one
Straight shooter

Keep it movin', make it hot
Out on the road
You sit on the rock
Even when we are playing we don't get to stop
You'll never come to far

Don't ask no questions
Don't tell no lies
Sick and tired of hearing your alibis

It matters to me does it matter to you?
To be a straight shooter
Straight shooter
Straight shooter too

Straight shooter

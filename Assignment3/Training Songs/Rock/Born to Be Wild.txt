Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Ya darling you could make it happen
Take the world in a loving embrace
Fire all of your guns and once in
Explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Ya darling you could make it happen
Take the world in a loving embrace
Fire all of your guns and once in
Explode into space

Cause you're a true nature child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild

Get your motor running
And head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Ya darling you could make it happen
Take the world in a loving embrace
Fire all of your guns and once in
Explode into space

Cause you're a true nature child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild hey hey, ow!

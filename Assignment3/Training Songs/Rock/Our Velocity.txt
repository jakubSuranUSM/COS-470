I'm not a man, I'm a machine 
Chisel me down until I am clean 
I buy books I never read 
And then I'll tell you some more about me 

Beneath the concrete there's a sound 
A muffled cry below the ground 
There is a poison in the air 
A mix of chemicals and fear 

manners are just hunches
I'm not sure what they mean 
You're asking for commitment 
When I'm somewhere inbetween 

Never never try to gauge temperature 
When you tend to travel at such speed 
It's our velocity 
Is it cold where you are this time of the year?
You didn't leave a scar 

A stream of numbers hit a screen 
And you're expected to know what they mean 
Throughout the conflict, I was serene 
I can't outrun the sadness I've seen 

Are you willing to resist 
The people you've never met?
The devil's wheel revolves 
But it needs to be reset 

Never never try to gauge temperature 
When you tend to travel at such speed 

It's our velocity 
Please tell me is it cold where you are this time of the year?
You didn't leave a scar 

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore 
I'm just alone with these thoughts 

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore 
I'm just alone with my thoughts 

I watched a film to change my feelings 
Strong enough to bear a burden 
If everyone became this sensitive 
I wouldn't have to be so sensitive 

If everyone became so sensitive 
Perhaps I wouldn't be so sensitive 

Love is a lie, which means I've been lied to 
Love is a lie, which means I've been lying too 
Love is a lie, which means I've been lied to 
Love is a lie 

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore 
I'm just alone with these thoughts

I've got no-one to call in the middle of the night anymore 
I'm just alone with my thoughts

Never never try to guage temperature 
When you tend to travel at such speed 
It's our velocity

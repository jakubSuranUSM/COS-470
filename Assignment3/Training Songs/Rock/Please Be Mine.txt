I told you once, I'll tell you again
You really are my very best friend
But I, but I had to go, to go
Every time I think of you now
I get so blue somehow
'Cause I, 'cause I still love you, love you

Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine

I can feel the days grow cold
Boy, I'd love a hand to hold
Is yours, is yours still for me, for me?
I know I don't deserve you back
But I'd really like it like that
Would you, would you like it too, it too?

Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine
Please be mine

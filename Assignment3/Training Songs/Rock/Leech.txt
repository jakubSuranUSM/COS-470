Tell those stories to me
I'm dying to hear the things you've done and seen
Farfetched as they may be
You strike a smile in me
Your stories ring of perjury
Constructed of self empowering theme

{Chorus}
Sucking on my brain
You're the teacher, I'm the student
Turning things around
You story's not congruent
Tabloid decoys
Pitiful excuses
Turning things around
You're turning things around!

A manic stunning scene
I'm taking notes
You're taking me away
Into your false reality
I know your comfort lies in lying
To try to make your life make sense
But you're not making sense

{Chorus}

I'd say it aloud
But I'm not allowed
I see your head
Spin round and round
Broken record talk tonight
Skip that needle back and forth on your mind
Wearing out unconvincing lies

Like a seedling dropped from and old oak tree
Your shade don't hide no sun from me
Fake stories humor me
It's graduation time
I love you like a mother

{Chorus}

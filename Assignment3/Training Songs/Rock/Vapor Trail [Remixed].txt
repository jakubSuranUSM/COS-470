Stratospheric traces of our transitory flight
Trails of condensation held
In narrow paths of white
The sun is turning black
The world is turning gray
All the stars fade from the night
The oceans drain away

Horizon to horizon
Memory written on the wind
Fading away, like an hourglass, grain by grain
Swept away like voices in a hurricane

In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail

Atmospheric phases make the transitory last
Vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past
Silence all the songbirds
Stilled by the killing frost
Forests burn to ashes
Everything is lost

Horizon to horizon
Memory written on the wind
Washed away like footprints in the rain
Swept away like voices in a hurricane

In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail

Washed away like footprints in the rain
Swept away like voices in a hurricane

In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail
In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail
In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail
In a vapor trail, in a vapor trail

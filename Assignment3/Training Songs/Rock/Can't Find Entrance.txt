I'm always on the lookout
For new mountain peaks to climb
But when I get to that high top
I'm on level with the ground
All I want is something
That I can hold on to
Something inside tells me
That it might be you

When I get it all
I reach for more

But I can't find entrance
Where is the entry?
Can't find entrance
Where is the entry?
So where is the entry?
Can't find entrance
Where is the entry?

Gold turns to silver in my hand
So I'm gazing at the sky
I really hope my new star
Doesn't turn to dust
You think I'm playing with you
But I'm just afraid to lose
I'm trying hard to find my way
To keep you

I'm always on the lookout
For new mountain peaks to climb
But when I get to that high top

I just can't find entrance

This is the time that's been given to me
On God's highway
She is good and that's how I want to be
On God's highway

I found my love and I lost my friend
On God's highway
I fell and fell and I will fall again
On God's highway

The winter turns to spring and the summer turns to fall
On God's highway
"There are too many doors," she says, "too many walls"
On God's highway

This is the time that's been given to me
On God's highway
She is good and that's how I want to be
On God's highway

I think the tree may fall in the front yard
If this storm has it's way
I hear you dancing on the floorboards above
Unaware of what's at stake
All I ever needed was a landline
Just in case the power lines go down
All I needed would never be enough for me

I think the storm may take the screen door
If the wind gets it's way
I hear you singing on the floor just below
Unaware of what's at stake
All I ever needed was a landline
Just in case the power lines go down
All I needed would never be enough for me

All I ever needed was a landline
Just in case the power lines go down
All I needed would never be enough for me
All I ever needed was a landline
Just in case the power lines go down
All I needed would never be enough for me

All I needed would never be enough for me
All I needed would never be enough for me
All I needed would
All I needed would never be enough for me
All I needed would never be enough for me

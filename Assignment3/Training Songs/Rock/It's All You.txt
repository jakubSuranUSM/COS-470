Driven to live, but now I complain
I'm fallin' apart when I feel this way
I can't ignore, I can't exist
The door is locked and on my mind it's...
Anytime you want me, I feel good all over
Spending all my time, it really is a good thing
This is good, it's all we have
Now I know there's nothing left
I'm trapped, I'm trapped
My head is filled with facts
And it's all you
Sick in the head, I think it's a game
But if it was, I wouldn't feel this way
I'm doing my chores, I'm checking my list
I'm walking the dogs, and on my mind it's...
I'm gonna get so wasted, gonna feel good all over
I'm spendin' all my time wishing you were with me
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's all you
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's all you

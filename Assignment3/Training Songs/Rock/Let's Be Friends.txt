I'm not the type of guy to follow a trend, 
I'm not the type of guy that you could offend. 
I'm not the angel that you want me to be, 
I'm not the person you're expecting to see. 
That doesn't matter 'cause I say what I like, now. 
I'm even thinking of you, woo babe I'm thinkin'. 

Hey little baby let's be friends. 
Hey little baby. 
Hey little baby let's be friends, 
'Cause I can tell that we're gonna get along. 

I'm not the reason for the lack in the charm, 
I am the reason you can raise the alarm. 
That doesn't matter 'cause I say what I like, now. 
I'm even thinking of you, woo babe I'm thinkin'. 

Hey little baby let's be friends. 
Hey little baby. 
Hey little baby let's be friends, 
'Cause I can tell that we're gonna get along. 

Hey little baby let's be friends, 
Hey little baby doll. 

Hey little baby,
Hey little baby, I said let's be friends. 

Hey little baby let's be friends. 
Hey little baby doll. 
Hey little baby let's be friends, 
'Cause I can tell that we're gonna get along. 

Hey little baby let's be friends. 
Hey little baby doll. 
Hey little baby let's be friends, 
'Cause I can tell that we're gonna get along. 

Hey little baby let's be friends, 
I said, I can tell that we're gonna get along.

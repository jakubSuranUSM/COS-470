Well, they stood prepared as you took the chair.
There was no need to satisfy you
I'll be damned though I held your hand
They felt the need to crucify you

You're goin' down baby baby
You're goin' down baby baby
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head

You're a fragile flower in its finale hour 
With no chance to taste the waters.
Judge declared "You'll get 15 yrs,
Join the lonely sons and daughters"

You're going down baby baby
You're going down baby baby
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head

Smoke and mirrors couldn't hide your tears
Your eyes only betray you
Long trip, you lost your grip
We've all been praying for you

You're going down baby baby
You're going down baby baby
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head
You're in a tailspin, running out of your head

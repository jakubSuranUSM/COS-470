I want to ride the range
Across those skies of black
I want to see for myself
And when I've gone the distance
I'll be making tracks
For an English Sunset

We're on a runaway train
Rolling down the track
And where it's taking us to
Who knows where it's at
But if we hold together
We can make it back
For an English Sunset
We want an English sunset

I feel the rhythm of the earth
In my soul tonight
May I never fade away
And I've decided I can live
With humility
And the sad decay
‘Cause that's the English way.

We keep the faith alive
In everything we do
And at the end of the road
We still keep coming through
And though it's sad and sorry
It's an English sunset
An English sunset

I feel the rhythm of the earth
In my soul tonight
May I never fade away
And I've decided I can wait
For the requiem
We take it  day by day
‘Cause that's the English way.
I saw the English sunset

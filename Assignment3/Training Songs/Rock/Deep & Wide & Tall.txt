My girl
She fled the fatherland
And all it's dumb demands
My Girl
She is the essence pure
She's super sure, she's got the cure
She's love ambassadress
With a message

Here comes the bottom line

Are we going to live together
Lovers over all
One unending understanding
Deep & wide & tall

My girl
She is the sweetest sound
When living lets me down
My girl
Can turn me on this way
From a world away
She's love's ambassadress
She's got a message

Here comes the bottom line

Are we going to live together
Lovers over all
One unending understanding
Deep & wide & tall

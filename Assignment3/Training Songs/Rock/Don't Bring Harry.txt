Harry and me we live in a dream
With a friend like him I don't need enemies
I don't know where morning is
It might not come today
That's the trouble when Harry's around
He forces me to play

I should have refused to meet this midnight cheat
He likes to prey on my mind with his own special treat
I don't know where morning comes
It might not come today
Harry likes to play all night
I'll do what harry says

Don't bring harry
I don't need him around
Don't bring harry
I don't need him around

Ah... you've met harry
I can see by your eyes
If once there was life there
Now there's compromise

Harry is a beast of luxury
He just wants my body and soul leaves the bones behind

Ah... you've met harry
I can see by your eyes
If once there was action
Now there is no life

Don't bring harry
I don't need him around
Don't bring harry
I don't need him around

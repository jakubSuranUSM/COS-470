We lived in the country when I was a child
You lived up the highway, 'bout half a mile
We laughed away the hours, runnin' to and fro
Tell me baby, where did the good times go?

I can still remember summers in the shade
Winters by the fireplace, the promises we made
You said, you'd always love me, what happened, I don't know
Baby, where did all the good times go?

[Chorus]
Where did all the good times go? Where did they go?
Tell me, woman, if you know, where did the good times go?

I can still remember summers in the shade
Winters by the fireplace, the promises we made
You said, you'd always love me, what happened, I don't know
Baby, where did all the good times go?

[Chorus]

3000 miles underneath the pavement
Holds you to something you don't understand
Staring for hours at the spot on the ceiling
It needs to be painted but it's out of your hands
And I don't want to be soul free
And that we can't even get on
Everything I should have never thought have has finally come
So don't paint my candles red again
Don't crawl into my head again

[Chorus:]
Jump off the world
Jump off the world
Jump off the world

Stuck in a hit in a staircase around you
Waiting for all of the trust in the sky
Write up on pictures you should have avoided
You gladly trade your mind for a write but

[Chorus]

For many lines of action
Will follow you forever and ever

[Chorus]

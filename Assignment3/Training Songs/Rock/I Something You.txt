I something you
As the nights get older
I something you
As if you couldn't see
In the best years of my life         5
At least I haven't got a wife
I something you
You whatnot me

I something you
As the dead things moulder          10
In Leicester Square
That's the place to be
After all these ruined years
Let me realize your fears
I something you                     15
You whatnot me

In this kind of song
Middle bits are so predictable
But you came along
You were not at all predictable     20

I didn't think you'd be like this
I didn't think you'd be like this
Well, I didn't even think that you'd be like this
That you'd be like this
That I'd feel like this, but        25

I something you
As the nights get colder
And you heat up
And you are next to me
In the twilight of this world       30
You are my Dutch, Australian, Hungarian, Jewish girl
I something you
You whatnot me

I something you
You something me

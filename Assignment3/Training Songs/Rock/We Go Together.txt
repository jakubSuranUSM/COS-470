We go together
Lot Like castles and kings
Birds of a feather
Two robins in spring
Let's go steady
Your are my first love ove-ove-ove-ove uh oh uh oh

We like the same things
That makes living so sweet
Loving at movies
In, in the balcony seats
Let's go steady
You are my first love

So please, listen to me
Someday, we will be
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band

We go together
Like two straws in a coke
Why not come over
And you'll meet my folks
Let's go steady
You are my first love

So please, listen to me
Someday, you will be
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band
I love you so 

We go together 
Lot likes straws in a coke
Why not come over and you'll meet my folks
Let's got steady
Your are my first love
First love
You are my first love
You are my first love

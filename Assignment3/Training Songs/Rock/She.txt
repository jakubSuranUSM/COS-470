She knew she was different
When she was nine years old
She had a little trouble
Doing what she was told
Strong-willed, spirit-filled, innocent, wild
Not your typical yes ma'am, no ma'am child
It was her life and she was gonna live it
And if it took her heart and soul
She was gonna give it

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side
That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

The day she turned eighteen
She instinctively knew
Love is the teacher
Life is the school
And she figured it out one fateful day
That if she played it safe she would never play
And in that moment hearts dream about
A girl walked in and a woman walked out

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side
That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

Driven by a fire
Burning deep inside
She says if life is what you make it
I'm gonna make it mine

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side
That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

"I think I've travelled here before,
And stood upon this velvet shore,
That looks out to the golden ship of Reason."
The man took to the gentle life,

The wind cried to the skies,
I felt that I would cry as I was leaving.
Tomorrow is a step away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sadness.

Still I am a dream away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sweet madness. 
"And in my dream, I thought I heard
The truth behind the spoken word.

I thought that I had something to believe in."
But all too soon the dream was gone,
And in the dust that lingered on,
The tears that I'd shed tried to free me.

Tomorrow is a step away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sadness.
Still I am a dream away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sweet madness.

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
And that I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun

So I choose freedom
Running 'round, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
Well I never expected it too

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

As for fortune and as for fame
Well I never invited them in
Though it seems to the world
They were all I desired

They were illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

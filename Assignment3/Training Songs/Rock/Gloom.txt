And the night catches in and takes us back
Back to those times and days where we left
My friend, one day it’d be you
’Cause something’s not right when my eyes are on fire
We all used to dream but it ain’t taking us higher
My baby, I’ve been thinking of you

And we’re floating in colors and heavenly things
The sky is below us and always within
We’re young, it’s our only drug
They put gold in our arms whenever we ask
Give us the fever, the fever we like
You know I’ve been thinking about gloom

Some days we dance and some days we don't
Some days we're young and some days we're old
Some days we're sad and wanna go home
Some days we live and some days we don't
Some days we dance and some days we don't
Some days we're broken and some days we're whole
Some days we shine and some days we don't
Some days we dance and some days we don't

Candle lit, and my eyes are slits
Jumpin' now, paper clip.
Make a move, sail a ship,
Tap it in, tap it in, ruby lips.

She's a mixed up, shook up girl,
Got me so strung out.
I don't know what to do.
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl.

Take a breath, in the night.
Hurry over, she said,
But there was no one in sight.
Now break away, is in her eyes.
You know that little girl, she cut me deep,
Inside out.

She's a mixed up, shook up girl,
Got me so strung out.
I don't know what to do.
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl.

Hey, you, I remember
All the empty streets.
Fill me now.
And though you're gone away,
I know not forever.
Why don't you just come over here and tell me, baby
Is it over now?

She's a mixed up, shook up girl,
Got me so strung out.
I don't know what to do.
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl.
She's a mixed up, shook up girl,
She's a mixed up, shook up girl.
And she got me so strung out
She's a mixed up, shook up girl

And she got me so strung out

She's a mixed up, shook up girl

I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life

I’m off the grid, I’m out of range
And the amber waves of grain
Are turning grey again
The darkened stage
And the infinite waves
Distance can change fate
I'm out of range again
I'm living my life
I'm living my life

Will you tell me when you find out
How to conquer all this fear
I've been spending too much time out
On the fading frontier
Will you tell me when you find out how
To recover the lost years
I’ve spent all of my time out here
Chasing the fading frontier

I’m living my life (on repeat in the background)
I’m off the grid
I’m out of range
And the amber waves of grain
Are turning grey again
The darkened stage
And the infinite waves
Distance can change fate
It's happening again
I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life

You make me sit alone
Waiting by the phone
Nervous but controlled
I'm talking to myself
I'm playing with myself
I've got to get away forever

Well it may be fun 
I'll try not to run away and hide

I'm strutting back and forth
I'm pacing what a bore
Still waiting for your call
I've got to get away
And let these feelings fade
My life is going to change forever

Well it may be fun 
I'll try not to run away and hide

[Chorus]
Now I'm going down in flames
I'll never be the same 
I'll try not to complain forever
Of all the things I've done 
You're the only one 
That always made me come forever

Living in the past 
My time has gone to fast
I'm over you at last forever
I've got to get away
And let these feelings fade
My life is going to change for better

Well it may be fun 
I'll try not to run away and hide

[Chorus]

Of all the things I've done
You're the only one
That always made me come forever
In leather
Forever

[Chorus]

Forever
Of all the things I've done
You're the only one 
That always made me come

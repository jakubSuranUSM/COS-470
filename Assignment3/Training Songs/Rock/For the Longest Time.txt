Would you wait if I came running home to you?
Or if I moved right down the street a block or two?
Distance is never on our side
It only seems to make our dreams collide
And you have gone on to someone new

Would you wait if I wrote you a perfect song tonight?
To make your heart stand still and make your chest grow tight
But I'll never write a perfect line
And I don't know why I even waste my time and try, whoa

And for the longest time
I couldn't love her to save my life
Never a moment of peace in my mind, yeah
Cause in the longest line
The front and the back are the same sometimes
And taking a number has taken my time, whoa

And there are things that I don't have the patience for
And when I go to my room I leave an open door
Cause I can't stand to feel alone
And when you come around I'm feeling more at home, whoa

And for the longest time
I couldn't love her to save my life
Never a moment of peace in my mind, yeah
Cause in the longest line
The front and the back are the same sometimes
And taking a number has taken my time, whoa

Don't pass me by
Give me another chance tonight
To make your heavy heart so light that you can fly
Cause every time
I see the light behind your eyes
The whole thing catches me in a moment by surprise

And for the longest time
I couldn't love her to save my life
Never a moment of peace in my mind, yeah
Cause in the longest line
The front and the back are the same sometimes
And taking a number has taken my time, whoa, whoa

And for the longest time
I couldn't love her to save my life
Never a moment of peace in my mind, whoa
(Don't pass me by)
Yeah, cause in the longest line
The front and the back are the same sometimes
And taking a number has taken my time, whoa
(Don't pass me by)

And for the longest time
I couldn't love her to save my life
Never a moment of peace in my mind, whoa
(Don't pass me by)
Yeah, cause in the longest line
The front and the back are the same sometimes
And taking a number has taken my time, whoa
(Don't pass me by)

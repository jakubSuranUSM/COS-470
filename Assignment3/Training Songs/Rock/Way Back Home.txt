I was just a little boy without care
I remember looking up and seeing you there
I never wandered too far from your sight
'Cause all the love I needed was there in your eyes

We grew up in a war zone city with a cast iron wind
Broken lives, darken streets, and twisted steel
But around our house the sky seems so blue
And on a wing and prayer we just muddled through

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I shall live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

Tell me why in wars that made our family strong
As our defiant little island weathered the storm
There never seemed enough on my plate
You said be grateful, say grace, don't complain

How can I ever thank you for the lessons that I've learnt
And the precious warmth and comfort that I've felt at every turn
And the roses sacrifice their lives for freedom and for peace
I will always find my way back, always find my way back home

I'll give you stories, operation burning skies
And our nation with its back against the wall
Like a wide-eyed school boy I hang on with the record
Stories I was too young to recall

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

We shall fight on the beaches
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields, and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender

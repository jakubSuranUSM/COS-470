I look up and I look down
I take my shoes off to be closer to the ground
I can think of many ways
To screw up all these perfect days
But I am feeling bold an brave 
I think I'll just feel good today

Somehow in the twisted world I'm really doing fine
You can say this peace of mind was never really mine
But I feel fine

Here's one reason to be sad
Half of us have nothing and the other feels too fat
But this nog the the time and place
To crucify the human race
There's a massive height to ride 
I'm keeping my eyes open wide

Somehow

I don't want to close my eyes
Someone tell me how long I 
Can keep this day inside

Somehow

I don't always wake up this alive 
But I have you so I feel fine

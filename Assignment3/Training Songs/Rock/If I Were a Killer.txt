This is just a hypothetical story
Of someone, let's just say it's me
I'd gain acceptance for my murderous ways
By stalking a defenseless prey

If I were a killer
I'd smile just like the boy next door
If I were a killer
I'd say I do it for the poor
If I were a killer
You'd bring me victims more and more
If I were a killer

Supreme Court would agree to hear my case
And find me innocent of crime
Holding public rallies to incite sympathy
Creative actuality

If I were a killer
I'd smile just like the boy next door
If I were a killer
I'd say I do it for the poor
If I were a killer
You'd bring me victims more and more
If I were a killer

If I were a killer
I'd smile just like the boy next door
If I were a killer
I'd say I do it for the poor
If I were a killer
You'd bring me victims more and more
If I were a killer
I'd hide behind a doctor's door
If I were a killer
I'd scrape you off my office floor
If I were a killer

Killer

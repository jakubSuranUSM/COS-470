Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Please don't leave me, baby, please don't go
Please don't leave me baby, please don't go 
Well, if you go 'way and leave me, dear you're gonna hurt me so
Yes I love you baby, gonna tell all the world I do 
Yes I love you baby, gonna tell all the world I do 
Well, if you go 'way and leave me, don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
'Cause my life is sliding
I tried to ride the wave
It came down crashing, it's time to start again
Backwards to go forward
Left at every corner
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

First step, your last breath
Everything's been planned
There's questions, and answers
You'll never understand
I hold on, but let go
I give you room to breath
Remember, the best things
Were never mine to keep
Starting at the ending
It won't break, while your bending
Been there, and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

The soundtrack to your life
And it goes by like a bullet, and my name
It may be different than yours but, you got the same
Beat a broken back for more
I'll be dragging my own ass off the floor

I've thrown my self right in and,
Whats the point if you don't live in

If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

It starts right now, there's a way I was before
But I can't recall how I was those days anymore
I'm learning how to be here and nowhere else
How to focus on what I can do myself

I'm not telling you all I'm going through
I feel fine

Leave it all to memory of
What we did when were young and
Now you could just leave me on my own
Oh, moving towards a new idea
You're not what I really needed
Now you could just leave me on my own

But I'm not, I'm not you
You're a part of me, you're a part of me

It's over now, there's a way I was before
But I can't recall how I was those days anymore
I'm learning how to be here and nowhere else
How to focus on what I can do myself

I'm not telling you all I'm going through
I feel fine

Leave it all to memory of
What we did when were young and
Now you could just leave me on my own
Oh, moving toward a new idea
You're not what I really needed
You could just leave me on my own

But I'm not, I'm not you
You're a part of me, you're a part of me

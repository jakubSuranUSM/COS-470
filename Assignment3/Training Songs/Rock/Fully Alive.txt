Telling Layla's story spoken
'Bout how all her bones are broken
Hammers fall on all the pieces
Two months in the cover creases

Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shining way

Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life
Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life

All my complaints shrink to nothing
I'm ashamed of all my somethings
She's glad for one day of comfort
Only because she has suffered

Here she stands today 
In her brilliant shining way

Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life
Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life

Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life
Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life

Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life
Fully alive
More than most, ready to smile, and love life

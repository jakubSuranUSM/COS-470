Time, love and tenderness

So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'?
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view, oh

Nothing is as sad as it seems, you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartbreak
Somehow you can get through the rain

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So, baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever, oh

All the tears are gonna dry, you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But, baby, that old luck's gonna change

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness

The hurt ain't gonna last forever
Oh
Oh
Time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love, and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Better than time, love, and tenderness

Baby, oh, baby
You just need some, you just need some
Time, love, and tenderness
Baby
All you need
Time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness
Baby
Time, love, and tenderness
Time, love, and tenderness
Gonna take some time
Love, ooh, ooh
Time, love, and tenderness
Baby
All you need, all you need

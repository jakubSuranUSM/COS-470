Recover the pieces, recover the pieces, it's all I've got.
And remember me not.
This feeling is empty, this feeling is empty, it's all you gave to me.

And all those fucked up things you put me through.
You lost the only thing you had left to lose, tragic mistake.

Under the circumstance, you act like a kid and you walked away.
What was the last thing that you said?
Shying away, 'cause you wanted it every day,
And you lost it all, and you lost it all.

Break through the casing, break through the casing, it's what's inside. 
All those things that you hide.
Pull skin from your fingers, pull skin from your fingers to ignore me, like always.

And all those fucked up things you put me through.
You lost the only thing you had left to lose, tragic mistake.

Under the circumstance, you act like a kid and you walked away.
What was the last thing that you said?
Shying away, 'cause you wanted it every day,
And you lost it all, you lost it all.

And it's time to see what's inside me.
It's been cold and dark for some time.
It's way too much for me.

Under the circumstance, you act like a kid and you walked away.
What was the last thing that you said?
Shying away, 'cause you wanted it every day,
And you lost it all, you lost it all.

Oh depression
Got you guessing about the thing you should do, yeah
Don't you let it, you can bet it
She'll make a fool out of you, hey

When confusion keeps you losin'
And you're searchin' for a find, yeah
Turn this madness into gladness
Keep these words in your mind

Everything that you do
Will come back to you, yeah
Everything that you do
Will come back to you, hey hey

Eyes wide open, see the motion
Of the problems that go down
You can't stop 'em, better drop 'em
Don't let 'em turn you around, oh no

When you hear that voice inside
Why don't you let it be your guide, uh huh?
Don't you know you just can't go
All wrapped up in your foolish pride?

Everything that you do
Will come back to you, oh yeah
Everything that you do
Will come back to you, uh huh

Everything that you do
Will come back to you, oh yeah
Everything that you do
Will come back to you, hey hey

Oh yeah hey, it's gonna come back
It's gonna come back
Everything is gonna come back
Everything will come back to you
Uh huh, gonna come back to you
Gonna come back to you
Gonna watch what you say
Gonna watch what you do
It's gonna come right back, right back home to you
Uh huh, everything gonna come back, right back to you

Waking up at twelve in my clothes again
Feel my head explode from a night of gin
Another night out late
I don't want to drink, don't want to be a clown
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
Before it pulls me in

How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna catch me when I'm coming down
To hit the ground again

All by myself
Cause I don't want to drag you down
Hold you down, cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now

On the underground the freaks and frowns
Looking at the world through silver clouds
But then it all came down
I gotta rise above the emotional flood
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands
Pull myself around

How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna be there when I've lost control
I'm heading to crashland

All by myself
Cause I don't want to drag you down
Hold you down, cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now

All by myself
Cause I don't want to drag you down
Hold you down, cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think its funny now, funny now
It's such a shame

All by myself
Cause I don't want to drag you down
Hold you down, cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now
It's such a sin

All by myself
Cause I don't want to drag you down
Hold you down, cause you're a friend
I blame myself
I guess you think it's funny now, funny now

Well you're still pretty
And now I'm sorry
That I don't say it
Well darling if we had a prayer
Well girl I swear, what you got I'm praying

Oh and you don't kiss the sweat away
When I walk through that door
Now I hate to see you not even be you
I look at snapshots trying to find clues

I've got to see oh just how we got stranded
Lord we're stranded
Now we're stranded in a place we can't call home
Yeah we're stranded, its better than being alone

Well you talk sad words
And now your eyes cry pretty black
Well you gave up dreams
And now you're mad well you want them back
Oh but even in your heart girl
Would you walk away from me?
Well sometimes you hold tight, when it's a cold night
You push up hard girl, hoping that you might find 
Some escape from the hate that we call 

Stranded, stranded
Now we're stranded in a place we can't call home
Yeah we're stranded
Its better than being alone

Well now the time was once where the boys made eyes
You walked away, you didn't need them
Well lately guys been comin around, what's going down?
Its all over town, now the word's comin round

Baby stranded, yeah baby stranded
Well baby stranded in a place we can't call home
Yeah we're stranded
Its better than being alone
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
No no no not anymore
Yeah we're stranded
And ain't that what we're for?

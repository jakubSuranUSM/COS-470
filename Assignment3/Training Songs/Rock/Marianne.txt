Can I get through to you now
Can I Marianne
What are you trying to do now
Come on Marianne
Ain't no use in conversation

Poor little girl you're outta this world Marianne
Everyone seems to think you're too much Marianne
Everyone seems to think they know you Marianne
Why you don't even know yourself
Poor little girl you're out of this world Marianne
Wake up Marianne

Ooh I can tell
You're a sweet little heart breaker Marianne
Don't mind me,
But I think I'll see you later Marianne
Don't you go flip out, trip out, skip out
Poor little girl you're outta this world Marianne

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Or are you afraid of the shakeup
There's a better thing you can take up,
Wake up Marianne

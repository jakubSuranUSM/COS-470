We are words that float through her veins
Her sexual use of pain
And she sends her sailors in
Well, they don't come back
And they don't give in

We are sailors drunk as wine
They forget the house in time
Baby, I'm upon the rocks
Tied in the arms of an octopus

National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care
National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care

[?] but cannot save
From across the waves
With a knife that's sure to kill
Following herself
Suits the dollar [?]

Sleep comes, this can't last long
Darling, watch the sunrise
Sleep comes, this can't last long
Darling, just see the sunrise

National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care
National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care

National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care
National anthem of nowhere
Winds come trolling, the sea don't care

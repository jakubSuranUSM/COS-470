When she flows
(Don't try to catch a river)
No one will ever catch her.
When love goes,
(don't try to catch your lover)
For love is a kind of river,
River flows over rocks and walls,
and I'd like to know why,
She seems to be  far away from the sky.

When she flows,
(Don't try to catch a river)
No one will ever catch her.
When love goes,
(Don't try to catch your lover)
For love is a kind of river.

Lovers leave their girls at sunrise,
and I'd like to know why,
They seem to be so ashamed of the size,

Don't you try
Don't you try
Don't you try
Don't you try
 River
River
River
When she flows,
(Don't try to catch a river)
No one will ever catch her.
When love goes,
(Don't try to catch your lover)
For love is a kind of river.

River carries along dead leaves,
And I'd like to know why,
Why don't lovers bring along wounded hearts.

River

Oehh ... River... 
Oehh ... River...

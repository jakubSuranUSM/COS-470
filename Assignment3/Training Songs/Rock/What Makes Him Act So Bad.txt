Please don't adjust that smile, the stowaway on the ceiling
Please don't adjust that dial, babe
'Cause this radio has feelings

And I know you're the one with the answer
What makes him act so bad?
And I know you're a wonderful dancer
What makes him act so bad?

What did we do to him to make him act so bad?
What did we say to him to make him say things like that?

And I know you're the one with the answer
What makes him act so bad?
And I know you're a wonderful dancer
What makes him act so bad?

You are a flighty one whose nature is so transgressive
Hold up that dialing wand and show me what's so expensive

And I know you're the one with the answer
What makes him act so bad?
And I know you're a wonderful dancer
What makes him act so bad?

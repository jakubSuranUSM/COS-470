I dreamt I was a refugee
Who lived outside of town
My family in a barria shack
Battered and run down

We had a friend from America
Helped out, we took him in
Like my brother he disappeared
They said he was with him

There we were far out at sea
Somehow we got lost
Then we landed hard on shore
There upon the rocks
While celebration shook the air
We turned to hear some shots
There's ones that have been here far too long
We think they've lost the plot

Here I go again
Leaving things out while I'm leaving things in
Where, where should I begin
Feeling so full or feeling so thin

Calling America
Man I know you're out there
Sisters are you breathing

Calling America
This thing they call America
It really is a dream

Then I stood face to face
With a girl that I once knew
She was dressed in gingham there
In colors red, white and blue
The more I spoke, the less she heard
And then she slipped away
I just stood there sinking
Far beneath the waves

Here we go again
Leaving things out while we're leaving things in
Where, where should we begin
Feeling so full or feeling so thin
 
Calling America
Man I know you're out there
Can't you hear me calling

Calling America
Sister are you out there
Can't you feel me dreaming

Calling America
This thing they call America
Really what does it mean

Calling America
This thing they call America
It really is a dream

Here we go again
Leaving things out while we're leaving things in
Where, where should we begin
Feeling so full or feeling so thin

Calling America
Man I know you're out there
Sister are you breathing

Calling America
This thing they call America
It really is a dream

Calling America
Sister are you out there
Can't you feel me breathing

Calling America
Sister are you out there
Can't you feel me breathing

Calling America
This thing they call America
Really what does it mean

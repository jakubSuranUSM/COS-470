There comes a time in a young girl's life
When she first meets a man
There comes a time in a young girl's life
When she becomes a woman

Highway number nineteen
The moon's shining bright
She's been in my dreams
If it's ever gonna happen 
It'll happen tonight

Talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what you gonna do
Come to me, come to me
Are we gonna see it through?
So you got a reputation
Well I do too!
All across the nation
There are guys hanging out to meet girls like you

The dogs are talking
Heartbreaker, heartbreaker
With a jelly roll skin
Lovemaker, lovemaker
Ain't'cha gonna let me in?
Backseat, backseat
You know ya gotta loosen up
Body heat, body heat
Don't stop now
Don't stop, don't stop

The dogs are talking
Cool down, cool down
You don't want to go home
Turn around, turn around
We're gonna scream and moan
Talk to me, talk to me
What's you number?
What's your name?
Gimme more, gimme more
Gotta do it again, and again, and again

The dogs are talking
Let them talk, talk!

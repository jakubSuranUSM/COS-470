I can fly through these hallways
Dressed in light though it always
It always gets cold
I can sing through my fingers
Though the worth of a singer
Is nothing I'm told

I am a full grown man
I will lay lay lay
In the grass
In the grass
All day

I can freeze in the place that
Gets me free from this taste that
I have in my heart
We can curl in the waters
Naked swirling like otters
(you know how they are)

I am a full grown man
I will be calm calm calm
In the grass
In the grass
In your arms

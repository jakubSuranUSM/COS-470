You don't like crazy music, you don't like rockin' bands
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holdin' hands
You're so square, baby I don't care

I don't know why my heart blips, I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby, I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps, but I do-a-hoo-hoo
I only know why I love you like I do, a-do, a-do, a-do

I don't know why my heart blips, I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby, I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby I don't care

I don't know why my heart blips, I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby, I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care, care care, care care

I?m tired and I?m sick
Got a habit that I just can?t kick
(I) Feel hungover and I?m all in love
When the lights go down
I?m gonna shoot ?em all/up

S?alrite
Don?t be afraid
You gotta keep dreaming in the bed you made
And if it tastes like shit
Well, it beats sleeping rough on the floor

Keep saying that my head?s locked up in the clouds
Keep praying that the lord won?t slow me down
I?m tired and I?m sick
Got a habit that I can?t, won?t lick
Feel hungover and I?m all in love
Let the lights go down
Me and you are gonna shoot em all/up

Keep saying that my head?s locked up in the clouds
Keep praying that the lord won?t slow me down
I?m tired and I?m sick
Got a habit that I just can?t kick
Feel hungover and I?m all in love
When the lights go down
Me and you are gonna shoot em all/up

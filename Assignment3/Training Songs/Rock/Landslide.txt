We're caught in a landslide
No one else is there
I try to be true 
But I don't have the strength

Listening all alone in your room was your finest hour
Being overlooked by the ones who can only follow
Little men
We're caught in a landslide

We're caught in a net
And I'm caught in the middle
Leaving you miles ahead
How can you come this far

And never wished them dead ?
I try to be true but I don't have the strength
We're caught in a landslide
We're caught in a net

And I'm caught in the middle
Leaving you miles ahead
Listening all alone in your home was your darkest hour
Being clothed and fed by the ones who can only follow 

Little men
Caught in a landslide
Caught in a net
Caught in a landslide

Caught in a net
Caught in a landslide
Caught in a net
I must try harder

What's this I hearthat's going all around town?
The people are sayin' you gonna put the kid down,
Lordy, what're you doing?
You can call it what you want,
I call it messin' with the kid.

You told me you loved me,
You told me a lie.
I love you woman till the day I die.
Lordy, what're you doing?
You can call it what you want,

You took the kid's car and drove all around town,
Tellin' everybody you're gonna put the kid down.

Love is an unfamiliar name 
Present and future I'm going to find you 
Ready for silence and the heat 
What have you got? 
Limited value on my stuff 
Falling and rising I'm gonna cut loose 
Love is an unfamiliar name 
What have you got? 
Love is an unfamiliar name 
I keep on trying to reach you but you're never the same 
I'm ready for silence and the heat 
But I'm tired and worn and it won't let me sleep 

So caught up in my lone communion 
When you get this honey, I'm for sticking 
So caught up in my lone communion 
When you get this honey, I'm for sticking 

Forever remember who you are 
Present and future I'm going to love you
Steady the minus and the plus 
What do you need? 
Limited value on my stuff 
Rising and falling I'm gonna cut loose 
Love is an unfamiliar name 
What have you got? 
Love is an unfamiliar name 
I keep on trying to reach you but you're never the same 
I'm ready for silence and the heat 
But I'm tired and worn and it won't let me sleep 

So caught up in my lone communion 
When you get this honey, I'm for sticking 
So caught up in my lone communion 
When you get this honey, I'm for sticking

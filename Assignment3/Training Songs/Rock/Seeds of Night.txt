Oh my darling we're meadowing now, oh love is bold in the
Cricketing fields
And a sly part of night gets down to get up, oh bright
Light sing me a song, on and on.

Oh, de da
Oh, I know

Oh my love this is our town, where gray cloud wander over
Heaven and ground
Oh, my love it's difficult times, mistakes I've made

Escape like birds from a line, on and on.

Oh, thinking of heaven, oh thinking it's night
Oh, thinking of heaven, oh maybe next time.

Oh thinking of heaven, oh thinking it's night
Oh, thinking of heaven, oh maybe next time, next life
Down the road.

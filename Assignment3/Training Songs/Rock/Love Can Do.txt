Who can say why she turned and walked away
I can see but she's gone away
Sometime love means we have to stand the fire
Everybody runs, everybody hides.

I know this ain't the moon
Now it's special love
This won't be I'm sure of.

Hey, little girl runnin' out so fast
Gotta stay put for love to last
Why you gotta say that love has gone away
It's not like that
Everybody hurts when the feelings fade
If you want ‘em back, you know you gotta stay
(No runnin'), No runnin'
Love's coming back like only love can do.

Love can do things you never thought it could
When the hurt's so bad, make you feel (so good).
Love's for fools; why's it love to take a chance
Hear the music girl; let me see you dance.

I know this ain't the moon
Now it's give and take
And it's your heart that's take.

Hey, little girl runnin' out so fast
Gotta stay put for love to last
Why you gotta say that love has gone away
It's not like that
Well, everybody hurts when the feelings fade
If you want ‘em back, you know you gotta stay
(No runnin'), No runnin'
Love's coming back like only love can do.

Hey, little girl (Hey, little girl) runnin' so fast (fast)
Yea, yea lookin' for love you're sure to last.
Why do I have to see love has gone away
It's not like that; love's not like that. 

Everybody hurts when the feelings fade
If you want ‘em back, you know you gotta stay
(No runnin'), No runnin'
Love's coming back like only love can do.

(Hey, little girl runnin' out so fast)
Gotta stay put for love to last
Why you gotta say that love has gone away
It's not like that. 
No everybody hurts when the feelings fade
If you want ‘em back, you know you gotta stay
(No runnin'), No runnin'
Love's coming back.

Hey, little girl runnin' out so fast
Gotta stay put for love to last
Why you gotta say that love has gone away
It's not like that

(No runnin'), No runnin'
Love's coming back like only love can do.

I left my home one day
For the sake of better pay
In a foreign land twelve centuries back in time
Where the sun keeps burning down
On the hole drilled in the ground
And I dream of the girl I left behind
Well I signed the dotted line
And I thought in a few years time
I'd be home and we can start a brand new life
But everything went wrong
And I just don't know how long
They will make me stay to pay for my crime
And I wish I was
Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh, oh, oh, rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me
There's a law that rules this land
That I just didn't understand
I didn't know that I was doing wrong
But they don't seem to care
And they all do it when they're over there
But here your face is justice of their god
And I wish I was
Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh, oh, oh, rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me
All the money that I've saved
To pay for better days
Just can't make up for how I miss you so
There's no consolation prize
Oh, but when I close my eyes
I'm dreaming of you in our new home
And I wish I was
Rollin' home, rollin' home
Home to the place I long to be
Oh, oh, oh, rollin' home, rollin' home
There's someone waiting there for me
Rollin' home there's someone waiting for me
Rollin' home there's someone waiting for me

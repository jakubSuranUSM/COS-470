I walk alone in dreams
I cannot feel I cannot see
The only thing I know is that
You're only real to me
I see your hair hang down around your shoulders and your collar
I lean your head upon a pillow made of leaves and straw
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass

The night was warm the moon was bright
your perfume filled the air
As I looked down on you
you ran your fingers through my hair
With lips apart I thought that you were
going to call my name
Instead the kiss that followed was enought to melt my brain
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass

I'm only left with misty dreams they're in my mind
My life was shattered on that night
That you were mine and now there's nothing left
Except the memory or is it misery
of how things used to be
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass

I walk alone in dreams
I cannot feel I cannot see
The only thin I know is that
you're only real to me
I see your hiar hang down around your shoulders and your collar
I lean your head upon a pillow made of leaves and straw
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass
Night of the Long Grass

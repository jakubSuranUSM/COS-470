As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat,
I thought I spied my future bride a-walking up the street,
I shouted to the driver "Hey conductor, you must"
"Slow down, I think I see her, please let me off this bus."

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you got something else to do.

I saw her on the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd tryin' to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. 
Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you're up to somethin' new.

Downtown searching for her, looking all around.
Saw her gettin' in a yellow cab a-heading uptown.
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.
Slipped a twenty dollar bill, an' told him "Catch that yellow cab."

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. 
Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you're up to somethin' new.

She moves around like a wayward summer breeze,
Go, driver, go.  Go on, catch her for me, please.
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier.
Leaning out the taxi window tryin' to make her hear.

[Chorus]

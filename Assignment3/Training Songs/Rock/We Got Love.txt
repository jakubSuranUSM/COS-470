'Cause you've got one lucky fella two love you true
And I got three little words I'm sayin' with four only you
Five o'clock I call you and by six we got a date
Seven I'll be heaven-bound and in your arms by eight

Everybody now (we got love)
By the numbers (we got love)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (ain't it wonderful we got love)

'Cause I got one million kisses two thrill you through
And I got three thousand hugs I'm savin' four only you?
Five'll get you ten, dear, that in six more years we rate
Seven little children, dear, or maybe we'll have eight

Ah, dontcha know it now (we got love)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (ain?t it wonderful we got love)

When we marry 
Five'll get you ten, dear, that in six more years we rate
Seven little children, dear, or maybe we'll have eight

All together now (we got love)
Ah let me tell ya (we got love)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (ain't it wonderful we got love)

One more time (we got love)
Ah dontcha know it baby (we got love)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (ain't it wonderful we got love)

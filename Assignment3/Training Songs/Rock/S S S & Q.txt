I'll kiss the flower in your hair I'll kiss your flower anywhere
I give you love but you don't care I want you,
Oh was it like heaven in your arms 
Or was it some place else that charmed?
Oh, there something is on my arm I want you, oh yeah.

Here comes the rain again 
There goes another lonely day
If I could only whisper to you I'd cross the hall and say
I spent the hours in your caress 
Mm, your caress is still the best
Mmh, oh my god, I'm in a mess 

Hey, I want you
Here comes the rain again there goes another lonely day
If I could only whisper to you I'd cross the hall and say
Girl, girl, oh my word make me, take me,
If you would soak, shake splash, and quake
Taste your flower, tastes so good
Girl, girl, oh my word make me, take me, if you would
Soak, shake splash, and quake
Taste your flower, tastes so good do it!

Oh yeah here comes the rain again there goes another lonely day
If I could only whisper to you I'd cross the hall and say
Here comes the rain again while your so far away
I lie and wonder whether it's just too much to pay
To my sea you satisfy my every need
Mm, it grows with your years
I need you, I need you, I need you

Girl, girl, oh my word make me, take me, if you would
Soak, shake splash, and quake
Taste your flower, tastes so good
Ooh! girl, girl, oh my word make me, take me, if you would
Soak, shake splash, and quake
Taste your flower, tastes so good
Girl, girl, oh my word make me, take me, if you would
Soak, shake splash, and quake taste your flower, tastes so good
Oh my word soak, shake splash, and quake
Oh my word soak, shake, splash, and quake

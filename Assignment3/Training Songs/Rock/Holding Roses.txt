Save me from such a sad, sad song
I’m leaning on a lamppost, I’m melting in the sun
My toes are dripping through the sewer
I can feel my heart beating as the tears roll down my tongue
And as the nights been getting cooler
Never thought that you’d be leaving
Should’ve known that I’d be wrong
Goodbye baby, and the music starts to fade
Goodbye baby, I really wish you could have stayed

Holding roses in my hand
Moonlight reflecting off my tooth
A man will do all that he can, just to be getting over you
And when the sadness lingers with its hand on my shoulder
Well you know it’s been there before
And as the wind blows through my fingers
It feels like I’m getting older every time I turn a door

Goodbye baby, and the curtain starts to sway
Goodbye baby, I really wish you could have stayed

Your love is like greasy fried noodles
Instantly gratifying - makes me want to come back for more
You fill me up and I'm hungry an hour later
Got to have another serving - give me a sweet encore

Come on over for some barbecued pork
I want to get you on my fork and then I'm gonna swallow you whole
Want to baste you on both sides get you nice and tender
Want you to melt in my mouth - give me a sensory overload

Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death
Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death
Sometimes you're a little like shake and bake chicken
A little hard on the outside but so soft within

I bite through your coating and you ooze all over me
I feel just like a pig with your juice running down my chin
Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death
Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death

For dessert how about a nice piece of your cherry pie
With some whipped cream on it, that would taste so unreal
After we're done I see you sucking on a cigarette
You know there's nothing like a smoke after a good hearty meal

Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death
Ring the dinner bell, I'm starving to death

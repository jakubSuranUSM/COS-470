New York City's like a graveyard
All the corpses like the way I play my guitar
You've gotta be cute if you wanna get far
New York City's like a graveyard

All the tombstones- sky scrapin'
All the rock stars double datin'
So if you hate me, go on hating
You've been waiting your whole life for this moment to be waitin'

We've got it!
We've got it!
We've got it!
We've got it!

All those hookers in their fucking cars
Twelve steppin' hippies hangin' out at the bar
Suckers and fuckers and stupid retards
New York City's like a graveyard

We've got it!
We've got it!
We've got it!
We've got it!

All the yuppies getting married
All the yuppies getting buried
Singing in this city's like singing on the prairie
New York City's like a cemetery

I knew a girl
With sad blue eyes
Put out the feast
I lost my psychic prize
I did forget
What the tarot maid did say
I burn today
I burn today

Our house was filled
With many birds
She said to me
I can understand their words
The land will shake, so run away
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

She said have fun
Its time has come
Hold my heart strings
And have yourself a strum
No, nevermore
This song will we play
I burn today eh
I burn today

And as I drank
In old Paris
She lay her cards
Just to see what she would see
Down by the water you'll find your happy days
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

I ran so fast
Into the north
No snow on me
And so he said thenceforth
I let snow fall
On frozen yesterday
I burn today
I burn today

And if my head
Is hanging down
I feel her arms
And her legs are all around
And we make love
Beside the waterway
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

Behold the rose
Of Jericho
How many lives
I really do not know
Though with the rain
I know it will return
Today I burn
Today I burn

She
Not right
I want something, I want something, tonight
I want something
I want something, all right
But she can't help because she's not right

It's always
Well, it's always this way

I
I'm not right
She wants something, she wants something, tonight
She wants something
She wants something, all right

Oh, but I can't help 'cause I'm not right
No
And it's always
And it's always this way
And it's
Always

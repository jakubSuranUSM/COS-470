There across the sea waits my fair loved one
In a Turkish town, waiting there for me
And I know that someday, we'll live and love
So the mystic Turks say from the stars up above

[Chorus]
So wait there, my loved one, I'm coming home
To my little Turkish girl, in a Turkish town
To my little Turkish girl, in a Turkish town

[Chorus]

As cold as it seems
When truth brings you heartache
It's so hard to believe
When love hits the wall

Love is
My faith in you
When it could have ended
And your trust in me

Love is
Everything I need to live
Love is
Everything that we forgive
Love is
Every crime of passion
That's what love is

Where would I go'
What would I do'
What would it mean'
To meet a perfect stranger

Why do we hurt'
Who draws the line'
When do we learn to look inside'
What love is

So many years
You can't take for granted
You can't take away
All the things you are

Together so long
I know where my heart is
Somewhere in me
(Oh yes)
I'll find a way to show

Love is
Every lesson we have learned
Love is
Every soft unspoken word
Love is
Every crime of passion
That's what love is

Where would I go'
What would I do'
What would it mean'
To meet a perfect stranger

Why do we hurt'
Who draws the line'
When do we learn to look inside'

Everything I need to live
Love is
Everything that we forgive
Love is
Every crime of passion
That's what love is

Love is
Every lesson we have learned
Love is
Every soft unspoken word
Love is
Every crime of passion
That's what love is

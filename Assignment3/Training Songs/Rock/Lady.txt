Lady
You got me feelin' low
I felt sick, yeah
I just can't let you go

What you want 
You might get
I feel good but
I might regret it
I come around but you'd hardly know
I come around and scream
Take me back

Lady
Take me back

I got that feeling little love
It makes it feel so sick
I know she just an
Acid love
That makes me
Make me
Scream

What you want 
You might get
I feel good but
I might regret it
I come around but you'd hardly know
I come around and scream
Take me back

Lady 
Take me back

What you want 
You might get
I feel good but
I might regret it
I come around but you'd hardly know
I come around and scream
Take me back

Lady
Take me back

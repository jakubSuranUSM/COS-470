Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway

It took me a year to believe it was over
And it took me two more to get over the loss, whoa whoa
I took a beating when you wrote me those letters
And every time I remembered the taste of your lip gloss

Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid we never really knew each other anyway

There were times when I wanted to hurt you
And there were times when I know that I did whoa whoa
There were times when I thought I would kill you
But can you blame me I was only a kid

Now tell me why we never respected each other
And tell me why I never believed that you were a person too
I always thought that you fancied my brother
I may not have liked it, oh but memory is a strange thing, oh, and Enid? 
Enid I remember you

Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid we never really knew each other anyway

It took me a year to believe it was over
Ohh and it took me two more to get over the loss
I took a beating when I wrote you those letters
And every time you told me to get lost

Now it's not fair to say that it's 
'Cause I was three inches shorter then
And it's not fair to say that it's 'cause 
I was only fifteen years old
But maybe it's fair to say it was a lack of communication
I took a phone message, oh and speaking of communication
Oh, and Enid
Enid you got a cold

I can get a job I can pay the phone bills 
I can cut the lawn, cut my hair, cut out my cholesterol 
I can work overtime I can work in a mine 
I can do it all for you
But I don't want to

Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Maybe we always saw right through each other anyway
But Enid we really never knew each other anyway 
Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway
Enid we never really knew each other anyway

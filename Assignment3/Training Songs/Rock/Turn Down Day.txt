It's much too groovy a summer's day
To waste running 'round in the city
But here on the sand I can dream away
Or look at the girls in their pretty

It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day and I dig it

There's nothing easier I can do
Than lyin' around doing nothing

It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day and I dig it

Soft summer breeze and the surf rolls in
To laughter of small children playin'
Someone's radio has the news tuned in
But nobody cares what he's sayin'

Don't you know
It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day and I dig it

Things that are waitin' to mess my mind
Will just have to wait 'til tomorrow

It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day and I dig it

It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day

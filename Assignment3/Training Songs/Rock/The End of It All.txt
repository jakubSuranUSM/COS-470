I see you wander
So lost and alone
You falter on the
Darkest of roads

Let us wait for a way now
You're too far from home
No longer careful wherever I roam

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
Goes on and on and on

This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on

You're going under
Life's pulling you down
Life's making you choke
Life's making you drown

Get away from the pain now
Consuming your soul
I see you fall
I see you lose all control

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on

This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on

This is the path to the end of it all
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on

This is the darkness at the end of the world
It lingers on and on and on
Lingers on and on and on

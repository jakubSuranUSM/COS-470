You and me could go on and on and on
But it's not enough to not get along
And when you see my face and you see it's changed
And you can't replace, no, the years we can't rearrange

I'll move on, but ? tonight
I don't know what tomorrow may bring
I won't fall apart on you tonight
But don't know what tomorrow may bring

What could have been is a sad old song
One I don't sing and won't hum along
There's nothing new and that's nothing bad
It's just the same, but that's not what we came here to say or to do

I'll move on, but ? tonight
But don't know what tomorrow may bring
I won't fall apart on you tonight
But don't know what tomorrow may bring

Outside in the wind and rain
My hands are wet and I can't explain
Why there's nothing wrong with long goodbyes
If we could only keep our mouths and our eyes dry

You and me could go on and on and on
But it's not enough to not get along
And when you see my face and you see it's changed
You can't replace, no the years, we can't rearrange

I'll move on, but ? tonight
But don't know what tomorrow may bring
I won't fall apart on you tonight
But don't know what tomorrow may bring
I won't fall apart on you tonight
I won't fall apart on you tonight

I built an aeroplane
It was just like the real ones that I saw when I was younger
But it was too small for me
To crawl inside the cockpit and fly away
At a million miles an hour (x4)
And it took me years
Underneath the house we lived in
I threw my head and my heart in the cockpit
The sounds of the engines
The voices from upstairs I only heard my crew
Preparing me for take off (x4)
Preparing me (x2)
And it's just a model
Built with plastic and with glue
But every day I go down to the airport
And I fly away from
I fly away from you (x2)

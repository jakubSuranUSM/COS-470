Isn't there a phrase that says don't be a stranger
Danger can present herself in so many ways and disguises
Scarlet Tulip shape of your greatest weapon in hiding
Rushes to your aid again
Rushes to your aid again

Lead this life you live as if a king commanding armies
Shed no blood of hatred save your wine
Scarlet Tulip make me stronger than houses and horses
Rushing to my aid again
Rushing through my veins again

Scarlet Tulip shape of your greatest weapon in hiding
Rushes to your aid again
Rushes to your aid again

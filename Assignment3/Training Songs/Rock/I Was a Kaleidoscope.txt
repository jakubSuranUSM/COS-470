I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms
And they were grouped in twos or threes, 
Like a Morse code message was sent from me to me. 
Cars on slippery slopes, they're stuck: people pushing through 
Their mittens as I was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes, 
Getting colder with every step I took to your apartment, dear. 
  
And I was a kaleidoscope, the snow on my lenses distorting the image of what 
Was only one of you and I didn't know which one to address as all your lips 
Moved. 

This is when I forget breathe all the things I scripted, they sound unfounded.
And the look that you're giving me, it tells me exactly what you are thinking,
"this ain't working anymore." 
  
They got their mothers worked into a panic
Sledding down hills into oncoming traffic
The parents layered clothes until the children couldn't move then kept them 
Outside til their noises were blue and I got left there, too. 
  
I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms. 
And they were grouped in twos or threes like a Morse code message was sent from me 
To me.

You tell me that you need
To spend some time alone
You tell me that you think it's best
If I'd go home now
I get my coat from off the floor
I'm out the door
Walking home alone
My love has left

My head,my heart all torn apart
My mind's exploding
Crying my eyes out over you

It must be hard for you to believe
That I might love you
Just try to understand 
I just want you to want me too
You made me fall in love again,you angel
How you take my breath away
I live for you

My head,my heart all torn apart
My mind's exploding
Crying my eyes out over you

It must be hard for you to believe
That I might love you
Just try to understand 
I just wanted you to want me too

My head,my heart all torn apart
My mind's exploding
Crying my eyes out over you

I live for you
Why won't you live for me

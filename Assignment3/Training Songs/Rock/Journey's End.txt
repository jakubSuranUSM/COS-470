Journey's End
Blue waves are rolling
Visions in my mind
Of a strange voice calling
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end

Hear the anchor sinking
Voices ringing clear
Farewell from my kindred
And friends I love so dear, and friends I love so dear
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end

Lost streams are fading
They sweep across the vale
And with oceans of meadows
To bring me back again, to bring me back again
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end

Long have I traveled
In storm, in the sun, in the rain
And it's homeward singing
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end

Journey's at an end, journey's at an end
Journey's at an end, journey's at an end

[Verse 1]
Lord knows i am peaceful when i'm left alone
I've always been an eagle,been awhile since i have flown
My claws are sharp as ever,so is my eagle eye
Somethings gonna go tonight,when the eagle flies

[Verse 2]
Lately i've heard rumors that the eagle may be lame
Just because i've been idle don't mean that i'm tame
You've jeopardized my freedom,my natural place to roost
I can fly if i have to,if they turn the eagle loose

[Chorus]
So lay all your doubts aside,when you go to bed tonight
My feathers have been ruffled and i'm ready for a fight
Just because i took awhile to fly don't mean that i don't care
When you feel the shadow crossing,the eagle's in the air

[Chorus]

When you feel the shadow crossing,the eagle's in the air

You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled
but I call you stormy today
All of a sudden that old rain´s fallin´ down
and my world is cloudy and gray, you´ve gone away

Oh, stormy, oh, stormy, bring back that sunny day
Yesterday´s love was like a warm summer breeze
but like the weather it changed
New things are dreary baby and it´s windy and cold
and I stand alone in the rain callin´ your name

Oh, stormy, oh, stormy, bring back that sunny day
Oh, stormy, oh, stormy, bring back that sunny day
Bring back that sunny day, oh stormy oh stormy...

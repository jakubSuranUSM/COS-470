Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cottonfields back home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
And I dreamed about that girl who's waited for so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
You know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after so many years well I find that I just wasted my life here all alone
I believe I'm gonna put my foolish pride on a Southbound freight and I'm gonna ride
That's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back to that girl who loves me
And who's waited so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
[ guitar ]
I want to go home I want to go home

Down the Mississippi where the water gets muddy
Forty-four school where the kids don't study
Well they all hang around at the root of Beale Street
Oh gonna dance all night to that Memphis Beat
 
I'm going to Memphis where the beat is tough
Memphis, I can't get enough
It makes you tremble and it makes you weak
It's in your blood, that Memphis Beat
 
Whoo They're hitch-hikin' here from California
Ridin' on a Honda from Arizona
Houston, Boston, Kansas City
We got New Orleans and a doo wa diddy

Yeah, I'm going to Memphis where the beat is tough
Memphis, I can't get enough
It makes you tremble and it makes you weak
It's in your blood, that Memphis Beat
 
Oh I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah!

Well they got people a-walkin'
And ridin' and swimmin'
Just tryin' to get a chance at them good lookin' women
Now we just march on down to the foot of Beale Street
Ah Then dance all night to that Memphis Beat

I'm going to Memphis where the beat is tough
Memphis, I can't get enough
It makes you tremble, it makes you weak
It's in your blood, that Memphis Beat

Let's go to Memphis
Where the beat is tough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I said I just can't get enough

You don't get nothing for free
Kev and me were two of three
Three brothers to the end
Then one went full on Kevin's mom now things have changed

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on

You don't get nothing for free
And this one took the long way
This one took the hard road
I ain't saying who But it wasn't me

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on 

Mommy

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom

Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom
Full on Kev's mom

Full on Kev's mom
Full on
We were three Kevin's mom made four (We don't come around anymore)

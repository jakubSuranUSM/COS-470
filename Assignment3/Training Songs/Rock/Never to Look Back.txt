It's not that easy
Never to look back
The years distort the lies
We take for fact

I had a black shirt
But I wasn't one
All my loving is not enough for that
I had a black shirt

But I wasn't one
I had black thoughts
But now they're undone
Thoughts are easy

And they're all I have
All my loving is not enough for that
All my loving is not enough for that
How could I think it was ever like this

The truth's the truth but did it ever exist
I tell myself, well never again
Never to look back
'Cause it's never the same

Never to look back
Thoughts are easy,
But they're all I have
Life's not easy

If all you do is fight
The truth is changed by
The memories we have
All my loving is not enough for that

All my loving is not enough for that
How could I think it was ever like this
The truth's the truth but did it ever exist
I tell myself, well never again

Never to look back
'Cause it's never the same
Never to look back

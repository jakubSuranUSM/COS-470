Take my lips and sew them shut
Without words I'll dry up and blow away
She said that we were both so out of touch
And when we talked we'd say things
That don't mean anything
I hear your voice but you're so far away

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I'll take in air and I'll fill it up
Never breathing out I'll burst in flames
Without you I can never get enough
Of the thing that makes me feel like
Life's worth anything
I feel your touch at the thought of your name

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I don't want anything 
Like a Jesus or a Superman
I don't want for anything
If you could be here with me again

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I can't kiss you anymore
I never felt alone like this before
Love ain't easy to ignore
I just can't live here anymore
Time is killing me and I'm killing
Nothing but time

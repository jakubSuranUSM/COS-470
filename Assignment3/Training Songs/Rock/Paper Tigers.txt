It's in the atmosphere we breathe tonight
It's in the people that we meet
And in your eyes
Just like every other fool out there
We all think we're so unique
Such special freaks

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a second chance
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

I see the world like through a looking glass
I see the people walk right by
By by
Like paper tigers roaming in the street
They stare right through me when we meet

It's in every single one of us
Every single one of us
Looking for a second cause
Hoping for a second shot
Every single one of us
Every single one of us

You got the kinda face that I can't resist
You got the kinda lips that ought to be kissed
You got that funny little look, baby, in your eye
Oooh-wee baby
I just want to die
 
You bug me baby
When we go riding in the pale moonlight
All I want to to do is hold-a you tight
You whisper come, come close to me
Ooo-wee baby
I'm in ecstasy

You bug me baby
The other night when I kissed your lips
My head was spinning and my heart did flips
And you looked at me and you wringkled your nose
Ooh-wee baby
You curl my toes

You bug me baby
When we go dating to a drive-in show
The picture playing we never know
Your close to me and I'm close to you
Ooh-wee baby
Is that lipstick new

You bug me baby
You got the kinda face that I can't resist
You got the kinda of lips that ought to be kissed
Funny little look baby, in your eye
Ooh-wee baby
I just want to die

You bug me baby
When we go riding in the pale moonlight
All I want to do is hold you tight
And you whisper to me come close to me
Ooh-wee baby 
I'm in ecstasy

You bug me baby
You bug me baby

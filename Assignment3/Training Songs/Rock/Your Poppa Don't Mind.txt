Give it a word, give it a try
Why don't you sleep out, stop living high
You're on your own, your making bed
Now time for wasting, just look ahead

Your poopa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He's got a reputation and he don't know fad
Your poppa don't mind at all

He's getting old, he's getting late
It's soon tomorrow, so celebrate
Bring it out, and go to town
Before you're thinking, sell him now?

Your poopa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He don't believe in heaven like a good man should
Your poppa don't mind at all

Find him out, he's half a fun
When you find out, don't try to run
If you know, then you'll be gone
And if you don't know, it's still to come

Your poopa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He talked about his women and his old school tie
Your poppa don't mind at all

You can't surprise him anymore
He don't believe in heaven like a good man should
Your poppa don't mind at all
Your poppa don't mind at all
Your poppa don't mind at all

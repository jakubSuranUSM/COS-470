Can't remember just how it ended 
I'm hazy as to how it began 
Crazy how our lives got so tangled 
Now we're simply silent partners again 
Secretly walking a tightrope 
Come fall into the arms of the past 
Cause it's still the same me 
Still the same you 
Who swore those promises would still ring true 
So when your heart cries out 
In the middle of a sleepless night 
And you're suddenly so lonely 
When seconds count 
Count on me, count on me 
Special moments taken for granted 
Tenderness that found no reward 
Funny how you speak of forever 
Only to wind up restless and bored 
Can sweethearts so suddenly strangers 
Recapture in a moment the fire 
Well it's still the same me 
Still the same you 
The same two children deep down it's true 
So when your heart cries out 
In the middle of a sleepless night 
And you're lost and feeling lonely 
When seconds count 
Count on me, count on me 
When your dream dies hard 
And you're stranded out on the boulevard 
I'll be there in a heartbeat 
When seconds count 
Count on me, count on me 
I'm going back in time to how it used to be 
Now it's a race with time till I change your mind 
When your heart cries out 
In the middle of a sleepless night 
And you're lost and feeling lonely 
When seconds count 
Count on me, count on me 
When your dream dies hard 
And you're stranded out on the boulevard 
I'll be there in a heartbeat 
When seconds count 
Count on me, you can always count on me

So join the party!
Let me in let me in

But I'm not wasting my time again
Let me in let me in
But I'm not wasting my time again
Let's get something, let's get something straight
You are going to be nothing
And I am so fucking great
It's the fight of our lives

So make me want it!
I'm a part of the lies
And I'll wait for the time till
You will buy it!

You are going to be nothing
And I am so fucking great

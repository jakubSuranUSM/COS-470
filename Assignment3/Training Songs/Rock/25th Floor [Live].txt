We explore the men's room.
We don't give a shit.
Ladies' lost electricity;
Take vows inside of it.

Desire to dance;
Too startled to try.
Wrap my legs 'round you,
Starting to fly.

Let's explore 
Up there, up there, up there,
On the twenty-fifth floor.

Circle all around me,
Coming for the kill, kill, kill
Oh kill me baby
Like a kamikaze
Heading for a spill.
Oh but it's all spilt milk to me.

Up there, up there, up there.

We must open up our eyes and seize 
And rend the veil of smoke which man calls order. 
Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and transform waste. 
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest pre-occupation of man. 
Man being the chosen alloy, he must be reconnected via shit, at all cost. 
Inherent with(in) us is the dream of the task 
Of the alchemist to create from the clay of man. 
And to re-create from excretion of man pure
 and then soft and then solid gold. 

All must not be art. some art we must disintegrate. 
Positive (anarchy must exist.)

In background:
(i feel it swirling around me
I feel it feeling no pain
I'm waiting above for you baby
I know that I'll see you up there
I'm floating in a door backward
On boundaries over this world
I'm waiting above in the sky, dear

Living in the sixth dimension 
Things get rough 
Living in the sixth dimension 
Can be tough 
It's so hard when your on your own 
When your on your own 

Moving in the wrong direction 
Brings bad luck 
Living without protection 
Really sucks 

It's so hard when your on your own 
You might fall into the Forbidden Zone 

Going down, down, down 
How far can you go? 
You might fall into the Forbidden Zone 
Going down, down, down 
'Cross the border line 
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine 

I'm going down 
I'm going down 
I'm going down I go 
Turning me around 
Turning me around 
Turning me around I know 

Living in the sixth dimension 
Moving in the wrong direction 
Living in the sixth dimension 
Moving in the wrong direction 
Living in the sixth dimension 
Moving in the wrong direction 

It's so hard when you're on your own 
When your on your own 
The Forbidden Zone 

Going down, down, down 
How far can you go 
You might fall into the Forbidden Zone 
Going down, down, down 
'Cross the border line 
The guards look scary but the girls are pretty fine 

Going round, round, round 
Driving me insane 
Everything looks different 
But nothing has changed.

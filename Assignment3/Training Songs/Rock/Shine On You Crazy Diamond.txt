Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

Shine on, you crazy diamond

You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you
Legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Threatenеd by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Shinе on (Shine on) 
You crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

Well, you wore out your
Welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you
Piper, you prisoner, and shine

Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far

Shine on you crazy diamond

Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

Shine on you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the
Shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion
And shine!

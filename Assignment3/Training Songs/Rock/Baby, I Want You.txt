I see her face so young and fair
I hear her voice but she's not there
Memories like these still linger on
I can't believe that she's gone

Baby, I want you
Baby, I want you
Baby, I need you to love me
Baby, love me

I wonder where she is today
If we'd meet what would I say
I can't tell it's been so long
I still go on, yeah, singing my song

About how I want you
Baby, I want you
Baby, I need you to love me 
Baby, love me

I believe
If you give
A little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Oh oh oh
Has gotta come your way

Well in my mind
It's easy
To lose sight of the truth
But in my heart
I can't deny
My feeling inside

'Cause I believe
If you give
A little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Oh oh oh
Has gotta come your way

Man in the sky
You say you are flying
Your lose sight of the world
You want to stay high
Then don't deny
Your feeling inside

'Cause I believe
If you give
A little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Oh oh oh
Has gotta come your way

Yeah, yeah
Whoo

I believe
If you give
A little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Oh
Has gotta come your way

I believe
If you give
A little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Whoo
Has gotta come your way

I do believe, oh
Give a little love

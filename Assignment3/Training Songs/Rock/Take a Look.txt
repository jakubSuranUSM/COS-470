Synthesized, programmed and synchronized
Detailed, computerized--no room for error
Specified, labeled and classified
Free mind has 'paralyzed imagination'
Educate, break down and formulate
Dictate, Don't speculate, --Don't be a failure
Parasite,--Know, sense, think, read and write
Translating black and white, Hungry for logic...
Stand fast--
Take a look at yourself
In a moment realize
We are thinking today
Take a look, take a look
Take control of yourself
For a moment realize
We are thinking today
Today, today,--take a look!
Doters of the silicon
Enslaved by self-design
Dependant on the life-blood
and body of their sun
Each cry for understanding
Begins and ends at the grave--
From cradle to grave
Null and void emotion
Break free of this system
Opening eyes finding release
Each breath of inspiration
Begins and ends at the grave--
From cradle to grave
I'll find a key to lock the door
I won't let on that I'm afraid
Heaven,--Heaven I'm scared!
Take a look at yourself
In a moment realize
We are thinking today
Today, today
Take control of yourself
For a moment realize
You are thinking today
Today, today,--Take a look!
Synthesize, programmed and synchronized
Detail, computerize your own damn/nation
Magnified these dreams you've kept inside--
Come alive!--your hand is bitten by your own creation
Take a look at yourself
In a moment realize
We are thinking today
Today, today
Take control of yourself
You're not a victim--
You're not anything
Only throwing away today, today--
Take a look!
I'm alive--
I breathe, I feel inside
Not just a toy
Not a fault you can override
I want to be alone
If I could find a place to hide
Will you always be there
In every thought, every word
Oh you're so damn--
Clinical, useful and practical
Always fanatical,--controlled existence
Oh we may generate, design and integrate
but never,--we never simulate human reaction
Stand fast--
Take a look at yourself
In a moment realize
We are thinking today
Take a look, take a look
Take control of yourself
For a moment realize
We are thinking today
Today, Today--
Take a look

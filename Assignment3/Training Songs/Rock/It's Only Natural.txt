Ha ha, you what time it is? Three, two, one

And I wish you would, oh, oh, oh
Come over here and show me something good
You got me thinking about, thinking about how you look
Oh, hot damn, you must have wrote the book
Oh, that girl's so fine, she must have wrote the book

And every second is electric like a thousand volts
Not to mention, my intention's only natural
And your affection is the question I've yet to close
And I'm close

You keep giving me looks when you come my way
The way you're shaking me up, it's like an earthquake
You keep giving me looks that I can't escape
You make my heart pulse race with the A-O-A

And you know I could, oh, oh, oh
Come over there and give you something good
I bet you're thinking about, thinking about how you're hooked
Oh, on me now, you know I wrote the book
Oh, with a touch like mine, I must have wrote the book

'Cause every second is electric like a thousand volts
Not to mention, my intention's only natural
And your affection is the question, I've yet to close
And I'm close

You keep giving me looks when you come my way
The way you're shaking me up, it's like an earthquake
You keep giving me looks that I can't escape
You make my heart pulse race with the AOA

And every second I'm infected and without a cure
And I'm positive you're someone who's worth fighting for
You just got that something more
Plus I'm really sure

You keep giving me looks when you come my way
The way you're shaking me up, it's like an earthquake
You keep giving me looks that I can't escape
You make my heart pulse race with the AOA

You keep giving me looks when you come my way
The way you're shaking me up, it's like an earthquake
You keep giving me looks that I can't escape
You make my heart pulse race with the AOA

Oh, you must have wrote the book

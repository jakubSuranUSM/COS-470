I know 
You love the song but not the singer 
I know 
You've got me wrapped around your finger 
I know 
You want the sin without the sinner 
I know 
I know 

[Chorus]
I know 
The past will catch you up as you run faster 
I know 
The last in line is always called a bastard 
I know 
The past will catch you up as you run faster 
I know 
I know 

I know 
You cut me loose in contradiction 
I know 
I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition 
I know 
It's asking for your benediction 
I know 
I know 

[Chorus: x2]

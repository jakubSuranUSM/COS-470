Girls, you've been in love too long 
(You're a fool for your baby) 
Don't you know, girls
You've been in love too long 
(You're a fool for your baby) 

When just his smile takes all your pain away 
And you find yourself believing whatever he may say 
Now when he keeps you cryin' 
But your heart tells you, Girl, keep right on tryin' 
Girls, you've been in love too long 
(You're a fool for your baby) 
Don't you know, girls?  You've been in love too long 
(You're a fool for your baby) 

When you accept his wrongs just to share his kiss 
And even though lonely nights are filled with happiness 
Now girl, you're in trouble; you know your heart is seein' double 
When your head tells you to run 
But your heart says he's your only one 
Girls, you've been in love too long 
You're a fool for your baby) 

(Girl, you've been in love too long) 
You're a fool 
'Cause when a week of loneliness 
Can be erased with just one sweet caress 
Girls, you've been in love too long 
(You're a fool for your baby) 
I say girls, oh yeah, you're a fool 
When his wrong looks right 'cause he always treats you bad 
When you find little excuses for all the sadness & abuses 
Don't you know, girls, you're in love 
You're just a fool for your baby 
Girls, you've been in love too long 
You're just a fool

They got married early 
Never had no money
Then when he got laid off 
Things really hit the skids

He started up his drinking 
Then they started fighting
He took it pretty badly
She took both the kids

She said "I'm not standing by
To watch you slowly die
So watch me walking out the door"
She said, "Shove it Jack
I'm walking out the fucking door"

She went to her brother's
Got a little bar work
He went to the buttery
Stayed about a year

Then he wrote a letter
Said, "I want to see you"
She thought he sounded better
She sent him the fare

He was riding through the cane
In the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door

He came in on a Sunday
Every muscle aching
Walking in slow motion
Like he'd just been hit

Did they have a future
Would he know his children
Could he make a picture
And get them all to fit

He was shaking in his seat
Riding through the streets
In a silvertop to her door

Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Don't know why you want to jump on me, 
 Baby, baby, baby, and make-a me cry. 
 Baby, I, I'm gonna find myself someone new, 
 Someone who will be true, 
 But no more toeing the line. 
 I know it's o-ooh-over, cause I've seen the signs. 
 Don't let me waste your precious time. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 If you want to get uh-rid of me, 
 Baby, baby, baby, you're doin' fine. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes 
 And leave you far behind. 
 You're rolling over in clover so refined, 
 But you can't fix this broken heart of mine. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Don't know why you want to jump on me, 
 Baby, baby, baby, and make-a me cry. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Don't know why you want to jump on me, 
 Baby, baby, baby, and make-a me cry. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line. 
 Baby, I'm tired of toeing the line.

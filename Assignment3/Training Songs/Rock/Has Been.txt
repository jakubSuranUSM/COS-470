You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?
You calling me has been?
What'd you say your name is?

(Never Done Jack)

Glad to meet ya. Who's your friend?

(Dick)
(Don't Say Dick)

What do ya know. And you friend,

(Don)
(Two-Thumbs Don)

Riding on their armchairs,
they dream of wealth and fame.
Fear is their companion,
Nintendo is their game.
Never Done Jack and Two-Thumbs Don
and side-kick Don't Say Dick
will laugh at others failures
though they have not done shit.

I heard of you, the ready made
connecting with the ever ready.
Yeah, never was talking about
Still trying. I got it.
Forever better gossiping about
never say die.

May I inquire about what
you've been doing, mister..

(Jack)
(Never done jack)

And you, partner, what's the
news of the world, Dick?

(I don't say dick)

Don, of all the people, 
you must be the tattler.

(Two-thumbs up)

What are you afraid of, failure?
So am I.

Has been implies failure. Not so.

(Has been)

Has been's history. Has been, was.

(Has been)

Has been, might again.

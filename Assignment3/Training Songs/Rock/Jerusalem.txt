Sir can you tell me how to get to Jerusalem 
‘Cause I have kinda lost my way 
Sir will you help me get there as fast as I can 
Tomorrow might be too late 

‘Cause things ain't what they used to be 
My love for life is gone you see 
Am I fighting things I cannot see 
People always tellin' me how sweet and simple life could be 
They say you might as well live before you die 

[Chorus:]
But one thing I know for sure 
I am a danger to myself, how come 
Yeah one thing I know for sure 
I need some guidance, to get me out of this hellhole 

Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem, yeah 
It took me quite a while to get into Jerusalem 
´Cause I had kinda lost my way 
I want to save me from myself so here I am 
I hope it's not too late 

´Cause things ain't what they used to be 
My love for life is gone you see 
Am I fighting things I cannot see 
I am so afraid to love 
´Cause of the way I've been hurt before 
I think by now it's time for me to leave 

[Chorus]

Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
Jerusalem, can you help me find what I have lost 

Things ain't what they used to be 
My love for life is gone you see 
Am I fighting things I cannot see 
I don't want to die this way 
Wishing that I could turn back time 
Wasted time, there is work to be done 

[Chorus]

Jerusalem, can you help me find my way back to Jerusalem 
Jerusalem, can you help me find what I have lost, yeah yeah 
Alright 

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem

I can hear the ocean noise
I can feel the pulsing crowd
Buzzing like a radio
Pumping like a disco sound
I can see a burning sun
Breaking through a raining cloud
Just like my heart beat heart beat, beating through the town
Lost forever

In love
I am your favorite son
I am a champion
Oh I am the fire inside
Of a loaded gun
I am a champion
Oh I am the fire inside

I don???t want to waste my time
Im just tryin to find my way
Racing through a perfect town
We're racing on a perfect day
And sometimes when I close my eyes
I listen to the words you say
People love a rising star
People love a rising star
People love a rising star

In love
I am your favorite son
I am a champion
Oh I am the fire inside
Of a loaded gun
I am a champion
Oh I am the fire inside

Of the window in my mind
Where the wind blows
From time to time
Where the seed grows
The perfect vine
Where whatever's yours is mine

In love
In love
In love
I am your favorite son
I am a champion
I am your favorite son
I am a champion

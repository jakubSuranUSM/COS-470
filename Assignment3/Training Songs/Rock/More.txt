Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know
Is I want more!
(More, more, more)
I want more!
(More, more, more)

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)

Why'd you get sad?
To feel so much?
To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold
So far, so out of control
Hard to come by
But not all

Some people get by
With a little understanding
And some people get by
With a whole lot more

I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
I want more!

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)

There are parts of me that don't get nervous
Not the parts that shake
You won't get what you deserve
You are what you take
Broken hearts are the Devil's playground
I'm not done yet
Counterfeit lovers
Or a virtual orgy
Anything I can get!

Some people get by
With a little understanding
And some people get by
With a whole lot more

I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know
I want more! 
(More, more, more)
I want more!
(More, more, more)

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)

I want more!

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get too)

I want more! 

I want more! 

I want more!

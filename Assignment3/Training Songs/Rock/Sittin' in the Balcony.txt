I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony
Just a-watchin' the movie
Or maybe it's a symphony
I wouldn't know
I don't care about the symphonies
Just a-cymballs and a-timpanies

I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row
I'll hold your hand and I'll kiss you too
The feature's over, but we're not through
Mmm-mm, just a-sittin' in the balcony

We may stop lovin' to watch Bugs Bunny
But he can't take the place of my honey
Just a-sittin' in the balcony
Just a-smootchin' in the balcony
Just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row

Just a huggin' and a-kissin' with my baby on the very last row

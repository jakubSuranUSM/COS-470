I was the night
That pierced the eyes and walls
That threw you so high you never came down
I was the table

To the meal whose memories last longer
Than photographs
I was the doll
Now I'm only a giant, I want sunsets to be quiet

You were the heart
That carried me on the wind
To touch the tide at dawn
You were the first

Horizon that I saw
Conclusions drift, forgotten now

You were the glass, the wine, the toast, the lips
I was the lust, the need, the smiles, the trips
I was the moment that held you

I was the night
That pierced tha eyes and walls
That threw you so high you never came down
You were the flame
Who answered my questions with silence surrounding you
You were the child
You were the impressionable one I gave my time to

You were the glass, the wine, the toast, the lips
I was the lust, the need, the smiles, the trips
I was the moment that held you

Caressing each heart
Possessing each heart
I was the moment I held you

I was the moment

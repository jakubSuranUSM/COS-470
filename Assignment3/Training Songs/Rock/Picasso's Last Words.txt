The grand old painter died last night 
His paintings on the wall 
Before he went he bade us well 
And said goodnight to us all. 

Drink to me, drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
Drink to me, drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 

Three o'clock in the morning 
I'm getting ready for bed 
It came without a warning 
But I'll be waiting for you baby 
I'll be waiting for you there 
So drink to me drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
Drink to me drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 

French interlude 
Temp change 
Jet...drink to me 
Drunken chorus 
French (tempo) 
Drink to me...ho hey ho

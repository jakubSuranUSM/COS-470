I need somebody who's consistent
With me
Someone already there when I need
Company
'Cause when I'm feelin' low
I don't want to have to go out
Lookin'
For a part-time kind of love

And when the dreams and rainbows
Start to disappear
Don't want somebody up and runnin'
Outa here
'Cause when you stop and start
Baby it's just too hard upon
My heart
That part-time kind of love

And I can't take you darlin' livin' here
Wait and see
I want somebody who's committed
Now to me
Somewhere, someday you'll have
To take a chance
So if you like the music baby
Get up and dance

And if we grow together daring to dream
I know we'll find our shares of
Peaches and cream
And when the juices flow
I don't want no no no excuses
Just want your full time love
For me
Just want your full time love
For me.

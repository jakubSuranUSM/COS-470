I got more I got no need
I got nothing I could leave
I got things that you should see

I went riding all around
Hit the pass, I built this sound
Tried to picture it going down

Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?

Felt a pull I pulled away
We got nothing that I'll say
Still I feel it's not this way

Waiting nothing's going down
Can't seem to get it off the ground
Seeing if I'll come around

Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?

Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh

I know my soul is battered
And I know my mind is gone
I been waiting for an answer
But the question takes too long
I need guidance on the river
I need everything I've done
So familiar's coming at me
Don't wanna blow it all at once

Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?
Come on wait for me, is it done?

Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh

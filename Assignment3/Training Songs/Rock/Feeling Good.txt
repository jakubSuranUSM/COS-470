Are you close to mine
Or could you blow my mind?
'Cause the heat is up
Already passed over time
Well I'm here to say
I got a better way
Nothing brings me down 
With how I feel today

Yeah I'm feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Yeah I'm feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah 

Back and forth again 
With my rememberin'
Tell me who, or what, why, or where and when?
Comin' back this time
I gotta know the rhyme
And I feel the clear
Never gon' take what's mine

Feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Yeah I'm feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah

Back and forth again 
With my rememberin'
Well I guess losers go
Money will make amends
Well I'm here to say 
I got a better way
Nothing brings me down 
With how I feel today

Feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat just like you know I would
Yeah I'm feelin' good 
Oh, like you know I should
Got the pressure beat
Yeah

I was just wondering why you hide
From anything
You never go outside the lines
What does it take to make you see
There's so much more to be

So I'm telling you hey, it's ok
Don't be scared to let it go
Get a little out of control
(What are you waiting for)
Hey, it's not too late
If you don't act now
Time will pass you by so come on
(What are you waiting for)

No, with your bright brown eyes
Just shine, and we will follow you
Never know what till you try
What does it take to make you see
There's so much more to be

So I'm telling you hey, it's ok
Don't be scared to let it go
Get a little out of control
(What are you waiting for)
Hey, it's not too late
If you don't act now
Time will pass you by so come on
(What are you waiting for)

If something pulls you down
Get up and stand your ground
Don't just walk away
Tomorrow's too late (tomorrow's too late)
Tomorrow's too late (tomorrow's too late)

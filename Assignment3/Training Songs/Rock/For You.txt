In the grace of your love I writhe, writhe in pain
In six hundred and sixty six ways I love you and I hope you feel the same

I'm for you
I'm for you

I'm killing myself for your love and again all is lost
In seven hundred and seventy seven ways I love you 'til my death do us apart

I'm for you, and I'm dying for your love
I'm for you, and my heaven is wherever you are
I'm for you, and I'm dying for your love
I'm for you, and my heaven is wherever you are

In six hundred and sixty six ways ways I love you and my heaven is wherever
you are

I'm here for you, I am here for you
I'm here for you, I am here for you
I'm here for you, I am here for you
I'm here for you, I am here for you

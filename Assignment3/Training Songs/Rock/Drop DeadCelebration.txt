I hate you, I hate you!
I hate you, I hate you!

Drop dead!
You stinking little creep
Drop dead!
With your emotions so cheap
Your poisoned mind,
It's disgusting everyone
We don't care if you vanish in thin air!

Drop dead!
It's a dead drop
You're a dead loss
Drop dead

You should be pushed down
Down into the ground amongst the worms
And other spineless things
Don't you see you're embarrassing to me
I can't stand that phony way you banter!

Drop dead!
It's a dead drop
You're a dead loss
Drop dead!

You're so pathetic
An insipid, dried up slug
Keep your mouth shut you impotent little slut
I'm so ashamed to be connected with your name
You're so lame
I wish you'd never been to blame

Drop dead!
It's a dead drop
You're a dead loss
Drop dead!

Those words
Tight-lipped and mealy-mouthed
It wasn't hard to realize that they were lies
Judging from the flies you've attracted from the skies
So just get lost
F*ck off!
And disappear into the compost!

Drop dead
Stinking little creep
Drop dead
Drop dead

Celebration

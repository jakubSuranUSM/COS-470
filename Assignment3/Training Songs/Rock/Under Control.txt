Lost a night again
This path is taking its toll
All your worry spent
In broken glass on the floor

Oh, it's just a bottle that holds
An empty soul

What was the sign? 
When did you know? 
I promise this time
To keep it under control
Under control, under control, under control, keep it under control

The room was spinning round
You shuffled me to the door
Heard you tell your friends, all of them
The lies you told them before

Oh, you're not a victim of hope
I alone brought you this low

What was the sign? 
When did you know? 
Give me the time
I'll give you control
Under control, under control, keep it under control

I've nothing to defend
And you have suffered enough
Help me make amends
Under control
Under control, under control, keep it under control
Keep it under control, keep it under control 
Keep it under control, keep it under control

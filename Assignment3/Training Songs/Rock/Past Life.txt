The sun pours from your eyes
We were killers in a past life
But it turned out alright
We'll turn into stars

Wrap your arms around
Reaching for the light
The angels from our land
The angels from summer

Raining down upon my car
The tokens are not ours
I'll run far fast
Never run away
Birds fly from your eyes
You know its a staircase
Parked a car at night
We'll crumble into flames

A lovers eyes
Never look away
I'm bleeding in my heart
You tell me that its safe
When I realize
That death is just a staircase
I'm bleeding in my heart, my heart
That nothing is for certain

Raining down upon my car
The tokens are not ours
I'll run far, fast
Never run away
Birds fly from your eyes
You know its a staircase
Parked a car at night
We'll crumble into flames

Slow ride
Take it easy
Slow ride
Take it easy
Slow ride

Slow ride
Take it easy

I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night

Ooh, slow ride
Ooh

Slow ride
Take it easy
Slow ride

Slow down, go down
Got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me
Slow ridin' woman, you're so fine

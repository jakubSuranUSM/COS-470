Gonna catch a flight to Nevada
Leave her friends at home in L.A.
Seven come eleven or blackjack
Gambling night and day yeah

'Cause she's a roller now, a high roller baby
She is, she's a roller yea, a high roller baby

She likes to play for double or nothin'
She's tellin' all the boys she's hot
And everybody knows she's ready
To give it everything that she got

She's a roller yeah, a high roller baby, my, my
She's a roller yeah, a high roller baby, look out

People try to tell her she's crazy
She doesn't hear a word they say
Tellin' all the boys to get ready
'Cause she's givin' it all away

She's a roller yea (roller) a high roller baby
She's a roller yea (roller) a high roller baby (she is)
She's a roller yea (roller) a high roller baby
She's a roller yea (roller) a high roller baby

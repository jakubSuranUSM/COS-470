Baby, is he looking after you?
Is he showing you the same love, the warm love, just like we knew?
Baby baby, it's you I'm thinking of
In the morning when I wake up, in the evening; it's you that I dream of.
Sometimes love hurts and sometimes love's unkind and sometimes you might
Feel blue,
But remember now darling, if his words are real, this will never never
Happen to you.
Baby baby, there's things I'd like to say.
I was hoping that with our love, we would get married someday.

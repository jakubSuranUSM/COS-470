I got love if you want it 
I got love if you want it 
I got love if you want it 
I got love if you want it 
I got love if you want it 
Will you rock awhile?
Will you rock awhile?

Quit teasing me baby 
'Cause you finally found a friend 
Quit teasing me baby 
'Cause you finally found a friend 
I'd like to love you baby
Be your lovin' man
Be your lovin' man

I love you little woman 
Than I do myself
I love you little woman 
Than I do myself
But you mistreat me baby
For somebody else
For somebody else

Kinda sad about you baby
'Cause you finally found a friend
Kinda sad about you baby
'Cause you finally found a friend
I'd like to love you baby
To the crying shame
To the crying shame
To the crying shame
To the crying shame

To the crying shame
To the crying shame
To the crying shame
To the crying shame

I'm the kid that no one knows 
I live a life I never chose 
But these thoughts in my mind 
Are my own, my own 

I'm face to face with the unknown 
My scary movie will be shown 
I've got one evil mind 
Of my own, of my own 

We take from one another 
And never stop to wonder 
How it feels from the other side 
Well nothing lasts forever 
When stupid turns to clever 
Why are you surprised? 

Little know it all 
Ten bucks in my hand 
Little know it all 
Don't cry I understand 

I'm a target of the smart 
They've got ambition I've got heart 
Analysed and tagged 
Before I start 

So tell me 
Who can I respect 
I feel a leash around my neck 
I find out there's shame 
In the game 

We take from one another 
And never stop to wonder 
How it feels from the other side 
Well nothing lasts forever 
When stupid turns to clever 
Why are you surprised? 

And I feel like 
I'm caught outside the box 
And I feel like 
I'm sleeping when I'm not 

(Lookin' for the real thing) 
(Lookin' for the real thing) 

We take from one another 
And never stop to wonder 
How it feels from the other side 
Well nothing lasts forever 
When stupid turns to clever 
Why are you surprised? 

Little know it all 
Ten bucks in my hand 
Little know it all 
Don't cry I understand 
Little know it all 
Ten bucks in my hand 
Don't cry I understand 

You'll never know it all

Reading your thoughts, Just a bird in a cage, Just a rat in a maze
Spiritual death, just a satanic catch, just a new god of lent
Dimensional screen, just a gospel to squeeze, just attention to seize
Plagerant muse, just a part for the fool, just a global epidemic
Flock of bats, unearthly addicts
Slave the hive, the clever bastards

Reading the lines just to pay your daily tides, just to bleed the vacant line
Web tainted minds, the majestic tribal sign, just inflicting mental crimes
Drawn to your grid, just a small reckless sin, just a life changing crypt
Gambit aflame, just to keep the cattle lame, your lobotomy is here

Flock of bats, unearthly addicts
Slave the hive, the clever bastards

They got us wired to the reptile brain, your life is not the same, this world is insane
Played by the man, just a torturous hand, executing his plans
Taunt you and tease, at the end of the chain, just accepting the game
Ever think twice in your evil device, how the programs concise
Digital tweak, the religion to seek, just a stab from the creeps

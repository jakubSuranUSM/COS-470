I heard one man call another man a “camel fucker” 
"Go die in your homeland you brown faced 
Dromedary lover 
So you managed to destroy the place you’re from 
We the people reject your plea to come 
Go back to your sand pit” 

I heard one man call another man a “sand n*gger” 
“Stay outta my way man I ain’t afraid to pull this trigger 
So the piece of piece shit Muslim president finally let you in 
Well I grew up here and my face doesn’t look like him 
And I am America” 

Give me your tired your poor 
But here’s the New New Colossus 
We’ll take refugees from places 
That don’t hang people on crosses 
‘Cause here we just burn those 
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free 
"But these wretched are too wretched for me" 
"Send these homeless tempest-tossed ones home" 
"It’s not my fault they don’t got one"

Want you to know, I'm a man
Say the words and I'll say it again
Want you to know, I'm a man you can depend upon
That's all, all I am

Wanted to show, I'm a man
Say the word and I'll tell you again
Wanted to show, I'm a man you can rely upon
That's all I am

I am a man that you can count on
Call out my name and I'll be there
I'm a man you can be sure of, baby
It's your love that takes me there, takes me there

Want you to know, I'm a man
Say the words to me, say it again
Want you to know, I'm a man you can depend upon
That's all, all I am

I am a man that you can count on
Call out my name and I'll be there
I'm a man you can be sure of, baby
It's your love that takes me there

I am a man that you can lean on
Call out my name and I'll be there
I'm a man you can be sure of, baby
It's your love that takes me there

I am a man that you can count on
Call out my name and I'll be there
I'm a man you can be sure of, baby
It's your love that takes me there, takes me there

Out of time and out of inclinations, that we're in 
How's it feel to watch a man relenting 
Let's just say that I might be a sucker 
The progress is all in how you cope in spite of no end 

You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
You don't have to worry, I know 
It's how we are 
You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
The give and take is taking its toll 

It's an honest work if I can stand up on it, maybe we're 
Not as far apart as it appears 
Swallowing the blame is second nature, I got to 
Keep on dealing my business my way 

You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
You don't have to worry, I know 
It's how we are 
You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
The give and take is taking its toll 

I I know (I know) 
it's all (it's all) 
My (my) 
Fault 
I 
Will take the fall if it takes us somewhere 
I I know (I know) 
it's all (it's all) 
My (my) 
Fault 
I 
Will take the fall if it takes us somewhere 

The give and take 
The give and take 
The give and take is taking its toll 
The give and take 
The give and take 
The give and take is taking its toll 

You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
You don't have to worry, I won't 
It falls apart 
You don't have to say it, I know 
It's all my fault 
The give and take is taking its toll 

You don't have to say it 
You don't have to say it 
You don't have to say it 
You don't have to say it

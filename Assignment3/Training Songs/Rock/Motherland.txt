Where in the hell can you go 
Far from the things that you know
Far from the sprawl of concrete that keeps Crawling its way about 1,000 miles a day? 
Take one last look behind, 
Commit this to memory and mind. 
Don't miss this wasteland, 
This terrible place
When you leave 
Keep your heart off your sleeve

Motherland cradle me, close my eyes, 
Lullaby me to sleep
Keep me safe, lie with me, 
Stay beside me don't go
Don't you go
Oh, my five and dime queen 
Tell me what have you seen? 
The lust and the avarice, 
The bottomless, Cavernous greed, 
Is that what you see? 

[Chorus]
Motherland cradle me, close my eyes, 
Lullaby me to sleep. 
Keep me safe, lie with me, 
Stay beside me don't go

It's your happiness I want most of all 
And for that I'd do anything at all, 
Oh mercy me!
If you want the best of it 
Or the most of all, if there's anything 
I can do at all

Now come on shot gun bride 
What makes me envy your life? 
Faceless, nameless, innocent, 
Blameless and free, 
What's that like to be? 

[Chorus]

Don't go

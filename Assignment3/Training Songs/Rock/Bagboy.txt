I had a bad reaction to your public hobby writings
I get no satisfaction from your very recent sightings

Like when I hear the sound of feet slapping on the runway
Like a small bird pretty while it’s crapping on the new day

So disappointed I was that I had made small talk with you
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth
I’m not feeling your buzz I only smell your crock of stew
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth

Bagboy, bagboy, bagboy, bagboy
Bagboy, bagboy, bagboy, bagboy

She had some beauty and manners but you look like a bug
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth
Migrations of their type are such good planners and not smug
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth

Bagboy, bagboy, bagboy, bagboy
Bagboy, bagboy, bagboy, bagboy

You are proselytizing alone
Listening to the voice with your ears
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth
You have regurgitated the tone
Now sat in your tract for many years
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth
Picked up from dead things that you licked
It’s a feedback loop you can’t evict
Cover your breath
Cover your teeth

Cover your breath
Cover your teeth

Cover your breath
Cover your teeth

Cover your breath
Cover your teeth
Bagboy, bagboy, bagboy

You’re a beautiful girl, what’s the matter?
They gave you the world, and you shattered
It’s such a cliché, you don’t even see it
You’re the talk of the town, and it’s no secret

Everybody said they’d never seen a face like yours
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
I don’t want to hold you back no more

Beautiful girl, but you’ve changed now
To see you like this, it’s just such a shame now

Everybody said they’d never seen a face like yours before
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
I don’t want to hold you back no more

I used to be the one that you’d believe
Now you’re happy listening to anyone but me
And I’m shattered
They gave you the world, but it didn’t matter

I have never seen a face as beautiful as yours, for sure
You don’t want to keep your public waiting
So I’m not gonna hold you back no more

Beautiful girl, beautiful girl
You’re a beautiful girl

But look what you do to yourself, what you do to your friends
So beautiful but beauty couldn’t buy you love

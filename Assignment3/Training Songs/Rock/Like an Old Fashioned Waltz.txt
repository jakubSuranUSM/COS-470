Roses are red, and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz.
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits 
For her beau to return,
And violins play 
From behind garden walls,
How I'd love to remain 
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz.

As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more 
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon 
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon 
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.

Roses are red and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
An old fashioned waltz.

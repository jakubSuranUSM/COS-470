See her by the corner
Then she walks on by
Heads turn to meet her
Steely eyed
She's her own girl
Her own design
She holds her head high
Hides her scars just fine

[Chorus:]
She makes it work out
Makes me feel
Makes me see
The untouchable one
Look and see
She's one the outside
She's with me

She's been through a lot
You can tell
As hard as it gets baby
She holds it well
Don't try to change her
No, she will not bend
But if you get close to her
She'll be your special friend
 
[Chorus]
She walks on by
You know she's walking with me
The untouchable one
Look and see
She's on the outside
She's with me
Make me feel
Make me see

The untouchable one
The untouchable one
She hides her scars real fine
She's her own design
The untouchable one
The untouchable one

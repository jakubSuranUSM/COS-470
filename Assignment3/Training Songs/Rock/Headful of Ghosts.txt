I stand around at American weddings
I stand around for family
At my best when I'm terrorist inside
At my best when it's all me

I was there when they took all the people
I was alone in a mental ravine
You breathe life when you break the walls down
You breathe life when you set me free

Where is my head?
Where are my bones?
Why are my days so far from home?
Where is my head?
Where are my bones?
Can you save me from myself?

Can you save me from myself?

Free-thinking renegade social
Mister Moon Man now
Out of the slipstream of my possibilities
Got the boat so we don't drown

These are the days that I'm split down the middle
No words to calm me down
Be sure that what you dream of
Won't come to hunt you down

Where is my head?
Where are my bones?
Why are my days so far from home?
Ghostman
Where is my head?
Where are my bones?
How come we get so lost?
Ghostman
Ghostman

Where is my head?
Where are my bones?
Can you save me from myself? 
Ghostman

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Should be banned
It's day that I can't stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Shouldn't exist
It's day that Ill never miss
Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go, I wanna go with you
And if you die, I wanna die with you

Take your hand and walk away

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life (life)

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
Is day that I'm glad I survived

I'm not gonna lie to you
Something is missing
We don't have to make believe
Nothing is gone
We've had the time
To see where we're going
But we're a long way off
From knowing why
 
[Chorus]
I can't remember the last time
You looked me in the eye
I can't remember a way to 
Make you cry

I know it's been a long long time
Since I listened 
And it's been a long long time
Since we've been clear
Many could live 
On what we have wasted
All because we never knew 
How much we had

[Chorus]

Many could live
On what we have wasted

[Chorus]

It's been a long long time
It's been a long long time
It's been a long long time

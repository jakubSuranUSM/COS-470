I'm tired of putting up 
With your sober wit 
Tired of looking at you 
Through an alcoholic haze 
You better change 
I'm begging you please 
'Cause if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 

I wake up in the morning 
I'm under the roof 
But I get no sympathy 
Baby you're too aloof 
You better change 
Yes, I'm begging you please 
'Cause if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 

Budweiser, Budweiser, Miller Lite 
Take a little nip baby it's alright 
All a fellow wants is company 
Come on baby have a taste with me 

Yeah, you say it's alright baby 
You don't care 
But as soon as I indulge 
I get that icy stare 
You better change 
I'm begging you please 
'Cause if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 

Don't give me no lectures 
'Bout stress and strife 
Soberiety 
Just ain't my way of life 
You better change 
Yes, I'm begging you please 
Well if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 

Yeah, Budweiser, Budweiser, Miller Lite 
Take a little nip baby it's alright 
All a fellow wants is company 
Come on baby have some fun with me 

Yeah, you say it's alright baby 
You don't care 
But as soon as I indulge 
I get that icy stare 
You better change 
Yes, I'm begging you please 
'Cause if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 

Well, if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave 
Yes, if you don't start drinkin' 
I'm gonna leave

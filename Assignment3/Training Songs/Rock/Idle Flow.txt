Idle flow
I've been running too slow
I use so much time
Now I'm working to grow
Don't regret our ties
This endless flow
You take these fears
When you say they go

Your touch honey- smooth
Your shining calm
So what if blood's spilt
You're my light you're my balm

Your forest a dream
Where scream melt to bliss
Where love has it's book
Your name written on it

I'm asking you're giving
Idle flow
I'm running you're waiting
So what if bloods spilt
Idle flow
Idle flow
I'm asking you're giving
Idle flow

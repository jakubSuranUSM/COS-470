First time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it on the back of my tongue
And then swallowed it
Second time, things are getting easier
Blow me down this wind is getting breezier
Third time lucky, maybe feelin' fuzzy
Oh my God! We're getting hippy-dippy!
Five, six, seven, man I'm in heaven
And I'm growing my beard
Before it gets sheared
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
Coz I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind (X2)
First time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it right up
And that was the end of it
Second time, things are getting easier
Hairs on the back of my neck are getting stickier
Third time unlucky, perversely bloody
Doctor I'm ill please pass me the brandy
Five, six, seven I heard George Foreman say:
Slow horses loose
Fast women frighten
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
Coz I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind (X2)
I just keep repeating myself (X6)
Aaaah yeah, coz you're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
Coz I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
Coz I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
Coz I know you're here to stay
For the rest of my mind

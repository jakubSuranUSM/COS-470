You're a hard act to follow 
Such a fine lookin' fellow 
I hear you're bell's yellow 
You're a hard act to swallow 
It kind of makes me sick 
The way you turn those trickes 
Come on and light it up 
I want to feel the rush 
I'll be shooting for thrills when I 
Walk out that door 
You say it's hard to care anymore 

kills, thrills and Sunday pills 
I'm on a mission to kill still cause 
Nothin' thrills 

you're hooked on coke and hoochie 
I want my milk and cookies 
You know you're wife looked pretty 
I think you're wife looked pretty 
I'll be shootin' for thrills when 
I walk out that door 
You say it's hard to care anymore 

kills, thrills and Sunday pills 
I'm on a mission to kill still cause 
Nothin' thrills 
I can't help missin' you still 
Well I always will 

kills, thrills and Ssunday pills 
Alright 

I'll be shootin' for thrills when 
I walk out that door 
Don't turn around and say you 
Need me anymore 
Poppin' pieces of pills up off the 
Lounge room floor 
You say it's hard to care anymore 

kills, thrills and Sunday pills 
I'm on a mission to kill still cause 
Nothin' thrills 
I can't help missin' you still 
Well I always will 
Kills, thrills and Sunday pills 

alright

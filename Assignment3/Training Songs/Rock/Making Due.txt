When I heard, no I wasn't surprised
Could've said it was a long time coming
Now you beg for some, compromise
And you're offering nothing

And by now, you must understand
Making due with what I've been given
Read the past on the palm of my hand
A few chapters, I think that you're missin'

So I'm wondering
Where can we go now
And I'm wondering
Where can we go now

When I heard no, I wasn't surprised
Shadows long and the pain gets numbin'
Years ago, you left me behind
And left the place gutted

And lined up, you stand and command
Streets lined with satellite dishes
I, skin my knees and I cut my hands
Got a pulse but there's a few beats missing

So I'm wondering
Where can we go now
And I'm wondering
Where can we go now

I run from the past but it's gaining on me
I thought we made a deal, you were crossing your fingers
So I'm wondering
Where can we go now

The rules came from your daddy's daddy
They were, grandfathered in
You forgot pretty fast, 'cuz you act like the past didn't happen

And so you, empty out your pockets
And you said, all the money's been spent
Now you don't come around, to this part of town till it's burning
Man, what did you expect?
You made some promises that need to be kept

Now I feel like I've been here before
I'm sitting on the bus, now I'm lost and alone
I feel the pain, it's a highway away
Another city in flames, in flames, in flames

So I'm wondering
Where can we go now
And I'm wondering
Where can we go now

I run from the past but it's gaining on me
I thought, we made a deal, you were crossing your fingers
So I'm struggling
With this weight that's been passed down

Well, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy
Girl, you sure look good to me
Well please don't excite me, baby
I know it can't be me
Well, I give you all my money
Yeah but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home til late at night

I'm gonna tell, tell my mama
Girl I swear to God what you been doing to me
I'm gonna tell everybody that I'm down in misery

So bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go

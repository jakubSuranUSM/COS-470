During the week I'm only half alive, wasting my time all day from 9 to 5
They think I'm slow and I'm a lazy guy
They should see me now, I'm here in your town, I'm blowing the fuses right out
Friday night - gonna let it go, dynamite - ready to explode
My boss says I'm not working hard enough
Don't even know that I sleep on the job
I'm only interested in rock 'n' roll
I'm using the week to save energy, I'm recharging my batteries - ow!
Friday night - gonna let it go, yeah, dynamite - ready to explode
Friday's okay, I get my pay, spending all night on rock, women and wine
(Solo)
Oh-oh - I'm allergic to those working days
Oh-oh - but I must survive 'til Friday, Friday, Friday
Friday night - gonna let it go, yeah, dynamite - ready to explode
I just can't wait 'til
Friday night - gonna let it go, yeah, dynamite - ready to explode, oho
Friday night - Friday night
Dynamite - that's the night that I like, that I like
Friday night... (to fade)

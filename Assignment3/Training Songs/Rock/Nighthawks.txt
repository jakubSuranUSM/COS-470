Every time when the night falls
I can feel my temperature risin'
Every time when the night calls
And the moon seems to be smilin'
Yeah, don't talk about it
Just take your wings and fly
Yeah, don't worry about it
We're all goin' flyin' tonight
We can wing it on the wildest storm
Baby we're gonna dive in, dive in
Wow, baby like the night before
see'mon and watch the nighthawks flyin'
see'mon and watch the nighthawks flyin'
Low down city
In the rain
In the summertime
Don't it want to make you cry
And die before your time
Nighthawks, nighthawks
Every time when the night falls
My baby gets sentimental
Every time when the night calls
And the mood gets temperamental
Yeah, don't think about it
Just shake your wings and fly
Yeah, don't worry about it
No sign in your eyes of fatigue
You've been jailed before
Ride on the wind
You need more, more, more, more, more
Nighthawks, nighthawks
Let me tell you that a nighthawk is cryin'
Don't cry like you know cryin'
Let me tell you that a nighthawk is dyin'
Don't die like you know dyin'
Yeah, don't talk about it
Just take your wings and fly
Yeah, don't worry about it
We're all goin' flyin' tonight
Nighthawks, nighthawks

Walking through the street making some noise
Be above now see us bringing on toys
Don't you know we got a choice?

And we go, go, go living like lovers
And we fight, fight, figh like we are in war
Then they know, know the rain won't wet us
And we can, can, can rich too '

If you got a smile but you don't know way
It's easy to do when you live a life
Put it that way for you and I

And you know go, go, go living like lovers
The we, by, by, by like we're all alone
Then they know, know the rain won't wet us
And we can, can, can rich too '

If let 'em through 'we come and say it going down, down, down
They act like they own the place
See the look from their face they, they're going down, down, down, down, down, down

And we go, go, go living like lovers
And we fight, fight, figh like we are in war
Then they know, know the rain won't wet us
And we can, can, can rich too '
And you know that we arrive to'
And you stay, never be the time when we

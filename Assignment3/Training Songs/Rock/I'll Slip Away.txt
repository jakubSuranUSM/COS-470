And I'll forget about the girl that said no
Then I'll tell who I want where to go
And I'll forget about your lies and deceit
And your attempts to be so discreet

Maybe today, yeah
I'll slip away

And you can keep your symbols of success
Then I'll pursue my own happiness
And you can keep your clocks and routines
Then I'll go mend all my shattered dreams

Maybe today, yeah
I'll slip away

'Cause you've been down on me for too long
And for too long I just put you on
Now I'm tired of lying and I'm sick of trying
Cause I'm losing who I really am
And I'm not choosing to be like them

And if you get bored and you got loneliness
Or it's dislike for me you express
I won't care if you're right or you're wrong
I won't care cause you see I'll be gone

Maybe today, yeah
I'll slip away

Maybe today, yeah
Maybe today, yeah
Maybe today, yeah girl
I'll slip away

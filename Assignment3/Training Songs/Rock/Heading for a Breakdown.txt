Some people think they're aging too fast, 
Living in a race against the past,
They cannot feel the present day, 
But there's always time to fade away

Unless you're heading for a breakdown, my friend, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown again, 
Unless you're heading for a home, We did not put you on this road 

Some people think they never grow, They're all afraid of moving too slow, 
In all the fields they try to break, There's never time for a mistake, 

Unless you're heading for a breakdown, my friend, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again,
We did not put you on this road,
We never told you where to go, 

Some people think they never get enough, 
Anything for real they try to make it stop, We're on the outside looking in,
We see the end when they begin, And when you all have gone insane, 
There will be no time to ease the pain, 

Unless you're heading for a breakdown, my friend,
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again, 
Unless you're heading for a home, 

We did not put you on this road
We didÂ´t put you on this road, We never put you on this road

Unless you're heading for a breakdown, my friend,
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, my friend,
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again, 
Unless you're heading for a breakdown, again,

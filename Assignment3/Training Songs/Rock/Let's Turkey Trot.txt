Come on let's turkey trot
Let's get it while its hot
This dance is really fine
{it shouldn't take much time} ?
My grandmother taught this dance to me
She did it at the turn of the century
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on let's turkey trot

People may say your some kind of a nut
When you're lifting your knees and you start to strut
But if your really want to get out of a rut 
Do some turkey trottin' and all your cares will be forgotten

Come on let's turkey trot
Let's give it all we got
And when the dance is through
I'll trot some turkey with you

Oh we're gonna do the turkey trot again
Just like they did it back in 1910
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and turkey trot

Gobbididly gobbididly

Oh we're gonna do the turkey trot again
Just like they did it back in 1910
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and turkey trot
And give it all we got
You'll never want to stop

Come on and turkey trot

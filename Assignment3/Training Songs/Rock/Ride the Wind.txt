Ride the wind let your dreams blow
Everybody in the stream of the wind flow
You will know the reason why I ride the wind
Ride the wind leave your mind behind
Feel the rush of suspended time
That's what gets you high
And that's why I ride the wind
Yeah

I see them colors flashing like a rainbow
Drink them in until your senses overflow
And you will find that you can grow by letting yourself go
Ride the wind let your dreams blow
People you will feel all you need to know
Be open-eyed and open up wide everybody
Come on come on come on yeah
Of it feels so good it feels so good

And we’re walking
Car parked in the shade of the trees
Tried to climb one 
Countryside activities

And we’re walking 
A woman and her dog look away
Nod at the locals
Knowing that we’re not going to stay

And we’re walking 
Talk about The Galapagos
Natural science
Erosion, eruption and us

And we’re walking
Palms are sweating
Our hands let go
Keep on talking
Self-conscious, but it’s not gonna show

Wade in the water on your own
Don’t wanna go home
Leave clothes and shoes on the ground
Don’t make a sound
Don’t make a sound
Don’t make a sound

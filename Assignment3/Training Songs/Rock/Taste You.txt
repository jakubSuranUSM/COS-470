Oh my love oh my love 
I can't hear you my love 
tell me where have you gone 
oh my love oh my love 
I can't taste you my love 
tell me what have I done? 

Plug it in now 
So I can digest you 
I will taste you 

Far away far away 
I can't feel you today 
I need healing my love 
Appetite running fast, following my gut 
Turning up every rock 

You're disappearing my love 
I need louder that this 
Please fill me up 
Good tidings I bring to you and your sin 
I'll forgive 

Come to me plug it in 
So I can digest you 
I will taste you
My appetite in that whole 
tempt you with it now 
I will taste you

Please shake me and tug 
I need shaking my love 
Can't you be the one 
I can't fake it my love 
I need filling come on 
I need it louder than bombs 

Come to me plug it in 
So I can digest you 
I will taste you
My appetite in that whole 
tempt you with it now 
I will taste you

If you remember my love 
Going up from above 
Are you listening love? 
Throw your tears away 
This tempting 
Game from my gut 

I will taste you
I will taste you (I've got a big mouth) 
I've got a big mouth 
I will taste you 
I've got a big mouth I will taste you 
I will taste you 

Oh my love oh my love 
I can't hear you my love 
Tell em where have you gone 
Far away far away 
I can't feel you today 
I need healing, love Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love

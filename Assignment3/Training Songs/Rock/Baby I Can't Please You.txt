Baby I can't please you I can't please you

Every time you start to criticize
I can see the misery in your eyes
You say I make your pain
You're trying to turn the blame all around you

You take the words I say and make them mean
Everything they don't baby you're obscene
You don't listen you don't hear
You're blinded by the fear that surrounds you

I know you say love when you mean control
You buy the truth and your heart is cold
So you live in shadows

You try to tell the world how it should spin
But you live in terror with the hollow men
Who stun you with their lies
With fever in their eyes as they drown you

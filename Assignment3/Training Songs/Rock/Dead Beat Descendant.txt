Shout! 
Here's a dance that is pure hell
Enter at your peril
Take five dead beat steps
Do a stroll
Act like you just got outta jail
You must be repellant
Dance dead beat descendant

Dead beat descendant
Shout!

Come back here
Come back here 

Turn left shout and shout come back here
Then hot-tail it right outta there
You are now descendant
You are a now descendant 

Dead beat descendant
Shout! 

Make out your head is in a bell
And you got a man on your trail
And you are descendent, of a vicious criminal 

Dead beat descendant's
Dawn!
Dawn!
Dawn!

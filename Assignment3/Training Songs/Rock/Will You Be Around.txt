And it feels like I?d been dying here
Underneath these sheets
It?s a cold cold world when who you are
Is always half asleep

You have woken up the lover
Now the other wants to leave
So if I believe then tell me please

When the rain comes tumbling, tumbling down
Will you be around, will you be around?
And when the pain starts coming, coming out
Will you be around, will you be around?

And when I can't find comfort in being found
And I'm on the ground, and I'm on the ground
Will you be around, will you be around
Will you be around?

Oh the clouds may cover up the days
But on a starry night
Will you be here breathing in
My melancholy over high

You have proved that there is more
To everything I have in life
Oh, I pray you're right
Oh, I pray you're right

When the rain comes tumbling, tumbling down
Will you be around, will you be around?
And when the pain starts coming, coming out
Will you be around, will you be around?

And when I can't find comfort in being found
I'm on the ground, on the ground
Will you be around, will you be around
Will you be around?

Will you be around?
I'm gonna need you, babe, need you, babe
I'm gonna need you, babe

When the rain comes tumbling, tumbling down
Will you be around, will you be around?
And when the pain starts coming, coming out
Will you be around, will you be around?

And when I can't find comfort
Oh, I can't find comfort
And I'm on the ground, on the ground
Will you be around, be around? Yeah

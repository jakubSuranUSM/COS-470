Who's house are you going to?
Who's house are you going to?
Who's house?
What time are you hanging around?
Your face is all over the place who knew

Good grief, by the skin and your teeth
You should've worked a little harder at school
Trust you to be tripping out
Trust you to be tripping out
Trust you, trust you, trust you

Hoochie coochie
Hoochie coochie

What game are you playing now?
What game are you playing now?
What game?
Whose car are you riding in?
I doubt you're even gonna begin to fool

Hightail going off of the rails
Click clack and then you're calling me back so cool
Trust you to be tripping out
Trust you to be tripping out
Trust you, trust you, trust you

Hoochie coochie
Hoochie coochie

You look like a Picasso
Black lashes, drink it like it's water
I cadillac it when you dance slow
Come on, baby, when are you gonna call it a night?

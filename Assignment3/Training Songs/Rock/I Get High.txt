There is a girl who wanted to go
Inside the head of everyone she don't know
Got lots of questions lots on her mind
She likes to look for things she don't want to find
I get high
There is a girl who wanted to know
What do I mean when I say hello
She's always trippin' into the unknown
She asks me why we live together just to die all alone
I get high
The sun shines in the evening
The hills are all alone
The sun shines in the evening
She's nowhere left to go
There is a girl who wanted to go
Inside the head of everyone she don't know
One day she shut her mouth and opened her eyes
Sometimes we all hang around to check out the sky
I get high

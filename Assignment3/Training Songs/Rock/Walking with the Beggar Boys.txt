Well, I walked along and I felt like pretending
The earth stopped moving and nothing was ending,
I saw the beggar boys in different places,
They wore dirty rags and filthy faces

I told them 'hello' and they came and they followed,
I gave them my bread and they chewed and the swallowed,
And they picked me up and took my hand
And I never felt like a better man

Well, love was just a dream,
You know I never got no sleep
Walking hand in hand with the beggar boys down the
Street

Well, we talked all night and I felt very tired
So I laid down and I looked at the fire
And I thought about nothing at all
And then in the morning I was up at dawn

We talked to the people who wanted to hide us
Nothing they said then could ever divide us
And I pulled out everything I know
And I never ever went back home

Well, love was just a dream,

You know I never got no sleep
Walking hand in hand with the beggar boys down the
Street

Take me

I was you (you were me)
He was she (she was he)
They were us (we were they)
It was real (we were free)
I was God (God is cool)
God is you (God is me)
I was one (we were two)
They were three (three is three)
I was me (you were you)
Love was us (we were love)
I was gone (you were there)
You were here (I was everywhere)
I was this (this is me)
I was young (you were old)
I was hot (you were cold)
I was all (You were everything)

Love was just a dream,
You know I never got no sleep
Walking hand in hand with the beggar boys down the
Street

Yeah, love was just a dream,
You know I never got no sleep
Walking hand in hand with the beggar boys down the
Street

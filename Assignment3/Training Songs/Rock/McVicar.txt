Don't plead no special case for me
Because there ain't no way I'll get my liberty
I'm back inside, I've been betrayed
Now I know this is the greatest robbery

Night after night, I lie awake
And watch the morning break
Night after night, I get the feeling
That, there's no way back

Don't think you'll see me here again
You better find another man to take the blame
Ooo, ooo, ooo, it's getting late
I better sweat it out and get myself in shape

Time after time, only a fool
Would make the same mistake
Time after time, and every day I thought
I won't get caught

Ooo, ooo, ooo, it's getting late
I better sweat it out and get myself in shape

Night after night, I lie awake
And watch the morning break
Night after night, I get the feeling
That, there's no way back

I never thought the day would come when she would say goodbye
She's leaving with a California tilt to live her life

Instead, I'm getting tired of holding back the words I want to say
I ran myself into the ground just hoping you would say

She left...
On her own through twisted roads
She left on her own again [2x]

Everything has got to end, but good things never leave
A Southern man once told me that love isn't what it means

She left...
On her own through distant roads
She left on her own again [2x]

She left on her own...

It's one of those nights when you turn out the lights
And you sit in the dark and say to yourself 'I miss her'

It's one of those moods when your body broods
And you conjure up her picture and you kiss her

It's one of those things for the pain it brings
You say to yourself 'Hey couldn't I live without it?''
Well, I think so, on the other hand, I doubt it

Well suddenly she's crashing through my mind
Like waves upon the shore (like waves upon the shore)
And I nod my head, whoa yes love, I'd welcome you again
If you knocked upon my door (If you knocked upon my door)
If you didn't, I'd seek you out love, I'd track you down for sure
Like a thousand times before (Like a thousand times before)

Whoa, yes love, I'd welcome you again like you know I've done before

Ahh...Yes love, you know I did before (before)
Ahh...Yes love, you know I did before (before)

And so it goes it's a cold in your nose
It's a pain in the neck, it'll make you a wreck if it gets ya
It's so insane 'cause for all the rain
When you ask yourself could you do it all again, you betcha

I hear a voice say you got no chance
And it makes me mad and I shout, 'Oh yeah, who says so?'
Well, of course not, on the other hand, I guess so

Whoa, suddenly she's crashing through my mind
Like waves upon the shore (Like waves upon the shore)
And I nod my head, whoa yes love, I'd welcome you again
If you knocked upon my door (If you knocked upon my door)
If you didn't, I'd seek you out, love, I'd track you down for sure
Like a thousand times before (Like a thousand times before)
  
Oh, yes love, I'd welcome you again like you know I did before

Ahh...yes love, you know I did before (before)
Ahh...yes love, you know I did before (before)

I could lay aside my better judgement
I could turn my back on all the pain
Make believe you mean it when you touch me
And be fool enough to think you'd change

I'm no fool and you're not changing
You know I'm telling the heartbreaking truth
You've gone wild and I'm going crazy
And what bothers me most is I don't bother you

Late at night you're such a great temptation
I'm too weak to fight you everytime
Lying in my bed of desperation
I want you lying in these arms of mine

I'm no fool and you're not changing...
Oh what bothers me most is I don't bother you

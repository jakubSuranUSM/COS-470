We stood in the dark
With our hands over each others heart
And we didn't waste a word
Grace is love undeserved

When you feel love
You remind me I can feel love
We sleep and share the same dream love
When we feel love

I've given up, I've given in
Given out and back again
Now that we're in from the cold
Our days are made of gold

Love you remind me
I can feel love
We sleep and share the same dream love
When we feel love

What has been lived
Can't be changed
But what we have lost
We can still, can still be reclaimed
And I won't, I won't let you down

When you feel love
You remind me, I can feel love
We sleep and share the same dream love
When we feel love

When you feel love
When we feel love
Yes we feel love, feel love
When we feel love

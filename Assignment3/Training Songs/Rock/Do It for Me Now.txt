It's a frightening night, and the wind has a roar 
It seeps through the hall, and from under the door 
Like the shit that was said 
Can take it that well 
I give and I give and I give and I give and I'm still 
Hurtin' from this, from the love that's been starved 
I know I got close but I'm sure it's to far 
From the point of suspense, we know it should be 
The end of the part, of our favorite movie 
When the guy grabs the girl and gives her his hand 
Says take me away from this torch in this land 
'Cause the grave is set up, the hole that I dug 
I gave and I gave and I gave and I gave you my trust 
Like the time that we kissed, and you gave me a lie 
To act of this scene you pretended to cry 
But I'm here and I'm cool, the way that it is 
Just give me a chance and I'll try to forgive 

And I don't know 
And I can't guess it's gonna be okay but now
My last wish is that you do this with me 
Kiss me here, and hold my hand 
Let me feel like I'm the only one 
I know you can 
Won't you do if for me now 

I really had it with the rain and the tears 
The predictable storm that has come every year 
And it sneaks from the shore with the bat in its hand 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I can't 
You're a thief and a witch, but if love you to death 
You steal my heart and curse under your breath 
But the one thing that I will most willing prove 
That when you are gone I'll be fine without you 

And I don't know 
And I can't guess it's gonna be okay but now
My last wish is that you do this with me 
Kiss me here, and hold my hand 
Let me feel like I'm the only one 
I know you can 
Won't you do if for me now 

Now just hold on, hold on to me 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)

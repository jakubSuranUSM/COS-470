Cocaine and chocolate won't keep you alive
But they might fill you up when you feel deprived
Stella oh Stella you need my umbrella
So I'll be your shield while your slaying the field

And I only wanted to fill you up
Just to thrill you up
'Cause I notice the things you like
And I only wanted to give you back

All the love you lack
You'd be touched but it's innocent
Sit on this wall with me,
I have some tricks to see

We'll find a voice for you
I am the boy for you
You have a dancers heart
I have a chancers art

We have a dancers chance
We do a chancers dance
I keep a chair for you
Empty and spare for you

I keep a day for you
Holy and pray for you
And I was describing the sight of you
In Rococo blue to my friend the protector

And he was designing a room for
With an urban view, he is a collector
Why won't you smile for me?
Once in a while for me,

You shouldn't toy with me
I am your boy you see

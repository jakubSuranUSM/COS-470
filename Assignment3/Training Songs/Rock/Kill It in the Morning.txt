I see not the same things
Are you assure are you sure I am wrong
I see her only when she moves so slow
Could it ever be more than what I want
We say last time my night
I am talking each game no one
You and me fall girl are you ever

Girl are you there for you speak to me
You speak to me unless she wouldn’t go
Well done somehow somehow
So excite see me on site we are lights
I don’t care I don’t care love
We are I am only away

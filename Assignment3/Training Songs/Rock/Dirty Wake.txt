Heaven, hold me up, don't let me go
Just shine your light
Hell is just the ebb, the undertow
A faded blue sky

I won't waste my time believing
Waste my breath breathing
Waste my eyes deceiving
I can't waste myself in a dirty wake

I spent my last shadow on heaven knows
I'm awake, let the undertow pull me away all on faith

River to it run the ocean go
A faded blue sky

I won't waste my time believing
Waste my breath breathing
Waste my eyes deceiving
I can't waste myself in a dirty wake

I spent my last shadow on heaven knows
I'm awake, let the undertow pull me away all on faith

Won't waste my time believing
Won't waste my breath breathing
Won't waste my eyes deceiving
I can't waste myself in a dirty wake

Won't waste my time believing
Won't waste my breath breathing
Won't waste my eyes deceiving
I can't waste myself in a dirty wake

I spent my last shadow on heaven knows
I'm awake, let the undertow pull me away all on faith
Spent my last shadow on heaven knows
I'm awake, let the undertow pull me away all on faith

River to it run the ocean go

Blessed are the one-way ticket
Holders on the one-way street
Blessed are the midnight-riders
For in the shadow of God they sleep

Blessed are the huddled hikers
Staring aut at falling rain
Wond´ring at the retribution
In their personal acquaintance with pain

Blessed are the blood relations
Of the young ones who have died
Who had not the time or patience
To carry on this earthly ride.

Rain will come and winds will blow,
Wild deer die in the mountain snow.
Birds will beat at Heaven´s wall,
What comes to one must come to all.

For you and I are one-way ticket
Holders on that one-way street
Which lies across a golden valley
Where the waters of joy and hope run deep.

So if you pass the parents weeping
Of the young ones who have died
Take them to your warmth and keeping
For blessed are the tears the cried
and many were the years they tried
Take them to that valley wide
And let their souls be pacified.

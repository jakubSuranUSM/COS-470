Lend me your comb, it's time to go home
Gotta confess, my hair is a mess
Your mama will scold, your daddy will shout
As we come in, the way we went out
Kissin' you was fun honey-bun
Thanks for the date
Time has come to run honey-bun
You know baby it's a-gettin' late
Just wait 'til I straighten my tie
Lend me your comb, we gotta go home

Kissin' you was fun honey-bunny
Thanks for the date
Time has come to run honey-bun
Sugar bug it's a-gettin' late
Just wait 'til I straighten my tie
Lend me your comb, we gotta go home

Here comes the weekend, honey.
What's going on?
Do we put our feet up, honey,
Or call it all night long?
Oh, baby, whatever... I'm With You
Are we staying home, are we going downtown?
Are we dressing up baby, or dressing down?
Oh, whatever... Baby, I'm With you

[CHORUS:]
You're my sunshine in the morning,
You're my stars at night.
You're all I ever dream about.
Anything you want,

Well, baby, that's alright.
Anything you don't,
I can learn to live without as long as...
I'm with you, till the Sun stops burning.
I'm with you, till the world stops turning.
Till the end of time, Oh, I'm with you.

[Chorus:]

I'm with you, till the Sun stops burning.
I'm with you, till the world stops turning.
Till the end of time, baby, I'm with you.
Till the end of time, Oh, baby, I'm with you

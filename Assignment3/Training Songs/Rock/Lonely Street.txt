Don't know what I'm gonna do since my baby said we're through
I've really got a case of blue oh I walk the Lonely Street

Ever since she said goodbye all I do is sit and cry
And that's the only reason why oh I walk the Lonely Street

Well she would give a little I take a lot I really long to have her near
And it's the truth believe it or not I hate to see a love disappear
Don't know what I'm gonna do

Well she would give a little
Ever since she said goodbye

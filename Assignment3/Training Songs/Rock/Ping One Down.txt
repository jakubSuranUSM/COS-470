We'll return to the ocean
Ride the tide again
Test the water, jump right in
And try to swim

So ping one down
Let it sink
Sink on down
Like heavy metal

We should take off the lotion
Let the sun shine in
Admire the holes with shaded eyes
And fry again

And ping one down
Let it sink
Sink on down
Like heavy metal

Ping one down
Let it sink
Don't ponce around
Like poor old men

Colour clean
This sterile scene
Move as we please
No use in complaining

Purify now
Saints alive
We're all deprived
Be careful what you're saying

We've been on a safari
Just collecting skin
Head to toe in camouflage
But high again

So ping one down
And let it sink
Sink on down
Like heavy metal

Colour clean
This sterile scene
Move as we please
No use in complaining

Purify now
Saints alive
We're all deprived
Be careful what you're saying

Careful what you're saying
Careful what you're saying

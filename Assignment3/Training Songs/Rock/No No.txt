Went to the river and I turned around
Because I didn't want to drown, drown, drown
Wow, no no
But the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul

Well I went to the river once before
But no no no, I won't do that no more
Wow, no no
Yet the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul

You can tell my mama and my wife
I changed my mind, I'm not gonna change my life
Wow, no no
Yet the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul

[Instrumental]

Yes I went to the river and I turned around
Because I didn't want to drown, drown, drown
Wow, no no
But the water was cold and it didn't satisfy my soul

[Instrumental and fade]

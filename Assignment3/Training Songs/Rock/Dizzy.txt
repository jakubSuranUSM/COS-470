Along the Palo Duro canyon
Red River shows so many eyes.
One eye squnting shading from the sun, shoot me.

Black as oil, his hair shone
Lily white his skin glistened
Restless as the reed between his lips blew.

It's just that mean old Texas sun
It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head

What day is this? I quietly asked the sky.
What time is it? he asked me sitting up.

Love that villain on the run
He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.

What are you running from? I asked the white boy. 
From the guys who chased me there; Come run.
I need your dark skin to sit beside me in my car.
Light up my cigar, I'll light you.

It's just that mean old Texas sun
It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head
Love that villain on the run
He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.
And dizzy, dizzy, dizzy,
In my head.

He said, You're only indian in Oklahoma.
You could be melting in America.
White on red, melt with my skin.
These two hearts will beat along the walls of our hotel.
I need your dark skin to sit beside me in my car.
Light up my cigar, I'll light you.

It's just that mean old Texas sun
It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head

The last I saw of Oklahoma
A gas station fading in the dusk.
Goodbye to my father, I thought, I'm carrying the light.
The light of my comanche
Make sure the dog remembers me
I dream the sand beneath your feet
I hold the light

It's just that mean old Texas sun
It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head
Love that villain on the run
He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.
And dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy,
In my head.

Have you got something to tell me?
Please come up and tell it to me,
Please come up and tell me baby blue.

Have you got a tear or two, well,
Come on up and tell me do now,
You can tell it all now, baby blue.

Really baby don't be shy,
It's alright for me to talk to you.
So let it all come out
And let it all come through, baby blue.

Someone has been cruel to you,
Someone has been unkind to you,
How about you tell me, tell me do.

Who would want to treat you that way?
Who would stand to see you that way?
Who could make you cry now, baby blue?
Let it all come out
And let it all come through, baby blue.

Ooh-ooh-ooh, someone hurt you bad,
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you don't have to take it so bad.

Really baby don't be shy,
It's alright for me to talk to you.
And let it all come out
And let it all come through, baby blue.

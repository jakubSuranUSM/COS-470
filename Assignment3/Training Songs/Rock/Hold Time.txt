You were beyond comprehension tonight
But I understood
I understood
If only I could hold time
Hold time
Hold time

Words have failed me tonight, failed me tonight
But you knew what I meant
You knew what I meant
Yeah, you heard what I said the whole time
The whole time
The whole time

And I wrote this song about it
Cause I didn't care about anyone in this photograph
Yeah, I wrote this song just to remember the endless, endless summer in your life
Endless summer in your life

Hey! I've got a message and tonight and I'm gonna send it.
Yeah! I had a body and men with knives wanted to lend it.
Sold my body to the company
So I got the money now away I go and I say thank you Mr. CEO.
Hey! I've got some money and tonight I'm gonna spend it.
Yeah! They gave me a paper
And I went ahead and penned it and I say thank you Mr CEO.
I filled my pockets now I might as well -
Die! cause I found the backdoor out of teenage hell - all right!
Filed my account cause I might in fact - Die!
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back - all right.
I.....'m gonna die....
Heavy morals seem so light but when it comes to cash I'm gonna die all right!
Hey! I lost the money seems like I can't comprehend it.
Yeah! Got a hole in my head gotta gotta mend it.
Too messed up to sit and settle down.
Too messed up to even mess around.
That's why your smiling Mr CEO.
I filled my pockets now I might as well -
Die! cause I found the backdoor out of teenage hell - all right!
Filed my account cause I might in fact - Die!
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back - all right.

Yeah why don't you do the same?
I got the money now I can't complain.
Except the tics won't go away oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no!
And the way I feel tonight is gonna make me die all right.

Teenage hell - all right!
Filed my account cause I might in fact - Die!
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back - all right.

Heavy morals seem so light but when it comes to cash I'm gonna die all right!

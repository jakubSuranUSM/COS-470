She's got ice hockey hair
It's instamatic and it has such flair
And when the puck hits the back of the cage
She feels the tingle of a quiet rage

She thinks it's tasty
Me thinks it's hasty
Take me to a chorus line

Tell me what to do if it all falls through
Can you point me a direction I can take my shoes?
What did I do to you to make you feel so blue?
I get the impression that we're overdue
I've got the lunar madness
And it's coming straight to you

Table tennis rules
They're so confusing it's not played by fools
And with my time filled to the brim
You may suggest to me anything

Phone me, page me
Fax me 'til I'm silly
Answer me today

Tell me what to do if it all falls through
Can you point me a direction I can take my shoes?
What did I do to you to make you feel so blue?
I get the impression that we're overdue
You're my Auto Teller
Oh won't you tell me something good?

Maybe you think I'm shady
But I sing your language baby
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Oooooh)

What did I do to you to make you feel so blue?
I get the impression that we're overdue (X2)
What did I do to you?

Now that you're here tell me you're a non-believer
Oh! Oh! Oh! (X9)

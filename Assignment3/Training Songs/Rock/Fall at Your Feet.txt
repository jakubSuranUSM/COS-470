I'm gonna stay right here with you
'cause you'll be giving up the secrets of your trade
& then put your little demon inside me
Til I'm made no less than utterly possessed

When you sing like an angel,
& I fall at your feet

I guess things will never seem the same again
'cause without you I'm like a torch without a flame
Not a case of fair or unfair, not a case of truth or dare
But your nerve of steel is gonna make me kneel,
& it's how I feel when

You sing like an angel,
& I fall at your feet

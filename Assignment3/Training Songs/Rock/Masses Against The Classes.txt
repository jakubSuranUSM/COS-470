THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT PROPERTY FROM THE MAJORITY
AND SO IT REMAINS

1, 2, 3, 4 

Hello it's us again 
We're still so in love with you 
And yes we mean it too 
Yes we're so in love with you 

Hello it's us again 
You thought you were our friends 
Success is an ugly word 
Especially in your tiny world 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When the future is what we believe in
We love winter 
It brings us closer together 

So can you hurt us anymore 
Can you feel like it was before 
Or are you lost forever more 
Messed up and dead on alcohol 

Hello, fond farewell my dears 
I hope you hear this nice and clear 
Our love is unconditional 
Our hate is yours to feed upon 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter 
It brings us closer together 

The masses against the classes 
I'm tired of giving a reason 
When we're the only thing left to believe in
We love the winter 
It brings us closer together 

A SLAVE BEGINS BY DEMANDING JUSTICE 
AND ENDS BY WANTING TO WEAR A CROWN

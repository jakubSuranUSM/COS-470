When I'm sure 
I don't know why but I feel so insecure 
And when it comes 
It comes like a great big lull 
But either way 
I don't know why but I get so crazy 
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots 

When I'm home 
I don't know why but I feel so all alone 
And then you come barring down like an atom bomb 
And I want to, but I want to 
But I want to, but I feel all inside out 
But I want to, but I want to 
But I want to, but I feel all inside out 

Everywhere you turn 
There's always something there
And all the time you're getting nowhere 
Everywhere I don't know why but I get so crazy 
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots 

Well I'm sure 
Sometimes I feel out a little more 
And then its hard 
It's harder than it ever was before 
But either way I don't know why but I get so crazy 
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots 

Yeah I want to, but I want to 
But I want to, but I feel all inside out 
But I want to, but I want to 
But I want to, but I feel all inside out 

Everywhere you turn 
There's always something there 
And all the time you're getting nowhere 
Everywhere I don't know why but I get so crazy 
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots 

Yeah I want to, but I want to 
But I want to, but I feel all inside out
But I want to, but I want to 
But I want to 
But I feel all inside out

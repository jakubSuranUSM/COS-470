I saw you coming out the corner of my eye
You touched my face just as I started to go blind
Know you injected all the poison into me
You have been killing me, is that so hard for you to see?

Where are you now?
I have been dancing in your veins
Where are you now?
In two more minutes, you'll be dead
Where are you now?
Your hollow heart will be my home

Suck it out, suck it out
Suck out the poison
Suck it out, suck it out
Suck out the poison

My face went numb, I couldn't move my hands or feet
I didn't notice when you kissed me on my cheek
I started sweating and I dropped down to my knees
You are becoming my all time favorite terminal disease

Where are you now?
I have been dancing in your veins
Where are you now?
In two more minutes, you'll be dead
Where are you now?
Your hollow heart will be my home

Suck it out, suck it out
Suck out the poison
Suck it out, suck it out
Suck out the poison

Help me, I'm infected
Suck out the poison
Help me, I'm infected
Suck out the poison

Help me, I'm infected
Suck out the poison
Help me, I'm infected

Where are you now?
I have been dancing in your veins
Where are you now?
In two more minutes, you'll be dead
Where are you now?
Your hollow heart will be my home

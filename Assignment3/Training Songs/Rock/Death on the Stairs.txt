From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in the war

With a pale young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little un-holy friend
She had no mind to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

There's a little boy in a stairwell who says
"I hate people like you"
Got matches & cable TV half of less than 50p
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window waking Steve
Bringing with a true love his un-holy friend
If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind

So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore

Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
I wouldn't know about that anyway

Monkey asked the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
It turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
To a cheap hotel when I can meet the past
And pay it off and keep it sweet
It's sweet like nothing no
It's just like nothing at all

Yes I've seen you there
How could I help but stare
It rips the heart out off your baby
Now I've taken far too much to see
Or think or touch what's real
I'm stranded on this street that
Paved my only way home

You really need it oh
You just won't leave it behind

So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore

Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bang on about yesterday
I wouldn't know about that anyway
Oh no

He got nothing he got nothing at all

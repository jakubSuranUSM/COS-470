What a waste of time looking for a god on a mountain side, everyone's
Depraved, you haven't got much sense though you've got less rights no one
Has it all, some of us are left to defend lost cause, all you want to say
It doesn't always sound like it's meant that way.
What a way to die, standing on your head to prolong the high, chained up
To your bed, rubbing in the oil to reduce those welts, tours in hostile
Lands, you could be ill advised to purse those plans years of self deceit,
Reality is blurred so you make believe.
Start out fighting, ran away frightened, takes a long time to reduce the
Excitement, levels, rebels, devils that disturb your sleep, no wonder you
Can't stay on you feet. 
What a shock to find, nobody around when you have lost your mind, books and
Photographs, living in an age that has long since passed, everyone's inside
Trying to find a way out of level nine, signed and sealed your fate, you've
Got more police but you're still not safe. 
Standing for election, running for protection, bulletproof vest in the
Banking section, roller coaster, comatose looking for the Elvis clone,
Nobody hears you so you reach for the phone. 
What a lot to give, everything you have not to be disturbed, homes and
Loans for free, following any fool that leads, words to understand while
Laying down the law in the desert sands, no one wants to smile, all of us
Are bored but we want more time. 
I can't shed no light but I do know there's not easy way I can't blindly
Hope though I do know that's no road to go. I can't feel the pain but I do
Know it's about to rain.
I don't care, I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care I it's
The news of the world I don't care, I don't care I don't care I don't care
I don't care I it's the news of the world, I don't care, I don't care I
Don't care I don't care I don't care I it's the news of the world, I don't
Care, I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care I it's the news
Of the world

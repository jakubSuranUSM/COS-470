Saw you coming my way
Put my nose in a book
Some crap that you gave me
Or something that I took

Man, he looked so good
It had to be ooze leather
He's so together
Oozing like I never could

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you

He's playing dumb
You're looking at clothes
Straightening his hat
Mr. Shnook ho-hum

I should've shook his hand
I never used to feel bad
I never felt so blue
Guess I never amused you

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you 
(They talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you 
(They talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you 
(They talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you 
(They talk boots while they're laughing at you)

Sleep tonight little girl
Go right in through
No-one can wake you now
You're falling through your dreams
Sliding down every beam
''cause you don't know how
Don't know how to hurt
Don't know how to lie
You just don't know how to do it
You couldn't if you tried
''cause you're wired to the moon
You innocent light
Will be shadows too soon
Sleep little angel
Stay wired to the moon
Faraway in the night
I saw my mother
She was looking at you
She said to me "My son
Don't you wake that little girl
Though I know you're wanting to
''cause you're wanting to laugh
And you're wanting to play
Leave her in sweet dreams
She may lose them one day
Keep her wired to the moon"
Like a girl I once knew
She was once happy too
Sleep little angel
Stay wired to the moon

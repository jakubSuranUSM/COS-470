See my love is asleep on the floor 
In a pose that's familiar 
See my sun will send you to war 
If the battles won't kill you 
Now I've a change in mind 
Just calling all the time 

That I don't want to live in your side 
Though the rose is vermilion 
And I find it so hard to survive 
Without when within you 

My sweet Lavinia 
My sweet Lavinia 

All the years buried under the floors 
And the wounds in the parlour 
Would have come up to greet us before 
If it weren't for my heart 'cause 

I've her name in mine 
And it's calling all the time 

For my sweet Lavinia

Outside the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore of dreams
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves
Through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Come alive
Honey, we'll be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once the story's told
You can't help but grow old
Roses do
Lovers too
So cast your seasons to the winds
And hold me dear
Oh, hold me dear

Close the window
Come alive
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out
Let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone
We're all alone

Close the window
Come alive
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out 
Let it all begin
Throw it to the winds, my love
Hold me dear

I wonder what it's like
To attack at night
And now down the defenseless
Invasions and raids just called
Fucking, punitive expeditions

Like a wildfire
Devastation spreads
Across all gallia
From helvetia to eburonia
The ravener's insatiate

Havoc
Think of yesterday
Ruin
A mass illusion! how could it come this far?

Narbonensis was not enough
The empire needed more
From aremorica to carnutia
Plagued and war-ridden land
War's inflicted on free gallia
An organised downfall
A black cloud of imperial
Rapacity unleashed

Imperial needs are met
At bloody cost of free tribes
Invasion, raid and war atrocity
In the name of s.p.q.r.

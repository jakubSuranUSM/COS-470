First light tonight,
First light tomorrow,
First light this morning,
First light this evening,
First light tonight.

Been looking back,
Down through the ages;
First I was an ancient,
Then I was an infant,
Now I am alive.

Been holdin' out,
Searchin' for something,
Something to carry
Me over the sunset,
To dawn's early light.

First light tonight,
First light tomorrow,
First light this evening,
First light this morning,
First light tonight.

Then I found it
I did it, finally oh
My search it was over
I prayed till was gone
My all in light
I been there

Still holdin' on
First light tonight,
First light tomorrow,
First light this morning,
First light this evening,
First light tonight.

First light tonight,
First light tomorrow,
First light this evening,
First light this morning,
First light tonight.

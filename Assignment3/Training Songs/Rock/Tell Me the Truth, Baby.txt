Tell me the truth Baby don't tell me no lie
Do you love me or some other guy
I wanna know before I walked out that door
Do you love me love me I wanna know
I wanna know baby don't leave me astray
Tell me the truth I'll rather it that way
I wanna know before I walked out that door
Do you love me love me I wanna know
I tried so hard to please you
With everything I sayin' dear
If ain't but one thing I'm beggin' you
Ain't that's to tell me the truth
I wanna know baby don't tell me no lie
Tell me the truth baby and I'll be satisfied
I wanna know before I walked out that door
Do you love me love me I wanna know
I wanna know before I walked out that door
Do you love me love me I wanna know

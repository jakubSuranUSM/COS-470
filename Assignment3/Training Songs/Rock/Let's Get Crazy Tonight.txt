Life can be too much you see
We all need insanity
You're off the hook when you're off the wall
You got to say, the hell with them all

C'mon let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right
Caught up with people we've never met
Ooh, Sunday morning we'll forgive and forget

Before the dawn begins to shine it's hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight

There's a part of town you've missed
Where the rules just don't exist
Give no mind and give no name
No one knows whose taking the blame

C'mon let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right
Caught up with people we've never met
Ooh, Sunday morning we'll forgive and forget

Before the dawn begins to shine it's hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight
Let's get crazy tonight

Let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right
Caught up with people we've never met
Ooh, Sunday morning we'll forgive and forget

Before the dawn begins to shine it's hazy blue light
Let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right

Let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right

Let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right

Let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right

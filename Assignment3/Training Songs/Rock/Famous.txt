You ask me if I notice all the things you do
Light the candles, light the incense
I am coming home to you
You make me...

I have seen you from my bedroom when you are alone
I have watched you moving slowly
Through my magic telescope
You make me...famous

I don't need this
I don't know what it is
I don't want this
And I'll get over it
(freedom, yes...)

You ask me if I notice how you aim to please
I have watched you moving slowly
Crawling on your hands and knees

You make me...famous
Yeah

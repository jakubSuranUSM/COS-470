To my surprise one hundred storeys high 
People getting loose now, getting down on the roof 
Folks screaming, out of control 
It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode 
I heard somebody say 

 (Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno 
(Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down 
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno 
(Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down 

 Satisfaction came in a chain reaction 
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct 
The heat was on, rising to the top 
Everybody is going strong, and that is when my spark got hot 
I heard somebody say 

 (Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno 
(Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down 
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno 
(Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down 

 Up above my head 
I hear music in the air 
That makes me know 
There's a party somewhere 

 (Just can't stop) When my spark gets hot 
(Just can't stop) When my spark gets hot

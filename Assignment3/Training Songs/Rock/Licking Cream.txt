Corrupt my hope
In joyous hell
Between the lines
Lick the cream that smells

I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(covering your eyes to make you pay)

Beyond the high
Lies burning eyes
Crashed down to soil
Fucked up and coiled

I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(covering your eyes to make you pay)

Too beautiful

Too beautiful

You want to feel it
But you can't reveal that
Conceived the meaning
And caress the demon
All those callous eyes
How they infect you world
So you pretend to reason
But you've lost your soul

I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(covering your eyes to make you pay)
You shouldn't be so beautiful in my eyes
(crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(covering your eyes to make you pay)

Too beautiful

Too beautiful

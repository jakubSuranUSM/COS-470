It ain't so long ago since we were just two kids
I remember well the secrets we've all hid from your mother
But you're much older now, although you still are young
I know you well, I like you

Hey Rose, you're finer than you know
Why hang around with clothes of another name
She'd got hair so dyed she lost too much inside
Ain't nothing left to hide in the game

Hey Rose, how do you laugh in your own show?
Try to fight the fears that rise within
No you're a rock 'n' roll slag, oh, you're such a drag
When you're trying to find a corner to inject

Hey Rose, so silently she goes
And I'm careful not to wake up, see your make up

Hey Rose, how do you laugh when she's on show, girl?
Trying to fight the fears that rise within
Hey, a rock 'n' roll slag, oh oh, you're such a drag
When you're trying to find a corner to inject

Hey Rose, you're finer than you know
But I hate to see you cold on a summer day

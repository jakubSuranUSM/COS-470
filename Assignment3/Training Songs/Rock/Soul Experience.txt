Be yourself and live a little,
Don't bother painting your face;
Tomorrow it may rain and colors run,
Better it quench the flowers thirst.

Don't be afraid to live a little,
Don't be afraid of the people that belittle our love,
Oh our love.

Open up your thoughts and listen to others,
Your fellow man may surprise you;
He offers a unique item,
Soul experience, help yourselves to each other.

Don't be afraid to live a little,
Don't be afraid of the people that belittle our love,
Oh our love.

Just be yourself.
Just be yourself.
Oh our love, oh our love.

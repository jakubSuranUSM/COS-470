Now you're a clone
With a heart of stone
Synthetic soul
Brainwashed and cold
You're just a drone
Got no control
Forced in a mold
Processed and sold

Hey! You know I find it frightening
How you change just as fast as lightning

You fell from grace
Leaving no trace
You've been replaced
Your name erased

Hey! It's your self-destruction
You never listen to my instruction

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame that everyone's the same
I thought you stood alone
We're different from the clones

You were a flash of light
A meteorite
Unique in time
Now out of sight
For I have seen what could have been
A vivid dream
A prophecy

Hey! Now there's no use waiting
Everything is disintegrating

Shame that everyone's the same
I thought you stood alone
We're different from the clones
I thought you were the true
Exception to the rule
But the truth it is cruel

Clones, clones, clones, clones
Clones, clones, clones, clones

Yeah!
Hey! Now there's no use waiting
Everything is disintegrating

Shame that everyone's the same
I thought you stood alone
We're different from the clones
I thought you were the true
Exception to the rule
But the truth it is cruel

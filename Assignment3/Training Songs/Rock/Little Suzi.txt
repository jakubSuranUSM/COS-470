Little Suzi's on the up, looking for a get-away
Ruby tries to bring her down, she's lookin' for another way
Little Suzi's on the up, headin' for the spotlights
Ruby finally gets up, lookin' for some quiet night

And the music makes her feel so hot
Ooh and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up

Little Suzi's on the up, now suddenly it's not a game
Ruby's got to give up, 'cause Suzi's plainly set on pain
Little Suzi's on the up, cost in cost, your point is made
Ruby's gonna hang around, to make sure Suzi's okay

And the music makes her feel so hot
Ooh and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up

And the music makes her feel so hot
Ooh and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Don't you bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far when her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up, oh yes she is, ow!
Now she's on the up, little Suzi's on the up
Heading for the spotlight, oh little Suzi
Oh and the music makes her feel so hot, go little Suzi, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah, oh yeah

Sittin in a hotel miles from nowhere
Thought that this cold be my happiness
I look at the phone and pick it up
For the millionth time I put it down again
I know I let you go
And I've got no right to know

[Chorus:]
Do you ever get lonely baby
Don't you ever get tired of living that way
Don't you ever wonder whether there's a better life,
out there yeah
Do you ever think about what we had
How you'd give anything to get it back
Don't you wonder if you'll ever love that way again
If only you could hold me
Do you ever get lonely

I look around the room and wonder
When and why and how my life has changed
I'm surrounded by so many so called friends
And I don't even know their names
When all that you love is gone
Just keep on holding on
Oh tell me

[Chorus]

Do you ever miss me
Wishing you could kiss me
If only you could hold me
Do you ever get lonely
I know that this world has changed us
Now we're nothing more than strangers
But do you think about me ever
Do you think we belong together

[Chorus]

Do you ever miss me
Wishing you could kiss me
If only you could hold me
Do you ever get lonely
'cause I do...

Speaking of love
You ask how much you should give
Expect and receive
Take what you could, give what you must coz
Whatever's for us, for us
Mmmmmm
Whatever's for us, for us
Speaking of pride
You ask but why, what for
And what it should be

Do what you will, say what you must coz
Whatever's for us, for us
Speaking of life
You ask how, how right you are
To be feared or loved
He'd not alive and not to trust coz
Whatever's for us, for us
Mmmmmm
Whatever's for us, for us

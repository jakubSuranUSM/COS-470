The very first rule
That you learned in school
Was that you shouldn't try to fool
The people you're close to

And now you're almost full grown
I really should've known
If I left you on your own
You wouldn't do like you're supposed to

Why'd you lie?

Don't want to hear no alibis
Don't want to know the reasons why
You left me here to cry
While you were out there loving him

And now you're acting real nice
You're all sugar and spice
You've already thrown the dice
Your chances are real slim

Why'd you lie?
Why'd you lie?

You'd better make a correction
To all this deception
And start treating me right
'Cause we had discussed it
'Til I was disgusted
There's one thing that I have to say
All about sleeping in another man's bed

Why'd you lie?
Why'd you lie?

The very first rule
That you learned in school
Was that you shouldn't try to fool
The people you're close to

Why'd you lie?
Why'd you lie?
Why'd you lie?
Why'd you lie?

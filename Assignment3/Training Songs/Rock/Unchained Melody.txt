Oh, oh my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long and lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely mountain's gaze
At the sea, at the sea
At the lonely open arms of the sea
All one I gaze at the sea, at the sea
All lone I gaze at the sea faithfully

Oh, oh my love
Oh my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long and lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

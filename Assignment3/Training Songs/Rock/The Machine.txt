I, I just took a ride in a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean

Do you want to ride
See yourself going by 
The other side of the sky 
I've got a silver machine

It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your zodiac sign

I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine

It flies out of a dream
It's antiseptically clean
You're gonna know where I've been

Do you want to ride
See yourself going by 
The other side of the sky 
I've got a silver machine

I said I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And I'm still feeling mean
It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your zodiac sign 

I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine
I've got a silver machine

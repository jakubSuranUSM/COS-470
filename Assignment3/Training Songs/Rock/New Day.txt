Come and have a new day, yeah
Hey, we all know that the town is around us today
Talking 'bout the pain that comes after
And what a high price it seems we got to pay for live

Time to share a little love
Come and have a new day, yeah

Hey, it's time that we're feeling
What has got both talking 'bout today
Take a look at the part that we're playing
In a hard special way

Time to share all our love
Come and have a new day

Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way
Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way

Got to have time to think it over
Need some more time to think it over
Over and over and over and over
And over and over and over

Time to share all our love
Come and have a new day

Ain't no room for non believers
You can leave us, if you like
Come back when you find your lovin', we'll let you in
Make you feel alright, gonna make you feel alright

Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way
Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way

Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way
Make it a new day, new day
Made in a new way

Make it a new day
Made in a new way
Make it a new day
Made in a new way

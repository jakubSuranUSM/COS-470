Dog and his master, took out together
Heading due west, away from the east
Walking the road, leading a blind man
Staff in his hadn, and a dog that could see
Strange looking band were we

Man and his hubcaps, flashing the highway
Shielding his eyes, from the heat of the sun
A wife, name of Maisy, who's driving him crazy
Convertable mind closed permanently
Strange looking band were we

So you've loved, and you've lost
Now you won't take another chance, at any cost
You've run up, against a wall
And you've been hurt so badly, just badly enough, to risk it all
And in the dark, you see your star shine through the window
All through the night, you strain to understand

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes, and you will see
There are dreams that, are waiting to be woven
Don't you weep, 'cause in your sleep
There are doorways, waiting to be opened

And now you hide, beneath yourself
You you don't let on that you could want, for someone else
And so you carry, this torch alone
Even though deep down you know she'll be, the only one
And in the dark, you see your star shine through the window
All through the night, you strain to understand

[Chorus:]

On to the end-hold back the tears, you feel like cryin'
Oh please, don't pretend, that there's no hope
And give up tryin'
There are doorways...waiting to be opened...whooooah

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes...and dream...and dream
Waiting to be opened...whoah
Close your eyes

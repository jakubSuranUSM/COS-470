Sometimes I don't even move a muscle
Baby when you lie awake at night
I think I've got nine lives in these corpuscles
Girl, you know sometimes I don't think right 

I hear voices in the hall
I wake up and its nothing at all
A hungry wolf, or an angry child 

Or something wild
Something wild
Something wild - tell me love is
Something wild - tell me love is 

It's not as if we could think that things were one way
And they would all just be that way right now
When I was a kid I thought that someday
I could tame this lion heart, some way, somehow 

Now I'm hungry for the love
That doesn't know what it's dreamin' of
Raging for the meek and mild 

Like something wild
Something wild
Something wild - tell me love is
Something wild - tell me love is 

There's a hole where the wind blows through
And some curtains hung
But I can't hid a thing from you
You know where I come from 

Well I tried getting there under my own steam
'Til my very last chance was shot
Now you're under my skin like a submarine
I can feel you in my veins running hot 

Now if it's more than a new pair of jeans, a new car, some pocket money
And a place to go
Then we better get up and scream at the top of our lungs like it
Was gonna die if we didn't make it so 

I hear voices in the hall
I wake up and it's nothing at all
An angry wolf, or a hungry child 

Or something wild
Something wild
Something wild - tell me love is
Something wild - tell me love is
Something wild
Something wild
Something wild

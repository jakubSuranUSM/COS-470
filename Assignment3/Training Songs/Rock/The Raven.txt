The clock struck midnight,
Then through my sleeping,
I heard a tapping at my door.
I looked but nothing
Lay in the darkness
And so I turned inside once more.
To my amazement,
There stood the raven.
Whose shadow hung above my door.
Then through the silence,
It spoke the one word
That I shall hear forever more:
Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven:
Nevermore!
And still the raven
Remains in my room
No matter how much I implore.
No words can soothe him;
No prayer remove him.
And I must hear forever more:
Quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!
Nevermore! Nevermore!
Nevermore!!!

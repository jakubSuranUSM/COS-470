As real as the morning 
As boundless as a dream 
Might see her walking down Union 
Sipping her coffee and smiling 
She's the woman on the subway 
She's the waitress that brings my tea 
She's the girls that I grew up with 
Locked inside my memory 

Never met a girl 
Never met a girl I
Never met a girl I didn't love 

Some of them were lovers 
Some of them were friends 
Some of them were mothers 
Some I tried to hold and lost in the end 
Some of them were lonely 
Some of them were tough as nails 
Some of them were holy 
Some were as wild as the City itself 

Never met a girl 
Never met a girl I
Never met a girl I didn't love 

It's not sexy it's not needy 
It's not friendship it's not lust 
It's not desire or manipulation 
It's not erotic it's just love 

Never met a girl 
Never met a girl I
Never met a girl I didn't love somehow I

Never met a girl 
Never met a girl I
Never met a girl I didn't love

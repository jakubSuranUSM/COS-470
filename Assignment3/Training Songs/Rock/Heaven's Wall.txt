Through the rise and fall, through the urban sprawl
You can have my sight, then we can see it all
In your neon dreams you will know what it means
Outside of heaven's wall

From the mountain top we'll see the fires glow
Where everything you are is everything you know
And then the fear will come and we can feel as one
Outside of heaven's wall

So come on, take my hand, I'll see you through it all
And when the stars come out we can watch them fall
So come on, take my hand, we'll rise above it all
Then we can meet as planned outside of heaven's wall

From the tower blocks to the lakes and trees
When you know who you are you will be on your knees
And when the real rain comes then we can be as one
Outside of heaven's wall

So come on, take my hand, I'll see you through it all
And when the stars come out we can watch them fall
So come on, take my hand, we'll rise above it all
Then we can meet as planned on top of heaven's wall

Thinking clearly never came,
As easy as it did for you,
Driving this route out of town,
I wish you were still around,
And in the dead of night I always,
wondered whether you were true,
Someone better than myself,
An offer you just can't turn down,
A morning fight,
And a wasted night,
You crept back to your room

Run along back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I couldn't trap you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,
Limassol

When its all good keep things close at hand

I could never bear to hear you,
Struggling against the tide,
Promises I couldn't keep,
I couldn't admit I was in too deep
Saw the lights on in your window,
Even though they'd said you'd gone,
The darker nights have come again,
Quicker than the year before
A morning fight,
A wasted night,
You slipped back to your room

You better run away back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I could never catch you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,
Limassol

When its all good keep things close at hand,
When its all good you've gotta keep things close at hand

There's no more affairs
No more fooling around
There's no more affairs
Are you going to find out?
If I tremble in your arms
If I sigh through your hair
This last affair
There's no more fooling around
There's no more affairs
Are you going to find out?
If my hand's by my side
If I avoid your stare
This last affair

There's no more affairs
No more fooling around
There's no more affairs
No more fooling around
There's no more affairs
Are you going to find out?

If I tremble in your arms
If I sigh through your hair
This last affair
This place in my mind
Where I know what's going on
But it grows, shifts in time
Leaves me hanging on
And though we were only having fun
It seems such a crime now
Go and play, play in the road
You're gonna get run down, run down
 
There's no more affairs
No more fooling around
There's no more affairs
Are you going to find out?

It's an impulsive thing
But we caught the other
Climbed into bed with all our previous lovers
It gets crowded in there
There's no more affairs

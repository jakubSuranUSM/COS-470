Here you go, taking your time
But don't you know, you're never giving
On and on, you're on my mind
This is no way for a man to live

C'mon don't you know I wanna see you
C'mon don't you know I wanna see you
And once again don't you know you gotta listen to your lover
C'mon don't you know I wanna see you
C'mon don't you know I wanna see you
And once again don't you know I'll treat you like no other

I, I can't feel, I can't feel a damn thing
And baby doll I ain't tryin' to blame you
But you never understand what I'm trying to say
OK it's your fault fine I'll blame you

How did it get this way
How did it get this way
And don't you know I wanna see you and that I will treat you like no other
C'mon now wont u listen to your lover c'mon now wont you listen to your oh oh

You gotta listen to your love, listen to your lover, listen to your love, Listen to your oh oh
Listen to your love, listen your lover, c'mon baby I'ma treat you like no other
Listen to your love, listen to your lover, listen to your love listen to your oh oh
C'mon now I'll treat you like no other oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

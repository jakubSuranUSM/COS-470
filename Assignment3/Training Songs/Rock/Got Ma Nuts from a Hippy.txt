Well I met her in a bar, the men with big guitars were playin
And I listened with my ears but I couldn't hear what she was sayin
And I guess she talked with her mind
But didn't want to seem to unkind so I just laughed
And kept my eyes peeled to the door
Wondering what I was there for

But it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
I got my nuts from a hippy in a camper van on Saturday night

Well I asked if she believed in Adam and Eve the fable
And I guess she would've given me an answer if only she was able
And she danced like a medicine man
Drew a crazy picture on my hand and told me
She wanted to change my point of view
Asked me where I was going to

But it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
I got my nuts from a hippy in a camper van on Saturday night

Well she whispered in my ear we got to get us out of
Here to the country
I asked her for a ride she took me aside said â??try meâ??
I thought I'm gonna wake pretty soon
In the middle of a Sunday afternoon just dreamin
And it was warm in the back of her van
When she made me a real man

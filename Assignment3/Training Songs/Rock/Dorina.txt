Tried to make you happen
Tried to make you real
Tried to make your face
From a broken Ferris wheel

Listen to me Dori
Listen and you'll hear
A wind that carries lonely
And a wind that carries fear

Dorina

The bartender must be crazy
He's such an irritating host
Every night the same dumb
Question
Where's your pretty little ghost

Can't a man imagine
Can't a man be free
Can't a man just have one little
Drink

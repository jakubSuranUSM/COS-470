[?] foes, anything goes
Sell 'em really high, they're not on fire
Decorated lives, this will be the time
When something is right, baby, come on now

Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?
Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?
Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?
Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?

The months will get cold, summer too slow
I want to let you try, you're not on fire
Hate to be on time, this will be a lie
Sounded like a song, baby, come on now

Well, [?] without you
Well, I lost and it's all we can do
And I know they don't belong
I know that it's all up to you

You can have it all and it's all gone
You can have it all and it's all gone

Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?
Hit the wall in the wall and what about it?
Well, [?] without you
Well, I lost and it's all we can do

I know they don't belong
I know that it's all up to you
You can have it all and it's all gone
You can have it all and it's all gone

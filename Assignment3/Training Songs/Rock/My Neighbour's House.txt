My neighbor's house is burning down
And I cannot say why
Ten million angry mouthless tongues
All lapping at the sky
My neighbor's house is burning down
And soon will mine be too
For the wind is slowly turning
And there is nothing I can do

So I don't
Do a thing
I just stand
There and grin
Like I'm one of the idiots

My neighbor's house is burning down
I turn the other cheek
Choose not to hear his cries of help
With masterful technique
My neighbor's house is burning down
And I wish that I could care
I search for fellow feeling
To find there's nothing there

Just a sense
Of relief
That it's him
And not me
Always one of the idiots

If it proves to be some kind of test
Can I say that I gave it my best?
If my neighbor cannot be my friend
Then we're both gonna burn in the end

My neighbor's house is burning down
My neighbor's house is burning down
My neighbor's house is burning down
My neighbor's house is burning down
My neighbor's house is burning down
My neighbor's house is burning down

If it proves to be some kind of test
Can I say that I gave it my best?
If my neighbor cannot be my friend
Then we're both gonna burn in the end

No one in here is a liar
everybody is telling you the truth
but someone in here is a liar
i just really wanted it to be you

(oh) as no one really wants to be
dealing with a misery
no they only want to jump the gun

No one in here is a stranger
everybody knows who you are (knows, knows who you are)
but someone in here is in danger
someone so close and yet so far away

no one really wants to be
dealing with a misery
hang out with your sympathy
no they only want to jump the gun

(knows, knows who you are)

no one really wants to be
dealing with a misery
hang out with your sympathy
no they only want to jump the gun

no one really wants to be
dealing with a misery
hang out with your sympathy
bringing out the worst in me !
no they only want
they only want
they only want
they only want to jump the gun

Today, you came by, to tell me you are leaving me 
And to say that the love, and all that we knew had just drifted away 
And I look, in your eyes, and I couldn't bare the pain I felt inside, of my heart 
To think I'm gonna be lonley again, and if e-ever, then I know at a glance
That I don't stand a chance

Hold on, to my love, I'm nothing, and I can't get along without you
Your the light of my life there no living without (your love)

It's so hard, to believe, that your going away could make me feel so down 
'Cause I know, that from this moment on I won't have you around 
And if e-ever you go, then I know at a glance that I won't stand a chance

So hold on, to my love, I'm nothing, and I can't get along without you 
Your the light of my life 
There no living without (your love)

Ooh, oh baby, nobody's taking you place but for you, but for me
Our love would live on for the whole world to see

So hold on, to my love, I'm nothing, and I can't get along without
You your the light of my life there no living without your love no
No, no, no, hey whooo

Honey hold on (hold on), to my love (my love) 
I'm nothing (hold on) and I can't get along without you (hold on) 
Your the light, your the light, of my life (my life) 
There's no living without (your love) 
Hold on, to my love) 
Hold on, cause I'm nothin girl, and I can't get along without you, you 
Your the light of my life (my life) 
And I just can't live without you

Their star-light shone bright in the blackout 
 Like the beams of the usherette 
 But when the Big Bear bit deep after Yalta 
 There were those that came to forget 
 They went out west for the screening 
 And they carried a sharp-tooth comb 
 So get up! Go on! Grip that stand! 
 And press your hand to your heart 
 Big Mac is asking the questions 
 And this is only the start 
 Now Mac came on hot and noisy 
 In his search for old Uncle Joe 
 As he tracked him down to Tonsel Town 
 For Boise, Idaho 
 And the folks that queued up for Coogan 
 Now queued up for the end of a myth 
 To sit open-mouthed at the newsreel 
 The night that Chaplin took the fifth 
 And the offers packed up for so many 
 Dropped like a Wurlitzer into the pit 
 And what we got for the pain was more John Wayne 
 And anything else that they saw fit 
 Because when they needed to break resistance 
 And they could not go on using a fist 
 They took the cameras into the court-house 
 They circulated a list

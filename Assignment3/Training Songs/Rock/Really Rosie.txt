I'm really Rosie
And I'm Rosie real
You better believe me
I'm a great big deal
Believe me!
Believe me!
I'm a star from afar
Off the golden coast
Beat that drum!
Make that toast
To Rosie the most!
Believe me!
Believe me!
I can sing,
"Tea for two and two for tea"
I can act, 
"To be or not to be"
I can tap
Across the Tappan Zee
Hey can't you see
I'm terrific at everything
No star shines so bright as me
Rosie!
Believe me!
Believe me!

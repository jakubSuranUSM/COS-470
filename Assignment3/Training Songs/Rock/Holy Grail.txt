Woke up this morning, 
from the strangest dream 
I was in the biggest army, 
The world has ever seen 
We were marching as one, 
on the road to the holy grail 

Started out, 
Seeking fortune and glory 
It's a short song, but it's a 
Hell of a story, when you 
Spend your lifetime trying to get 
Your hands on the Holy Grail 

Bud have you heard of the Great Crusade? 
We ran into millions, and nobody got paid 
Yeah, we razed four corners of the globe, 
For the Holy Grail. 

All the locals scattered, 
They were hiding in the snow 
We were so far from home, 
So how were we to know, 
There'd be nothing left to plunder 
When we stumbled on the Holy Grail? 

We were foolish beings 
But we were dying like flies 
And those big black birds, 
they were circling in the sky, 
And you know what they say, yeah, 
Nobody deserves to die. 

Oh I, 
I've been searching for an easy way 
to escape the cold light of day 
I've been high, and I've been low 
But I've got nowhere else to go 
There's nowhere else to go 

I followed orders 
God knows where I'd be 
But I woke up alone, 
all my wounds were clean 
I'm still here 
I'm still a fool for the Holy Grail 
Oh yeah, 
I'm a fool for the Holy Grail

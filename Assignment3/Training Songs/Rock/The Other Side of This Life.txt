Would you like to know a secret, just between you and me.
I don't know where I'm goin' next, don't know where I'm gonna be. 
Refrain:
But that's another side to this life, I've been leadin',
But that's another side to this life. 
I think I'll go to Nashville, down to Tennessee,
The ten cent life I've been leading here,
Is gonna be the death of me. 
(Refrain) 
I don't know what I'm doing half the time,
I don't know where I'll go,
I think I'll get me a sailin' boat
and sail the Gulf of Mexico. 
(Refrain) 
My whole world's in an uproar, my whole world's upside down,
Don't know what I'm doin' here, but I'm always hangin' round. 
And that's another side to this life, I've been leadin',
And that's another side to this life. 
Would you like to know a secret, just between you and me.
Don't know where I'm goin' next, don't know where I'm gonna be. 
And that's the other side to this life, I've been leadin',
And that's the other side of this life.

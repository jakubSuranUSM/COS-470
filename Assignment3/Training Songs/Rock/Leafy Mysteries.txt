And these leafy mysteries
And the silence of the eve
And in the shady tree's I swing
& in the dappled orchards heat
Where I lie & wait
Wait for the breeze
To carry me

To a place I can lose myself
No time just somewhere else
With a face I can recognize
-I forget sometimes
That's always been here

And all these leafy mysteries
& the changing of the seas
& all the secrets of the tide
Just open up the world I find-
So small to me
When there's so much to see ? 
So much to be ?

day up & the grasses hiss
Get up! Like sweet lips they kiss
See now that you're part of it
I forget sometimes
That's always been here

And these leafy mysteries
Have always been & always will
& in the shady trees I swing
& in the dappled orchard's heat
-where I lie & wait
Wait for the breeze
To hunger me-
Wait for the trees
To breathe in to me

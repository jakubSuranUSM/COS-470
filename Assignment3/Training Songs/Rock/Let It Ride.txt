Lady spare a thought for me
Try to keep a man alive
Lady you get my sympathy
See you cut me in on your vibes
Slow down you're way too fast for
Keep it slow and let it ride

When you think you've found the reasons
Then the answers you can't hide
Slow your stride let it ride
With the angels are the thoughts you've been keeping
Slow your stride let it ride
With the angels are the thoughts you keep in mind
You're sweeter, sweet, sweet dance to me
Try to give this man a guide
Lady you get your victory
See you cut me in on your vibes

When you think you've found the reasons
Then the answers you can't hide
Slow your stride let it ride
With the angels are the thoughts that you've been keeping
Slow your stride let it ride
With the angels are the thoughts you keep in mind

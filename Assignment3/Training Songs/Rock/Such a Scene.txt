So eager to supply again
Keep giving now what you've got in
Your so sad and lonely
It's such a scene

I wanna tell you what I can't say
Is it always gonna be this way?
Everything is one way up
And that's all there is

I don't wanna say hey again
Chasing 'round the bed and then
Don't wanna lose what I can win
There's something in my head

You said I should let words go
But something inside won't let me show
The shapes that I see
In everybody's stares

Can feel that I'm not right
Am I holding on too tight?
Feelings that I'm feeling
When everybody stares

I don't wanna say hey again
Chasing round the bed and then
I don't wanna lose what I can win
There's something in my head
There's something in my head

So eager to supply again
Keep giving now what you've got in
Your so sad and lonely
It's such a scene

I wanna tell you what I can't say
Is it always gonna be this way?
Everything is one way up
And that's all there is

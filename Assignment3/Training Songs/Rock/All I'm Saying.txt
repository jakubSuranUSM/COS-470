I'm dreaming of you
You are free of all the pain
You kept from me
Your gaze is strong

I'm dreaming of you
With those black brown eyes
That seem to see
Right through me
Your wise half smile

I'm talking to no one
I'm talking to no one
No one but you
You who've moved on

I'm talking to no one
I'm talking to no one
No one but you
Now the raven has gone

Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Hard to trust, hard to trust to change
Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Hard to trust, hard to trust to change

I'm talking to no one
I'm talking to no one
No one but you
Now the raven has gone
I'm missing you
And your laugh that opened all the worlds to view
We never said goodbye
I'm dreaming of you
In a multiverse of meaning
Fractal shards
From a distant star

Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Ride a wave, ride a wave from our birth to the grave
Hard to trust, hard to trust to change

All I'm saying, all I'm saying, all I'm saying, all I'm saying
I'm missing you

Holding a seance
Speak with the dead tonight
All I'm saying, all I'm saying, all I'm saying
Holding a seance
Meet you in dreams tonight
All I'm saying, all I'm saying, all I'm saying, all I'm saying

I'm missing you and all the worlds you opened up to view
I love you
See you next time

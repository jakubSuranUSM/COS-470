It'd be a lie to say that I'm not gonna miss you
So don't say goodbye now till I've kissed you one more time
And held you like I did when you where mine
It'd be a lie to say I don't still love you
I won't be thinking of you girl I never try to call you one more time
Or try to find a way to change your mind
Ooh, you don't love me anymore oh baby
You don't love me any more baby please forgive me
But the wines gone to my head
And tomorrow I'll remember when you turned to me and said
It'd be a lie to say that I still love you

That I'm thinking of you boy or drive by to say hello sometime
Oh but now you're gone and all I have is five words on my mind
You don't love me anymore oh baby
You don't love me any more baby please forgive me
But the wines gone to my head
And tomorrow I'll remember when you turned to me and said
Ooh, you don't love me anymore oh baby
You don't love me any more I'll have to face it
Ooh, you don't love me anymore oh baby
You don't love me any more honey it hurts so bad
Ooh, you don't love me anymore oh baby
You don't love me any more my tears are falling

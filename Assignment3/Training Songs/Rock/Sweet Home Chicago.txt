Come on, now baby don't you want to go
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to that place I love, sweet home Chicago

Come on, now baby don't you want to go
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to the place I love, sweet home Chicago

One and one is two, two and two is four
I got my bags loaded and I'm headin' for the door
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to that place I love, sweet home Chicago

Now, two and two is four, four and four is eight
So won't you come on baby, don't you make me wait
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to that place I love, sweet home Chicago

Come on, baby don't you want to go
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to that place I love, sweet home Chicago

Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Come on, a-baby don't you want to go
Back to that place I love, sweet home Chicago

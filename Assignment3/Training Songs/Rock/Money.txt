Before I die I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand and I'll take it for a ride
You hit me yesterday because I made you cry
So before we die let me do something nice

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

And if I had a car I would trade in my car
If I had a gun I would trade in my gun
Honey we ran from the country rolling dust to the city
And now there's something to be done, there's something to be done
There's something to be done, there's something to be done

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

And I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

And I want to buy you something, but I don't have any money
No I don't have any money

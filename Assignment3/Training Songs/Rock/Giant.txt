Banks & Steelz in the building
Flash the camera
I'ma drop the hammer
Things done changed in hip-hop
Since they let Bobby out the slammer
Hip-hop started on the East coast
Then it moved West, now down to 'Bama
I'ma bring it back to New York
Roll those blunts and throw your hands up
Pass me the cup full of Goose
In the club with the juice
In the pub getting bent out
Then I'ma slide with a dime to my right
And head up to my penthouse
Oh, I'm not tryna take it slow
Working hard, caking dough
Open the 24, we striving for that gold

I'll stop for nothing
I will play this game
That's so easily started
Not so easily parted, aw

F*ck CNN, this is ghetto editorial
See me like milk and Oreos
Dipped inside the audio
Platinum plaques in my portfolio

I'll smack you silly
Back on up on this
Before you f*ck with this
You better wall jumping off the building
I'm cuttin' wrists
Oh, gotta heat up the show
Raise the thermometer
I'm gonna take full control
Hey, Paul, let 'em know

I'll stop for nothing
I will play this game
That's so easily started
Not so easily parted, aw

Novus ordo seclorum
E pluribus unum
They changing climates
And replacing humans
And fracking soils
While bulldozing forests
But they can't defeat us
They cannot destroy us
(Are we dreaming the same dream?)
(Of money, guns, and gasoline?)
And nicotine for the average teen
CFOs are after cream
GMOs extracting genes
With everyone on my TV

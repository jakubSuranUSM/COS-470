Baby baby baby baby baby
Come back baby I wanna play house with you

You may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool

Now come baby come
Come back baby come
Come back baby
I wanna play house with you

Now this is one thing baby
I want you to know
Well-a, come on back to me little girl
We can make like we did before (chorus)

Well now this is one thing baby
That I'm talkin' about
Well, come on back to me little girl
So we can play some house (chorus)

Well, listen to me baby
Try to understand
Well, I'd rather see you dead little girl
Than to be with another man (chorus)

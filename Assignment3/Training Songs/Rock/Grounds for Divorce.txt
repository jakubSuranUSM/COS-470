Mondays is for drinking to the seldom seen kid

I've been working on a cocktail called grounds for divorce
Polishing a compass that I hold in my sleeve
Down comes him on sticks but then he kicks like a horse

There's a tiny cigarette case
And the rest you can keep
And the rest you can keep
And the rest you can keep

There's a hole in my neighborhood
Down which of late I cannot help but fall
There's a hole in my neighborhood
Down which of late I cannot help but fall

Mondays is for drinking to the seldom seen kid

There's this whispering of jokers doing flesh by the pound
To a chorus of supposes from the little town whores
There'll be twisted karaoke at the Aniseed Lounge

And I'll bring you further roses
But it does you no good
And it does me no good
And it does you no good

There's a hole in my neighborhood
Down which of late I cannot help but fall
There's a hole in my neighborhood
Down which of late I cannot help but fall

There's a hole in my neighborhood
Down which of late I cannot help but fall

Someday we'll be drinking with the seldom seen kid

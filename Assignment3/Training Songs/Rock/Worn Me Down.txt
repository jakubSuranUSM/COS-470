Gone, she's gone.
How do you feel about it?
That's what I thought.
You're real torn up about it.
And I wish you the best
I could do without it
And I will because you've worn me down
Oh, I will because you've worn me down

Worn me down like a road.
I did everything you told.
Worn me down to my knees.
I did everything to please you.
But you can't stop thinking about her.
No, you can't stop thinking about her.

And you're wrong. You're wrong.
I'm not overreacting.
Something is off.
Why don't we ever believe ourselves?
And I, oh I, I feel it more for you.
And I will because you've worn me down.
And I will because you have worn me down.

Worn me down like a road.
I did everything you told.
Worn me down to my knees.
I did everything to please.
But you can't stop thinking about her.
No, you can't stop thinking about her.

She's so pretty. 
She's so damn right.
But I'm so tired of thinking about her, again, tonight.

Worn me down like a road.
I did everything you told.
Worn me down to my knees.
I did everything to please you.

Worn me down like a road.
I did everything you told me to do.
But you, you can't stop thinking about her.
No, you can't stop thinking about her.
No, you can't stop thinking about her.
No, you can't stop thinking of her.

It's late at night, and I'm feeling down
There are couples standing on the street
Sharing summer kisses and city sounds

So I step inside, for a glass of wine.
With a full glass and an empty heart,
I search for something to occupy my mind

But you are in my head, swimming forever in my head,
Tangled in my dreams, swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

Now its morning light, and it's cold outside,
Caught up in a distant dream I try
And think that you are by my side

So I leave my bed, and I try to dress,
Wondering why my mind plays tricks
And fools me into thinking you are there

But you're just in my head,
Swimming forever in my head,
Not lying in my bed, just swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember how we used to go

You are in my head, swimming forever in my head
Tangled in my dreams, swimming forever (swimming forever)
Swimming forever...

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)

In my most secure moments I still can't believe
I'm spending those moments with you
And the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared at those moments with you

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

In the songs I've been singing quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of the song would come true

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

You are of gracefulness
You are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of

Love, love, love

In the songs I've been singing quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of the song would come true

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

Love, love, love, love
Everything is love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Everything is love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Everything is love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

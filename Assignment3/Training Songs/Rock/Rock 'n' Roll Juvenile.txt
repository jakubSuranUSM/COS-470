I'm a rock 'n' roll juvenile
Watch me run a mile
When they play Beethoven
I'm a rock 'n' roll groovy mover
I only dig Beethoven
When he's been rolled over
(Roll over Beethoven)

I'm a rock 'n' roll holy roller
I love to sing 'bout Jesus
'Cos he saved my soul-a
I'm a rock 'n' rolling believer
Roll a rock at the Devil
He's just a deceiver
(Roll the rock)

Look at me I'm your rock 'n' roll man
Been a rock 'n' roll fan since it began
Look at me follow me if you care
I've found a rock 'n' roll heaven
I'll take you there

Look at me here I am
Get a rock 'n' roll band
I am a rock 'n' roll frontman
Love a solo guitar
It could take you far-take it-take it away

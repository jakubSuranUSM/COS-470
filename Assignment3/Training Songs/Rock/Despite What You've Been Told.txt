Well, I guess by the blood stain of your lips
And the wander of your fingertips
I should prove true to my emptiness
And stay here

Well, I'm just a kid of ill repute
But the skin I wear is my only suit
And you, you're just a substitute
For the one that I hold dear

You know, you could be anyone
God forgive my tasteless tongue
I never should have been set free

I claw my eyes, I skin my face
Beg somehow to be replaced
That's how we deal with boys like me

Well, I guess for this world so sick with loss
And your service is so free of cost
I should climb down off my rugged cross
And lay with you

But you know, by now it's half past late
And I only came here for escape
You you're just my next mistake
Like me to you

You know, you could be anyone
God forgive your unborn sons
I hope they don't end up like me

I drag my mind through streets of shame
Lay myself forgive the game
That's how we deal with boys like me

But despite what you've been told
I once had a soul
Left somewhere behind
A former friend of mine

And I hate to speak so free
But you mean nothing to me
So if the street lights they shine bright
I?ll get home tonight

I guess by the dim light in your eyes
And that to you all things come as a surprise
I should set the steel trap of your thighs
And dive right in

But to you I'm just a confused child
Insecure or in denial
Go raise your robes, go have your trial
I?ll let you win

You know, I could be anyone
God forgive what I should've done
A thoughts enough to guilty be

Yes, I guess I made this bed
But I?ll take the sidewalk instead
That's how we deal with boys like me

But despite what you've been told
I once had a soul
Left somewhere behind
A former friend of mine

And I hate to sound so true
But I mean nothing to you
So, if the street lights they shine bright
I?ll be home tonight

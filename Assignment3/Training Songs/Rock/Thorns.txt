Thorns
Just keep walking away from it all 
I don't have a plan
For calling you back ever at all 
Thorns
Keep walking away from it all
'Cause I shouldn't have to tell you 
Every time I see you
You know I don't want you around 
And I shouldn't have to tell you 
Every time I see you
I'm getting sick of putting you down
Thorns
You keep sticking around in my side 
I just wanna know when you will go 
Once you arrive
Thorns
Keep sticking around in my side
Keep hanging around
And I'll keep walking away
'Cause I shouldn't have to tell you 
Every time I see you
You know I don't want you around 
And I shouldn't have to tell you 
Every time I see you
I'm getting sick of putting you down
Thorns
Keep walking away from it all 
Thorns
Keep walking away
Ain't no talking to 
No getting rid of you
Once you've got your foot in the door
Keep hanging around 
I'II keep walking away 
Thorns

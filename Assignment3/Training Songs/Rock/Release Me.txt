Na na nah

I can still feel your teethmarks in my neck your footprints on my back
And the gris gris you sprinkled in my bed is starting to make me crack

I can still hear your twang ringing in my ears, your perfume I still smell
You bought it way down below the mason dixon line
Like your mother you're a southern belle

I said release me, but please don't let me know
I said release me, but please don't let me go

Ah my blood's still boiling, like a snake you come coiling
Ready to strike

When the night comes down I get a big black fear,
Like the clouds hanging up above
I don't want you to possess me, but that's how it is
I ain't nothin' but your slave of love.

I said release me, but please don't let me know
Release me, but please don't let me oh oh oh

Release me, but please don't let me know
Release me, but please don't let me go

Release me release me baby, release me release me yeah

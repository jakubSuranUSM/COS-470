I like to eat bananas
'Cos they got no bones
I like marijuana
'Cos it gets me stoned

Put a seed into the ground
Wait for the sun to come around
Nurture it with love and care
Give it sun and rain and air

There, oh there
There, oh
You gotta let it grow
Let it grow

Come on, wait for it to sprout
Then you get your Rizlas out

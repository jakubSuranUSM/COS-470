We do believe it ends right here
The orchestration and the dream is clear
Shuttle departs and they're all there
Everyone's cracking up but we don't care
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestrareal
Whisper the cymbals ride on in
Though this time we'll trade the strings for old 110
Headphones will assure position when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestrareal
I don't believe the way this feels
Slight alterations leave enraptured ears
Headphones will insure possessions when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestrareal

Don't you know we're sick and tired of talking
Don't you know the gap has grown too wide
You think you know the answers to all our problems
But you only ever see one side

Glory to the boys that beat the system
Glory to the boys that live to die
Even tho' the odds are stacked against us
Glory to the boys, glory to the boys
You'll never ever stop us when we try

Glory boys are all around you
Doesn't matter where we hide
We can always breed new winners
Fighting fair is not our style

Now you know we're really up against it (now you know)
Condemn us all you like we're here to stay
Your new laws aren't printed in our rule book (rule book)
Glory boys won't go away

Glory to the boys that beat the system
Glory to the boys that live to die
Even tho' the odds are stacked against us
You'll never ever stop us when you try

As we try, god knows why, you know why

(Glory to the boys)
Glory boys are all around you (glory to the boys)
Glory boys are all around you (glory to the boys)
Glory boys are all around you (glory to the boys)
Glory boys (glory boys)
Glory boys (glory boys)
Glory boys (glory boys)
Glory boys

When the moon rises, the dogs will howl
Look out of your window, I'll be on the prowl
I'm not usually a gambling man
But oh I just wanna hold up my hands

And say I'm taking a chance on you love
Whoa I'm taking a chance on you love

I'm not superstitious and I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck, please, don't worry me
Cause when I look in the mirror, here's the future I see

I'm taking a chance on you love
Whoa, I'm taking a chance on you love

Place your bets, better yet
Don't forget, what I said
Roll the dice, spin the wheel
Always remember, you've got to keep it real

Don't believe in voodoo, black magic was never my style
But I believe you do, and it won't take much time
To gather the portions that weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean has a secret to tell

But anyway I'm taking a chance on you love
Whoa I'm taking a chance on you love
Whoa I'm taking a chance on you love

The mother of the outlaw thinks about the time he had the mumps
And she's really very sorry
And she hopes this has nothing to do
With the way she brought him up
And the outlaw he lies wounded as the doctor gives the police sergeant a
nod
And the last words he was saying
Something about I do believe in God

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race

And the sister of the prostitute
She's trying to find the right way to love
Cause when it gets down to make a living
These days it's pretty hard for a girl to get it up
And the romance on her street corner
He rides around in Eldorado fame
And lately she's been thinking
That what she's been seeing in the movies just ain't the same

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race

And the legless Vietnam survivor
He's trying to find a job or a wife
Cause he can't find peace with honor
As he gets conditioned to his wheelchair life
And the killers still run the country
And they count their money
With their bloodstained hands
And lately I've been thinking
Maybe it s time we really took a stand

And who divides the oceans
When a generation's lost its place
And who sets the motion
Of the human race

I've never seen this kind of love
The kind that won't wash away
And then leave you in the dark
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you

I've never kissed a sweeter mouth
I've never been swept away
It's what dreams are made up of
Don't you know I could not survive
Without you in my life
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ya ya
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ya ya
Yeah yeah yeah

I've never seen this kind of love
The kind that won't slip away
Yes I'm soaring through your heart
Don't you know I could not survive
Without you in my life
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ya ya
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ya ya
Yeah yeah yeah

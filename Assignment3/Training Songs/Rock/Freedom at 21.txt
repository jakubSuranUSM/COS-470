(Yeah)
Cut off the balls of my feet
Made me walk on salt
Take me down to the police
Charge me with assault
Smile on her face
She does what she wants to me

That's right
She don't care what kind of wounds she's inflicted on me
She don't care what color bruises that she's leavin' on me
'Cause she's got freedom in the 21st century
(Alright)

(Listen)
Two black gadgets in her hands
All she thinks about
No responsibility no guilt or morals
Cloud her judgement
Smile on her face
She does what she damn well please

(Right)
And she don't care about the things people used to do
And she don't care that what she does has an effect on you
She's got freedom in the 21st century

Cut off the balls of my feet (Cut off the balls of my feet)
Make me walk on salt (Make me walk on salt)
Take me down to the police (Take me down to the police)

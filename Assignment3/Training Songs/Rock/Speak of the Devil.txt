Speak of the devil
The devil appears
Waiting for someone
Been waiting for years
And it's alright now
Yeah I'm alright now

Watching her walking
Like watching a flame
Trying to forget her 
Don't mention her name 
And I'm alright now 
Yeah I'm alright now 

Lonely days without her 
Nights that would not end
As long as I don't think about her 
I can still pretend
It's alright

Yeah
Speak of the devil 
The devil appears 
Been waiting for someone
Lonely for years 
But I'm alright now 
Yeah I'm alright now 
It's alright
It's alright

Speak of the devil 
Speak of the devil
Speak of the devil

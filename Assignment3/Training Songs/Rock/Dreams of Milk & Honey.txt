Sitting in a blue room, staring at the wall
Trying to get into anything at all
Cigarettes taste funny as I sink into my bed
Dreams of milk and honey are running through my head

Chorus

Look at me, Lord
Listen and see

Look at me, Lord
Listen and see

Girl, you say you love but the truth is in your eyes
Your heart for me is empty and your lips are gilded lies
And it seems I'm in a blue room, spending all my time
Trying so to catch you while you're running through my mind

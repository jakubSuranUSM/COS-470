Get in your car and go 
Dependin' on how you feel 
Turn up your radio 
DJ says the love is real 
He thinks it's the latest sensation 
And you just keep changin' the station 
(believe me baby) Do you know what love is about 
Heard it on your stereo 
Everybody does without 
Brokenhearted comic book hero 
Don't worry your pretty little head now honey 
It's only top twenty 
 
[CHORUS:] 
Whoah oh oh 
Radio girl 
Radio girl 
Livin' for that three minute song 
Welcome to the real world 
Transistor sister 
That's right mister 
The Radio Girl 
 
And everybody's waiting for 
Fairy godmother to show 
You ain't holdin' your breath anymore 
Turn up the radio 
Here's a song just came in from left field 
And you're goin' right through the windshield 
 
REPEAT [CHORUS:]  
They want to know 
What's wrong with you 
They want you to 
Come out and play 
You're gonna push in all the buttons 
Blow them all away 
They got their whole lives to tell you 
How much stuff they can sell you 
 
REPEAT [CHORUS:]

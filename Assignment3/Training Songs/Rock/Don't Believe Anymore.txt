I had no idea how much I need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating 
When I think my guess was wrong
But I think I'll get alone
she's just a girl 
She's a bomb

Athena 
All I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled 
And she's the reason 
Just one word from her 
And my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll get along
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
She's a bomb 
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena
My heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath 
I felt like one of those flattened ants
You find on a crazy path 
I'd have stopped myself to give her time
She didn't need to ask 
Was I a suicidal psychopath 
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
She's just a girl 
She's a bomb
Consumed
There was a beautiful white horse
I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe 
Livin' in his rib cage

I felt like a pickled priest
Who was being flambed
You've got me requisitioned blondie
She's just a girl
She's a bomb
I'm happy 
She's a bomb
I'm ecstatic 
Just a girl, just a girl 
Just a girl, just a girl 
Just a girl, just a girl 
Just a girl

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the mem'ry claimed
How long would children remain 
How long could children remain

Athena
You picked me up by my lapels 
And screamed

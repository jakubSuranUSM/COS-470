One hundred and fifteen
You are seventeen
Itchy trigger 
Venomous
You growing longer
You growing stronger
So she'd your skin, baby
Now she'd this

Come on over now
Come on over baby
You tell me it's holy holy 
I don't know what that is, come on over now
Let's call it the fullness of time 
I don't know what that is, come on over now

Hey holy, console me 
Some power, controls me
Remorse it, I force 
It can't free it, so be it

I'm speaking in tongues 
Handling you 
I got religion now look at it
The days grow longer
As we grow stronger
So she'd your skin baby let it rip

Come on over now
Come on over baby
You tell me it's holy holy 
I don't know what that is, come on over now
Let's call it the fullness of time 
I don't know what that is, come on over now

Hey holy, console me 
Some power, controls me
Remorse it, I force 
Don't free it, just be it
Just be it, just be it

I've been lookin' to find you
But it's a little too late too soon
And I looking out and far
Spirits are your doom
In you
In you

I got the hangman
I got Milagro
I got the celebration too
The flesh is strong
My spirit's stronger
So shed your skin
Baby let it through

Come on over now
Come on over baby
You tell me it's holy holy 
I don't know what that is, come on over now
You wanna call it the fullness of time 
I don't know what that is, come on over now

Hey holy, console me 
Some power, controls me
Remorse it, I force 
It can't free it, so be it

Hey holy, console me 
Some power, controls me
Come on over baby

I knew a girl and her name was Judy
She used to do things I thought were rude
But I never said anything to her face
'Cause my friends thought she'd kick my arse all over the place

Used to think she was kinda cool
(Kind of cool)
Saw her walking all around the school
(Around the school)
All the older boys would stop and turn their heads
All the older girls wished that she was dead

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

Now me and Judy we're the best of pals
(Best of pals)
She took me dancing to the early hours
(The early hours)
And she showed me things I've never seen
Mum always asked me where I'd been when I'm with

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

When you go home at night
Are you still looking for a fight?
You know you're mum is not that mean?
But still you want to rip out her spleen

Judy, what you gonna do
When you're older and no one wants to know ya?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you

What's in your head?

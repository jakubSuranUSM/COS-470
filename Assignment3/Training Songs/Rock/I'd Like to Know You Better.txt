I'd like to know you better
There's so much about you I can see
There's a love as good as gold in you
I can feel it when I'm holding you
I want to be your friend, your lover

I'd like to know you better
Being with you feels so good to me
In a world of distraught humanity
You have brought me to my sanity

How lucky we are
We seem to get along so well
Whether or not we'll stay that way
It's much too early to tell

But I'd like to know you better
Though I already feel as if I do
Meeting you has been so good for me
And if only temporarily
I want to be your friend, your lover

Yes, I'd like to know you better

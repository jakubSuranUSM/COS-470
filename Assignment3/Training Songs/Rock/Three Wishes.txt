So frightened, so worried
So cold and it's raining
My naive illusions
Distraught by confusion
You're laughing, I'm crying
Outside it's still raining
Graveyard of soldiers
No flowers on their graves

So helpless and lonely
Outside it's still raining
To afraid to ask why
No questions are made
You're laughing, I'm crying
I feel like I'm dying
My naive illusions
Distraught by confusion

If I had three wishes
I'd wish for three more
But dreams are for lovers
And love is so precious
You're laughing, I'm crying
I feel like I'm dying
My naive illusions
Distraught by confusion

If I had three wishes
If I had three wishes
If I had three wishes

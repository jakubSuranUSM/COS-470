Halos and helicopters
Everything is over my head
Thought they were coming to save me, 
But they just left me here for dead

I hopped in an ambulance
Caught a ride back to my old hometown
Got out at four corners,
And watched the crowd gather 'round

For the homecoming parade
Where they called me a hero 
And asked me why i've changed
At the homecoming parade
They're killing off their favorite sons

Angels and astronauts
Everyone is looking down at me
I thought they were coming to help
But they're just falling out of the sky

There's a laugh track, 
But no one's smiling
Everyone is keeping their head down.
No one wants to make a scene 
In this small minded town
Where all the mothers drink 'til they drown

At the homecoming parade
Where they call you a hero 
And then spike the lemonade
At the homecoming parade
They're killing off their favorite sons
And all their daughters are on the run

Heretics and hometown heroes
We all get treated the same
They line us up to praise us
'Til they turn the tv cameras off

Then they line us up and interview us
Then they line us up and accuse us
Then they line us up and shoot us

At the homecoming parade
Where they call you a hero 
As they tie you to the stake
At the homecoming parade
They're killing off their favorite sons
They've got all their daughters on the run
They've been killing off 
Their favorite sons for years
All their daughters 
Are picking up their guns 
And getting out of here.

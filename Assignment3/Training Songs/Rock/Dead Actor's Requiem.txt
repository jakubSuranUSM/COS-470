ItÂ´s time to leave the stage
In this theatre of pain
To let go of all the rage
When all scenes have been played

The final act concluded
The curtain falls for one last time
And outside the crowed still cheers
There'll be no encore this time

Weep away all your tears my friend
We will meet again someday
But this time, there'll be an end
To this play I called my life

Leaving the stage, smash the mask
An actor dead, a human being
On the ground, a final gasp
The doors are opened wide

The air perforated by the rain
Outsied is conquered silently
By a soul who's free of pain
The actor left the stage

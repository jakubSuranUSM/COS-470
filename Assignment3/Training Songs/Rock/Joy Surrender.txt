I was born to start a revolution
It would be my contribution 
To a worldwide resurrection 
I was born to start a million fires 
The joy of men's desires 
Was laid in my hand 

But I was born a weak and worried thinker 
With an eagerness to know myself 
That throws it all away 

'Cause all I can think of is 
Love and Saturday 
And how the golden road can seize to glare 
Oh, man 
What if I just don't gave a damn? 
How wonderful 
But after all the worst can't be that bad 
Oh, man 
What if I knew how to say 
"Stop 
No, let go"? 

Oh, the angelheaded demon's-tongue 
Who thought he knew 
Why some mirrors crack so easily 
Oh, now he ain't got a clue 

And every now and then 
It seems to me it's come to this 
That promises and prophecies 
Was all I had to give 

'Cause all I can think of is 
Love and Saturday 
And how the golden road can seize to glare 
Oh, man 
What if I just don't gave a damn? 
How wonderful 
Hut after all the worst can't be that bad 
Oh, man 
What if I knew how to say 
"Stop 
No, let go"? 

Oh, love 
The worst can't be that bad 
Oh, love 
Saturday, and how the golden road can seize to glare 
Oh, man 
What if I just don't gave a damn? 
How wonderful 
But after all the worst can't be that bad 
Oh, man 
Seems like a joy surrender 
Love

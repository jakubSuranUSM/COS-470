Picked a girl up at the trainstop where I live
Took a drive along the beach by the ocean
Talk about the dreams we had while we were growing old
Wrote a poem on the back of your shoulder 

Chorus 

Tell me your name, tell me your story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit 

I will start again 

Give the dog a bone to chew as I drive around
Wrote this song last night while I was sober 

Chorus 

Tell me your name, tell me a story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit 

And I kept on driving
I will start again 

Chorus 

Tell me your name, tell me a story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit

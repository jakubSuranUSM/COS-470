We strolled the lane together
Laughed at the rain together,
Sang love's refrain together
And we'd both pretend it would never end
But one day we cried together
Cast love aside together
You're gone from me,
But in my memory
We always will be together.

Oh darlin' the memory
Of all the happy moments we shared together
Will always remain in my heart
The picnics at the park,
The boat rides on the lake,
The way we danced all night,
The warmth of your kiss,
The way you held me tight
Are all part of a tender love
I'll never, never forget.

You're gone from me
But in my memory,
Darlin', wherever you are,
We'll always be, together.

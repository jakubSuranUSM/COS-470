Here I stand
Going through the motions with the mic in my hand
Playing hard to get, pretending like I understand
Just a fool getting by
Just a fool doing alright

Out getting loaded, only way away from the pain I guess?
Holding me so tightly will it ever let me rest?
Memorize the lines and try to work within the frame
Busting out the glass, bloody knuckles broke the pain

Just a fool getting by
Just a fool doing alright
Just a fool getting by
Just a fool doing alright
Just a fool, just a fool

Out on the street
Bleeding in the gutter, busting out the teeth
Spoke my mind, wound up on the wrong side of the fence
Made another promise that should have never left my lips
Now I'm wasting away behind the bars of this country cage
Nowhere else to turn and try to quiet down my rage
Thinking about the ones who did just what they always said
Trying to find the strength it takes to become one of them
Working for the man and dreaming of the day
That I'm throwing down the hammer and marching my own way

Just a fool getting by
Just a fool doing alright
Just a fool getting by
Just a fool doing alright
And dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight
Just a fool, just a fool
Just a fool, just a fool

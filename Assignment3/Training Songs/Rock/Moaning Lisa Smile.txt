Clinging to love, escape a father and mother
She offers some other way out of the hole
She's overachieving, chasing her dreams
And coming down slowly, yeah, it's out of control

(Ah) Scrap the blues, if the blues don't work
Flash your teeth, though the inside hurts
(Ah) it's time to glow, lose your way
To make you feel better just because you feel worse

All of the books and all in a boat and
Nowhere to run, God, this is out of control
You wait for something to undo these feelings
Waiting and waiting but it's out of control

(Ah) Scrap the blues, if the blues don't work
Flash your teeth, though the inside hurts
(Ah) it's time to glow, lose your way
To make you feel better just because you feel worse

(Ah)
(Ah)
It never is enough
No, it never is enough
It never is enough
No, it never is enough

So you're tired but you're alive
So open up your eyes
And you can get some sleep when you are dead
Kill the clock inside your head
Bring your normalcy to the edge
And watch it drown in new horizons
New horizons

You said I'd only have to wait until I died
And that's no time
How did we come to think that this was funny
Cheering and laughing at the dying
While we've been riding the light in you

Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die
(New horizons)
There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)

Sin with a conquest
Life floods in with a new quest
Here's a voice for the voiceless
And a song for the soulless
Life floods in

Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die
(New horizons)
There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)

When the times keep going wrong and we go right
When the times keep going wrong and we go right

Wait
You said I'd only have to wait until I die
(New horizons)
There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)
Wait until I fly
(New horizons)

Wait until I fly
(New horizons)
There is no such thing as time
Inside this moment no sun rising
Wait until I fly

When the times keep going wrong and we go right
We go right

You walked in my life
But made me smile
How could I have known
Hunger locked in time
We can start a fire,
But we can't control the flame
And I just can't wait to feel the heat again
In the middle of the night

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
I said too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Well it just seems like yesterday
I was running alone
And I turn my back home love
But baby I wasn't wrong
Do I miss your touch 
Or tell myself on the line
Then I can't get enough 
When I'm lying by your side

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
I said too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I gotta burn his heart baby

Do I miss your touch 
Or tell myself a lie
And I can't get enough 
When I'm lying by your side
In the middle of the night

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
I said too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I gotta burn it hard baby

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
But I smoke as fire baby
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me hey

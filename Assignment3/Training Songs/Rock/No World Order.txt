Let me tell you 'bout the new world order
 Not the kind to make you run for the border
 It's a new religion wrapped in a revolution
 With a proven solution for your mental pollution
 Don't let no one tell you that God ain't got a sense of humor
 Someone said he's pissed off, but that was just a rumor
 I know he's laughin' when the preacher starts to scream about
 How trippin' is evil, and sex is unclean
 Cars and gold bars and chains and diamond rings
 These are the symbols, we want the real things
 Peace in the soul and a natural insight
 Things that please the mind and make the body feel right
 Nature wants your life to go on long and on strong
 To have children and show them where you went wrong
 So if your life style leads you into hell or into prison
 Wake up and listen, this is what you're missing
 Free will, we can't seem to get our fill
 We are beggars, we are choosers drunk on a lack of power
 I believe in understanding, I've got to know where we're landing
 I'm takin' my survey now, hands up if you're with me
 Do you want different choices? Can't hear the quiet voices
 Got to dim all the lights, turn down the volume
 Put on a little more forgiveness, who's gonna be my witness?
 If we must endure this trial, someone is bound to touch us
 Do you want more sex, more comforting
 A little more foreplay and afterglow, let my people go
 Everybody wants peace on the earth, children sheltering
 Calling every man, every woman
 We're gonna take control of our own bodies
 Peace breaks out in the battle of the sexes
 We start to learn what the other one expects is
 We stay away from what the other one rejects is
 And have respect for individual perspectives
 We're gonna break out of this cycle of dependency
 And liberate each other from a hopeless life of drudgery
 And face up to the truth as we dispel all of this secrecy
 And simplify the situation when we learn to speak plainly
 We're gonna take control of the machinery
 Bad little actors that chew up the scenery
 Job number one is gonna be findin' a way
 That we can rave all night and meditate all day
 Mankind's strugglin' hard to see the light
 To hear the voice of the spirit in the night
 To lay down his heavy burden and pick up his soul power
 And build a heaven on earth hour by hour by hour
 Child protection, more careful mate selection
 Everyone wants to be wanted by a natural father and mother
 Lookin' for a sense of wonder, don't let your faith go under
 This is a beautiful world, if we could only give up fighting
 The answer is surrender, every race, every gender
 Beat our swords into plowshares on the anvil of a pure heart
 We gotta have honest answers and the courage to take our chances
 Opportunity's knockin' loud, give me your attention

I just want to sit here doing nothing
Everybody's talking saying nothing
Maybe I should move on somewhere else
Give up trying to be like someone else

Everybody's going crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

Quite content to let the world pass by
Living every moment with closed eyes
Draw the curtains tell the stars good night
Oh the dreams that wait for me tonight

This whole world's crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

I just want to sit here doing nothing
Everybody's talking saying nothing
Maybe I should move on somewhere else
Give up trying to be like someone else

Everybody's going crazy
I don't care
I'm so lazy

I think I'll go to sleep

Dear friend
As I write this letter
I hope you are okay
There's something on my mind today
I thought you'd like to hear
Eighteen Eighty Eight
Twelve Twenty Third
He gave her his ear
"Guard this object carefully"
And then he disappeared

Razor in his right hand
He sliced through his left ear
Started high at the back
Hacking downwards fast
Left the upper ear attached
An ugly fleshy flap

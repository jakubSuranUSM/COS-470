Don't ask me how, but guess who hit the big time
Don't look now but guess whose back in town
It's so easy don't even have to try
You're the winner you can take the prize

It's a dream come true which one will it be
It's a dream come true we'll just wait and see

Only the lucky one's get to steal the show
Only the lucky one's really get to know
Only the lucky, Only the lucky one's get Lucky

Same old story something never change
With a beautiful girl everything's rearranged
Your whole life it comes to you for free
You wear it well it comes so naturally

It's a dream come true which one will it be
It's a dream come true we'll just wait and see

Only the lucky one's get to steal the show
Only the lucky one's really get to know
Only the lucky, Only the lucky one's

Don't ask me how, but guess who hit the big time
Don't look now but guess whose back in town
It comes so easy don't even have to try
You're the winner you can take the prize

Lucky ones
Only the lucky one's really get to know
Only the lucky, Only the lucky one's
Oh lucky

All designed for my downfall
Fortified but for how long
Everything I want nothing I need
Poverty is hard wealth's a disease
In control I'm not in control
Stranglehold
Nobody know's the trouble I'm in
Happiness is wafer thin
I'm in love until I'm not
Less content the more I've got
Play too much to want to stop
All that's good I've given up
Takes awhile to realize
Mischeif does what love defies
In control, I'm not in control
Swallowed whole

If I could read you like a book
If I could read your second look
If I could be the one you love
The one you're thinking of

I wouldn't need these eyes
I wouldn't need to see
I wouldn't need to hear your voice
Say you love me

If I could stay here for a while
If I could hang on to your smile
If I could turn your loving ways
Upon my lonely days

I wouldn't need these eyes
I wouldn't need to see
I wouldn't need to hear your voice
Say you love me
Say you love me
 
 I tried so hard to find
The reason you came my way
And now I can't believe my eyes
Are you here to stay?

If all the world came falling down
And lay in pieces on the ground
With only darkness from above
If I could touch your love

I wouldn't need these eyes
I wouldn't need to see
I wouldn't need to hear your voice
Say you love me
Say you love me

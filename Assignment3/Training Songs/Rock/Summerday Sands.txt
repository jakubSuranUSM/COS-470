I once met a girl
With the life in her hands
And we lay together
On the summerday sands

I gave her my raincoat
And told, "Lady, be good"
And we made truth together
Where no one else would

I smiled through her fingers
And ran the dust through her hands
The hour-glass of reason
On the summerday sands

We sat as the sea caught fire
I waited as the flames grew higher
In her eyes, in her eyes

We watched the eagle born
Wings clipped, tail, feathers shorn
But we saw him rise
Over summerday sands

Came the ten-o'clock curfew
She said, "I must start my car
I'm staying with someone
I met last night in a bar"

I called from my wave top
"At least, tell me your name"
She smiled from her wheel spin
And said, "It's all the same"

I thought for a minute
Jumped back on dry land
Left one set of footprints
On the summerday sands

I once met a girl
With the life in her hands
And we lied together
On the summerday sands

On the summerday sands
On the summerday sands
On the summerday sands
On the summerday sands

You believe it (you better)
I got their number
Classic camcorder
I saw everything
Dinner plate specials
The shapes of cucumber
I'm going to the papers
I am going to sing
In the cool, cool night
And in the middle of the day
I'm watching my back
I'm waiting my visitation

From the men in black
Are they grey or is it my own nation?
Its been a good year
Its been a good summer
I wait for the door or that phone to ring
Our little race
I don't want to fall
So just in case
I made you a copy
And I put it in the mail
You believe it
I got their number
Classic camcorder
I saw everything

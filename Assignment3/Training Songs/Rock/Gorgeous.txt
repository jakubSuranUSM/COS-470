In this town where I'm from
There's not a lot of things going on
You've got to use a little imagination
To get along

So you go to a bar
And you talk to your friends
About girls and cars
And even though you're bored
They'll only go this far

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

You hear a song, you spin around
And you laugh as your feet hit the ground
You feel like a celebration
This time around

So you go to a bar
And you talk to your friends
About girls and cars
And even though you're bored
They'll only go this far

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

You need a lover, oh yes you do
You need a lover, nothing else is true
You need a lover, I need you
You need a lover
You'd make the dead dance too

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

I need you, you need me
I need you, yes it's true, it's true

You're so gorgeous, baby
You're so gorgeous, save me
You're so gorgeous, baby
Yes you are

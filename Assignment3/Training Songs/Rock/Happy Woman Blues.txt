Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
Goin' down south with the New York City blues

Gotta hit the road before I blow a fuse
I might buy me a Cadillac or a Chevrolet
I don't care what model as long as it takes me away

I've been hiding my heart in a trunk
Can you come see me when my ship has sunk
You can give me lovin', that I can't refuse
And love is the one thing that's sure to cure my blues
Goin' down the road with a heave heart

Tryin' to find lightness in the dark
Tryin' to live my life, tryin' to get satisfied
My mind is in the city but my heart is in the countryside

Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused

Well you know how it goes when you [help up your bitch while it's] hot
I was out on the beach, down in grease, I was in for some fun
And there she was
Looking so fine, this stark lookin' woman just had to be mine
She gave me this drink, it just made my head spin instantly
Then she told me she lived in the hills with the king of gypsies
Said I was brave
Making the pass, but I only knew that I needed her fast
Chorus:
Can't stop, nowhere to run - I'm heading for a storm, no way left to turn
Can't stop, nowhere to run - I'm heading for a storm, no way left to turn
We made love, she's so hot, fell asleep, I woke up, it was night
She was gone, I heard voices around me and I realized - out in the dark
They're waiting for me, I'm starting to run but they're closing on me
(chorus)
(Solo)
(chorus)
Can't stop, nowhere to run - I'm heading for a storm
Can't stop, nowhere to run - I'm heading for a storm
Can't stop, nowhere to run - yeah, heading for a storm... (to fade)

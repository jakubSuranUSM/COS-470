Yeah, mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy, all night long
Alright, hehee, huhu, alright

Mm, see the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
Alright, hehee, huhu, alright

Mm, tell your mamma, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back to Arkansas
Huhu hey, honey you don't do right
I say you don't do right
Mmm, alright

See the girl with the red dress on
She'll do the Boogie Woogie all night long
Alright, hehe, huhu, alright

Well, tell me what I say (what'd I say)
Tell me what I say right now (what'd I say)
Honey, what I say (what'd I say)
Baby what I say right now (what'd I say)
Tell me what I say
Tell me what I say

And I wanna know (I wanna know)
I wanna know right now (I wanna know)
I gotta know (I wanna know)
Baby, I wanna know right now (I wanna know)
Baby, I wanna know
Baby, I wanna know
(What'd I say, what'd I say, what'd I say)

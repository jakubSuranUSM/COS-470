If you want me I'll be at your door
And if you need me I'll be by your side
'cause every day is a long winding road
And I'll always be here don't you know

I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I always try, I wonder why, I wonder why

[Chorus]
Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know

Well, if you've got no-one to give your heart to
And if you've searched and you can't find the truth
When they tell you this time to let go
Well, I'll always be here - don't you know

I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why

[Chorus]

Oh, nobody told me bout the wind and the trees
And the summer breeze and
You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
And the light is slipping through
And I've seen the sun catching your eye
Like the moon in the sky

Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
And though you've never asked me to believe its true

I've loved you from the start
Oh I've got to find a way to mend today
These wings that need to fly
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know

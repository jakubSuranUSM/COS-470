I can see it on the road ahead
Running hard I'm here
But I could be there instead
Many houses with the lights on
Silhouettes behind the shades
Beside fires
I'm sure that I saw you in one
I loved you but
That was way back then
Now I'm alone outside
I face the wind
The rain washes me thin

Knocked me down and I got back up
I got myself back in the race again
Knock me down and I'll get back up
And I'll get myself
Back in the race again

Race through the shadows
Race against stone
The sunken city
I thought was my own
Might be in a brave new world
But it's not my home
Roll over fall in
'My God', I screamed
They might catch them
They won't catch me
I'm out here clean
I'm free, I'm free

Knocked me down and I got back up
And I got myself
Back in the race again
Knock me down and I'll get back up
And I'll get myself
Back in the race again

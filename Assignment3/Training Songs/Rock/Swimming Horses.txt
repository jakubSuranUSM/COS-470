Falling in your, falling in your arms 
Fish on a line, learns to live on dry land 
Thrown back again to drown 
Kinder with poison 

Than pushed down a well - or a face burnt to hell 
Feel the cruel stones breaking her bones 
Dead before born 
Words fall in ruins - but no sound 

She's dying of your shame - she maimed by your paw 
He gives birth to swimming horses 

Fish on a line, walking on dry land
But, back in the water to drown we drown
Floating in sky 

He gives birth to swimming horses 
Take a ride on the tide with the assassin at your side
The weightlessness under water -- forgets in slow motion
And washes pointless tortures 

He gives birth to swimming horses 
Floating in sky like fishes can fly through your arms

Hand me down my favourite coat
Show what you're made of, surprise us both
Fly in the night, slow down town
Brake too fast, bring us round, bring us round

And our finest days have come
Summer nights go on so long
So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent

I can see you with my eyes closed
You're the last one standing
Lean and hungry with a fire in your eyes
I'll play catch up, you can show me where it's at

I'll go along with anything that you want to do
Everyday I'm making ground
So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent

And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house
I'll be the last one standing
If you want you can get there

Night vision and I find your white doves
Landing in your treasure towers
And I promise that I won't look back
Everyday I'm making ground

So high I might as well be gone
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house

I'll be the last one standing
And you are magnificent
And I can see you with my eyes closed
When you're walking into my house

I'll be the last one standing

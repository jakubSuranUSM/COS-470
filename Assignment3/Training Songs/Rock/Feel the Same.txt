True, I've been lost just for waiting on your smile.
True, I've been there, saw your treason fantasise.
Cool black goat morning. Yes, it's true that angels sigh.
Don't you know as blue morning passes over stranger's eyes.
I'm always calling out your name. You'll never change,
Or feel the same.

Mr. Bowtie Man, I never want to put you down. 
Settle down, settle, settle down, settle down.

I'm always calling out you name.You'll never change,
Or feel the same.

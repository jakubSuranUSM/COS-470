Tonight tonight, I feel just fine
Out on the streets and right out of my mind
And I know everything that a good boy should know
So darlin' you gotta tell me which way the winds gonna blow
I'm old enough to know what's wrong and what's right
I've just got to know if that thing is open all night

With the way you walk there ain't no mistake
My finger starts a shakin' knees start to quake
And I'm gonna love you baby until I'm completely spent
Turn around jack back up and be a hundred percent
Turn a mouse into a man a man into dynamite
I've just got to know if that thing is open all night

Love isn't blind love isn't pure
But you'll never find anything else shine any truer
You got me shining like a candle and it's burning at both ends
I want to be your lover don't care at all 'bout good friends
I'm old enough to know what's wrong and what's right
I just got to know if that thing is

Open all night
Open all night
Open all night
Yeah open all night
Well you turn a mouse into a man a man into dynamite
I've just got to know if that thing is open all night
24 hours baby
C'mon boy get you some

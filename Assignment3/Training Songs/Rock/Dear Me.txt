If I hold out, if I hold out
Will I make out like you?
If we hideout, if we hide here too
Will it take us back to me and you?

Days and nights inside this room

Oh, never ending thoughts of you
Time can make it seem alright
Why can't I get you out of view?
I follow you now, I follow you

Make it all up, take it all down
If it serves me, I do
We can hideout, we can hide here too
It won't take us back to me and you

Days and nights inside your room

Oh, never ending thoughts of you
Time can make it seem alright
Why can't I get you out of view?
I follow you now, I follow you

Oh, never ending thoughts of you
Time can make it seem alright
Why can't I get you out of view?
I follow you now, I follow you

Days and nights inside
Days and nights inside
Days and nights inside

Oh, never ending thoughts of you
Time can make it seem alright
Why can't I get you out of view?
I follow you now, I follow you

How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again

I think you know it well
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
I think you know it well
Whenever we meet again

Yeah alright
And you will begin to know about that
That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Until we meet again
Hey

Oh yeah

Just run and let it out
Oh yeah now
And you will begin to know about it darling
That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Until we meet again

How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again
Oh, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Oh, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Oh, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again

Again

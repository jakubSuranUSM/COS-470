Cool as the water melting from the winter snows
You are the island I've been looking for
I don't know where you come from but I can feel you comin' on
You're a storm inside my soul that's ragin' out of control

Call the wind out, call out the thunder
Oh lightning, only you can will the weather
I said come on, won't ya come on?
Lightning you're mine, tonight, tonight
You caught me while I was sleepin', restin' from a heavy run
I saw you in your evening gown, you were lighting up the sky
No matter what tomorrow brings, lightning, you're mine tonight
Oh, lightning you're mine tonight

Crack the horizon, only you can split the night
Then comes your mother cloud to take you away
Another wind will dry me and the sun will make me warm
But to me my life will always be the calm before the storm

Call the wind out, call out the thunder
Oh lightning, only you can will the weather
I said come on, won't ya come on?
Lightning you're mine, tonight, tonight
You caught me while I was sleepin', restin' from a heavy run
I saw you in your evening gown, you were lighting up the sky
No matter what tomorrow brings, lightning, you're mine tonight
Oh, lightning you're mine tonight

Call the wind out, call out the thunder
Oh lightning, only you can will the weather
I said come on, oh come on
Lightning you're mine, tonight, tonight
You caught me while I was sleepin', restin' from a heavy run
Well I saw you in your evening gown, you were lighting up the sky
No matter what tomorrow brings, lightning, you're mine tonight
Oh, lightning you're mine tonight

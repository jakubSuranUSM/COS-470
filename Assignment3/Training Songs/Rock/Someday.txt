Here's a song for the hearts so lonely
The ones who feel that love won't come
But then you find that one and only
I got something to say to you

You see the lovers walking down the street
You feel your lifes a little incomplete
And I know what you mean
And I'm here to tell ya
Wipe the tears from your eyes
You know I would not lie

Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon
Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon

Give your love away to someone new
Just so you can say that he belongs to you
You smile and you laugh and you duck me forever
I'm not so sure that its true

Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon
Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon

Ooh don't give up on love
Someday will come soon

After you've found that dream you treasure
After the chill has left the air
All of the pieces will come together
The things that you can share
But only time can take you there

Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon
Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon

Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon
Save your love for someday girl
Someday will come soon

Save your love
Someday will come soon
Ooh don't give up on love
Someday will come soon

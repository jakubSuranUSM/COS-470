I guess I got romantic notions;
I need a love, a love like the ocean.
You look so sweet, you seem so fine;
Naturally, I wish you were mine.

She says: "I don't know why you're wishing and hoping,
When you could be kaleidescopin'.
No, I don't know why you're wishing and hoping,
When you could be kaleidescopin'.
No, I don't know why."

Consider the lilies of the field, and how they grow.
I'm just like that, but I'm more slow.
I need a love that's tender and true.
I need a love, someone like you.

She says: "I don't know why you're wishing and hoping,
When you could be kaleidescopin'.
No, I don't know why you're wishing and hoping,
When you could be kaleidescopin'.
No, I don't know why.
I don't know why."

I wish I had another life,
To show you how I feel.
I'm hoping that my luck is good;
I know my love is real.

Kaleidescopin'...
Kaleidescopin'...

Falling in love again, I never wanted to
But what am I to do, I can't help it
Love's always been my game, play it how I may
I was made that way, I can't help it

Girls flutter to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn, I am not to blame

Falling in love again, I never wanted to
But what am I to do, I can't help it

it feels like the '80s
when we were much smaller
but somehow felt bigger than now
come summer, my brother
you say you will marry
by this time next year will it be?

you came with a ring
the obvious thing
and we were all smiling so wide

it feels like the '80s
when we were much smaller
but somehow felt bigger than now
bigger than now

it feels like the '80s
when our world was honest
it sometimes feels less honest now
the love of another
the cradle and cover
by this time next year will it be?

we long for these things
these obvious things
when we can feel complete inside

it feels like the '80s
when our world was honest
nothing seems more honest now
more honest now

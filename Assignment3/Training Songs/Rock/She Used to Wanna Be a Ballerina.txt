She used to wanna be a ballerina
She used to wanna be a paper swan
She used to dance pretend for the Prince of England
With her deerskin boots and her ballet makeup on.
She used to run among the forest branches
Costumed in the feather and the leaves she'd find

Practicing her pirouettes and prances
Perfectly Pavlova in her prime.
La dat dat dat, la dat dat dat,
Oh look in your heart, see where she's at.

She used to wanna be a ballerina
She settled for the satisfaction of her soul,
Rock and roll will never be Tchaikowsky
But Tchaikowsky'll never be rock and roll
La dat dat dat, la dat dat dat
Oh, look in your heart, see where she's at

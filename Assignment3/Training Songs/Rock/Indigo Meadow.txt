lay your hands on my chest girl
you been a problem since the moment I met you 
you always cause a real friction
put your pale hands on my face my love 

Be strong i wish she were
you stand up and act like a love it
keep your  hands of my chest girl
leave your pale face on my lip, my love

always indigo, always indigo, always indigo
always indigo, always indigo, always indigo

Hate me
My jacket's not right

Hate me
And my thousand hairs
And my shoes look bad tonight

Hate me
My shirt is shitty

Hate me
And you hate my slacks
You don't even like me

I've got my money
I've been here standing in line
Am I so funny
Standing here all the time

Hate me
My jacket's not right

Hate me
And my thousand hairs
And my shoes look bad tonight

Hate me
My shirt is shitty

Hate me
And you hate my slacks
Damn, you don't even like me

I've got my money
I've been here standing in line
What is so funny
Just standing here in this line

Hate me
My shirt is shitty

Hate me
Yeah, I combed my hair
It's still not pretty

Hate me
Hate me
Ooh, hate me
Hate me
What? You don't like my slacks? Oh, I see!

Snowflakes that fall across my eyes
Cannot compare to a dark surprise
What's new becomes old, what's old is new
When I first laid my eyes on you

I do not care for the winter sun
Windows and fires or the bridge you're on
It doesn't matter
This time of year

Though darkness comes so quick in time
Shortens our days to longer nights
Build a blue fire and kneel beside
Snowflakes that fall across our eyes

It's all that matters
This time of year
It's all that matters
This time of year

The film they show is
Sad and boring
The morning shot from a diving bell

Forgetting you is like
Breathing water
There's got to be a better way

Dynamite
A thing you said once
Made me wonder
What can go away as fast as love

First the light
And then the thunder
I've been up all night and I got it now

Dynamite

All day I
Did things slowly
Walked in circles round your home

I had something to add
To the things you showed me
I've got it here underneath my coat

Dynamite

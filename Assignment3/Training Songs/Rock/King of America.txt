I’ve cleaned your floors
Scrubbed your toilets
Man, I’ve swept under your feet
Worked in your stores
Every boy gets one chance
You’re laughing at me
Now it’s my turn to bleed
Shout it out
King of America
I wanna be king of America
I have waited in your long lines
I have sweat ‘neat your sun
I’ve kicked ’round in your factories
I did it all without a gun
Now it’s my time to run
Shout it out
King of America
I wanna be king of America
Gimme some
Gimme something I can be
I have worn your cheap little outfits
I have taken your sickening drugs
You tried to sweep me under your carpet
Then decided I had enough
Shout it out
King of America
Every boy dreams to be
King of America

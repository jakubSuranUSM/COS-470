Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Baggy suit and flashy tie, blue of knuckle, red of eye,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

He'd sell his mother for a quid, rumour has it that he did,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

He used to be his father's pride, 'til he spent a year inside,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

Six feet from shoulder to shoulder and five feet from the ground,
Iron fists, a head like a boulder - a friend like that is good to have around!

At the club he's set to pounce, girls to chat and boys to bounce,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.
Oy!

{Erik - Solo}

Six feet from shoulder to shoulder and five feet from the ground,
Iron fists, a head like a boulder - a friend like that is good to have around!

(Wide boy), wanna buy a stereo?
(Wide boy), heard you got a truckload!
(Wide boy), need a color TV too.

(Wide boy), I'm in a spot of trouble,
I need assistance at the double,
(Wide boy), it's good to have a friend like you.

Never rich and never poor, (never poor)
Just a step outside the law, (outside the law)
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

Doesn't make a difference 
I don't care how far 
We can go the distance 
In my car 
In my car 

Don't bother with directions 
Doesn't matter where we are 
Cruisin' down the highway 
In my car 
In my car 

I don't need no backseat drivers 
Leave 'em all behind 
And trouble it can't find me 
When I'm in my car 
In my car

Just an act
An impossible divorce
That put the life in to you
It's too late to abort

I never gave you the time that you deserved
Never gave you even half of what you're worth
My beautiful son

Can you feel it inside you, my son
Could you beat me black and blue
For the doubt and apathy
Just trying to keep your feet on the floor
Just trying to put the fear in to you
Just trying to board up all the doors
And I can't serve anymore

And maybe you'll realize
When you take those little tests
The more you breathe, the more you lead
You're more yourself even less
Nobody ever said they'd love you forever
They close you up and let you down
Separate forever

One day all this could be yours

I've tried to forget you
But I just can't help myself
I should have never let you leave
Without me
I realize I was a fool to you
Send me a letter, show me a sign
I'm saving my loving for you

I have a photograph of you
A memory or two, my love
Lasting forever
I have a photograph of you
And though you are so far away
I'll never forget you - my love

If I could tell you
I'm sure I could justify
The words that I said to you
As we said goodbye
If I could just apologize to you
Could you forgive me
I need you here with me
I want to make you realize

I have a photograph of you
A memory or two, my love
Lasting forever
I have a photograph of you
And though you are so far away
I'll never forget you - my love

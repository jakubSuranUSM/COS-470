Drivin' along with my radio on feelin' good
Ain't got no lady but maybe I'm thinkin' I could
I slept all day nothing to do

And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' around, oh yeah

Thought I was cool
When I dropped out of school it was great, yeah
Could have gone crazy but I was too lazy to wait
So I'm drivin' along, all alone

And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' round

I'm driving along all alone, yeah
And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
No, I don't see the world going by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' around
Ooh baby
Listen to the people sing now

Just hangin' round
Just hangin' round
Just hangin' round

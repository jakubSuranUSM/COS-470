Soldier boy stands at a full salute
He wants your orders to excute
Send him out - 'neath the 
Screaming red lights
In a narrow ditch for the funny fights

Foxhole, foxhole
Too much danger
Foxhole, foxhole
Where's my guardian angel - oh no

You showed me the war
I don't know what for
You showed me the war
But the war is such a bore

In the line of duty, in the line of fire
A heartless heart - is my proper attire

Chorus
The flashing sword has been explored
The perfect slice - perfect slice of life

I feel the shells hit - Moonlight web
Goodbye arms, so long head

Chorus
Hello guardian angel

You pin me down, go ahead it's a cinch
You pin me down, you'll feel the pinch
I was trained for the fights

Foxhole, foxhole...........

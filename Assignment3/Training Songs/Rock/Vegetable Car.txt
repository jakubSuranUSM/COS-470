Baby, you don't even know me but one day I'll get up the courage as you pass by.
You'll see.
Oh baby, one look just might save me.
I need you to slow by the corner. 
Stop right in front of me.

Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more than I know about you.

[Chorus]
She drives a vegetable car.
Diesel, Mercedes, green, two-door.
I barely know who you are.
Lisa Lobe glasses.
I'd sure like to ask you to stay.

Baby, I need you to save me. 
The one thing that my heart requires is that you admire me.

Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more than I know about you.

[Chorus]

How do I know why the sight of you makes me weak?
Each time I see you turn onto my street
Your hair is always up in a bun.
This girl is the one.

[Chorus]

Don't go.

Why did you come undone?
Let me cut off the wings, you don't need them
So beautiful, what have I done?
It's the sweetest parade I am giving

Drive me crazy, you're the one without no ending
Drive me baby, I wanna be like your

Fever, fever
I will burn in the sun when you take me again
Fever, fever
You will learn in the sun when you take me away
Fever

So now that I haven't gone, it's too late to give up
'Cause you'll wake me
So beautiful, what have you done?
It's the beat to the drugs you were taking

Drive them crazy, you're the one with no ending
Drive me baby, I wanna be like your

Fever, fever
I will burn in the sun when you take me again
Fever, fever
You will learn in the sun when you take me away
Fever

I'm the line without no ending
And you're the one without

Fever, fever
I will burn in the sun when you take me again
Fever, fever
You will learn in the sun when you take me away
Fever, fever

Fever, fever
You will learn in the sun when you take me away again

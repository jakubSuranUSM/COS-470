No one can say, that crime doesn't pay, that never is true
It's supply and demand, with blood on your hands, nighmares come true
It's in all the headlines, you're the worst of a kind, a sinister breed
Such a contemptable way, to have your own say, you're poisoned with greed

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

You don't have to be smart, it don't take any heart, least of all, shame
Some turret stunt, open in the front, your motive is plain
And for those that contend, with the choice to condemn, I know that you care
For those left alone, when it's time to go home, and nobody's there

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

When you're out on the street, and you got nothin' to eat, it's easy to see
That you do what you can, still I don't understand, how wrong you can be
Though it's all very clear, that you bargain with fear, there's no justice at all
It's easy for some, they say the bigger they come, the harder they fall

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

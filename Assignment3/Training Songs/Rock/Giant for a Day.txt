You can be President Carter, maybe Idi Amin, or say Muhammed Ali
Make yourself Marlon Brando, Mickey Mouse, anyone you can see.
Listen to all these songs tell yourself that it's wrong to even go your own way
Throw away your old cloak, put on your mask, be a Giant for a Day.

Think to yourself you're in Paris, Tel Aviv, Istanbul, or maybe London or Rome.
Close your eyes to be there, even though you may be sitting at home.

REPEAT.....

Sitting in a Rolls Royce, if it's the car of your choice or just a black
Cadillac.
And if you don't think these suit you, just a Porsche or a plain Pontiac.

REPEAT.....

GIANT FOR A DAY, GIANT FOR A DAY
PUT ON YOUR MASK IMAGINE YOU'RE A GIANT FOR A 
GIANT FOR A DAY

You can think your Jack the Ripper, Mama Belle the stripper, you can fight in
the streets.
You can be the French Connection, Harvey Oswald, or the boys on the beat.

REPEAT.....

GIANT FOR A DAY, GIANT FOR A DAY
PUT ON YOUR MASK IMAGINE YOU'RE A GIANT FOR A 
GIANT FOR A DAY

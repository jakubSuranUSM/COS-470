Six feet underground
We move backwards now
At the speed of sound
We are nowhere now

Too much time to kill
Too much wasted air
Too much everything
There's no need to think

Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love

Looking down at Earth
It is luminous, observe

We had every chance
But we never learn
We just make it worse
What we don't deserve

The principle of love
Has no meaning here
'Cause if you don't live here
Better get out while you can

Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love

Looking down at Earth
It is luminous, observe

Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love

Looking down at Earth
It is luminous, observe

Six feet underground
We move backwards now
At the speed of sound
We are nowhere now

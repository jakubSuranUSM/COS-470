Sloe gin, sloe gin
Tryin' to wash away the pain inside
Well, I'm sick and I'm all done in
And I'm standin' in the rain
And I feel like I'm gonna cry

I'm so damn lonely
And I ain't even high
I'm so damn lonely
And I feel like I wanna die

Mayday, Mayday
I've been shot down over stormy sea
Well, I feel like I'm driftin' away
Can't seem to get a grip on me
Now I can't even try

I'm so damn lonely
And ain't even high
I hate to go home alone
But what else is new
I'm so damn lonely

I hate to go home alone
But what else is new
I'm so damn lonely

You stand there bleedin'
People pass me by
No matter if you live
No matter if you die

Sloe gin, sloe gin
Tryin' to wash away the pain inside
Well, I'm sick and I'm all done in
I'm standin' in the rain
And I feel like I'm gonna die

I'm so damn lonely
And ain't even high
I'm so damn lonely

Sloe gin, honey
Baby, come and get the best of me

You needed my love and I was nowhere to be found
You're having a rough time, but I was painting the town

Like to make it up to you somehow
But things are just different now

How am I supposed to help you if I can't get myself together
How am I supposed to love you if I can't get my act together
If I just can't help myself

Wish I could make everything better again
I know your heart aches, and yes I know I'm to blame
There must be something in my DNA
'Cause our love, it goes my way

Like to make it up to you somehow
But things are just different now

Wish I could make everything better again
I know your heart aches, and yes I know I'm to blame
There must be something in my DNA
'Cause our love, it goes my way

Wish I could make everything better again
I know your heart aches, and yes I know I'm to blame
There must be something in my DNA
'Cause our love, it goes my way

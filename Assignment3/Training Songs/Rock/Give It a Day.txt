Aych ay see two (half a canyon too) 
Increase Mather told her dad, yeah
"I roundly disagree with you
You're vocal style's to preachy
All the yokels mock your teaching."
But Cotton, he was just so oblivious
To all their cutting pleas

Soon the townfolk took to it,
In every pew they looked to him
For guidance just like eyeless lambs
Awaiting that ol' kabob stand
The skeptics formed
The nation's born
They want to have it, Cotton's dream
But Increase had them mounted
And they burned on open fires
So the word spread just like small pox 
In the Sudan

The gentry cried:
"Give it a day!" 
"Give it a day!" 
"Give it a day!" 

"Give it a day!" 
"Give it a day!" 
"Give it a day!" 

Years and years have passed 
Since the puritans invaded our soul
Just like those Arab terrorists
You'll never know
But today the gods can't make us quake,
We see our lives as situations
Eyes are eyes and teeth are teeth,
Well mine are rotten underneath
I got two ways we can separate from the clan

If I could fly, I could fry

I hope you profited from this bulletin
And it stabilized your land
You're drenched, you're fired, 
(You gentrified?)
Your Alzheim clan, but
Your father is another one of them
I don't want to mention him again, cause
I talked to him last night, 
He hates my guts
We had a fight
And he called you a slut girl, 
Why's that? 
What did you do to him to make him think

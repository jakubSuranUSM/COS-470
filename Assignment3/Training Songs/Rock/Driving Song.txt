Will they ever stop driving me?
Have they ever taken time to see
That I need some rest if I'm to do my best?
Can I please stop working so hard?
They just tell me gotta close it hard.
Got to think of my health. 
Can I be myself?

Oh, tell me I'll be home some day,
Well I doubt it if I continue this way,
Cause this hard life I've led is making me dead.

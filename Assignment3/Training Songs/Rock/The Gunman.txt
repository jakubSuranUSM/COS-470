I know that on some narrow street
Our paths will cross, our eyes will meet
And love will leave me at his feet
I'm waiting for the gunman

When I enter a room
I will only sit facing the door
It's love I'm looking for
As I search every face
I start wondering
Is this the place?

For love is a gunman, and no mercy has he
He'll hunt you down until the day
Death sets you free
Love is a gunman, and he's coming to town
You'll meet his gaze, both barrels blaze
Staring you down
Love is a gunman, and no mercy has he
This time his sights, are fixed on me

You can run, you can hide
You can even saddle up and ride
But love won't be denied
You can wear a disguise
But he isn't fooled by alibis

For love is a gunman, and no mercy has he
He'll hunt you down until the day
Death sets you free
Love is a gunman, and he's coming to town
You'll meet his gaze, both barrels blaze
Staring you down
Love is a gunman, and no mercy has he
This time his sights, are fixed on me

Love is a gunman, and no mercy has he
This time his sights, are fixed on me

O love is teasing and love is pleasing
And love's a pleasure when first it is new
But as love grows older it still grows colder
And fades away like the morning dew

Come all you fair maids, now take a warning
Don't ever heed what a young man say
He's like a star on some foggy morning
You think he's near he's far away

I left my father, I left my mother
I left my brothers and sisters too.
I left my home and my fond relations,
Oh my young man, for the sake of you

O love is pleasing and love is teasing
And love's a pleasure when first it is new
But as love grows older, it soon grows colder
And fades away like the morning dew

I like wasting my days in a caravan
I liked my uncle Joe
What a lovely man
Well I love things
I do my best
I eat sleep laugh and cry just like the rest
What becomes of me
Is meant to be
So I'll just groove along quite naturally yeah

Summer's here and I'll be hiding my time away
Looking for someone who'll tell me the time of day
And he'll make your wish for true come
Unexpected attacks on your nose
Can be treated by touching your toes

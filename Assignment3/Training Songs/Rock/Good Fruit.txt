If it doesn't mean a thing, then don't say anything.
But it means something, more then we can say.

But you kissed me so, even though,
Your heart said no, so when will you phone?

Lost feelings of love come flooding back,
Every time you cry, you give me little heart attacks.

Love seems strongest when its new,
But that's something I can't prove,
I can't prove that I love you.

Oh I need you here, so make your reasons clear,
Is it me you fear? Oh I fear I'm losing you.

It's time to choose, you know I can't stand losing.
It's my mind your bruising, as well as my heart.

You were just there, in the right place,
You smoothed out the wrinkles on my face.
You got to sort the good fruit from the bad fruit,
Darling, I'm not supposed to feel this,
Not when your leaving.

You, oh you should stick around,
To hear me hit the ground,
Its such a pretty sound.
If you felt it weeks ago,
Then where did those feelings go?
Oh surely you must know,
Cause I'm not supposed to feel this,
Not when you're leaving

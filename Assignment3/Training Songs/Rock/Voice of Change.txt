Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

Hey, you there in the tie, let me bend your ear if that's okay..
You've been sitting there staring at the ground for almost three days,
Ain't sure what I'll say, but I'm thinkin' about the people givin' orders

Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

Hey, Business Man, you're turnin' t' give me a sideways glance every now and then, 
But now your kind is in the papers,
You've got to think now friend, 
How does that grab your signed-up majority, 
Are you worried about the people giving orders?

Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

Hey friend, you don't have to be silent anymore,
Things do affect you you know, things like pollution, tax and wars, 

How would you like to have your healthy kid die of suffocation
On the streets? 

You'd better talk to people giving orders

Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

Hear the Voice of Change, hear the winds of movin' on
Hear the song of not the same thing, hey

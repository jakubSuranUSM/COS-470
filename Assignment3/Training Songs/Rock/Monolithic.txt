You know you're quite a hot topic
You've gotta nothin' in your head
You've got your ass in the back seat
We all agree you're over-fed
You're from the suck generation
Like a doggie with a bone
You like your lame fuckin' music
You love a-talkin' on your phone

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You got about a-nothin' to say
So buy your stupid garbage
And love yourself to death
'Til Daddy takes your T-Bird away

You want a new load of garbage
I'd love to drop it at your door
Your gonna eat it little piggy
You always gotta have some more

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You got about a-nothin' to say
Keep spendin' all your money
And love yourself to death
'Til Daddy takes your T-Bird away

[Repeat: x4]
Monolithic baby

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You got about a-nothin' to say
Keep spendin' all your money
And love yourself to death
'Til Daddy takes your T-Bird away

You're stone monolithic
I smell it on your breath
You got about a-nothin' to say
Keep spendin' all your money
And love yourself to death
'Til Daddy takes your T-Bird away

[Repeat: x4]

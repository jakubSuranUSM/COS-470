To settle our thoughts,
Never minding what for.
Nothing of harm to dread.
On my mind.
Tell me what belies,
Or tell me what I could have.
Oh, tell me what for.

No more of this living, dying,
Just scientific analyzing.
Forgive us, oh life,
The sin of

Death, oh baby,
You know that dying is fine, but maybe.
I wouldn't like death if death were good,
Not even if death were good.

Is this is,
Maundering about?
And all I have is too much time,
To understand.
One can only love,
Life until its ending.
Oh, and I can't forget.

No more of this living, dying,
Just scientific analyzing.
Forgive us, oh life,
The sin of

Death, oh baby,
You know that dying is fine, but maybe.
I wouldn't like death if death were good,
Not even if death were good. (x4)

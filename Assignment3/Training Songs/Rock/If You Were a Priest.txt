If you were a priest
I would wait at least
Up unto confession time and
Crawl into your box
Breathing like a fox
Hunting for obsession time and
I've thrown a lot of time away to be with you
So please don't lock away your eyes

If you were a nun
I would surely run
Way down to the hospital and
Cover all your charts
With decorated hearts
A palpitating ritual and
I've spent a lot of time on this to be like you 15
So please don't lock away your eyes

If you were a ghost
I would treasure most
Time I never spent with you and
Wander through your head
The words I never said
Till I knew what I meant to you and
I've spent a lot of time on this to be with you
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes
So please don't lock away your eyes (away your eyes)
So please don't lock away your eyes

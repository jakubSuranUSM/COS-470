There’s a young men that a know, his age is twenty one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service and he’s lookin' for his fun
Someday soon goin' with him someday soon

My parents cannot stand him 'cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the toughest road I know
Someday soon goin' with him someday soon

And when he comes to call, my pa ain’t got a good word to say
Guess it's 'cause he was just as wild in the younger days

So blow you ol’ blue northern, blow my love to me
He’s drivin’ in tonight from California
He loves his damned ol’ rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon goin' with him someday soon

And when he comes to call, my pa ain’t got a word to say

Someday soon goin' with him someday soon
Someday soon goin' with him someday soon

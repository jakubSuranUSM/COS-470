As dark as dark sky and earth,dizzily mind
As sore as sore the back of the gullet,dizziness

You can't catch me,can't catch me
Can blind birds fly? They can't

I go up the blind stairs intently

Ladies and gentleman,time is over
Ladies and gentleman,please die

haisuikou ni nagareteyuku ore no kodomo wa munou na kakera
Ore no te ja nani mo tsukamenai

Like a garbage I go back to doing

Whatever I may wish,it's weed life

Night and day at the end of the day,all day and so every day
Yume sae mo sakebu sa 
I want to become happy

barairo makka na kuchi warau ore no kodomo wa munou na kakera
Jigyaku gyakutai shine wasuretai daikirai
Hanabira GEEMU no kazoe uta

Oh referee
Carry me to safety
I can tell
I can tell you wish me well
Thirty thousand
There is someone mouthing
Give them hell
Give them hell until the bell

As I run, I wave to everyone
To each and every beholder
And I so wanna be grateful
But nothing keeps me
So I’m just coming home

Pang in my chest
Promised you I'd fix this
But I’m almost out
Ouch, injury
I can run no longer
Carry me
Carry me to safety

As I run, I wave to everyone
To each and every beholder
And I still wanna be grateful
But nothing keeps me
So I’m just coming back home

A life to live as me
A moment that feels free
Like two big colliders
Singing out their days
You smile as if to say
Now our story’s over

Build physical structures
Mountainous landscapes of colorful ice
I am still on the inside

Build physical structures
Mountainous landscapes of colorful ice
I am still on the inside

Come, let’s wave to everyone
They came all this way to see us
Absolve our enemies and ghosts
To catch the autumn show
We’re just coming home

Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, he's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my T V see one five
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my T V see one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my T V see one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my T V see one five

VERSE 
 Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
 "Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
 My T V see one five, he, he just stares back unblinking
 So hologramic, oh my T V see one five
 One of these nights I may just
 Jump down that rainbow way. be with my baby, then
 We'll spend some time together
 So hologramic, oh my T V see one five
 My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
 So hologramic, oh my T V see one five

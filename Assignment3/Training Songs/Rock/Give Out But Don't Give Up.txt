Give out but don't give up
Give out but don't you give up
Give out but don't you give up

When I'm feelin' down
Your love is a pick-me-up
And what comes around went that way
And when I'm not feeling up to par
You come along, and there you are
Giving me the strength
Giving it all I have to give
Giving me the strength
Giving me the strength

Just one kiss
I get the strength to carry on
Your smile makes it all worthwhile

Just one kiss
I get the strength to carry on
When I'm feeling down
Your love is a pick-me-up
And what comes around went that way

Give out, but don't give up
Give out, but don't give up
Just one kiss
Well now, you give me this load
And I can't take it
Just one kiss
I get the strength to carry on
Your kiss
Give me the strength to carry on
Your smile makes it all worthwhile

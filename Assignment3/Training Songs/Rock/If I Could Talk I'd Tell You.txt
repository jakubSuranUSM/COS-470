Half past nine, quarter to ten
Ten-fifteen, and we're coming around again
Hold off, are we going soft? 
Flushed my Zoloft, and we're comin' around again
Found out, and I almost drowned
Walked back down, and we're coming around again

[Chorus:]
If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

{repeat chorus}

Khmer Rhouge, and genocide qua
Your place or Mein Kempf, now I'm givin' the dog a bone
Slight hunch, without the vaguest clue
To keep the blood balanced, now we're coming around again
Half past nine, quarter two,
Ten-fifteen, and we're comin' around again

If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

If I could talk I'd tell you
If I could smile I'd let you know
You are far and away
My most imaginary friend

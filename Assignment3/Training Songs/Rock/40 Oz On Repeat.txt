I don’t know why it’s so difficult for me
To talk to somebody I don’t know
Well I’ve tried to ask you out about a thousand times
In my head, you just always say no

And I don’t care at all, I’ll drink some alcohol
It’ll make me who I really wanna be
But I’m that kind of special person that drinks too much
Cause nobody understands me

Because everybody’s got somebody, everybody but me
Why can’t anybody just tell me that I’m somebody’s?

I’m gonna lock myself inside my room, with this 40 ounce on repeat

I thought that if I cleaned up my act
It’ll help me understand exactly who I am
But I hate to say that it just don’t work like that
Cause I’m a special individual I don’t need no plan

But I got bills to pay, and I got pills to take
Cause I’m born and raised in the USA
And I’ll just scream and shout, that I’ll never sell out
I’ll never sell out, man!
Wait, how much?

Because everybody’s got more money, they got more money than me
Why can’t anybody just give me some more money?
Because everybody’s got somebody, everybody but me
Why can’t anybody just tell me that I’m somebody’s?

I’m gonna lock myself inside my room, with the television on repeat

Because everybody’s got somebody, everybody but me
Why can’t anybody just tell me that I’m somebody’s?
Because everybody’s got somebody, everybody but me
Why can’t anybody just tell me that I’m somebody’s?

I’m gonna lock myself inside my room, with this 40 ounce on repeat

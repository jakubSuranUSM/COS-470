Deep is the longing that I feel,
It's like a light that goes right through
This darkness I've been working in,
Trying to do so much for you.
To feel you close to me this way
Much closer than the air I breathe,
I come to recognise my fate
As something you've already seen.

(Walk)
I've been walking till it ain't true,
I've been walking five miles of you.

It's a kind of paradise, your smile,
But why I haven't got a clue,
It's something I would like to solve,
The mystery of the pleasure of you.

(Walk)
I've been walking till it ain't true,
I've been walking five miles of you,
Five miles of you.

Walking out in the wind and light,
Before me I see only you.
Walking out in the wind and light
Into the mystery of you

I've been walking till it ain't true,
I've been walking five miles of you,
I've been walking till it ain't true,
I've been walking five miles of you,
I've been walking till it ain't true,
I've been walking five miles of you,
(Walk)

Dum, doobie dum, whoa, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, whoa, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, whoa, tonight I fell in love
Whoa

Tonight, tonight I fell in love
I want the stars above
To know tonight I fell in love

Tonight, I gave my heart away
True love is here to stay
'Cause tonight I fell in love

Oh, what a wonder, this magic spell I'm under
This feeling that I feel, is it really real?
My heart beats so fast, I pray that it will last
'Til the end of time

Dum, doobie dum, whoa, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, whoa, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, whoa, tonight I fell in love
Whoa

Tonight, oh, may it last forever
Forever and ever
Yes, tonight I fell in love
Yes, tonight I fell in love
Yes, tonight I fell in love

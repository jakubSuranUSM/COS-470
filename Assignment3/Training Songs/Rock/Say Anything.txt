sawameki dake ga 
kokoro o sashite 
kikoenai mune no toiki 
toki o wasurete motome samayou 
takanaru omoi nurashite 

(Only the heart's pounding 
stab my heart 
the silent sight of the heart 
forget the time the plea roams about 
wet the though/feeling that makes 
the heart pound) 

Run away from reality 
I've been crying in the dream 

k?ritsuita toki ni furuete 
yugande mieni kioku kasaneru 
kanashimi ga kieru made 

( Shiver in the time that was frozen 
piling up distorted memories 
until the grief vanishes ) 

* You say anything 
kizutsuke au kotoba demo (the fitting word blesses 
but) 
say anything 
tachikirenai kokoro ni (to the heart that cannot 
sever) 

You say anything 
Just tell me all your sweet lies 
say anything 
enji kirenai kokoro ni (to the heart that cannot 
lie) 

If I can't go back to where I have been 
yume no naka ni dake ikite 
owaranai ame ni nureru 
nagareru namida o 
hakujitsuyume ni somete 

(Live only in dreams 
getting wet in the endless rain 
colour the running tears in my day 
dreams ) 

You say anything 
wathever you like to say to me 
say anything 
you leave me out of my eyes 
you say anything 
all I can hear is voice from dream 
say anything 
you can dry my every tear 

akari no kieta (the lights have gone out) 
on the stage 
hitori mitsumete 
t?ritsugita 
hibi ni dakareru 
kowashite kure nani mo ka mo 
kazatta ai mo 
toki no suna ni kieru made 

(staring lonely 
embraced by the days that have gone 
destroy(ing) everything,as well 
the adorned love, 
until it vanishes in the sand of time ) 

* repeat 

Close your eyes and 
I'll kill you in the rain 
kirei ni koroshi aeba 
z?ka no bara ni umoreta 
shijin no namida wa 
kioku ni nagarasete 

(if a beautiful murder is fitting 
the artificial rose is buried 
shedding tears of a poet in 
the memories) 

Time may change my life 
but my heart remains the same to you 
time may change your heart 
my love for you never changes 

You say anything 
kitzutsuke au kotoba demo (the fitting word blesses 
but) 
say anything 
tachikirenai kokoro ni (to the heart that cannot 
sever) 

You say anything..... 
say anything....... 
Now you've gone away 
Where can I go from here? 
Say anything.... 
say anything...... 

I believed if time passes,everything turns into 
beauty 
If the rain stop, tears clean the scars of memory 
away. 
Everything starts wearing fresh colours. 
Every sound beginds playing a heartful melody. 
Jealousy embellishes a page of epic. 
Desire is embraced in a dream 

But my mind is still in chaos and......

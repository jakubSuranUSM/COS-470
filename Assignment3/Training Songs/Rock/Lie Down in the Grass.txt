Voice in the daytime, a dream at night
Out the screen door, in the moonlight
Take a look, can you see someone saying
"Come unto me?"

Swing down from the winner's seat
Ears ringing to an ancient beat
Lie down in the grass, lie down
Lie down, lie down in the grass

Merry-go-round, a sight to see
Spinning visions of enemies
Disconnected, all alone
Rest upon the cornerstone

Swing down from the winner's seat
Ears ringing to an ancient beat
Lie down in the grass, lie down
Lie down, lie down in the grass

Wash your hands of twisted thought
Pull the switches on what you've been taught
Draw a line, make it straight
A narrow path can lift the weight

Swing down
(It's a dream at night now)
Ears ringing
(In the pale moonlight now)

Lie down
(It's a dream at night now)
Lie down
(In the pale moonlight now)

Take a look, can you see someone say
"Come unto me?"

Lay it all down
Lay it all down
Lay it all down, come on
Lay it down

A voice in the daytime, a dream at night
Out the screen door, in the moonlight
Lie down, gotta lie it down, lie it down
Lay it all down now, come on

A voice in the daytime, a dream at night
Out the screen door, in the moonlight
Lie down

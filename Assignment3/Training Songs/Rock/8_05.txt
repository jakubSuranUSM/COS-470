Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving soon
I can't go on without you
Its useless to try

To love you would be so good
To keep you would be so wonderful
Here is my heart that I give
It's all that I have

Please change your mind 
Before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you can try?
Do you think you can try?
Do you think you can try?

Please change your mind
Before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you can try? 
Do you think you can try?
Do you think you can try?

Please understand how I feel
Until I can prove it to you 
Don't fill my world with rain
You know your tears
Would only bring pain in my heart

Eight-oh-five
I guess you're leaving...goodbye

I can't help staring when you're hardly wearing a thing
Your lascivious mouth is full of smiles
Your laughter echoes off the bathroom tiles
With your pretty hands folded sweetly in your lap
You make such a tantalising trap

But who deserves your perfect curves and wiles?
Well, I can tell you now that it won't be me
Because my girlfriend's waiting patiently
And I have noticed that you're inclined to tease
So don't make this any harder for me please

Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?

You kissed me once and you got a response, and I know
After a kiss like that some men would leave their wife
But I don't want to destroy my life
Just because you look at me that way
It doesn't mean that I'm about to stay

But I can hardly believe
That I'm about to just leave
Because some weird chromosome
Somewhere deep inside is calling me home

Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?

Of course I want to share your bed with you
But if I stay tonight I can never go home

But I can hardly believe
That I'm about to just leave
Because some weird chromosome
Somewhere deep inside is calling me home

Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?

Oh I can hardly believe
That I'm about to just leave
Because some weird chromosome
Somewhere deep inside is calling me home

Oh please don't look so confused
I guess you're seldom refused
You must think I'm insane
Walking out knowing I won't get this chance again?

[Chorus]
Hey big brother
As soon as you arrive
You better get in touch with the people, big brother
And get them on your side, big brother
And keep them satisfied

Welcome to the beat of the city street
Walk on now and don't be shy
Take a closer look at the people you meet
And notice the fear in their eyes
Watching the time passing by

[Chorus]

Focus your eye on the filthy sky
Just as far as you can see
Everybody's gettin' kind of tired of waitin'
'Cause nobody wants to cry
And nobody wants to die

[Chorus]

Now that you got the picture
What you gonna do
Now that you got the picture
What you gonna do

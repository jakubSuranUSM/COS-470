I love you Babe
Do you know?
I'll be any place

Save my love for you

When you need love to help you
Do not fear
Sweet sweet Baby
I've found a nurse

You be my trust

Ooh ee Baby

Get down and do those things you do to me
You're alright

All the time since
You left your spell on me
Your lovin' set my soul on fire
Your love is my one desire

Ooh ee Baby
Ooh ee
Get down and do those things you do to me
Yer! Yer!

Always tryin' to do

Anytime you want me to go

Get down and do those things you do to me
Get on down

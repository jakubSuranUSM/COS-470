Your old lady sure looks good to me.
Your old lady sure looks good to me.
Don't wanna lose you, 'cause you're my friend,
But your old lady is the livin' end.
Your old lady sure looks good to me.
Your old lady sure looks good to me.

Your old lady is my old lady too.
Your old lady is my old lady too.
Oh brother, one thing that I know
Somebody, somebody's got to go.
Your old lady is my old lady too.
Your old lady is my old lady too.

I don't even know why
Do you think I'm a mess
Maybe someday but now you're gone

When I do as I please
I'm no different to me
Am I crazy or have good luck

You're the talk of the town
So you say (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I don't know why you're so glad
When my head's filled with sorrow
So maybe if I fade away
There'll be no sad tomorrow

My whole life is a drag
Baby listen to me
When I go away, will you care

I feel naked and weird
Do you see what I hear
Maybe one day I'll die, who cares

Hide away in complete 
Misery (oh, oh)

[Chorus]

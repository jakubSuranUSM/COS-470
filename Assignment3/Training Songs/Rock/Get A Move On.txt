I want you to levitate me
Don't you love me yet?
Press up against the amp
Turn up the treble, don't forget

Getting dizzy, sitting around
Sacred trickster in another tight sound

I wish I could be music on a tree
Noise nomads and me
Levitating on the ground

What's it like to be a girl in a band?
I don't quite understand
That's so quaint to hear
I feel so faint my dear

Doing nothing, sitting around
Sacred trickster in another tight sound

I wish I could be music on a tree
Noise nomads and me
Levitating, spinning around

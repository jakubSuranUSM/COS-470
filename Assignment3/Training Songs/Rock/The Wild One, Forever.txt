Well the moon sank as the wind blew 
The street lights slowly died 
They call you the wild one, said stay 'way from her 
Said she could love no one if she tried 

But then somethin' I saw 
In your eyes told me right away 
That you were gonna have to be mine 
When the strangest feeling came over me 
Down inside no matter what it takes 
I'll never get over how good it felt 
When you finally held m e 
I'll never regret 
Baby those few hours 
Will grow in my head 
Forever 

Well it's too bad, but I want you 
To know I understand 
Yeah, it's been a long time but I don't mind 
Yeah, it's all right I understand 

Beca use somethin' I saw 
In your eyes told me right away 
That you were gonna have to be mine 
When the strangest feeling came over me 
Down inside I knew right away 
I'll never get over how good it felt 
When you finally kissed me 
I'll never regret 
Baby those few hours 
Will grow in my head 
Forever

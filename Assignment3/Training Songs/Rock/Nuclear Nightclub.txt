That day was bright and sunny
Seemed to me
With eagles wheeling overhead
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead is what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I's dead 

I'd said goodbye to moma
And goodbye to pa
And packed my bags from under the bed
And that train was moving on
I had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dad is what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I's dead 

Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead and gone and old and grey
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead and gone and old and grey 

Standing at the station holding you
I remember you were dressed in red
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead, that's what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I's dead 

Get to say, Don't worry
I'll work it out
Never really knowin' what I'd said
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead and gone
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I's dead

Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead and gone and old and grey
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead and gone and old and grey

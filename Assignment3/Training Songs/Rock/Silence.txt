Say the words break my heart
Touch my lips with your fingers
And push them apart
Put your hands in my hair
And pull me down
Well you're nothing but a stranger
To me now

'Cause I'm long past feeling
And I'm too far gone
Staring at my ceiling
I know silence better
Than anyone.

Say my name
And look away
Take a breath take a bow
And take the train
Say your piece
And say goodbye
You will regret that alibi

'Cause I'm long past feeling
And I'm loading my gun
Staring at my ceiling
I know silence better than anyone

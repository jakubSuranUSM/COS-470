Don't you know it's been such a long long time
Since I had you in my arms
And can't you see that you're someone
I've been trying to find

When I feel your hands pressed against my back
I can't lie baby, I want you more than that

Thinking 'bout times that we had
The good times and the bad
At the end of every line
You've been always on my mind
I give you just what you want
But I'm saying
Now you got to give me just what I need

And, baby, I need to feel your love
Baby I need to be a part of
Your everything
Maybe they say we're too young
But that's just fine
'Cause I've made up my mind

We both know that we've loved hard and we've lost
But I got to give it up
I've been holding back so much
But at what cost?

When I feel the sweat drippin' down my neck
I can't lie, baby, and I can't be more direct

There was a time when my dreams were coming true
Our future is so unclear
Do you listen when my heart
Speaks to you

When I see the sun bend over the trees
If I lied, baby, that'd be all I ever need

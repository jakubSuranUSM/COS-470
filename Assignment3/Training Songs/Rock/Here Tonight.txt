It's ten PM and I should have made the road tonight  
The moon was out and the clouds came in and took it's light  
My suitcase is over there somehow I  just don't care  
Cause I don't want to be anywhere but right here tonight 
The rains came down and I should have made an early plane 
Where I'd rather be if it can't be seen then I can't explain 
It's so warm in here and I want to hold you near 
And there is no pain or fear right here tonight 
With tomorrows dawn I will carry on what I've set aside
It's not a matter of my faith or of my pride 
It just seems so insane  to strike out in the rain
When it's so easy to remain right here tonight

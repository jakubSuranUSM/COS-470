I'm using life
It's true, I don't mind if you leave
You're fated, I'm always relieved
I hope you understood the words unsaid
So many rooms inside my head
(Too many different places)
Sometimes I'm dying to be dead
(Too many lovely faces)
It's like a poison to meâ€¦

I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
Won't you set me free?
Leave it all to be

I, I, I, I won't pretend
I'm not scared to death of being left alone
My love for you is still unknown
I'm getting closer and I use my wile
I crack the liars smile
(I won't just live my life to die)
I'm getting high from being vile
(There is no use to ask me why)
It's like a poison to me

I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
Won't you set me free?
Leave it all to be

I see you drowning in my lies
I crack the liars smile
I won't just live my life to die
I'm getting high from being vile
There's no use to ask me why
It's like a poison to me

I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
Won't you set me free?
Leave it all to be

I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
Won't you set me free?
Leave it all to be

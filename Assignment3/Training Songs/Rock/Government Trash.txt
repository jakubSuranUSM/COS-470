Well you can't say nothin'
We're doin' right
'Cause the government trash
Will give me up all night

'Cep for drugs so hard
They need to break their banks
Don't step on the crack
'Cause you know about that, oh

21, 21, Nobody knows anything at 21
22, 22, Nobody knows anything at 22

She's alright, alright
She'll make it alright, alright

It's not a secret
Everybody has decided
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes

Don't stop thinkin'
Now pass the phone
I said do what you want
But just leave me alone

Nothin' is free
Call the police
They dress to care
I dress to die, oh

It's not a secret
Everybody has decided
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes

Don't stop thinkin'
Now pass the phone
I said do what you want
But just leave me alone

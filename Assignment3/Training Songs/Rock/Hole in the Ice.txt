Take it down, mess it up, light a match, make a fire
Walk away as the money burns, it might just save your life
I play the happenstance, oh, I see my fortune fly
Sometime you lift it up, another long day goes by

And I won't travel into the straw daylight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

Sit back and watch the money burn, five days in a hot house hell
Once you're gone there's no return but I never wanna let you lie+ 0.50
I want my love to burn, hotter than a comet's tail
I want my bed to cry, I never wanna let you down

And I won't travel into the straw daylight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

And all I ever do is therapy, one on one, one on one
And you and I, we might want the same thing, one on one, one on one
I don't want a teacher to remind me, one on one, one on one
Well , how to get something better out of my life, life, life, yeah

I play the happenstance, well, I see my fortune fly
Every time you lift the cup and another long day goes by

And I won't travel into the pale moonlight desire
I wrote that some Eskimo gave me the line

Your freedom, wow it's so precious that it makes me hurt
I learnt that my teachers were my loneliness
And wisdom can be passed on by the one who's left
Your freedom, it's so precious that it makes it work

I keep on dancin', dancin'
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
I find myself alone, I'm thinking just of you
You got me dancin'
Dancin'
Why don't you help me? 
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? 
To stand beside me

There's once a man in a foreign land
In love with a woman who didn't understand
Love is not a thing you command
Love is something that keeps you and keeps you
Dancin'
Dancin'
Why don't you help me? 
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? 
To stand beside me

I keep on dancin'
Dancin'
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
I find myself alone, thinking just of you
You've got me dancin'
Dancin'
Why don't you help me?
Why don't you guide me?
Why don't you promise? 
To stand beside me

Dancin'
Dancin'
Dancin'
You've got me
Oh, help me
Guide me
Why don't you promise
To stand beside me
Help me, oh

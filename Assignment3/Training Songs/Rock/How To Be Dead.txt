Please don't go crazy, if I tell you the truth, 
No you don't know what happened, and you never, will, 
If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall, 
This blanket is freezing, its been out in the hall, 
Where you fight me for hours, 'til I'm sure what I want 
But darling I want the same thing, that I wanted before, 
So sweetheart tell me what's up, I won't stop, no way.

Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice, 
Its hardly what I'd be doing, if you gave me a choice, 
Its a simple suggestion, can you give me some time, 
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame?
'cause both my shoulders are heavy, from the weight of us both, 
You're a big boy now, so lets not talk about growth, 
You've not heard a single word I have said, Oh My God, 

Please take it easy, It can't all be my fault, 
I haven't made half the mistakes, that you've listed so far, 
Baby let me explain something, its all down to drugs, 
At least I remember taking them, and not a lot else, 
It seems I've stepped over lines, you've drawn again and again, 
but if the ecstasy's in, the wit is definitely out, 
Dr Jekyll is wrestling Hyde, for my pride.

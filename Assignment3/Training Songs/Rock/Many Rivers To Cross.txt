Many rivers to cross 
But I can`t seem to find 
My way over 
Wandering I am lost 
As I travel along 
The white cliffs of Dover 
Many rivers to cross 
And it`s only my will 
That keeps me alive 
I`ve been licked 
Washed up for years 
And I merely survive 
Because of my pride 
And this loneliness won`t leave me alone 
It`s such a drag to be on your own 
My man he left me but he wouldn't say why 
Well I guess, I have to try 
Many rivers to cross 
But just where to begin 
I`m playing for time 
There`ll be times I find myself 
Thinking of committing 
Some dreadful crime. 
And this loneliness won`t leave me alone 
It`s such a drag to be on your own 
My man he left me but he wouldn't say why 
Well I guess, I have to try, yeah yeah 
Rivers, rivers to cross 
Yeah yeah 
Rivers to cross

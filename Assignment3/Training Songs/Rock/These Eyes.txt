These eyes
These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, long to hold you, again
The hurting's on me yeah
But I will never be free, oh my baby no no

You gave a promise to me, yeah
And you broke it, you broke it, oh no

These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end
This heart, could not accept and pretend

The hurting's on me yeah
But I will never be free, no no no
You took the vow with me yeah
You spoke it, you spoke it
Babe

These eyes, are cryin'
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes,
Cry every night for you
These arms,
These arms want to hold you, hold you again

These eyes, are crying 
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you 

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of love, 
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

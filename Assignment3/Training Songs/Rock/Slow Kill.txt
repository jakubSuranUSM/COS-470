Don't cry on the bridge of starving
So cold, first light
Up here on the bridge of night
Forsake me but listen

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
For what

Up here on the bridge of night
To fall it would be so nice
Chase this misery out of this town
Bury my face into the ground

Now jump
Now jump
Jump

Into a smile mesmerised
She wants you
She wants you
Up here I can see for miles
Such a fire as burns inside
I'm up here because I wanted to die
I'm up here like a dying messiah
I'm up here because I wanted to die
I'm up here

I lie here
The pain
Don't cry
Now jump
Now jump
Jump

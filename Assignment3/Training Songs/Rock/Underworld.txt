Just another girl in the underworld.
Just another dream, something might have been, in the underworld.
In the underworld, it's a wicked world, wild world, the underworld.
Just another scene, only seventeen, in the underworld.
Down the road I've seen only broken dreams in the underworld.
And you're all alone, yeah, looking for hope, but the answer's no, no, no, the underworld.

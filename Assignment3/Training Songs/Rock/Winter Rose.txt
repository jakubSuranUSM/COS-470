Precious winter rose
Beautiful and rare
Precious winter rose
In the garden there

Now there's only thorns
In the garden there
All of the petals are tattered and torn
Scattered everywhere

And the hand that crushed
The winter rose was mine
Yes, the hand that crushed
The winter rose was mine

Yes, the hand that crushed
The winter rose was mine, was mine
Yes, the hand that crushed
The winter rose was mine, was mine
Was mine

The hand that crushed
The winter rose was mine

So beautiful and rare

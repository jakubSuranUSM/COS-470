If the smile on my face
Doesn't mean much anymore
Then it's all been just a waste of time
So won't you close your door?
But when I look into your eyes
I feel there's still something there
And something's all I need to hold on to
I can lie to myself
I still care
I still care about the way
And the little things you say
Won't you please come out to play?
I'm only dreaming

What good does dreaming do, when you're nowhere?
I got nobody to hold on to, yeah
But I keep on smiling, crying
See me walking down the street
Turn your head and walk away
'Cause by now you ought to know how I feel
And there's no more
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming

Hoo, haha
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Ooh, yeah

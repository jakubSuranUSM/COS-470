You're next in line to love me for the night
So say goodbye and leave me on high
Don't darken my door with your light.
Your long winded lies of a short mended life
I die by design on a dime.
Drag me along singing this song.
Bury my bones when the glory is gone
The infection has led to the heart and the head
The infection has led to the heart and the head

All my monuments of accomplishments
Are lost and left behind
How do I find an end,
I can't remember how this began
There's no loyalty in shooting stars
Just lawyer fees and failure scars
For every birth there is a death,
For every sunrise there is a set
Half past my prime that spark in my eye
Is discolored and oxidized
And all that resides is how to survive
And provide when this dream as died

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare

Don't darken my door with your light,
Long winded lies of a short mended life
I die by design on a dime.
Bury my bones when the glory is gone

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial

So say goodbye, you loved me for the night

Farewell welfare, farewell welfare
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial
We're dying in stereo from birth to burial

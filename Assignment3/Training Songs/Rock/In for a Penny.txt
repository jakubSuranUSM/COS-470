Do you remember the night in September
The two of us laid in the hay
Do you remember the day in December
And how we get carried away

If you're in for a penny
You gotta be in for a pound ooh
'Cos over and over
You play me that old fashioned sound
So look around
Play the refrain
Play it and play it and play it again

Did you discover that ooh I'm a lover
When we took a tumble or two
Where you surprised when you tried me for size
You bit off more than you could chew

If you're in for a penny
You gotta be in for a pound ooh
'Cos over and over
You play me that old fashioned sound
So look around
Play the refrain
Play it and play it and play it again

 Break 

Do you remember the night a surrendered
You wanted to paint me in oil
Do you are tender well do you remember
The sleepers could hear me for miles

If you're in for a penny
You gotta be in for a pound
'Cos over and over
You play me that old fashioned sound
So look around
Play the refrain
Play it and play it and play it again

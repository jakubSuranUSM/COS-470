I'm so cool, too bad I'm a loser
I'm so smart, too bad I can't get anything figured out
I'm so brave, too bad I'm a baby
I'm so fly, that's probably why it feels just like I'm falling for the first time

I'm so green, it's really amazing
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off me (all the dirt off me)
I'm so sane, it's drivin' me crazy
It's so strange I can't believe it feels just like I'm falling for the first time

Anyone perfect must be lying
Anything easy has it's cost
Anyone plain can be lovely
Anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction
What if I lost a sense of time
What if I nursed this infection
Maybe the worst is behind
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time

I'm so chill no wonder it's freezing
I'm so still I just can't keep my fingers out of anything (fingers out of anything)
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing
I'm so done, turn me over cause it feels just like I'm falling for the first time

Anything plain can be lovely
Anything loved can be lost
Maybe I lost my direction
What if our love is the cost
Anyone perfect must be lying
Anything easy has it's cost
Anyone plain can be lovely
Anyone loved can be lost
What if I lost my direction
What if I lost a sense of time
What if I nursed this infection
Maybe the worst is behind
Maybe the worst is behind

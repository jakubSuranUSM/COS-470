Get back, get back again and again
I've been here since I can remember when
My life is a boat, being blown by you
With nothing ahead, just the deepest blue

To me you're like a setting sun
You rise then you're gone
To me you're like a setting sun
You rise then you're gone

Come back, come back again and again
I've been here since I can remember when
Your world just spins whilst mine stands still
Nothing's changed in your gravity grave

To me you're like a setting sun
You rise then you're gone
To me you're like a setting sun
You shine then you're gone

To me you're like a setting sun
You shine then you're gone
To me you're like a setting sun
You shine then you're gone
But I want your life
So bright it burns my eyes
Sounds like the perfect way
To end my life
To me you're like a setting sun
To me you're like a setting sun

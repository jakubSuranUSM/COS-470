No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you
No more doggin' 
Foolin' around with you
I want to let you out baby 
'Cause that's what I have to do

Well I give you all my money 
Played me for a fool
You know pretty baby 
That's against daddy's rule

No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you
I'm gonna let you out baby 
'Cause that's what I have to do

Well you told me you loved me 
That was just a lie
I'll love you baby 
Until the day I die 

No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you
I'm gonna let you out baby 
'Cause that's what I have to do

Well I took you off the streets
And I made you fine
Spent all my money on 
Whiskey, beer and wine

No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you
I'm gonna let you out baby 
'Cause that's what I have to do

No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you
No more doggin'
Foolin' around with you

I'm gonna let you out baby 
'Cause that's what I have to do

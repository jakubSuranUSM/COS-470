There is a fire in the study 
Whisper in the dark 
Colors burning brighter, hunger for a spark 
? call me on the hearts 
To challenge the alive, and summon the asleep 
And the sun seems overexposed 
The sky explodes on the ?

[Chorus]
There's a new wild feeling dancing in the air 
There's a new wild everywhere! 
There's a new wild feeling dancing in the air 
There's a new wild everywhere! 

Rocks jump and jitter in bush surface roots 
Dream not clay in water ?
The man breaks, the spirit shakes 
Some things switches on 
Running independent, rushing ? men gone. 
And the sun seems overexposed 
The sky explodes on the ? 

[Chorus]

Fly up to the Heavens, anchored in the clouds 
Fly beyond the night, love the blooming sounds 
? and cries, neon lives wishing ?
Take a flight to wave in heights, turn on ?
And the sun seems ?
The sky explodes on the ?

[Chorus]

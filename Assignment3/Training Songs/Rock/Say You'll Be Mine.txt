Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

I just can't hide the truth no more
I've got to get my feet back down on the floor
I love you so
I need you so
I just don't think I can let you go

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

Well, it's you that keeps me feeling this way
I don't think I can take it even one more day
It don't seem right
That I should be alone tonight

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

I just can't hide the truth no more
I've got to get my feet back down on the floor
I love you so
I need you so
I just don't think I can let you go

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

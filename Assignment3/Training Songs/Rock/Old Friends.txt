It's like when you're making conversation 
And you're trying not to scream 
And you're trying not to tell 'em 
You don't care what they mean 
And you're really feeling fragile 
And you really can't get home 
And you really feel abandoned 
But you want to be alone 

[Chorus] 
Old Friends they shine like diamonds 
Old Friends you can always call 
Old Friends Lord you can't buy 'em 
You know it's Old Friends after all 

And when the house is empty 
And the lights begin to fade 
And there's nothing to protect you 
Except the window shade 
And it's hard to put your finger 
On the thing that scares you most 
And you can't tell the difference 
Between an angel and a ghost

[Chorus]

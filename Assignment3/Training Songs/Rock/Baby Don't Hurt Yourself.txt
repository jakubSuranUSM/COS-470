I know it's hard
When the evening starts
Fading
And your guiding star
Seems to be so far away

You've lost your touch
Spending far too much
Waiting
Now your weary heart
Slowly beats away

Start thinking
Start thinking now

Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself

Guess it takes some time
Maybe you should try
Thinking
Tomorrow looked so far
Only yesterday

Start thinking
Start thinking now

Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself
Baby don't hurt yourself

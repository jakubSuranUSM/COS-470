Fly, you greatest fool,
Why can't you say what they want you to?
Why can't you say what they want you to?
Why can't you do what they taught you
And show what they wanted of you?
Fly, you greatest fool,
Is this what everyone talked about?
You spill your high-flung phrases
And hush when the risk gets too much
And I, I wish you would do it,
Then I'd never have to notice 
If the bridges are burnt.
Then I'd never have to notice 
If the bridges are burnt.
Is this what everyone talked about?
Swallow everything that suits, 
Dress it up as truth,

Swallow it all down
And I, I wish you would do it,

Then I'd never have to notice 
If the bridges are burnt.
And I, I wish you would do it,
Then I'd never have to notice 
If the bridges are burnt.
Then I'd never have to notice 
If the bridges are burnt.
So cold out here

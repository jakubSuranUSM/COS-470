The stage is set, the race is on
To drink the cup 'til every drop is gone
And when you make it to the top
The hunger doesn't stop
You climb the ladder to success
The way the world defines it more or less
You find the grass is greener still
On someone else's hill
 
Diamonds and pearls
Silver and gold
Soon fade away
Empty and cold
Nothing remains of the things that we strive to attain
Only the love that is lasting will not be in vain
 
They say that pride's before the fall
The stakes are high, you know who takes it all
To make it through the needle's eye
You just can't live a lie

Diamonds and pearls
Silver and gold
Soon fade away
Empty and cold
Nothing remains of the things that we strive to attain
Only the love that is lasting will not be in vain

[Instrumental]

Diamonds and pearls
Silver and gold
Soon fade away
Empty and cold
Nothing remains of the things that we strive to attain
Only the love that is lasting will not be in vain

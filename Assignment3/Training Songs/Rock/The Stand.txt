Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand

Oh, I have been out searching with the black book in my hand
And I've looked between the lines that lie on the pages that I tread
I met the walking dude, religious, in his worn-down cowboy boots
He walked liked no man on earth
I swear he had no name (had no name)
I swear he had no name

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and make the stand

As I crawled beneath the searchlights
Looking through the floorboards of this life
I met Doctor Strangelove's cousin, he bore the marks of time
"Hey! Trashcan where you going boy?
Your eyes are feet apart
Is that the end you're carrying Shall I play the funeral march" (play the march)
"Play the funeral march"

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down,
Come on down and we'll make the stand

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, we'll make the stand

When I looked out the window
On the hardship that had struck
I saw the seven phials open, the plague claimed man and son
Four men at a grave in silence With hats bowed down in grace
A simple wooden cross, it had no epitaph engraved (it had no)
It had no epitaph engraved

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, we'll make the stand

Come roll out the red carpet come bugler sound the horn
The hero is returning gotta welcome him to his home
Don't say I didn't warn you, this prophecy's coming true
The cavalry is thundering riding over the hill
Riding over the hill

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on
And make the stand!

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand

Come on down and meet your maker (you got to meet your maker!)
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on 
And we'll make the stand

He don't deserve you but you will take him on
You might not know now how that could end up wrong
He'll leave you broken, afraid of what you've got
He'll be around you when you are all he's got

You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now

End it now
Or you'll never leave at all
You end it now
Or you'll never be alone

He doesn't want you
He just wants to have you around
You might not see all of the ways he's keeping you down
It's not your fault if you decide that you could leave
You keep on trying to move on from where you came in

You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now
You've got to leave, leave, leave
Leave him now

End it now
Or you'll never leave at all
You end it now
Or you'll never be alone

You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or never at all
You gotta go right now
Or he'll never let you 

Leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
You leave, leave, leave him now
Leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home
You leave him now and feel right at home

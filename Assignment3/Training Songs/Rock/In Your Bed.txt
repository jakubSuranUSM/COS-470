I don't want to party no more
Somehow that scene can be such a bore
I don't even want to paint the town red
I don't want to waste my time
Putting on dresses and drinking wine

I just wanna be in your arms instead
Let's lay in your bed and dream together
In a world of our minds
Just spending time in your bed
And walk forever in a silence divine
Just spending time in your bed

Little Annie makes things seem bright
When she spins sparkles all through the night
But I like you like the kind that grows inside
Get home so early the birds are in bed
There's a cyclone blowing through my hair

Well I just wanna be in your arms instead
Let's lay in your bed and dream together
In a world of our minds
Just spending time in your bed
And walk forever in a silence sublime
Just spending time in your bed

And dream forever in a world of our rhymes
Just spending time in your bed
And walk forever in a silence sublime
Just spending time

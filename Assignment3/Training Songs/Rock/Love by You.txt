Anybody looking on
They can see
I'm not so good
People in the know

They can see that I miss you
In the night
With no one to hear me cry
Seasons change
But there's nothing changes my mind

I've been loving you too long
And I can't seem to stop
You are my lifeline
You make me happy
I said that

I had to say it baby
Who on earth ever held me like you
I'd like to see someone try
Love by you
And no other loving will do

In your time
Baby come back to me
Don't lave this girl
Lost in space
You're the one who could
Guide me out of this maze

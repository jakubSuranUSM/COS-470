I'm damned if I voodoo, and I'm dead if I don't
Kick the crypt and baby walk with me 
And we'll find a new place to haunt
Now the dead can't die, they're not alive
I've got one walking by my side
It's a curse, a hex, tell me what comes next
Tie the noose around my neck

See you in the graveyard at midnight
Such a horrifying delight
Your ice-cold touch, it feels so right
And just last night
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie

Her stare is so demanding and her clothes are so commanding
She makes me feel like a kid in a candy shop
With my head on the butcher block
You're the only one for me, I'm in love with a decomposing zombie
Beauty's on duty in this horror movie
Make me spill my guts with just one touch

See you in the graveyard at midnight
Such a horrifying delight
Your ice-cold touch, it feels so right
And just last night
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie

She makes me do everything she wants me to
And that's okay with me because I'm walking with a zombie

See you in the graveyard at midnight
Such a horrifying delight
Your ice-cold touch, it feels so right
And just last night
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a zombie, zombie, zombie
I walked with a 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie

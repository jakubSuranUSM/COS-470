Money
She always gets a chance
Music
She sure knows how to dance

She's a high-flying woman so reach for the sky
She's gonna knock you down then pass on by

She's a high-stepping prancer
A tried true romancer
She's a little gandy dancer
And she's too much for me (Ow!)
Little gandy dancer

Broken
She left me with a broken heart
Spinnin'
I don't know how to start

She's a low-flying woman she dragged me around
She'll get you high on love then knock you down

She's a high-stepping prancer
A tried true romancer
She's a little gandy dancer
And she's too much for me (Ow! Ow!)
Little gandy dancer

Dance, dance, dance little gandy dancer 
Dance, dance, dance little gandy dancer 

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance 

Dance on, beauty

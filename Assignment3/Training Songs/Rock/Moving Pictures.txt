You'll sleep tonight
Dream dreams where I would die
It's alright, it's alright

They did not come true
Although they will do, in time
It's alright, it's alright

Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference? It's all, oh, oh
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you, oh, oh

Not real brown eyes look into mine
But I was so shy
It's alright

You'll sleep tonight
Dream dreams where I would die
It's alright, it's alright

Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference? It's all, oh, oh
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you, oh, oh

Guarded thoughts, firing off
Parting shots, missing lots
Guarded thoughts, firing off
Parting shots, missing lots

Fakes, liars and stars of moving pictures
What's the difference? It's all, oh, oh
Like all the parts that I'm not into
But I see in you, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

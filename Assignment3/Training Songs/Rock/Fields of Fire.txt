Between a father and a son
Between the city and the one
Before the teacher and the test
Before the journey and the rest
The shining eye will never cry
The beating heart will never die
The house on fire holds no shame
I will be coming home again

400 miles without a word until you smile
400 miles on fields of fire

Between a woman and a boy
Between a child and his toy

Between a woman and a boy
Between a child and a toy
Before the following of the west
Before the journey and the rest

400 miles without a word until you smile
400 miles without a word until you smile
400 miles on fields of fire

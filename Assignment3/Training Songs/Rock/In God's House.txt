In God's house I do wait
For my love on our wedding day
Dewy eyes and lashes long for my love
But I'm feeling something's wrong

What's this I see?
My baby's hand on the wheel
What's this I see?
Fire
Fire

Through this veil they can't see
The fog of death unveil me
Where's my boy? Why would he lie?
And leave me here in this church to cry?

What's this I see?
My baby died on the beach
What's this I see?
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

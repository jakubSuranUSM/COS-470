Something's in the air, empty as smoke that won't clear
Lowly burn, filled up car where you disappear
Secrets are a stain that mess up your mind 
That we love to play
Take your time, waste your time
While life slips away

Oh, what do you want to hear?
What do you want? 

Oh
Where can you go?
Where can you go?
Stuck in the undertone. 

Oh, no. 
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Stuck in the undertone.

Hold it with your hands, all of your hopes are in this one 
The silent stare that won't be there after you're done
The sun is coming up, shining on top
Of dying wheat
Lonely love, those tangled sheets 
Won't stop the bleed

Oh, what do you want to hear?
What do you want?

Oh
Where can you go?
Where can you go?
Stuck in the undertone.

Oh no
Won't let you go
Won't let you go
Stuck in the undertone.

Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?
Where can you go?
Can you swallow the sea?

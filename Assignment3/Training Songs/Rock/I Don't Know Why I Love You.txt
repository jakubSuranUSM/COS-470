I don't know why I love you
Your face is a hammer in my head
I remember every word you said
I just don't know why I love you

I don't know why I care
I never even liked your hair
I feel like a seven heir
But I don't know why I love you

Television turns me on
When the summer's hot
And the spirit's thrown
How can I get close to you 
When you got no mercy
No, you got mercy
No you got no...

I don't know why I love you
Your face is a foreign food
I really don't know if I should
I just don't know why I love you

I don't know why I care
I duck and I weave and I fight
I work just to treat you right
God, I don't know why I love you

Ha, ha, ha

I don't know why I love you
It might be your soul and your heart (not sure about "your soul and your heart")
Maybe it's the way that you speak
I don't why I love you

Television turns me on
When the summer's hot
And the spirit's thrown
So, how can I get close to you 
When you got no mercy
No, you got mercy
No you got no...

I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I care
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
And I don't know why I care

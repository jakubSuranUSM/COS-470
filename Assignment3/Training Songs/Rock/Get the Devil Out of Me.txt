I don't know what to feel, I don't know what to say
Ooh, I don't know what to do, what makes me treat you this way

Oh I get numb in my bones, oh I get numb in my heart
Why don't you leave me alone before I tear you apart?

I'm no Jesus Christ, I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I apologize, it's your destiny to get the devil out of me

Oh I don't know what to do, it always ends the same way
Though I've been here before, I know the rules to this game

And though I try not to lose, in the end I will fall
Better to have you in tears than not to have you at all

I'm no Jesus Christ, I'm the one mistake that you love to hate 
I'm no Jesus Christ, I'm the one mistake that you love to hate 
I apologize, it's your destiny to get the devil out of me

If you think I'm hard to handle (you give up so easily)
I just need a good example (to be what I used to be)

Get the devil out of me

I'm no Jesus Christ, I'm the one mistake that you love to hate
I apologize, it's your destiny to get the devil out of me

Everyone's feelin' crazy, but no one takes the chance
When there's a knock on the floor, the whole world starts to dance
A fireman rushes over, he's got stretchmarks on his hose
And he punched out the light under everybody's nose

Oh, oh, it's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
Oh, oh, it's alright, yeah it's just alright

The music was gettin' louder, until you could not hear a sound
So turn it up if you want when the record starts spinnin' around and around and around

And you can dance on my face if you want to
It's alright, it's alright
And if you're feelin' much the same way as i do

It's alright, yeah, it's just alright
The whole world's goin' crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Hey baby, you want to go crazy with me

The ladies smoked the whiskey, and the butler ate the wine
New York, that's alright, but to keep it down more divine

The whole world's goin' crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Hey baby, you want to go crazy with me
And you can dance on my face if you want to
It's alright, it's alright (everybody)
'Cause if you're feelin' just as crazy as i do
It's alright, yeah, it's just alright
Oh, oh, it's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
Oh, oh, it's alright, yeah it's just alright

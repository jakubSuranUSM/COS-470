Rico! Youngblood! Wake up
Prohibition is over, but the country's still a mess
They need us out there, we've got some cleaning up to do
Especially when it comes to this guy

Get those sport coats on with the big lapels
They're back, they're fashionable again
Okay, let's look at some mug-sheets
From the suspects from the 80's

Admiral Poindexter
Get back on Felix The Cat where you belong
Get the damn pipe out of your mouth
You're history, you're gone

Oliver North, no 'Secret Government' for you, buddy
You're over, you're through
Bill Casey, you're dead, I mean it
Bush, you're still a wimp, I'm sorry, you're history

Deaver, Nofziger
You're crooks, book 'em Dano
Dano? How'd he get in the show?
Get outta here

Reagan, you're asleep, wake up
The country's in a mess
You're history anyway, buddy
You're meat, you're through

You're vapor, you're baloney without the mayo
Buddy, you're outta here
In fact, it's Robin Leach who said, "I don't know why"
Hey, fellas, take me to the bridge, I want it now

Rico! Youngblood, let's get outta here, it's all over
The Untouchables

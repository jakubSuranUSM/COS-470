I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me 
On my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me
'Cause I'm dead and bloated

I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me 
On my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me
'Cause I'm dead and bloated

Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
Oh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'

I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me 
On my birthday deathbed

I am trampled under sole of another man's shoes
Guess I walked too softly

Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
Ohh yeah, and she says it's natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run

You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm thinkin'

I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me 
On my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me
'Cause I'm dead and bloated

I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I run through the world thinkin' 'bout tomorrow, thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me 
On my birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me, somebody gave me,
Somebody gave me on
My birthday deathbed

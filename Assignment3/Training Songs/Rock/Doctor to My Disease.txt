I've been treated for mild depression
And I've been treated for growing pains.
I've been treated for hallucinations;
Now I can see it all coming again.
Well, you can wind me up. 
Yeah, you can slow me down.
You can dig a little, and you can mess me around.
But there's one thing I should tell you, 
To which you must agree:
There's no use you playing doctor to my disease.
Said it's no use you playing doctor to my disease.

I got no cure for this condition,
That you've been causing me tonight.
Well, you put my heart in overdrive:
Hand me the bullet I must bite.
You can stir me up and you can cut me down.
You can probe a little, push that knife around.
But there's one thing I should tell you, 
To which you must agree:
It's no use you playing doctor to my disease.
No use you playing doctor to my disease,
No use you playing doctor to my disease.

Do you have to break my engine
So you can fix it up again?
Tuned to crazy imperfection
Just to score me out of ten.
Well, you can wind me up. 
Yeah, you can slow me down.
You can dig a little. 
Yeah, you can mess me around.
But there's one thing I should tell you, 
To which you must agree:
That it's no use you playing doctor to my disease,
No use you playing doctor to my disease,
No use you playing doctor to my disease.

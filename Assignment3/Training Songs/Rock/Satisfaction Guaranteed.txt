Mystery surrounds me, and I wonder where I'm going
There's a cloud above me and it seems to hide the way
I'm going straight ahead, 'cause it's the only way I know
I want to leave the past, and leave just for today

Now then tell me baby, do you need my love?
Tell me baby, are you thinking of me?
Tell me baby, what it is you need?
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed?

Sitting in the gutter with my head wrapped in my hands
I've been drinking all night, and I just can't stand the pain
It took an awful lot of trouble just to make me understand
Now it's clear to me, but will it ever be the same?

Now then tell me baby, do you need my love?
Tell me baby, are you thinking of me?
Tell me baby, what it is you need?
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed?

Now then tell me baby, do you need my love?
Tell me baby, are you thinking of me?
Tell me baby, what it is you need?
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed?

Head upon the highway, just as fast as I could go
I rode through the night, and halfway through the day
I had no direction I didn't even want to know where I was going
The only thing I knew, was that I had to get away

Now then tell me baby, do you need my love?
Tell me baby, are you thinking of me?
Tell me baby, what it is you need?
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed?

Tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby, do you need my love?
Now that I'm here, yeah, do you need, do you need my love?

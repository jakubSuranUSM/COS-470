I built a little love nest, we set it on fire
Down came the tree that held our desire
Now there's no one home on this broken branch
So I'm movin' on

And I'm not done with these passionate chains
I'm draggin' them around town making such a sad sound, baby
You better look out mama 'cause I'm so strung out
Swinging from these chains of love

I got a dirty little story if you really want to hear
About a dirty little bird that used to come around here
But the booze dried up and the car won't start
So I'm movin' on

And I'm not done with these passionate chains
And I'm draggin' them around town making such a sad sound, baby
You better look out mama 'cause I'm so strung out
Swinging from these chains of love

Chains of love
Keeping me from the ground
Chains of love
Swinging from these chains

I caught a little bird, I grabbed her and kissed her
Boy, was I surprised when I seen your sister
But when the sun goes down all cinnamon brown
I'm movin' on

And I'm not done with these passionate chains
And I'm draggin' them around town making such a sad sound, baby
You better look out mama 'cause I'm so strung out
Swinging from these chains of love

Swinging from the chains of love
Swinging from the chains of love
Swinging from the chains of love
Swinging from the chains of love
Swinging from the chains of love

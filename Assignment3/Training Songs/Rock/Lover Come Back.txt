Bound for trouble from the start
I've been walking through this old world in the dark
All along right by my side
There you were shining, my ray of light

So, I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
Lover come back, lover come back to me

I'll never be as good as I'd like to be
Eternally restless refusing to believe
But I think that we missed our connection
I wanted to feel your affection
Until my final days

I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
Lover come back, lover come back to me

I am warm enough yet I still shiver
I am fed but still I starve
You know me I am the great misgiver
Always waiting on the clouds to part

I sing lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
So lover come back, lover come back to me

Lover come back, lover come back to me
Won't you ever come back, ever come back to me
How could I have been so foolish to let you leave
So lover come back, lover come back to me

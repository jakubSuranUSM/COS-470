I'd sell your heart to the junkman 
Baby, for a buck, for a buck
If you're looking for someone to pull you uut of that ditch
You're out of luck, you're out of luck

Ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking

There's leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers

God's away, God's away
God's away on business
Business
God's away, God's away
God's away on business
Business

Digging up the dead with a shovel and a pick
It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with a plague and a flood
Join the mob, join the mob

It's all over, it's all over, it's all over

And there's a leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business 
Business
God's away, God's away
On Business
Business, ha

Goddamn there's always such a big temptation
To be good, to be good
There's always free cheddar in a mousetrap, baby
It's a deal, it's a deal
God's away, God's away, God's away
On business 
Business

God's away, God's away, God's away
On business 
Business

I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby
Let her ring, let her ring

God's away, God's away
God's away on business
God's away, God's away
God's away on business, business

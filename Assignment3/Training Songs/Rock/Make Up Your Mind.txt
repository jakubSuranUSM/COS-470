A lonely evening settles down 
There's no escape here â€˜cause now I drown 
In all that memories that float inside 
And keep me burning 
A raging chaos in my head 
I throw my blanket from my bed 
There ain't no rest and there ain't no peace 
I'm thinking about you 

The burnt-out end of a smoky day 
I have to go now, cannot stay 
I'm trying hard not to lose my way 
That takes me backwards 

It could be heaven, could be hell 
But she's in doubt and she cannot tell 
If we're together or apart 
No final answer 
And now I'm staring at the phone 
Time is frozen, I'm on my own 
I'm sitting here completely paralyzed 
I'm in slow-motion 

Do you remember the time when our hearts could fly 
Stretching our souls across the wide wide sky 
My self and my soul they were the very best friends 
But now they're apart and never shake their hands 

This is an SOS 
This is an SOS 

Make up your mind 
Don't keep me burning 
I'm trying so hard to gain ground 
Make up your mind 
Don't keep me yearning 
I'm down on my knees 
(Down on my knees)

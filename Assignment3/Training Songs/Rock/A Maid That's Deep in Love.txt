I am a maid that's deep in love???
But yes I can complain
???I have in this world but one true love
???And Jimmy is his name???
And if I do not find my love
???I'll mourn most constantly???
And I'll find and follow Jimmy thro'
???The lands of liberty
??????Then I'll cut off my yellow hair???
Men's clothing I'll wear on
???I'll sign to a bold sea captain
???My passage I'll work free???
And I'll find and follow Jimmy thro'
???The lands of liberty
??????One night upon the raging seas
???As we were going to bed
???The captain cried 
\"Farewell my boy,???
I wish you were a maid???
Your rosy cheeks, your ruby lips???
They are enticing me???
And I wish dear God with all my heart
???A maid you were to me''??????
\"Then hold your tongue, dear captain
???Such talk is all in vain???
And if the sailors find it out???
They'll laugh and make much game
???For when we reach Columbia shore
???Some prettier girls you'll find
???And you'll laugh and sing and you'll court with them???
For courting you are inclined\"??????
It was no three days after???
Our ship it reached the shore???
\"Adieu my loving captain
???Adieu for evermore???
For once I was a sailor on sea???
But now I am a maid on shore
???So adieu to you and all of your crew???
With you I'll sail no more''??????
\"Come back, come back, my own pretty maid???
Come back and marry me???I have ten thousand pounds in gold
???And that I'll give to thee
???So come back, come back, my own pretty maid???
Come back and marry me''

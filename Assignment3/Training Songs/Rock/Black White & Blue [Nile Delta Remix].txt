Time is never easy when you’re alone
Your mother, she always told you to hold your own
'Cause this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
'Cause this is real life

On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white & blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white & blue for you

Life inside your head has come undone
Your soul descent to madness has just begun
But this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
'Cause this is real life

On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white & blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white & blue for you

Waking from a strange dream
Spinning cause you had too much last night
No communication,
Wondering if you’ll ever feel alright

But this is real life, oh no
You can’t fight it, oh no
'Cause this is real life

On and on through the night and the milky way
It’s black and white & blue for you
Now and then when you cry
It will always be black and white & blue for you

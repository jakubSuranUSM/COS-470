I was encased in an aircraft 
 Feeling so sick I couldn't say 
 When the cat next to me 
 Said let's take it down to Cuba way 
 Well his manner wasn't nice 
 But his hand grenades looked very mean 
 And the luger down his trousers 
 Well that was twice as obscene 
 When we touched down in Cuba 
 The temp was a 105Â° 
 Though the cantenna was closed 
 Even I was glad to be alive 
 As for two weeks in Miami 
 I sussed then that they were blown 
 Dr. Fidel wasn't home 
 So they showed us where the sugar was grown 
 Chorus Havana Bound hi-jacked by some joker 
 Took me down to Cuba 
 Where the grass was green 
 [Solo] 
 Well the passport man came up to me 
 And he really looked sly 
 Well he chalked on my valise 
 And then the cat let me by 
 Well I didn't mean to immigrate here 
 I told him all so quiet 
 But he gave me my visa 
 But then he wanted me to buy it 
 [Chorus]

Picture they took of you in your cowboy hat 
Makes you look like you are one of the boys 
Out on a Saturday night, meanwhile on the outskirts of the dance hall 
I'm a joke that you'd probably enjoy 
On the outside of Memphis all the building look big 
And the white picket fences all dare to charge around the lawn 
And hold their heads up high when my headlights find them out 
They'll be the first to put their hands in the air with my radio on 
Singing a country song soft and low 

Oh when I've got a worried mind I know 
I hear the ghost of Patsy Cline 
On the Grand Old Opry Show 

Living on the edge of the city limit line 
This is where the boundary finally ends 
And I swear that we're the last living souls in a populated ghost town 
All the billboards are our best friends 
Which way did our last chance go and can we 
Get out if we go right now? 
It seems that with the malls and the mega-church stadiums 
We would get out if we knew just how with the radio on 

Standing in line to get my self-help book signed off 
On by the reverend who shouts to the converted 
Have mercy on this boy he did it all by the book 
But still kind of has his doubts 
Oh you look pretty good in that jonquil dress 
But your smile is a wooden nickel's pride 
and I know that it ain't worth much but I feels good to touch 
And I think that I could dance if I tried with your radio on 

Oh when I've got a worried mind I know 
I hear the ghost of Patsy Cline 
On the Grand Old Opry Show

Long John Silver ring in his ear
He's the hero, make that clear
Does the same thing his father did
Sailing around the Caribbean
Robing king with his talking parrot
This time I think he's on the high side
Scabs are forming, scraped his knee
Guards are warning a bad man is free
He's like electric clock that needs no winding
Keeps the time without your hands
Western feet need no binding take
A barefoot run through old Japan
He's seen a thousand countries
They're all the same
Some men crazy, some men sane
But all men are ruled by a flag or a game
He knows Nobody's got you
If you don't sign your name
Long John Silver serves no king
No land holds him, that's why he feels like singing
Every country now and then
Roars like Irish, drunk and singing
Every monk will now and then
Call his men to hear the wenches night bells ringing

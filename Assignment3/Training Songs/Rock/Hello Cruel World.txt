Hello cruel world, so this is you
A broken heart, but with a view
I'm looking out to face another day
The angry mob, the happy mass

This birthday cake may be the last
I'm looking out to find another way
Norman Rockwell colors fade
All my favorite things have changed

Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world
I thought I heard an opera star
Who had no home under the stars

She sang and sang and sang the night away
And Mother Nature changed her name
She doesn't want to play the game
I don't believe she'll ever be the same

So Big Brother never came
Howdy Doody gets the blame
Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world

Bad and beautiful and strange
Monkeys dancing in a cage
Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world

Venus DeMilo grew an arm
And Old MacDonald bought the farm
Say goodbye
Hello cruel world

Norman Rockwell colors fade
All my favorite things have changed
Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world

Bad and beautiful and strange
Monkeys dancing in a cage
Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world

Say goodbye
Hello cruel world
Well, what the hell
Hello cruel world

Hello, hello...
Hello cruel world

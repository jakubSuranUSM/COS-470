You say you want drama
I'll give you drama
You say you want muscle
I'll give you nerve
You want sugar
Would you settle for honey?
You want romance
Would you settle for love?

Would you settle for love? 
Would you settle for love?
Would you settle for love or do you need
All that meaningless stuff
Would you settle for love?
Would it be enough?
Baby, would you settle for love?

You say you want fire
I'll give you fever
You want kisses
I'll give you all I got
You want diamonds
I'll give you rhinestones
And you want romance
Would you settle for love?

Would you settle for love?
Would you settle for love?
Would you settle for love or do you need
All that meaningless stuff
Would you settle for love? 
Would it be enough?
Baby, would you settle for love?

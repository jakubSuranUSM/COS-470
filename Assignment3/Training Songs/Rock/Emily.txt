You never were going to change your mind, were you, Emily? 
You just sat back, took it all for you, there was nothing for me; 
I didn't mean to prove that all I can do is lose 

Next time that you need me, don't call me up, Emily; 
I'm tired of your lies and your cheating ways with me; 
And every time you go, please don't let me know 

Emily, you still live inside of me; 
And, Emily, you are the fire in my tree; 
So if you should fall, please don't call; 
And next time you write, I won't stay up all night; 
'cause Emily you, just look at you - you're a tragedy 

You never were going to change you mind, were you, Emily? 
You just sat back, took it all for you, and nothing was there for me; 
I didn't mean to prove that all I'm good for is to lose 

Emily, you still live inside of me; 
And, Emily, you are the fire in my tree; 
So next time you fall, please don't call; 
And next time you write, I won't stay up all night; 
'cause Emily you, just look at you - you're a tragedy 

You never were going to change you're mind were you, anyway

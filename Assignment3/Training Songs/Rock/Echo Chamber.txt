(Echo, echo, echo, echo) 

No 
Have you heard the word no, no, no? 
I thought so 
'Cause everybody says yes 
Everywhere you go 

You know 
If you always must know what's right 
You will end up 
You will end up among the ones 
Who always are wrong 

Remember a star that shone so bright 
But now his glare fills me with fright 
And now I actually fear 
That something's gone wrong with your ears 
I'm singing 

Step out, step out of your echo chamber 
Step out, step out of your echo chamber 
Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late 
'Cause I miss you so 

(Echo, echo, echo, echo) 

You 
You always stayed among the ones 
Not so strong 
Too eager to belong 
To object when you were wrong 

When 
When will you ever get sick of 
Listening to repeats 
Of what you have said? 
You better listen instead 
To folks who think with their own head 

I never want to be your foe 
I just want to say I miss you so 
How long will you stay in there? 
I just wish that you could hear me singing 

Step out, step out of your echo chamber 
Step out, step out of your echo chamber 
Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late 
'Cause I miss you so 

(Step out, step out of your) echo chamber 
Oh, step out, step out of your echo chamber 

Step out (step out) 
Before you go crazy 
Before you go crazy 

Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late (late) 
Before it is too late 
'Cause I miss you so

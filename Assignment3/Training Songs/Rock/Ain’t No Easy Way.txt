It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know your done
You got easy eyes to hunt 
When the world above needs your blood
And the cold vain to the richest man
They're paid away to steal our hand
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When your on your luck you know your done
And the last kiss had a foolish cause
Straight tired eyes could only haunt
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
Its easy to fall in love when you fall in love you know your done

Nothing but good 'bout Mary Ann
Who satisfies a one like no-one can
Her face like a rocks
Her words like chimes
This is dedicated to you
And the sweet things that you do

Searching for peace I used to be
Peace is the thing she gave to me
Suppose we didn't meet, where would I be?

Where would I be?
Hey
This is dedicated to you
And the sweet things that you do

Hey! 
This is dedicated to you

This is dedicated to you

This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you!

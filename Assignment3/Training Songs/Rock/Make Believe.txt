Won't you lay in this bed with me
Make believe that nothing's wrong
Fill the air with only good memories
Of a time when we were strong

Would you smile and stare back at me
To the loose side of the truth
'Cause I'm finding it hard to believe
It's the last time I will ever see you

And you wear your heart right there on your sleeve
I never saw us falling apart, I never could believe
And I know you're tired and it's the end for you and me
Won't you love me one last time
Make believe you're mine
Make believe you're mine
Make believe you're mine

Won't you wrap your arms around me
Think back to two long years ago
Back to the day you found me
Back to holding me close

You say we'll never fall apart, but will we ever know?
You said you'll never break my heart, now you're letting me go

And you wear your heart right there on your sleeve
I never saw us falling apart, I never could believe
And I know you're tired and it's the end for you and me
Won't you love me one last time
Make believe you're mine

You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe

Make believe you're mine
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
Make believe you're mine
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
Make believe you're mine
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I never could, I never could, could believe
Make believe you're mine

And you wear your heart right there on your sleeve
I never saw us falling apart, I never could believe
And I know you're tired and it's the end for you and me
Won't you love me one last time

And you wear your heart right there on your sleeve
I never saw us falling apart, I never could believe
And I know you're tired and it's the end for you and me
Won't you love me one last time
Make believe you're mine (You wear your heart on your sleeve)
Make believe you're mine (You wear your heart on your sleeve)
Make believe you're mine (You wear your heart on your sleeve)
Make believe you're mine (You wear your heart on your sleeve)
Make believe you're mine (You wear your heart on your sleeve)

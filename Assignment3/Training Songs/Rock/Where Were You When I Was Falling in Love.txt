When your eyes met mine, 
I knew that I had better play it cool,
I'm doing my best trying to resist
'Cause I ain't no fool.

Where in the world did you come from baby?
You waited just a little too long
To look my way.
Now it's a little too late.

Where were you
When I was falling in love?
I was looking for you, baby.
Where were you
When I was falling in love?
Looking for you, baby.
If I'd ever looked in those eyes before,
We'd be together tonight I'm sure.
Where were you
When I was falling in love?
Where were you
Lost and looking for love?

If I'd have met you sooner,
I'd be talking to you and playing the game.
But the best thing for me to do
Is get up and leave without knowing your name.
It might have been something special, baby,
Something only people in love could understand,
Like this ring on my hand.

I used to see those red tail lights
Heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way

Looking back on those summer nights
I was wasting time, fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay

Oh, but that night I met you
The night you came through made me realize
There's no way I could leave
You made me believe and now when I look in your eyes

I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby, I would walk through fire

It's crazy how these things work out
I used to think I had no chance
And I somehow thought you'd slip away

You pulled me through the fear and doubt
Gave me all I'm looking for
Everything I needed to stay

How could something so good
Something so simple, get serious?
How could someone so right come into my life
And now I just want you to know

I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby, I could walk through fire

And I would go anywhere, I would do anything
I do what you want me to, you know that I would
I want you to know that whenever you need me, yeah
Ooh, wherever you are, no matter how far
You know I'll be coming for you

I could walk through fire, I could feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, to get right back to you
And when the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
And baby, I could walk through fire

Baby, I could walk through fire, right back to you
And I could walk through fire, and I could walk through fire
And I could walk through fire, right back to you, yeah

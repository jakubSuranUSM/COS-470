Attention thrills, and then it kills
They make you king, and make you I'll
'Til you're alone, dead on your throne

So my idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone

Now is the season for war with no reason
Now is the season for war with no reason

They break your skin, when you're a kid
They steal your soul, and keep it hid
And that is why, I hate mankind

'Cause my idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone

My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun

My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun

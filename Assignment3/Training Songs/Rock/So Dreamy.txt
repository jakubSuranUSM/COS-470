How was I to know 
That from our very first hello 
I'd feel so dreamy (so dreamy) 
You came rushing in 
With all the promises of spring 
When I was lonely (so lonely) 
Everything seemed new
Almost unreal because of you 
I felt so dreamy (so dreamy) 
Love had come to me 
So very unexpectedly 
I was so lonely (so lonely) 

Dreamy every time 
I hear you say that you'll be mine 
Until the end of time 
All I ever knew could never be compared to you 
And it's all far behind 
Dreamy for a while 
Each time you make me realize 
That all I see is real 
I could never find the words to say 
The way I feel 

Hello morning sun 
Another day has just begun 
And it's all dreamy (so dreamy) 
Where can I begin to say the love I feel within 
I feel so dreamy (so dreamy) 

Dreamy every time 
I hear you say that you'll be mine 
Until the end of time 
All I ever knew could never be compared to you 
And it's all far behind 
Dreamy for a while 
Each time you make me realize 
That all I see is real 
I could never find the words to say 
The way I feel

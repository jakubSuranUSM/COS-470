Hard times, hand to mouth, down and out,
All those hard times
But we've seen the seasons turning
As we weathered every storm
And the climate of our loving
Is so tender and so warm

And the best is yet to come
This is only the beginning
And we've only just begun
To realize the best is yet to come

Heartache, more or less useless,
All the heartache
But when the flood of sudden tears came down
We smiled and stood our ground
And the laughter we'd been counting on
It finally came around

And the best is yet to come
And it's getting so much better
Than anything I've known
And I know, oh, yes 
The best is yet to come

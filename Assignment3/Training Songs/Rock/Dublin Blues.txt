I wish I was in Austin 
In a chilly parlor bar 
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not carin' where you are 
But here I sit in Dublin 
Just rollin' cigarettes 
Holdin' back and chokin' back 
The shakes with every breath 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye 

I am just a poor boy 
Work's my middle name 
If money was a reason 
I would not be the same 

I'll stand up and be counted 
I'll face up to the truth 
I'll walk away from trouble 
But I can't walk away from you 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye

I have been to Fort Worth 
I have been to Spain 
I have been to proud 
To come in out of the rain 

I have seen the David 
I've seen the Mona Lisa too 
I have heard Doc Watson 
Play Columbus Stockade Blues 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye

I wish I was in Austin 
In a chilly parlour bar 
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not carin' where you are

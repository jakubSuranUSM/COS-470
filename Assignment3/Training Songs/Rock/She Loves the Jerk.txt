We've talked it to death, cryin' on the telephone.
Nights when he drinks at home, she has to whisper throught her tears.
"Johnny," she says, "you'd never do these things to me."
But I can never make her see he's wasted such precious years.
Well, "you married the wrong guy" is all I ever say. 

[Chorus]
He's a no good so and so, but she'll never let him go
Though she knows it will never work, she loves the jerk.
She loves the jerk. 

He was the guy always out on the make.
I guess he had what it takes to turn the heads of pretty girls.
She thought he would change; the worst of us will settle down.
But he couldn't stay out of town, not even with this precious pearl
Now she lives with the lies and the bumps and the bruises. 

[Chorus]
 
Well, I hang up the phone and I pretend she's in my arms.
What I wouldn't give for just one-tenth of what she gives Mister Charming. 

[Chorus] 

He's a no good so and so, but she'll never let him go.
Though she knows it will never work, she loves the jerk

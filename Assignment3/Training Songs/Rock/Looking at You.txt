When it happened, Something Snapped inside me
Made me wanna hide
All on my own, all on my own
I stood up on the stand my eyes shut tight

Didn't wanna see anybody
Feeling alright, having a good time heh
Doing alright, doing alright
Doing alright, doing alright

I saw into the dancing crowd
Felt like screaming out loud
I saw you standing there
Saw your long, your long hair yeah

Opened up my eyes baby
You made me realize what I wanna do now
I wanna do now babe, looking at you
Looking at you babe, looking at you
Looking at you, looking at you baby

You baby (x6)

Yeah yeah

(repeat verse 2) (with 9 extra "you baby" s)

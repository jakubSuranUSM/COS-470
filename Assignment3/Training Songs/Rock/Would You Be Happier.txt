Have you ever wonder where the story ends
And how it all began? I do
(I do, I do, I do)
Did you ever dream you were the movie star
With popcorn in your hand? I did
(I did, I did, I did)

Do you ever think you're someone else inside
When no one understands? You are
(You are)
And wanna disappear inside a dream
But never wanna wake, wake up
And then you stumble on tomorrow
And trip over today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part?
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
You're gonna be just fine
(Gonna be just fine)

Are you not afraid to tell your story now
But everyone is gone? It's too late
(Too late, too late)
Was everything you've ever said or done
Not the way you planned a mistake?
And so you promised that tomorrow be different than today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part?
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?

You're gonna be just fine
(You're gonna be just fine)
I think you're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be just fine
(Fine)
So don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)

You're racing for tomorrow
Not finished with today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part?
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
I think you're gonna be just fine
(Gonna be just fine)

Would we be happier if we were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if we played a bigger part?
Would we be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
I think we're gonna be just fine
(Gonna be just fine)
I think you're gonna be just fine

Don't worry, baby
(You're gonna be just fine)
Don't worry, honey
(You're gonna be just fine)
Don't worry, baby
(You're gonna be just fine)

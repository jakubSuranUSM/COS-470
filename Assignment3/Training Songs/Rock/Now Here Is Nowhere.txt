Aging eyesore
Nearly nowhere
Found, unearthed
A moment burst with all of us
Relfecting dust in the oh, most high (oh, most high)
As morning light bled
Over glass white
Burned out daylight
Plain and just
As I turned, it thurst its softly worn
The newly born
In the hardly there (hardly there)

Who rests
In dust?

Who moves
In air?

(Our lives
Erased
Our lives
Erased
Our lives
Our lives
Our lives)

Swollen nowhere
Breathes,
Laughs
Don't you see?

All this time (all this time)
All this space (all this space)
All these words

(Our lives
Our lives)

(Swollen nowhere
Breathes,
Laughs
Don't you see?)

(All this time
All this space
All these words)

Move my feet
And touch my sole
Bass sound drum beat
Rock`and roll
Just play that music
I don`t care what key it`s in
Where it`s come from
Where it`s been
Just play that music

I don`t need to see your face
I don`t need no autographs
I can`t play your interviews
Can`t hear your photographs

You don`t need to be profound
In fact don`t speak
Just play that sound
Just play that music
I`ll turn on my radio
If you`ve got a great live show
Just play that music

If it`s hitting make it stick
Do your job just play music
Critics mags and interviews
Who cares about bad reviews

Does it have to be so tame
Do I have to twist and shout
Do we have to play this game
Or be down and out
It don`t have to look the same
I keep trying to tell `em
It don`t have to all sound lame
I sing the song you sell `em

If it`s hitting make it stick
Do your job just play music
If you need an ear to lend
I`ve got the cash to spend

Move my feet
And touch my sole
Bass sound drum beat
Rock and roll
Just play that music

I don`t care what key it`s in
Where it`s come from
Where it`s been
Just play that music

Does it have to be so tame
Do I have to twist and shout
Do we have to play this game
Or be down and out
It don`t have to look the same
I keep trying to tell `em
It don`t have to all sound lame
I sing the song you sell `em

Does it have to be so tame
Do I have to twist and shout
Do we have to play this game
Or be down and out
It don`t have to look the same
I keep trying to tell `em
It don`t have to all sound lame
I sing the song you sell `em

Just play that music!
Just play that music
I won`t refuse it
I`d like to tell ya
Just play that music!
Stay on that feeling
Don`t you loose it
Stay on the stageing
Just play that music!
Don`t you loose it
Just play that music!
Some like theYankee sound
Just play that music!
Sometimes from London town
Just play that music!
I`ve seen the that alley ground
Just play that music!
Sometimes from London town
Just play that music!

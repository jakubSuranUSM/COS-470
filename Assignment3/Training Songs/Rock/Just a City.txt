(words t.bryn/music t.bryn, m. jones)

it's so near to me
It's so dear to me
I see it in my sleep

and I always know if I've no where to go
It's somewhere I could be

I see you at night in the city light
But it could change so easily

chorus

it's just a city
And on night like this I feel small in this world
It's just a city and I am just a girl

it seems to me that once you stop walking
You don't want to know, you stop wanting to see
Your eyes get used to the same old story
Once you stop talking strangers

chorus

out of place out of time
Nothing to hold me nothing mine
But I'm always told "there's no hurry don't go
There's nothing but time "but how do they know?

chorus

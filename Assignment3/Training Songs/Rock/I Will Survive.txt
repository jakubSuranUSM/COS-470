At first I was afraid, I was petrified
I kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong, I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that, that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock 
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. 

Oh now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Do you think I'd lay down and die? 

Oh not I, I will survive
Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive. 
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive 

I will survive
Yeah, yeah...

(SOLO) 

It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart,
I'm tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself, 
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high. 

And you'll see me with somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free,
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me, 

Oh now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Do you think I'd lay down and die? 

Oh not I, I will survive
Yeah, as long as I know how to love I know I'll be alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive 

I will survive
Yeah, yeahâ€¦

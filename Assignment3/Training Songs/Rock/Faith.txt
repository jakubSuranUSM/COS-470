I'm in to deep
That is way I feel in need
Open up your heart to me
You're surreal

Faith let me linger on
Faith let me linger
Keep me hanging on

Can we embrace
The love we face
If we let the things we fear
Disappear

Faith let me linger on
Faith let me linger
Keep me hanging on

Hold on to me
There's more than you ever saw
Hold on to me
Yeah because I'm in too deep
How could you hurt me baby

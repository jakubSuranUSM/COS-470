Though I try, I can't decide 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 

The tears pour down in the nights spent awake 
Salvation in sleep always seems to escape 
I look down at your picture in pieces thrown across my room 
The future was hidden in the cards we were dealt 
How could you cheat on the love that I felt? 
I sink my head in my pillow, confused about what I'll do about you 

Though I try, I can't decide 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 
Can't you see what you mean to me 
Won't walk away, walk away from you 
Whoa, from you 

I can't see an end to the pain that I'm in 
The alibis you handed me seemed mighty thin 
Clear the lump from my throat, read your letter just one more time 
I haven't been asleep for a week 'cause it seems 
That I can't close my eyes, you're there in my dreams 
I throw your number in the trash, confused about what I'll do about you 

Addicted to your love like a martyr is to pain 
Like a sinner craves a vice and a drug need a vein 
Am I giving you the blade and begging you to run me through? 
Well, I'm the type of man who believes in the fight 
I know what is wrong and I'd die for what's right 
I'll make you understand if it's the last thing I do 
Whoa, that I love you 

No, I just can't walk away, walk away from you 
Though I try, I just can't walk away, walk away from you 
No, I just can't walk away, (I just can't walk away) 
Walk away from you 
Though I try, (yeah) I just can't walk away 
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't live without you by my side now, babe

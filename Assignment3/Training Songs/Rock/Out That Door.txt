Your kiss can leave me cold.
I miss the fire that our hearts used to hold.
Oh-oh, there's no danger anymore,
Oh-oh, you're not a stranger anymore
And I'm out that door (Out that door),
I'm out that door (If you call)
But I'm not sure
When we decided not to care for each other anymore.

By rights we should be friends.
My pride was hurt but is that so hard to mend?
Oh-oh, I've been trying not to 'phone,
Oh-oh, I've gotta know if you're alone
And I'm out that door (Out that door)
If you'll just call (If you call)
And day or night (Night and day)
Anytime at all (If you call)
But should I wait? (Should I wait?)
We're always breaking up, and making up
So much better than before.

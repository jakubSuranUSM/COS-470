Kung Fu do what you do to me 
I haven't been the same since my teenage lobotomy 
Full on, I moved to Hong Kong 
With Bruce Lee's brother and Johnny Wong 
I think its strange, he's friends with Fu Manchu 
And he thinks he knows you 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan Come on Jackie Chan 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Last night Jackie Chan came 'round 
I played pool with him and we hung out 
Mr. Miagi and the X-men 
Called in for a while as well 
Kung Fu do what you do to him 
I can't live without my Kung-Fu movies 
'Shanghai Killers' and 'Deadly Road' 
My life was ruined when the Green Dragon closed 
I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu 
And he thinks he knows you 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan 
Come on Jackie Chan 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
He's in love with you 
Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan 
Come on Jackie Chan 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh

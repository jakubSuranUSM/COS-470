Now, my baby got excited about a little ring
But our marriage didn't mean a thing

I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil

My baby, she doesn't love me no more
I got the meanest woman man has ever seen
She sleeps with a knife in her hand Lord, she fights all in her dreams

I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil

My baby, she doesn't want me no more
Now I ain't going down ain't by myself
If I can't take you girl, I'll take someone else

I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil
I've been dealing with the devil
My baby, she doesn't want me no more

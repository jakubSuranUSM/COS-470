Say goodbye to yesterday
Nothing standing in my way
Never was a guarantee
But in my heart
I know there's got to be

Healing, gonna take some time
I'm on the mend
I'm healing
Starting over at the end
I'm feeling
Stronger now than I've ever been
I'm healing

I can see me pulling through
Finding out I'm someone who
It's moving on, and letting go
I'm picking up the pieces
For the road to

Healing, gonna take some time
I'm on the mend
I'm healing
Starting over at the end
I'm feeling
Stronger now than I've ever been
I'm healing

The chapter's been written
It's all in my past
I kept turning pages
I'm here at last

Healing, gonna take some time
I'm on the mend
I'm healing
Starting over at the end
I'm feeling
Stronger now than I've ever been
I'm healing

I'm healing
Stronger than I've ever been
I'm healing
Gonna take some time
I'm on the mend
I'm healing

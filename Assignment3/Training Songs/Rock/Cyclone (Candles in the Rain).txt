Hold tight cyclone
Found love in the music but lost in the overtones
Sweat on the brow, blood on the lips, love for the money
And gold at the fingertips, at the fingertips

Hold tight cyclone
A fool to continue but love keeps me holding on
And it feels good real slow
I love you to hurt but pain makes me let you go
Makes me let you go

Hold tight cyclone
Don't need no religion to look for the kingdom come
Gotta feel for the ground, reach for the sky, leap off the edge
To see if you fall or fly if you fall or fly

I wait for the day to burn into night
And then I wait for dawn
And I open my eyes when it gets bright
And know I must be home
I know I must be home
I know I must be home

Hold tight cyclone
Found love in the music but lost in the overtones
Sweat on the brow, blood on the lips, love for the money
And gold at the fingertips, at the fingertips

Cyclone, lost in the overtones
Cyclone, lost in the overtones
Cyclone, lost in the overtones
Lost in the overtones
Hold tight!

When I first saw you
I tried to ignore you
Because I knew
You'd haunt me
Until we grew
In my mind
An obsession
I just couldn't subdue
But now it's an avalance we ride
Head over heels into Eden
Laughing inside
With you the female
An imprint in detail
To fit my male
So perfectly
Like fairy tale
Patterns of fate
That had to prevail
But now it's an avalanche we ride
Head over heels into Eden
Laughing inside
And it used to be hard
So hard to live
So scared
Running away from love

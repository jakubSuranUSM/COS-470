She looking like Stonehenge in a different land
She don't move, she don't move, she don't move
She just stands

She doesn't feel the sound
She feel for the ground
She like a dead fish in a cold pan
She don't give an inch to the band

She don't, she don't dance
My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance, baby

She doesn't feel ashamed
She's just feeling strange
To the sh ah, ah, immy shake
She's the straightest dame in the place
She's so, she's so safe, damn

My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance
Oh, my baby don't dance
Oh, my baby doesn't

She don't, she don't dance

She's looking like a dead fish in a cold
She don't jump

My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance
My baby don't dance
Oh, my baby don't dance
Oh, my baby, yeah, ha

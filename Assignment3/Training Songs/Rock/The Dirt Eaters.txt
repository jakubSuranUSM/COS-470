I'd eat all the dirt in this yard for you
And all the dogbones too if you asked me

Do you know the
Smell of your own face?
Will you eat the
Will you eat the world?
Gone to a place that's rotten
Feast on what's in the way
Going to an open, to a clearing
The soil is sour and unforgiving
We buried our guilt
I think I left the shovel there
Any sick brain
Knows an unknown fellow
Makes me think about things

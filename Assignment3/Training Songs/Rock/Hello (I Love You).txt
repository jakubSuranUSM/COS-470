Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Walking down the street, blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy to make the queen of the angels sigh?

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long,
when she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet, like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game

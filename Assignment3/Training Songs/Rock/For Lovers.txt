I'm running away with you
That's all I ever do
That's all we ever mean
I forgive you
Everything
Meet me at the Railroad Bar
About seven o'clock
We talk til the sun goes down
Watch the lovers
Leaving town

This is for lovers
Running away
This is for lovers
Running away
Just for today

I'm running away with you
From yesterday's news
Let's leave it all behind
Help me back to my mind
I've paid the penalty
You're the jailer rattling the key
But the key is mine
I keep a spare one every time

This is for lovers
Running away
This is for lovers
Running away
Just for today

This is for lovers
Running away
This is for lovers
Running away
Just for today
This is for lovers
Running away
This is for lovers
Running away
Just for today

This is for lovers
Running away

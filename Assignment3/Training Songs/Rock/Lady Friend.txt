Here it comes again, it's going to happen to me
Here it comes, I should have learned to duck
She's going to say, she's going away
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes, it looks just like the last wave I drowned in
Here it comes and I'm so far from shore
She's going to go and take her trinkets
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes again, the night is going to fall
Here it comes, she's going to say goodbye
She's going to go and leave only me
And I will have to live without her and survive

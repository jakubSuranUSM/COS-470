I've tried hard to tell you
You better, you better, you better be careful
Right down the line
And I am no stranger

It wasn't long ago, so very long ago
I was one of your kind
You'd better stop the running 'round and listen
'Cause when the lights come up

I'll have my eye on you
Once you mistook me
For the menace, the menace
Oh, if you'd only known

And that last confrontation
Was just a warning, so that you'd know
What would happen
If you push me too far

You'd better stop the running 'round and listen
'Cause when the lights come up
I'll have my eye on you
I see a cloudless sky before me

I'm searching for the ones, I'm searching for the ones
Who'd like to leave this all far behind them
And when I find you all we'll fade away
Maybe I'll be back, maybe I'll be back

In some other way
You'd better stop the running 'round and listen
Stop the running 'round and listen
'Cause when the lights come up

I'll have my eye on you
I've got my eyes on you
Now we're standing on the sidelines
Just watching how you play

With the toys that seems to outgrow you
I suppose we'll have to miss
What you'll decide to do
In a blink of an eye

It comes back to you

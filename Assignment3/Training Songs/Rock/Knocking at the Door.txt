Got the North Star guidin' me
It's the fire burning inside of me
No, I don't need a miracle
I got something far more powerful
And in this collective
I've got a brand new perspective
Some news that might break the tension
Can't walk on water
But I'm walking through an intersection

All aboard, I heard my brother say
All aboard, like it's some parade

That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm thirsty
For more, for more, for more
That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm knockin' at the door
I'm knockin' at the door
That's me

(Talk about the time you were broken)
I regret the hours that were stolen
(So how'd you keep going?)
I put my shoulder to the wheel
And I just kept rollin'
You can call it religion
Walkin' into the mystic
When the power's with people
I don't get pessimistic
Standin' shoulder to shoulder
I hold me head high
Standin' shoulder to shoulder
As we walk across the finish line

All aboard, I heard my sister sing
All aboard, and bring your offerings

That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm thirsty
For more, for more, for more
That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm knocking at the door
I'm knocking at the door
That's me

From the ground up
From the people
Turn the sound up
Like we mean it
Rise up, oh rise up
Rise up, oh rise up
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up

That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm thirsty
For more, for more, for more
That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm thirsty
For more, for more, for more
That's me, I'm knockin' at the door
I'm knocking at the door
I'm knocking at the door
That's me

That's How I Got To Memphis (Tom T. Hall)
If you love somebody enough
You follow them wherever they go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
If you love somebody enough
Then you go where your heart needs to go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I know if you'd seen her
You'd tell me cause you are my friend
I've got to find her
And find out the trouble she's in
If you tell me she isn't here
I'll follow by the trail of her tears
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
She' use to get mad and she'd say
She'd go back to Memphis someday
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I got to find her
Tell her that I love her so
I'll never rest till I find out why she had to go
Thank you for your precious time
Forgive me if I start to cryin'
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis

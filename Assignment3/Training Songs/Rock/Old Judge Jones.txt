Old Judge Jones never gave a man break
On his hangin' tree the leaves don't shake
That man in black what did he say
A hundred years and one dark day
A widow's tear filled with pain
Can make the blue skies shed some rain
You people think that you got the blues
Wait â€˜til you read our everyday news
One more hung from the tree last night
Old Judge Jones done took another life
Folks keep prayin' it would end
But sad as it is
It'll happen again

You'd think we wouldn't put up with it
He'd bust an old lady for a sidewalk spit
Church on Sunday he's the first in line
Last week gave the preacher a fine
You can't hate a man for what he must do
But if his cause ain't just and his word untrue
That man in the robe's a devil in disguise
The bailiff's books are filled with lies
Election time the Jones will never lose
With a gun at your back in the voting booth
You can't do what you think is right
Sad as it is 
Another hangin' tonight

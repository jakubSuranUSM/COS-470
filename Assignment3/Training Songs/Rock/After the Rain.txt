When the sky-full of tears
Is threatening to fall
Don't stand in the way
Come inside, close the door
The sky will clear again
After the rain

When the clouds overhead
Want to capture your heart
Let them know you are strong
You will not be caught
The clouds will blow away
After the rain

Fall, fall
Fall, fall
Fall, fall
Fall, fall
After the rain
No clouds over you
After the rain
Sun yellow sky blue
After the rain
Though you can't see it now
The sun never sets
It always does
What you sometimes forget
The sun will shine again
After the rain
Fall, fall
Fall, fall
Fall, fall

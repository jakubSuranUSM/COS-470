You think that I'd like to make it with you, girl
But it's against my better judgment to do it
And you think that I know how good it would be
You think it means a lot to me, but it doesn't

I don't want to see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't want to be another star on the wall, no
I just want to be your friend
I just want to be your friend
I just want to be your friend, that's all
Yeah, baby, know what I mean? Baby, know what I mean?
Baby, know what I mean? Baby, know what I mean?

Ah, I know you think you've met my kind before, girl
But there is more to me than what you're seein'
And I don't want your face to look the same to me
As those who only want to play their games

I don't want to see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't want to be another star on the wall, no
I just want to be your friend; yes, I do
I just want to be your friend all the time
I just want to be your friend, that's all
Yeah, baby know what I mean? Baby, know what I mean?
Baby, know what I mean? Baby, know what I mean?

I don't want to see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't want to be another star on the wall, no
I just want to be your friend; yes, I do
I just want to be your friend,all the time
I just want to be your friend, that's all

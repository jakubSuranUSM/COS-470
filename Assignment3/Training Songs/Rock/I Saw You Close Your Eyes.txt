Hey now, is it the dawn or the end?
The hours we talked
You wished we'd stopped
Acting like it's nothing at all
In the first act, your gun on the wall
The kick back into your
Shoulder is always hard to ignore, hey!

Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes

Hey now, the slip, the doubt, the itch
You bow so long to live beyond
Now you're walking, humming your song
Mirror in the bathroom, nails getting long
Aw please, tell me I'm wrong
In the third act, it's gotta go off, hey!

Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes

Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes
Even if I'm on your side
I saw the way you close your eyes

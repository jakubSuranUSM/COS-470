Fare thee well love, Fare thee well love
Far away, you must go
Take my heart love,Take my heart love
We will never meet, again no more

Far across love, Far across love
O'er the mountains and country wide
Take my heart love, Take my heart love
No one knows, the tears I've cried

So I'll drink today love, I'll sing to you love
In paupers glory my time I'll bide
No home or ties love, a restless rover
If I can't have you, by my side

Oh come back love, Oh come back love
The sun and moon refuse to shine
Since I've gone love, gone away love
This lonely girl has had no peace of mind

So I'll drink today love, I'll sing to you love
In paupers glory my time I'll bide
No home or ties love,a restless rover
If I can't have you, by my side

Fare thee well love, Fare thee well love
Far away, you must go
Take my heart love, Take my heart love
We will never meet, again no more

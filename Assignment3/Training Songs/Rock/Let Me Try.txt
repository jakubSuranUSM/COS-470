It's harder than you think
To get through the things clear
I wonder you're my brother?
Thoughts easy disapear
This weight, this heavy stone
The voices on the phone
"I know that you'll make it
You have nothing to fear"

And you can tell your soul
I will not let go
And you can bring it all back home
And shine your light through the hearts of stone

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try

Do you wanna live
I'll promise you to give
Every little twinkle
Until I lose everything
If you just let me try
You'll wonder why you cried
This poem like an airplane
Will fly and touch the sky

And you can tell your soul
I will not let go
And you can bring it all back home
And shine your light through the hearts of stone

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try

Just please let me try
Just please let me try
Please let me try
Let me try
Try

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I tried
But I never found my feelings for you
So please let me try

I'm really gonna try it over
Just please let me try
Just please let me try
Just please let me try

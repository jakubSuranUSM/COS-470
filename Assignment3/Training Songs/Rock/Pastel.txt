I see the style in your face
Is it pastel in clothes
A new life in apartments 
It's all her good vibration 
I wanna make you feel older 
So we can share our fear 
With glass flowers in our dinner 
Are we grenades if we're here 

We really need to be friends
We really need to be friends 
We really need to be friends 
We really need to be friends 
Right now

I see the style in your face 
Are we pastel in homes 
That a proper lifestyle in drinks 
You should take me home 
I wanna make you cum 
Let's talk more about what you want 
Such a pretty machine 
They all want to have your cravings

We really need to be friends
We really need to be friends 
We really need to be friends 
We really need to be friends 
Right now

I really want to be serious
I really want to be serious
I really want to be serious
Really, really, really serious

I really want to be serious
I really want to be serious
Don't really want to be serious
Really, really, really serious

I really want to be serious
I really want to be serious
Don't really want to be serious
Really, really, really serious

Seventeen, seventeen
Cool and solid seventeen
Young enough to dance and sing
Old enough to get that swing
 
Past sixteen, just been kissed
Graduated and got that twist
Kind of love I can''t resist
At seventeen
 
Now, sloppy shirt, old blue jeans
Dirty shoes by all means
Patch of blonde, peroxide hair
Jukebox baby, ain''t no square
 
Seventeen, hot rod queen
Cutest girl you''ve ever seen
Tell the world I''m really keen
On my hepcat doll of seventeen

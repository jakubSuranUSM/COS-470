I crept up on my baby, I laid down on my town
I found a shrinking violet, I crushed it into the ground
I felt the heart of forever, I held it over my head
I said f*ck you on Christmas, and then they put me to bed
And I'm never gonna tell you why

I got my face in the furnace, I got my snake in a sleeve
God's drowned in a bowl of cereal, I have to ask you to leave
Roll up your expectations, and feed them into my sleep
I'll ask the master cylinder what kind of cookies he eats
And I'm never gonna tell you why

Sometimes my soul just moves so slow
Like a dream of diesel heart that just won't go
There's a light that used to shine
I breathed it all the time
Now I wait on the edge of Mars
But it just don't show, yeah

I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe

So long here babe
So long here babe
So long here babe
So long here babe yea

Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea

I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe

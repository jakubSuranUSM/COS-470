What's she got that I don't have 
Does she fill those spaces that I left you 
When you wake up every night 
Does the scent of regret ever haunt you 

(chorus) 
Put this under your skin 
'cause I am me 
And I won't change for anyone but me 
And I won't change for anyone, 
For anyone... like you 

Does the weight of consequence drag you down 
Until it pulls you under 
And does she lend an eager hand to save you 
From the future of being with her 
Are you with her? 

(chorus) 
Put this under her skin 
'cause I am me 
And I won't change for anyone but me 
And I won't change for anyone, 
For anyone... like you 

Why would I
Why would I change 
Why would I change 

(chorus) 
Put this under your skin 
'cause I am me 
And I won't change for anyone but me 
And I won't change, I won't change 

What she got that I don't have? 
What she got that I don't have?

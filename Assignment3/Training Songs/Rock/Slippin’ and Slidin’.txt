Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told along time ago
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told along time ago
I been told, baby you been bold
I won't be your fool no more

Oh big conniver, nothin but a jiver
I done got hip to your jive
Oh big conniver, nothin but a jiver
I done got hip to your jive
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
I won't be your fool no more

Oh Melinda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Oh Melinda, she's a solid sinner
You know you'd better surrender

Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
I won't be your fool no more
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told a long time ago
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told along time ago
I been told baby you been bold
I won't be your fool no more

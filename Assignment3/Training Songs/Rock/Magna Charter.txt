Write the rules for the games we play
Carved in stone for a future time
Broken pieces thrown away
Broken pieces that are mine

Hope in words so nearly true
Peaceful times are long unseen
Promises I give to you
Only I know what they mean

Charter for a freedom lost
Made by man who knows not why
Leaving youth to count the cost
They only suffer times gone by

It would never be the same
If ruler lived beyond his past
He would have to live his game
And speed of truth is never fast

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The scream of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

And so
Time moves on
A war
Waged in words
With Kings and Church and common man
But no winner
Or beginner
Can understand the battle plan

But the battle never lasts long
Even though it is an old song
And the singer never sings the same old verse
Turn the melody to war chant
Change the flowers into warplants
Kill them all
Just to swell the purse

Pray to the Father
Peace ever after
Only love
Up above
Glory to the war


So for peace we wage a war
As in war we fight for peace
Death to all, be rich or poor
Comes in such a bloody feast

Will they meet in a future time?
Will it happen yet again?
Only God knows the truth they say
Only He is ahead of our time

Where is the charter made for love?
Where is the charter for killing war?
Sadly hidden in the warrior's glove
Making light for ever more

Magna Charter shows a path
Over which no truth can stray
Floating as a neutral craft along its way

Should there ever be a charter
With words to change the course of man
To give us peace and hope and understanding
And take us back to where it all began

The sword is still the only answer
The loudest sound that can be heard
The screams of silence as the fear grows stronger
Hear the people
Cry to no-one
No-one hears their words

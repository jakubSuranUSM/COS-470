Can't sleep tonight
I feel so shaken
Baby the wind has changed again
You come to me
Straight out of nowhere
Taking me where I've never been

Suddenly all of my fences have broken
I'm cutting the reins of my life

Whoa Runaway horses
Take us through the night
Runaway horses
Ooh baby hold on tight
Racing through the darkness
Trying to find a light
You and I on Runaway horses
Baby hold on tight

Stars guide us now
The whole world is sleeping
10 million dreams will soon be told
Out on this road
I'll share your secrets
I'm not afraid of where we'll go

I want you here with me
Pray for our destiny
Here on this mystery ride

Whoa Runaway horses
Take us through our life
Whoa Runaway horses
Oh oh baby hold on tight
Racing through the darkness
Trying to find a light
You and I on Runaway horses
Oh baby hold on tight

Open my eyes, there's so much light
I feel alive when I'm with you
With every end we'll begin again

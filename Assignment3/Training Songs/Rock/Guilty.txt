I feel guilty
My words are empty
No signs to give you
I don't have the time for you

You say I'm heartless
And you say I don't care
I used to be there for you
And you've said I seem so dead, that I have changed
But so have you

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

I put a shield upon you
I didn't mean to hurt you
I would have only poisoned your mind
Never meant to make you cry

You've been so thoughtless
I can see right through you
You used to be there for me
So don't you leave and say goodbye
'Cause you have changed but so have I

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

I never thought that the time and the distance between us make you so much colder
I'll carry the world on my shoulders

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

Guilty, guilty, I feel so 
Empty, empty, you know how to make me feel

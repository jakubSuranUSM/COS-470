Turn
How can you expect people in their right minds
To not see between the cracks
And notice that there's something missing?
Wouldn't you agree now is the right time
To be all that we can be?

Come and dream with me that we were all together 
In perfect unity
But we are torn apart by things that do not matter
And time is running out for us to see

We gotta turn this life around
Turn this life around
Turn this life around

Take a look around can you tell me
Why does it take a tragedy to bring us all together?
Who can change a heart change a motivation
Take it right back to the start?

Come and dream with me
That we were all together
In perfect unity following the maker

Although ?Turn? delivers a general message for the world, it is also directed towards the church. We are meant to be leaders in relationships, politics and art, yet we are often on the fringe rather than the cutting edge. This song challenges us to consider what we need to turn away from and what we should be turning to. We've got to turn this life around! Essentially that means always turning back to Jesus.

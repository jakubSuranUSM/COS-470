I was told once, by a friend of mine
She had seen an olden sign
She said she was not from this time
And did I feel the same?
So I told her, "Yes", I knew her fear
As I left the truth draw near
Told her back three hundred years

Was the time that I held dear
Gather ye lords and ladies fair
Come with me to the Renaissance Faire
Hurry now
We're almost there
Fa,la,la,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
Through the shroud of mystery
Turn a page of history

Feeling more than you ca see
Down at the Renaissance Faire
Hear the minstrels play their tunes
They will play the whole night through
Special songs for me and for you
And anyone whose heart is true
There;s too many stars for one sky to hold
Some will fall, others are sold
As the fields turn to gold
Down at the Renaissance Faire

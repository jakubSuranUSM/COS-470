Say you're the dreamer
And come dream on
Say you believe her
And believe in me

So bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here

I can't deceive ya
Won't you be with me
I didn't leave ya
It's you leaving me

'Cause you're not sure
With all your wealth
I want to see you again

So bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here

I want to take you out tonight
Punches would be rolling
Blood it would be flowing
I can't fight

You're bound to put one in my eye
But this is not about you
This is about me

So bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here
Bring your lovin' back here

Please don't leave me alone again
(Don't leave me alone again)
Please don't leave me alone again
(Don't leave me alone again)
Please don't leave me alone again
I just want to lie low
I just want to lie low
I just want to lie low

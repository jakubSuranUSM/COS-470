Do I, Do I love you baby?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, more than ever.
More than ever baby.
I remember all I wanted in a lover was a pretty face,
but all I found were hearts of stone.
Spent a lifetime on the road to nowhere 'till I found my way back home.
You gave me shelter from the cold and the rain whoa
and now I know pleasure where there used to be pain.
Do I, Do I love you baby?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, more than ever.
Do I, do I need you baby?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, more than ever.
More than ever baby.
You saved me warmth and understanding 
you're ev'rything that I could ever want,
and after so long we're standin' here together and forever we'll live on. 
Whoa.  In time most other loves just wither and fade, 
I tell you, ours just gets stronger each and everyday.  Eeow

Hey, come over here for a second; I got something I want to say,
More than ever.
I just want you to know that even though 
I may not think to tell you every day,
Ooo I'm so happy you're still mine.
Oh you came along with a love so sweet, 
took me by surprise knocked me off my feet 
still sends chills up and down my spine, 
well I gotta be the luckiest man alive.

You'd like to show me all around
Thank you girl but I know this town
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Don't you know they're all the same,
Only difference is the name
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Three motels, dusty cars,
Movie shows and a dozen bars
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Only thing that I can say
We'll be here for just one day

CHORUS:  

Baby, don't you know
We're leaving early in the mornin'
So long I don't know
We might be back next year
Maybe it just might be never
Don't you worry 'bout it
So long, good to know
Your smilin' face was here

This town is boring you to tears
Nothing in the world ever happens here
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Don't you know you gotta help
Nothing ever happens by itself
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
If no one will share the load
Go pack your bag for the open road
It's all right hey lawdy mama, it's all right
Try to find someone like you
Hope he'll tell you what to do

REPEAT CHORUS

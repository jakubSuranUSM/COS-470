Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy
Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy

Oh, father, I pray to thee
I gotta man so blind I can't see
I'm his favorite toy like a beach ball
Play me up and down and throw me 'gainst the wall

"Oh, Tallulah", he said, "You're so dramatic
What's all that shakin' goin' on in your attic?"

Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy
Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy

You can't knock it or rock it or be-bop it, it's a itch you can't scratch
Nothing's gonna stop it, I'm a cheater, so ravenous
Waitin' on my man and his one hot kiss, I'm on the prowl
Sent my thunder hour after hour, break this spell I'm under

Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy
Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy

All my life, I've searched for you, all my life
All my life, I was searching for you

Spinnin' round the room and I can't sleep
Oh, you're little girl wants to

Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy
Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?
My love, you got me spinning like a wound up toy

Hot, hot, hot, love
Hot, hot, hot, love
Hot kiss, hot kiss
Hot kiss won't you tell me what you miss, boy?

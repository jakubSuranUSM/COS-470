I never meant to hurt you so
But here I am again
Embracing someone else
It never seems to change

I Know my heart belongs to you
But it yearns for someone else
I cannot help myself

I've begged you to forgive me
A thousand times before
This time it's impossible
Don't want me anymore

And you took your things and at the door
You waved a quick goodbye
There is nothing left to say
Just bitter tears to cry

Living a lie ain't easy
Truth comes out and kills our jaded love
I want you to forgive me
Find a way to save this

You see a sign of youth 
I hope you understand, as we
Both go up the hill
And with the spectral gleam 
Above the filth machine, and we
Both go up the hill
Sunny sunny sunny weather
Sure we won't grow old together
True, its still because of you

CHORUS: Ay ay ay ay, o ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay e mo meme mo I want
Ay ay ay ay, o ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay e mo meme mo I want you,
(I don't know this)

An all the vegetables 
They're sullen obstacles, see the
Moonbeams on the hill
And on the section one
With the capitol nuns, you see the
Moonbeam in the hill
Sunny sunny sunny weather
Sure we won't grow old together 
True, its all because of you

CHORUS

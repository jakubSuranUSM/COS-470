Feel the heat below my feet
I have to go, no time to sleep
Can't believe the things you say 
I turn my head and walk away
You make me sick, you make me nervous

Times are gone when you would say 
This is the one and seize the day
Times are gone for honesty
"My victory is your defeat"
Oh can't you see you've been mistaken

[Chorus:]
In my life I decide and it turns me on
How I am, how I live, who I love
In my way I feel strong 
And it turns me on
In my life, I decide, I decide

All you do, you can't deny it, 
It's waste of time, waste of time
Can I suggest that you invest in something more than hopelessness
Before you know, the ride is over

[Chorus]

It's up to you if you give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop [Repeat x2]

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up 
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up, 
It's up to you, it's up to you

The record choose that you're dead but you're still living
Every time you have died you have been given
Another chance to fix your bad attitude
And make a move, it's up to you 

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up [Repeat x3]

It's up to you [Repeat x2]

Give it up [Repeat x8]

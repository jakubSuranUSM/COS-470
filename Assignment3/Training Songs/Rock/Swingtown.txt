Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
Let's make some romance
You know the night is fallin' and the music's callin'
And we've got to get down to Swingtown

We've been workin' so hard
We've been workin' so hard
Come on baby, come on baby, let's dance
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on and dance, come on and dance
We may not get another chance
You know the night is fallin' and the music's callin'
And we've got to get down to Swingtown

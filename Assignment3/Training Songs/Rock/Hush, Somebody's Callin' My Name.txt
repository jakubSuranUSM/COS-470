Hush, hush

      Somebody's calling my name

      Hush, hush

      Somebody's calling my name

      I hear a voice so sweet an' clear          

      Calling me angel an' a honey dear

      Well, whoa-ho, hush, hush
      Whoa-ho, hush, hush

      Whoa-ho, hush, hush
      Somebody's calling my name.

 

      Hush, I say hush

      Somebody's calling my name
      Whoa-o-o, won't you hush
      Somebody's calling my name.

 

      If it's the girl I've been searching for

      I'll tell the world I won't-a search no more

      Talk to my brother wouldn't do me no good
      I talked to the gypsy and she said, Rejoice

      You'll know your lover by the sound of his voice.

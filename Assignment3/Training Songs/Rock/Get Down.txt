Take aim before you shoot - for you should,
This game has an issue,
With me I'll set it straight - set it straight,
You guessed â?? I meant it,

Watch me, get down get down... get down... get down,
Watch me, get down, I'll get down... I'll get down... get down,

Take aim before you shoot - for you should,

Watch me, get down get down... get down... get down,
Watch me, get down, I'll get down... I'll get down... get down,

The Cure worked, now Ash is keeping me sane,
Cruel stares on cold nights,
Two dots on my neck won't go away,
These walls are listening.

Watch me get down, get down.
Watch me get down, get down.
Watch me get down, get down.
Watch me get down, get down.
Watch me get down, get down.
Watch me get down, get down!

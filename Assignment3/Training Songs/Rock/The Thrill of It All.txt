I wish I could find a way to make it right
I wish I could see an end to this fight
'Cause all I want is a restful sleep tonight
Maybe we're both to blame, I don't know

Or maybe we're both afraid of letting go
Just like a fire that's burning low
The flames are dying,
And I can really feel the cold

'Cause I don't care who's wrong or who's right
I can't stand another day, I can't stand another day
All we're doing is wasting our time, carrying on
When the thrill of it all is gone

I'd rather live alone, than live in hell
'Cause it feels like I'm doing time, and this room's a cell
These four walls, the stories they could tell
But they're in the past, and we both know it well

'Cause I don't care who's wrong or who's right
I can't stand another day, I can't stand another day
All we're doing is wating our time, carrying on
When the thrill of it all is gone

'Cause if you cast your mind back to the way it was before
I couldn't live without you for a day
And I don't want to kid myself, the truth is plain to see
It's time we turned and went our separate ways

I wish I could find a way to make it right 
I wish I could see an end to this fight
Why don't we say our long good-byes
Then walk away, while we still both have our pride

'Cause I don't care who's wrong or who's right
I can't stand another day, I can't stand another day
All we're doing is wasting our time, carrying on
When the thrill of it all is gone

Working on a night shift, high on a 'fore day drive
I'm energized from sundown to sunrise, and I'll sleep from nine to five
Shadows fallin' all down the line
Get ready 'cause it's night shift time

Living, loving, searching high and low,
Feel the fire, I'm hooked to a live wire, and I can't let go
I got a feeling that I can't mistake
Sun rises and I'm still awake

I'll play my music - I don't mind working over time
And if I lose it, I'll come to you and you'll give me peace of mind

{Rod - Solo}

I get home early in the morning, I love to get next you
You touch me and you thrill me, you know what to do

{Dave Scat/solo}

Working on a night shift, you tell me something's got to give
I don't mind 'cause I'm feelin' fine, and I love the life I live
Shadows fallin' on down the line
Get ready, 'cause it's night shift time

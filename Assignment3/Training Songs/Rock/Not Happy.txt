Can't we be happy?
Can't we be happy like the swimming turtles?
Can't we be happy like the bumble bees on the River Tees?
When they buzz they buzz in harmonies!
Can't we be happy like them?
I wanna know
I am happy when you are happy,
And you are happy when I am happy,
So let's be happy!

Can't we be happy?

Can't we be happy like the tiny mice?
Can't we be happy like the oddball birds of South
America?
The oddball birds of South America are happy
Can't we be happy like them?
I wanna know
I am happy when you are happy,
And you are happy when I am happy,
So let's be happy

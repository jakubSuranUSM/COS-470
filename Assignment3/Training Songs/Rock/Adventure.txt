We are adventuring, we are adventurers
And in the heart of Nepal we ran into trouble
And he's caught sight of our elegant rubble
And they rest at our camp without saying goodnight

Okay so yeah it's cool
'Cause we're like, adventurers

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

We are adventuring we are adventurers
Did they fall it was blazing hot
The lazy players, the sunlight would start
We traveled through jungles and the tiger's we've fought

It's all cool you know
'Cause we're like, adventurers

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

Castles and causeways and long stays and highways
Castles and causeways and long stays and highways
Castles and causeways and long stays and highways

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

Oh and the search for the something we have seen

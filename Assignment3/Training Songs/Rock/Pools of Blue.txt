And with the rain
Soft pools of blue
White mist like love
When you glow so new
Must warm to you

Just like the snow
Falling anew
When it's soaked through
The snowdrops so few
Must warm to you 

Take my hand, my love
Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life was free

Tell me of rain
In soft pools of blue
How white mist like love
When you glow so new
Must warm to you

Tell me of snow
Falling anew
How when it's soaked through
The snowdrops so few
Must warm to the love of your heart
Warm to the love of your heart
And warm to you

Take my hand, my love
Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life was free
Take my hand, my love
Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life is free

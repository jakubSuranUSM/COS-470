You really caught me deep that time
I couldn't sleep all week
I'm in the Hotel Motivation 
With silk and satin sheets

You really caught me deep that time
I couldn't sleep all week
You'd better wash those hands like a surgeon
It gets so dirty in here

Check in, sell out
Talk loose, get out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, ah, get the hell out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, get out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, ah, get the hell out

Polished shoes
I got the perfect blues 
And the stories that go hand in hand with them

Yeah

I'm in the Hotel Motivation
I still can't get no sleep
I'm meltin' faces, quite literally
Not so cool, not so pretty when it's real

Check in, sell out
Talk loose, get out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, ah, get the hell out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, get out
Check in, sell out
Talk loose, ah, get the hell out

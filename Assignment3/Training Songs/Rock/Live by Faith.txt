I can't feel You movin' inside
I don't hear Your voice whisperin' in the night
And I've never seen You with these eyes
Am I a fool, am I just a fool?

They ask how I follow what I can't see
Why I trust in a love that my arms won't reach
I don't need You, don't need You, to prove it to me
I'll be a fool, yes I'll be a fool

'Cause blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe
And blessed are the hands that keep givin' but never receive
Blessed is the heart that gets broken but keeps holdin' on
Holdin' on for another day

'Cause that's what it means to live by faith
So I cry for Your help while the world looks on
And they laugh at my hope when all hope is gone
But I'll just keep prayin' when answers won't come

Am I the fool, am I just a fool
For standing alone while they mock Your name
"Well if your God is so good, tell us why all the pain?"
I'm not sure, not so sure that God is to blame

So don't be a fool, please don't be a fool
'Cause blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe
And blessed are the hands that keep givin' but never receive
Blessed is the heart that gets broken but keeps holdin' on

Holdin' on for another day
'Cause that's what it means to live by faith
In a world where our questions are haunted
'Cause life's not as fair as we all wanted

Where the innocent die, we ask why
And still we await the reply...
Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe
And blessed are the hands that keep givin? but never receive

Blessed is the heart that gets broken but keeps holdin' on
Holdin' on for another day
'Cause that's what it means... it means holdin' on for another day
'Cause that's what it means to live by faith

Yes that's what it means to live by faith
That's what it means to live by faith, to live by faith...

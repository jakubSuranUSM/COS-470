Hardly art
Hardly starving
Hardly art
Hardly garbage

More coloured liquid
No scent, no skin
More stained paper
More parts per million
No new deafness
No self reference
No cults and
No new stands

No one ideal
Know what I feel
No two the same
Know two with the
Same name

More coloured liquid
No scent, no skin
More stained paper
More parts per million
No new deafness
No self reference
No getting psyched on
No culture icons

No one ideal
No what I feel
No two the same
Know two with the same name
Eyes so deep
You'd never see through
I can't fucking stop
Thinking about you

When all the worst we fear let's fall its weight
When the gyre widens on a window, wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts a man and makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again and their singing
And once atrocity is hoarse from voice and shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover be good to me)

Be as you've always been
Be like a love that discovered the sin
That freed the first man, would do so again
And lover be good to me (Lover be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost
That's been next to our after since the master was crossed
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost
Oh, lover be good to me

When the man who gives the order is born next time 'round on the boats and back
When the body is starving at the border
Or on TV given people the sack
Love, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there’s nothing left for you and I to do
Oh, when there is nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love, for you

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover be good to me)

Be love in its disrepute
Scorches a hillside and salts every root
And watches the slowing and starving of troops
And lover be good to me (Lover be good to me)
Be there and your stairs you stack
Or be like the rose you hold in your hand
I will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover be good to me

Love, won’t you be?
Love, won’t you be?
Be as you always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won’t you be?
Be as you always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won’t you be?
Be as you always been?
Love, won't you be?
Love, won’t you be?
Be as you always been?

She's the one, don't let her get away
She's the one, believe me when I say
She stole my love and know she's gotta pay
She's the one, I'd like to let her go
She's the one, 'cause I hardly know
She stole my love and now she's gotta pay
It's not right for her to run around
She took my love and stomped it to the ground
She's the one, stole my love from me
She's the one, but I won't set her free
She stole my love and now she's gotta pay

It's not right for her to run around
She took my love and stomped it to the ground
She's the one, stole my love from me
She's the one, but I won't set her free
She stole my love and know she's gotta pay

Lingering strong is my dream of greatness
A history that had its day, came and went 
Broken bones and broken hearts will make it true 
All that left is here again and the rest's arriving soon 
With trembling hands I raised it up for all to see 

Just what we'd done towards a new breed 
Wretched dreams and endless schemes 
I need a miracle, we need a miracle 
A purity that's bound to dwindle 
A poor attempt to rekindle what was lost

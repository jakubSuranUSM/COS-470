History just fades to insignificance
Listen to what I've got to say
Now what would you do
If you were in my shoes? Tell me

Previously to this I had no adventure
Life was just a Jurassic lark
Now what would you do
If it happened to you? Tell me

Hit and run, blow my mind
Get it together, leave your future behind
DNA, make my day
Found the key to a parallel universe
Found the key to a parallel universe
Don't tell me I've lost it
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Found the eggs one night up by the quarry
Then I hid them underneath of my bed
If I only knew
For I had not a clue, now I've

Pterodactyls flying 'round my attic
They were incubated by the boiler
They're green with some blue
What on earth will I do? Tell me

Hit and run, blow my mind
Get it together, leave your future behind
DNA, make my day
Found the key to a parallel universe
Found the key to a parallel universe
Don't tell me I've lost it
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Will the dinosaurs come back and haunt us?
I've a bet down fifty-to-one
And with the money maybe

One day I'll build my own
Parallel university
With a park and good facilities
For all who enroll

Glyndwr would be so proud
He never got around
To build one himself
Although he planned to do so, told his kids so

Hit and run, blow my mind
Get it together, leave your future behind
DNA, make my day
Get it together, leave your future behind

Hit and run, steer blind
Get it together, leave your future behind
DNA, make my day
Found the key to a parallel universe
Found the key to a parallel universe
Don't tell me I've lost it
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

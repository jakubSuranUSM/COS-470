He made a fool of you
I said he would, you know he did
How many times did I say
He'd let you down, well, it's a sin

You're playin' a losin' game
Well, you're a fool, you just can't win
It's gonna be hard for you
When you're alone and need someone

Need someone to hold you tight
Need someone when you're alone at night
Thinkin' of me, thinkin' of me

Need someone to hold you tight
Need someone when you're alone at night
Thinkin' of me, thinkin' of me

I'm not gonna wait so long
For you to call, 'cause I'll be gone
'Cause he's made a fool of you
I said he would, you know he did

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you know he did
Oh, you know he did

Oh, yeah, yeah, baby
You know he did
Listen to me, honey
Well, you know he did

Here making each day of the year 
Changing my life with one wave of his hand 
Nobody can deny that there's something there 

Running my hands through his hair 
Both of us thinking how good it can be 
Someone is speaking 
But he doesn't know she's there 
 
I want him everywhere 
And if he's beside me I know I need never care 
But to love him is to meet him 
Everywhere knowing that love is to share 

Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there 
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere 

I want him everywhere 
And if he's beside me I know I need never care 
Oh but to love him is to meet him everywhere

Knowing that love is to share 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there 
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere

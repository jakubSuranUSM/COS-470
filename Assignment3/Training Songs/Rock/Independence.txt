My independence went away
I didn´t listen when it said 'rely on yourself 
trusting someone else is a path for the silent ghost'
My independence went astray
I didn´t think you could betray the pieces that belong inside yourself
Still I wonder where did we go wrong

Dear independence, which way do go?
Dear independence, the world will know what I think is right

My independence kicked me out
It fed me to a hungry crowd
Like a leper I´m not touched and cannot bear 
to watch as I lose the will to lose myself

Dear independence, which way do go?
Dear independence, the world will know what I think is right
My independence had a mind of its own

Tonight, my heart is full of a sad song
My lonesome lover has taken off
I'm wondering around on a cloud
Empty heart, I've been down and out

It's been a week I think since he wrote and it's sad
And it's been years that I've heard these stories about this
Fella he's so brave and so alive
Turning this world around from the out to the inside

Well our courtship was brief and magnetic
I was singing at the corner bar
And we both felt so romantic
We took a walk with the moon
Down to the train yard

Well it was too much for me
My gypsy heart was inflammed
Put me at the head of your list
And don't forget to call my name
Well I fell in love with a boy
Who has a real life romance with a train

Oh my beautiful lover and friend
This is exactly what I wanted
And now I'm feeling so haunted
And I can't get you outta my mind

I can't forget him, as he's rolling away, and it's
All I can do is just to stay here, is
Just to stay

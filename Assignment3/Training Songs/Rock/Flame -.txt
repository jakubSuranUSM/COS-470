Flame why do I come so close to you
Vain telling me what I shouldn't do
I saw you smouldering before
I let him burn me to the floor, flame

Flame why do you paralyze my soul
Pain if I hold you or let go
There's nothing bluer than your heat
You make the night bleed at your feet, flame

Break my fall into this wild fire of love
Stolen from dreams

Flame why do I dance so close to you
Stained with the longing of a fool
When fires rise the shadows fall
Over the edges where we crawl, flame

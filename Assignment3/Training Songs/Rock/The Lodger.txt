One step two step, close the door
All my records are on the floor
No time to myself it seems
People in my lounge hangin' from the beams

Enough time to think cause the phone isn't ringin'
Can't you see my guitar needs stringin'
Then I'll play the songs I should be singin'
Then I'll play the songs I should be singin'

One step two step, find the light
All too late, anyway it was too bright
Your beds too hard, well please use ours
I've always wanted to know how to sleep in cars

Don't be silly, it can get chilly
We'll take a drive around picadilly
All I need is time to put my clothes on
All I ask is time to put my clothes on

One step two step, who's your friend
Yes our car is the one at the end
'Cause it's gone to far, we've seen it all drawing lots
I feel like a platform dream, now the dog has been really shot
It'll all change for the midnight movie

Grab my hand, cause you might lose me
In the rush of those who try to use me
Now in the rush of those who try to use me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

I remember your eyes from the 12th of July 
When the sirens were screamin' and the flames lit the sky 
And you held me so tight, thought you'd never let go 
'Til the bullets exploded on the pavement below 

And I laid you down next to a burnt out car 
Screamed out for help but you were gone too far 
Still got that picture of you locked away from the start 
Developing inside my fanatic heart 

I went around in a daze for a couple of years 
With the blood in my veins frozen over with tears 
And I did anything that they asked me to do 
'Cause all I could see was that picture of you 

And the young ones passin' by'd say, "how's about you - real hard man" 
Deep down inside I was just a castle of sand 
Still had that picture of you locked away from the start 
Developing inside my fanatic heart 

Then they took me inside, threw me up against a wall 
They put electric prods on my chest and my balls 
And they told me to sign things that I knew weren't true 
And in the end I did what they told me to do 

Then they locked me up and threw away the key 
And left me there with just your memory 
Now I walk through New York like a grey silhouette 
Tryin' hard to remember what I'm supposed to forget 

That look in your eyes on the 12th of July 
When the sirens were screamin' and the flames lit the sky 
Hey I sleep with other women and I hold them through the night 
'Cause all I want to do is just get on with my life 

But that picture of you won't let me make a new start 
It's frozen inside my fanatic heart.

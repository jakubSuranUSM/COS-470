I know you
You're the one with everything
So give me your child's body
Make it small and make it real

If the dress fits
Why can't I wear it
As the scars start to ache
How much more can I take?

What I'd go through
To look like you
Why can't I have it?
I want to be just like you

For a minute would do
Everything here has changed
I'm on my own again
I really do need a friend
But everything here has changed

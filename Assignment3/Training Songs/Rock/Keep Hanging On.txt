Only angels have wings, girl
And poets have all the words
The earth belongs to the two of us
And the sky belongs to the birds

You've given me so much happiness
That I'll wrap up and give you this song
You gotta grab it with both hands
You gotta keep hanging on

Gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep, 
You gotta keep hanging on

The cat walks to the window
And I hear the key turn in the door
No one knows and anything goes
And everything falls on the floor

The apartment starts shaking
And the roof opens up to the sun
The crows flying in parallel lines
And ah ah ah

You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep hanging on
Hanging on, keep hanging on
Ah ah ah

Laying in each other's arms
We're sleepy, we begin to nod
And we start to dream of grandiose things
Oh God, oh God, oh God

You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep hang, hang, hang, hang, hang, hanging on

You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep hanging on
You gotta keep
Ah ah ah

Got to make a move now
Its so hard to run in place
Slippin' further from the race
People pushin' by you
And the trials sent to try you
Is it all too much to face
Bridges are burnin'
Just another warnin'

It might be time to stand up, stand up
Stand up

Promises are easy
You swallow every word
Just be sure of who you serve
Listen to the warnin'
All your bridges are burnin'
Don't have to wait in line to stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up
Why don't you stand you-you-hu-up, Owwww

Why don't you stand up
Got to make a move now-ow
Its so hard to run in place
Slippin further from the race
I don't like it
All your bridges are burnin'
Its not just another warnin'

Don't have to wait in line to, stand up, stand up
Say why don't you stand up, stand up
Why don't you stand up - stand up
Why don't you stand you-you-hu-you-up

You better toss your bullets
You better hide your guns
You better help the children
Let 'em have some fun
You better count your blessings
Kiss your Mom and Pop
You better burn that flag
'Cause it ain't against the law

You better pledge your allegiance
You're not the only one
Listen up forefathers
I'm not your son
You better save the country
You better pass the flask
You better join the army
I said, "No thank you, dear old Uncle Sam"

You better toss tour bullets
You better hide your guns
You better help the children
Let 'em have some fun, some fun, some fun

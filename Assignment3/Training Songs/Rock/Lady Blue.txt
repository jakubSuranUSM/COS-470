Well you're showing me a different side
Even asked if the flame has died
You're getting used to me baby
But you just a-wait and see lady
'Cause I've been in love before 
And I love you a whole lot more
So if you want it to be real good to you
When I'm layin' here makin' love to you
Listen real close to me baby
I want to get it straight right now oh baby
'Cause I love you more and more and more
Lady blue

Sad lady, blue lady
Sing me a love song
I just want you to know that I love you 
More and more and more and more

So if you want it to be real good to you
When I'm layin' here makin' love to you
Listen real close to me baby

You just a wait and see lady
I got a whole lot of love to give you
I got a whole life to spend if you'll just 
Let me sing sweet love songs

Lady blue, oh sing a love song
Lady blue

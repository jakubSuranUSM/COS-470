Love's sweet exile 
Love's sweet exile 

We blur into images of state coercion 
Classified machines die misunderstood 
City reflections pour out misery 
We don't count 'cause we hate 

Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Leave this country 
Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Leave it 

Despair seeps through and cuts our eyes 
Unified collapse of everything inside 
We understand but can't accept 
You are not dead 'cause we hate 

Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Leave this country 
Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Leave it 

Our lives drift into a faceless sense of void 
Everything of meaning becomes destroyed 
There's too much concrete for us to breathe 
We are kept down 'cause we hate 

Love's sweet exile 
Love's sweet exile 

Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Leave this country 

Rain down alienation 
Leave this country 
Believe it 

Love's sweet exile

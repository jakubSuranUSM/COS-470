Everyone was running scared
Someone talked and someone heard
The twisted end to all the words
That I'd hung on to
One more time inside the dream
Where nothing has to be this real
And I don't ever care to feel
What I don't want to

You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch
Eyes so sad, evergreen
The saddest eyes I've ever seen

Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing
Healing, healing, healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing

Pick me up and hold me there
Leave me hanging in the air
Till I promise I will care
The way I used to
Diamonds in the pool tonight
Reminds me of what nights were like
Before I feel into a life
That I got used to

The shining sea the silver sky
A perfect world before my eyes
Don't be scared don't you cry
If all the world goes passing by

Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing
Healing, healing, healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing

You once said I thought too much
But never thought enough to touch

Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith faith and healing

Lost all reason and belonging
Can't do right for doing wrong and
I don't like the way I'm feeling
Need your faith healing
Healing healing healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing
Faith and healing

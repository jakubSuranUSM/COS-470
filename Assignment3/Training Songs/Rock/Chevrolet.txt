Heard you got a brand new Chevrolet
You're leaving today
I heard you got all your money saved
You're leaving today

What shall I tell all your friends
When they ask of you
What shall I tell your mom
When she asks of you

Shall I tell her that you're gone
Gone and left me all alone

Girl it's awfully cold at night
I need you by my side
Girl it's awfully cold at night
I miss you by my side

You're leaving today

Heard you got a brand new Chevrolet

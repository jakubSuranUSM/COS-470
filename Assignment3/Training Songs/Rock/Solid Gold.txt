It's number one
(It's number one)
On your local radio
(On your local radio)
In the hall of fame, I'll be named
For my contribution

It's solid gold
(It's solid gold)
I'm over come with joy
(And he's over come with joy)
And now I've topped the charts
Bless your hearts, I'm an institution

I tip my hat to you
(I tip my hat to you)
Captains of industry
(Captains of industry)
You made me what I am
(Solid gold, solid gold)
A once unknown production
I'm a household word today eve

And I want to tell the world
(And he wants to tell the world)
That the tax will bite
(Bite)
It's all right
(Right)
Because I'm making millions.

Solid gold, solid gold
Solid gold, solid gold
Solid gold, solid gold

I'm on my way
(He's on his way)
To a life of luxury
(To a life of luxury)
And now I can't back out
There is no doubt, I was meant to make it
Taken all this time to hear him say

It's solid gold
(Solid gold)
Solid gold, all mine
(Solid gold)
Solid solid gold
(Solid gold)
Lovely solid gold
(Solid gold)

Solid gold
(Solid gold)
Lots and lots of solid, solid gold
(Solid gold)
Give me more MCA, more gold
(Solid gold)
Solid gold, I'll do anything, for gold
(Solid gold)

Your tender touch wakes me from my sleeping
The words on your lips tell me I'm not dreaming
Waking up to you, waking up to you
Skin on my skin, the sound of breathing
The kiss of my love, the power of healing
Giving me new life, giving me new life

Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down, lay down on me, whenever you need
Lay down, lay down on me

Tear up the sheets and blanket regulations
You blow the cover from my imagination
Daring me to move, daring me to move
Hand on my heart, head on my pillow
There's still the wonder, even though we both know
Nothing new today, nothing new today

Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down, lay down on me, whenever you need
Lay down, lay down on me

I'm ready when you call
I'm ready and I'm willing
You've given me your all
You take my breath away 
Woh! Woh! Wo wow oh!

Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down on me, whenever you want
Lay down, lay down on me, whenever you need
Lay down, lay down on me

Come on come on, just like yesterday
Come on come on, take my breath away
Come on come on, you're the one I need
Come on come on, lay yourself on me

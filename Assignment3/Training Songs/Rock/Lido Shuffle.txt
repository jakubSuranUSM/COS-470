Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed
And he ain't comin' back

At a tombstone bar, in a juke joint car he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top

Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down, let 'em roll
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One for the road

Lido
Whoah oh oh oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go, Lido
Whoah oh oh oh oh oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido will be runnin', havin' great big funnin' till he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow it and that was all she wrote

He'll be makin' like a bee line, headin' for the border line, goin' for broke
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin' to it
One more for the road

Lido
Whoah oh oh oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go, Lido
Whoah oh oh oh oh oh
One more job ought to get it
One last shot then we quit it
One more for the road

Lido
Woah oh oh oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go, Lido
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
One more job ought to get it

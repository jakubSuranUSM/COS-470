Say something else, something new for a while
You do me good, keep my faith on your side

It´s alright
You don't have to step aside
It's alright
I am not around this time

Today, not today you're the same what a shame
Help's on the way, so be cool go my way

It´s alright
You don't have to step aside
It's alright
I am not around this time
In my absence you rule my world

Don't Die Young:
They're coming to take you home
To lead you through the endless night

They're coming to keep you warm
To break the silent barriers

Come on out
You're not lonely now
Set the speed, that you need
To come back to me
Back to me

I don't know what you have seen
Where your empty eyes have been

You know where you want to be
Where the screams can't get to you

Come on out
You're not lonely now
Set the speed, that you need
To come back to me
Back to me

Ring-a-my phone, ring-a-my phone, yeah
Ring-a-my phone, ring-a-dee-doo
Ring-a-my telephone, any time at all I expect a call
I come a-running, ooh, straight to you
I know you're the only one, to be my number two
You're the only one under the sun
That understands me, ooh, through and through

Ring-a-my phone, ring-a-my phone, yeah
Ring-a-my phone, ring-a-dee-doo
Ring-a-my telephone, any time at all I expect a call
I come a-running, ooh, straight to you

When I hear your sweet voice, coming across so loud
I pretend my telephone is just sweet lips of mine

I know your loving's, the only love ever I'll be true
'Cause your buttercup
Please hurry up, and let me-ooo-hear from you

When I hear your sweet voice, coming across so loud
I pretend my telephone is just sweet lips of mine

I'm gonna speak, I'm gonna speak
Often felt that way, too
'Cause your buttercup
Please hurry up, and let me-ooo-hear from you

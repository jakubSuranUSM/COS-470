As soon as we arrived I expressed my concern,
I might have known I should, should have learned,
Faded photos, a fool at each turn,
It seemed to me this trip, that we have been burned.

Find me some time, to find a way out of here,
I'd be inclined to walk my way home,
Find me a plane, I'll fly my way out of here,
We were so blind to come here at all.

Along came insomnia,
As if this week wasn't dragging on enough,
One might reflect upon a me
It was such a relief to leave this ride on and on.

Find me some time, to find away out of here,
I'd be inclined to walk my way home,
Find me a plane, I'll fly my way out of here,
We were so blind to come here at all.

No way out
No way out
No way out for me, and the girl.

Find me some time, to find away out of here,
I'd be inclined to walk my way home,
Find me a plane, I'll fly my way out of here,
We were so blind to come here at all.

Find me some time, to find away out of here,
I'd be inclined to walk my way home,
Buy me a plane and I'll fly my way outta here,
We were so blind.

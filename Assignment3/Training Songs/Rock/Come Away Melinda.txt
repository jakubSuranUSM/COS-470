Daddy daddy come and look
And see what I have found
A little way away from here
While digging in the ground

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
It's nothing but a picture book
They had before the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Oh daddy come and look
There's four or five Melinda girl
Inside this picture book

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
There were lots of little girls like you
Before they had the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Oh daddy hurry do
There's someone in villages
Who's all grown up like you

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
That someone is a mother
Like you had before the war

Daddy daddy come and see
Such things I've never seen
Happy faces all along
And all the ground is green

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
It's just the way it used to be
Before they had the war

Daddy daddy come and see
And tell me if you can
Why can't it be the way it was
Before the war began

Come away Melinda
Come in and close the door
The answer lies in yesterday
Before they had the war

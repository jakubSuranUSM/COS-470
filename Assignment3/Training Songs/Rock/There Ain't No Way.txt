The dirty rain is falling
I hear the wind a calling me away
The motel sign is flashing
And in my mind I'm crashing what to say.

What to say
The words they started flowing
And passions started growing like years ago
The wine made my mind crazy

But now I'm not so hazy I gotta go
I gotta go
The love we made today
It was just a foolish way

To try to bring back yesterday there ain't no way.
The dirty rain is falling
And in my mind it's calling me away
I'm staring at the ceiling

I can't let that feeling make me stay.
I just can't stay

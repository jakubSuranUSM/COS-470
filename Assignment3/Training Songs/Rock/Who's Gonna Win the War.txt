Lonely figures waiting, shadows on the hill
Looking into valleys where everything is still
Only death is lurking, the creeping sickness waits
Who's gonna win the war, now
Who's gonna win the war, now
Who's gonna win the, who's gonna win the
Who's gonna win the war
Radiation wastelands in the setting sun
Dust clouds they are gathering to obliterate the guns
Already weeds are writing their scriptures in the sand
Who's gonna win the war, now
Who's gonna win the war, now
Who's gonna win the, who's gonna win the
Who's gonna win the war

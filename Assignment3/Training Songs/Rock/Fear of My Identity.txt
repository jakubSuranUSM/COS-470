Last thirty seconds I wait for him
Last thirty seconds I wait for him to begin, to begin
Last thirty seconds I wait for him
Last thirty seconds I wait for him to begin, to begin

The nights are getting longer
The pain is getting stronger
But I know, ooh I know
The hate is getting darker
And the fear is growing larger
But I know, ooh I know

You taught me that I would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old, old, old
You taught me that I would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old, old, old

Last thirty seconds I watch you go
Last thirty seconds I watch you go all alone, all alone
Last thirty seconds I watch you go
Last thirty seconds I watch you go all alone, all alone

The nights are getting longer
The pain is getting stronger
But I know, ooh I know
The hate is getting darker
And the fear is growing larger
But I know, ooh I know

You taught me that I would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old, old, old
You taught me that I would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old, old, old

The fear of my identity standing right in front of me
I want to run but I can't see
I want to scream but I can't speak
The fear of my identity standing right in front of me
I want to run but I can't see
I wanted to be you but I know it's me

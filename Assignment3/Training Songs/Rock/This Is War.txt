A warning to the people, the good and the evil
This is war
To the soldier, the civilian, the martyr, the victim
This is war

It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
And the moment to live and the moment to die
The moment to fight, the moment to fight,
To fight, to fight, to fight

To the right to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth,
It's a brave new world from the last to the first
To the right, to the left,
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth
It's a brave new world, it's a brave new world

(Whoa oh, whoa oh)

A warning to the prophet, the liar, the honest
This is war
To the leader, the pariah, the victor, the messiah
This is war

It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
And the moment to live and the moment to die
The moment to fight, the moment to fight,
To fight, to fight, to fight

To the right, to the left,
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth,
It's a brave new world from the last to the first
To the right, to the left,
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth
It's a brave new world, it's a brave new world, it's a brave new world

I do believe in the light, raise your hands up to the sky
The fight is done, the war is won, lift your hands towards the sun
Towards the sun, (it's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
It's the moment to live and the moment to die, the moment to fight)
Towards the sun,
Towards the sun, (it's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
It's the moment to live and the moment to die, the moment to fight)
The war is won (to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight)

To the right, to the left,
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth,
It's a brave new world from the last to the first
To the right, to the left,
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the earth
It's a brave new world, it's a brave new world, it's a brave new world

A brave new world
The war is won
The war is won
A brave new world

I went to a dance with my sister Kate; 
Everybody there thought she danced so great; 
I realized a thing or two, 
When I got wise to something new: 

When I looked at Kate, she was in a trance, 
And then I knew it was in her dance; 
All the boys are going wild 
Over sister Katie's style. 

Oh, I wish I could I shimmy like my sister Kate; 
She shimmies like a jelly on a plate. 
My mama wanted to know last night, 
What makes the boys think Kate's so nice. 

Now all the boys in the neighborhood, 
They know that she can shimmy and it's understood; 
I know that I'm late, but I'll be up-to-date 
When I shimmy like my sister Kate. 
I mean, when I shimmy like my sister Kate. 

Now I can shimmy like my sister Kate, 
I know that I'm real late, 
I think I'll do a real shimmy dance, 
Dancing like my sister Kate, 
Sweet papa, just like my sister Kate.

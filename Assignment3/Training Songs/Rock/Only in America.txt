There's a rainbow on Sunset Boulevard,
Made of tears from Hollywood.
People praying for their Green Card,
Pay to play,
Work for food. 

Swear alleigance every morning,
It's another sunny day,
Well it's murder on the freeway,
Someone's life gets blown away. 

There's a pirate on the radio,
There's a preacher on TV.
Call the C.I.A Big Daddio,
Tell the White House I'll be free. 

[Chorus]
Only in America
Only in America
Only in America
Only in America 

Tijuana 'cross the border,
Eat the worm see paradise,
Education in Las Vegas,
Cut the cards and roll the dice 

People come to California,
And they aim to do it right.
Every waitress a performer,
You'll be famous overnight.

[Chorus]

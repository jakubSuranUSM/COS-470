You can get your life stolen and die in the shade
Lie in the bed that your parents have made
You can all go to hell at a red traffic light
As a matter of speaking I couldn't care

You can stuff your beliefs and your nursery rhymes
I drink till I'm senseless whatever the wine
With no hope, no glory and no jesus christ
We all turn into ashes, welcome to the show

But hold tight and hold still
For a little while and for real
I could break it up
I could break it in two
Are you holding tight?
Are you holding still?

Holy father and son change your disguise
For all the good people and sinners alike
So I try and have fun in a rock n' roll band
And your party is over, do you understand

And the future is set in a shadowy road
You can try to walk back through the streets
that you know
But the houses are empty and nobody's home
Only sad looking dogs and welcome to the show

But hold tight and hold still
For a little while and for real
I could break it up
I could break it in two
Are you holding tight?
Are you holding still?

I want to fly you away with me
Into the mystic third eye
We'll reach the gates when the Sun goes down
And never ask ourselves why

'Cause in the hope of discovery
Beneath the mountainous lair
Stretching the bounds of curiosity
We'll find out what's living there
Oh yeah

My head's not fact but it's fiction
And in the back of my mind
There lives a creature of fantasy
The orange goblin we find

And so on the shards of silver light we slide
Into the goblin's domain
To find a world of deprivation
Amidst the torture and pain

Oh yeah

Trapped here in the land of confusion
A prisoner to the diamond of night
Cocooned within my shell of creation
That hides me from the master of light
Alright, yeah

The ship of dreams sails into eternity
And sinks into the red lake of fire
A slave unto the goblin, I lay down my sword as the potion starts to take
Me up higher

Loose lips sink ships 
So come aboard for a pleasure trip 
It's high tide, so let's ride 
The moon is rising and so am I 

I'm gonna get it up 
Never gonna let it up 
Cruisin' on the seven seas 
A pirate of my loving needs 
I'll never go down, never go down 

[Chorus]
So let's get it up 
Let's get it up, get it right up 
Let's get it up, right to the top 
Let's get it up, right now 

Loose wires cause fires 
Getting tangled in my desires 
So screw 'em off and plug 'em in 
Then switch it on and start all over again 

I'm gonna get it up 
Never gonna let it up 
Ticking like a time bomb 
Blowing up the fuse box 
I'll never go down, never go down 

[Chorus]

What I tell is a different story,
What I have, I take, then give it all away,
So if you'd like to come this way,
Then help me climb the walls that stand before me.

I want to know,
If this is just a game,
Can anybody play,
Can everybody win,
Can you believe it,

I may be lost, I may be blind,
I may be cursing most of the time
But it?s half the fun,
And in this world we spin and shout
We want it all we want it now,
They said ?oh shut your mouth
You don't know what you talk about?.

I want to know,
If this is just a game,
Can anybody play,
Can everybody win.

Another show another scene,
The city sleeps below you sing a lullaby,
Another show another scene and,
I can't imagine the world without me,
I can't imagine the world without me,
I can't imagine the world without me, hey,
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll, la la la la.

I'm on a roll la la la la,
I'm on a roll la la la la,
I'm on a roll la la la la,
Me me me me me me me me me,
Me me me me me me me me.

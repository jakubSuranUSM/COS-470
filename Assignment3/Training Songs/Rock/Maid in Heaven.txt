She's a maid in heaven
He's a knight on the tiles
A bat out of hell, oh well
It's just a question of style

It's a time for giving
In the two star hotel
Where breakfast in bed per head
It's just the price of a smile

I know
It's not easy to live this way
Just an hour and a fleeting kiss
'Till the morning

Silent night of wonders
Day breaks through the door
So broken and torn, reborn
Two shadows thrown on the floor

Hold me now, go lightly
Take the ruff with the smooth
A token of love, my love
Was made in heaven for you
Was made in heaven for you
Was made in heaven for you

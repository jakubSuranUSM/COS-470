You're on the outside
You're lookin' in
You're takin' pictures 
Of what you've never been

So kill to kill
So you want to die?
You're burnin' slowly
With seven lies

Blow up the bitch
With the firecracker smile
Switchblade in her suitcase
Loves to drive them wild

So kill to kill
Yeah you're gonna die
Everybody's searchin'
Every single night

You'll never keep it
'cause you sold yourself
And by the way-i-ay-i-ay
You'll never lose it
'cause you never had it
It's all the sa-i-ay-i-ame

[Chorus]
Rock star life
Turn off the switch
Hollywood bitch
So fake that she seems real
(She goes again) [Repeat: x2]

She's from the westside
She's lookin' thin
She fills her body
With what she'll never be

So kill to kill
So you want to die?
Everybody's searchin'
Every single night

You'll never keep it
'cause you sold yourself
And by the way-i-ay-i-ay
You'll never lose it
'cause you never had it
It's all the sa-i-ay-i-ame

[Chorus]

Rock star life
Turn off the switch
Hollywood bitch
So fake that she seems real
(She goes again)

Maybe I should just move along
But you know I'd draw blood if that's what you want

You found someone who makes you laugh
Who'd stick around but that's not what you want

You slipped at the start
And dragged the whole thing sideways down
Everybody fucks up
It's just something that's been going round

And you found someone who said he'd stay
Who'd give it all but that's not good enough

Now you're standing alone
And you're living alone cause you don't know what you want
And you're living alone
And your wondering now, cause you don't know what you've done

Maybe I should just disappear for now
Then maybe you could see a little clearer now

And you found some one who makes you laugh
Who promised you he'd never let you down
And you blame it on your broken heart
But everyone who reaches out gets stung

Now you're standing alone
And you're waiting alone cause you don't know what you want
And you're living alone
And you're wondering now cause you don't know what you've done

Maybe I should just move along
But you know I'd draw blood
If that's what you want..

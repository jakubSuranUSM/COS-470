[Chorus]
Well, you say you're mine 
But baby you don't show it
You'd better fly right cause before you know it
I'm gonna set my foot right down on you

Gonna stop your struttin' baby 'til you say you're through
I'm gonna turn you around
And put you upside down
If that don't stop your runnin' around 

[Chorus]

Ah well, you tell me this and you tell me that
How come your dog bites me instead of that other cat

[Chorus]

I'm gonna turn you around
And put you upside down
If that don't stop your slippin' around 

[Chorus]

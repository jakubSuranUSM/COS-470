My soul starts spinning again
I can't stop feeling, no, I won't stop feeling
The fun's not fun anymore
I can't stop feeling, no, I won't stop feeling

And you leave me here on my own
You leave me here on the floor
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

Feel anymore, feel anymore, feel anymore

My soul starts spinning again
I can't stop feeling, no, I won't stop feeling
And we're not us anymore
I can't stop feeling, no, I won't stop

And you leave me dancing alone
Oh you leave me to die on the floor
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore
Feel anymore, feel anymore
Feel anymore

Soul boy, you're down and alone
Your soul is broken again
But you can't stop moving
No, you won't stop moving along

You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

(Can't feel it) 
Anymore (can't feel it)
Anymore (can't feel it)
You can't feel anymore, anymore, anymore
You can't feel anymore

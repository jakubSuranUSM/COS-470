Out of her mouth it came as no surprise 
Lipstick stained on whipcream lies 
I feel that if I had been uglier 
It would have been easier 

There it sat, blinked and spat 
In a black feather hat 
And said "the rat" 
I now possess quasi success 

But she wants to be a better singer 
Swing the Heartache 
Just for her sake 
But she wants to be a better singer 
Swing the Heartache 
Just for her sake

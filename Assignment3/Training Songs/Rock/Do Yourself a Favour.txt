Isolated junkyard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life
Sweet fragrance irritates
In a stale room death awaits
Persecute your own self pride
Suffocate the new high
Ride a thorny mule that cries
Dig your grave and jump right in
Like a Judas pay the price
Thirty pieces for a ride
Here's the fire take a chew
chorus: Do yourself a favour
 Educate your mind
 Get yourself together
 Hey there ain't much time
 Do yourself a favour (Do yourself a favour)
 Educate your mind
 Get yourself together (Get yourself together)
 Oh there ain't no time
Shredded know-how gives away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs
Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly slowly drowns
Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul gon' pity you
Hurdle over time to death
With open arms it waits I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground?
{Repeat chorus}
(Let the devil step right in)
(Lucifer's your only friend)
(Ain't a soul gon' pity you)
(Hurdle over time to death)
(With open arms it waits I bet)
(Don't you wish you could reach ground?)
Do yourself a favour (Do yourself a favour)
Oh educate your mind
Oh get yourself together (Get yourself together)
Oh there ain't no time
{Repeat}
(Do yourself a favour)
(Get yourself together)

Everybody sat here waiting for the train to come
Just lay down a bright red carpet for her to step on
Lookin' to the bend I see her waving her hands at me
Her looks were tanned and quite amazing as she ran to me
*Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me the news about yourself
Hello Susie, hello Susie
Tell me that you've enjoyed yourself
Frantically she knocked me over
Causing such a scene
Shook the crowd enough to sway
The interest from the queen
Her black transistor socked out
One o'clock radio
Completely drowned the band
And loud enough to stop the show
(*repeat)
Yes sir rock 'n' roll the day away
Come on everybody
They all seem too keen to make the scene
Come on everybody, come on everybody
Got to dig me just a while
I was... threw her bags into the car
Susie took her bow and made her exit like a star
The national news took films which... to make history
Her looks were tanned and quite amazing as she ran to me
(*repeat)

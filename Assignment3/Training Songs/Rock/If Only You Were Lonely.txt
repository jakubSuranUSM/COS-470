Well, I walked out of work
And I was tired as hell
Another day's come and gone and oh well
Somewhere there's a drink with my name on it

Well, I ordered a Scotch as I bust through them doors
Spilled half on my jeans
The other half on the floor
When I saw you standing by that video game

Well, I ain't very good
But I get practice by myself
Forgot my one line
So I just said what I felt

If only you were lonely,
If only you was lonely too,
If only you was lonely
I'd go home with you

Twenty push-ups this morning, that was half my goal
Tonight I'll be doin' pull-ups
On the toilet bowl
And somewhere somebody's throwin' up

Well, I broke the seal on my door
And I poured myself to bed
The whirlpool spinning around in my head
Around in my head

There was liquor on my breath
And you were on my mind
And I'll be dreamin' of that smile
Without a care in the world

If only you were lonely,
If only you was lonely too,
If only you was lonely
I walked out of the kitchen

I was tired as hell
Another day's here and oh well
Somewhere there's a smile with my name on it.

Ah ooh darlin'
Be mine tonight
Won't you be my baby
And treat me right
Ah ooh darlin'
You know you're my only love

Baby baby
Like I said
She got a heart of gold
And somethin' I call soul
Yeah
She got everything I need
Ain't no flies on me
Oh baby
Won't you love me tonight
Oh baby
I'm gonna treat you right

Keep my hand
And hold me tight
Take you in my arms
And love you tonight
She got a heart of gold
And something I call soul
She got everything I need

Ain't no flies on me
Baby when you wrote that letter
It went right to my heart
And I opened the envelope
I knew we were going to part
Ah ooh baby
Don't treat me like a fool

Because baby
I went to school
I know I love you
And I always will
Ah ooh baby
You sent me your bill
Ah ah oh ooh yeah

She's lying through her teeth
I bet he's proud of his daughter
The way she's looking at me
Here we go

She's down on her knees
She gonna throw away her father
Now she's lying beneath
Here we go

She said "I only came to give some head"
She making messes in my bed
We're going down in the motel no tell
I guess she really came to give some head
Now the sheets are red
We're going down in the motel

She can barely get it out
Saying "I've never done this,
Can we slow down?"
There she goes

I'll take the blame
'Cause I've never done this
With someone so young
There she goes

She said "I only came to give some head"
She making messes in my bed
We're going down in the motel no tell
I guess she really came to give some head
Now the sheets are red
We're going down in the motel no tell

She's lying through her teeth
I bet he's proud of his daughter
The way she's looking at me
Here we go

She said "I only came to give some head"
She making messes in my bed
We're going down in the motel no tell
I guess she really came to give some head
Now the sheets are red
We're going down in the motel no tell

You are going under
Deep inside you hear the silent scream
You are filled with anger
Bitter sides want to be part of you

Scream when you fall
Scream and let it go

All lies entwined around your soul
In your chameleon halo
It's all in your head but it's not your role
You've got to get away from the dark

You are the rising thunder
Deep inside you hold a violent scene
You are hateâ€™s creation
But what you really are it depends on you

Scream when you fall
Scream and let it go

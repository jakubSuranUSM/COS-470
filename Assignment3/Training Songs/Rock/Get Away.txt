Break it down and then break it up again
Me and my guitar drowning down and down
Not even the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in

Oh I can't get away

Panoramic view, that's one thing I won't do
No shouted abuse from the corner of my mind
Not even the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in

Oh I can't get away

Summer sun says get out more, I need you
I want you but I can't get this feeling off my mind
I want you, I need you

I can't get away

Summer sun says get out more, I need you
I want you but I can't get this feeling off my mind
I want you, I need you

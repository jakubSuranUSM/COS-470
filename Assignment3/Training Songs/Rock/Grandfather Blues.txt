My great great Grandfather
Prospected for gold
In the wilds of Alaska
In the Yukon cold

My great Grandfather
Fought the Civil War
On the side of the South
In the Infantry Corps

My own Grandfather
Was a hell of a man
He rode Rock Island Railroad
In the blowing sand

All this makes me wonder
What they'll say about me
Oh he was just some fool rambler
Dyin to be free

O-o-oh, I need one good woman to pull me through
O-o-oh, I got one good woman just like you

My great great Grandmother
Wore a calico gown
She had a double-barreled shotgun
That she never set down

My great Grandmother
Was a Cherokee bride
You could find her every evening
Down by the riverside

My own Grandmother
Had a heart of gold
She had eyes like an Angel
And an ocean for a Soul

All this makes me wonder
What they'll say about me
Oh he was just some fool rambler
Dyin to be free

O-o-oh, I need one good woman to pull me through
O-o-oh, I got one good woman just like you!

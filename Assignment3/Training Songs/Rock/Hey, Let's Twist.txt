Hey, let's twist
All you do is this
Hold your arms out straight
And let your hips rotate

Then all you gotta do
Is what I tell you to
Uh, huh uh

A come on, a come on
A right now, a that's how
That's it, don't quit
A come on, a come on

Now that you know how
Hey, let's twist

Hey, let's twist
All you gotta do
Is wiggle your knees
Hey, let's twist
Wiggle, wiggle
Baby, all you please
Hey, let's twist
Hey, let's twist

A come on, a come on
A right now, a that's how
That's it, don't quit
A come on, a come on

Now that you know how
Hey, let's twist

Hey, let's twist
All you gotta do
Is wiggle your knees
Hey, let's twist
Wiggle, wiggle
Baby, all you please
Hey, let's twist
Hey, let's twist

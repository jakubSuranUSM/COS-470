Truth or dare, it’s in the air
Ten feet under water playing millionaires
A swimming pool and a cruel summer
This is how I met you

Went to the city, in someone’s basement
We paid four-fifty
Woke in the morning and you were different
It goes so quickly

Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl
Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl, you're not my girl, you're not my girl, you're not my

Blown to bits, the greatest hits
Sing 'em to your children, and their childrens’ kids
A microphone and a cruel lover
How can I forget you?

Back in the city, I check the statements
I pay nine-fifty
Woke in the morning and I was different
It goes so slowly

Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl
Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl, you're not my girl, you're not my girl, you're not my

Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl
Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl

Time doesn’t mean much to me, doesn’t mean much to me
If you're not my girl (you're not my girl)

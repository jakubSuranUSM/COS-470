Now the time has come for leaving
For here now we shall return
We were so glad we could make it but so sad we gotta run

Well, it might be a long time
'Til we raise another glass
You can rest assured that next time
We'll have ourselves a laugh
Yeah, we'll have ourselves a laugh

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
We all had a good time
And we're sad to see it end

Good luck be with you
You go your way, I'll go mine
So until the next time
It's farewell and not good-bye

Now the show is nearly over
And we gotta pack it in
Though we had ourselves a really good time
It must come to an end

So now I say good evening
As I write another line
We have ourselves a parting glass
And wish each other well
Yeah, we wish each other well

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
We all had a good time
And we're sad to see it end

Good luck be with you
You go your way, I'll go mine
So until the next time
It's farewell and not good-bye

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
We all had a good time
And we're sad to see it end

Good luck be with you
You go your way, I'll go mine
So until the next time
It's farewell and not good-bye

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
We all had a good time
And we're sad to see it end

Good luck be with you
You go your way, I'll go mine
So until the next time
It's farewell and not good-bye

Chained and bell they can't contain me
Bruise and beat they couldn't chain me, no
Shut up all their plans I did
Here I am lost on their grid, oh no

And when the ship hits the
Tell me who you think is the man
The one who would make me stand
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll keep the mouth shut for you

Tired of gag they would have loved me
Sad and blue you would have found me, no
My silence had set you free
Now don't you go and tell on me, oh no

And when the ship hits the
Tell me who you think is the man
The one who would make me stand
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll keep the mouth shut for you

And when the ship hits the
Tell me who you think is the man
The one who would make me stand
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll bite my tongue, I'll bite my tongue
I'll keep the mouth shut for you

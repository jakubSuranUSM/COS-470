she stepped out of the lobby
into the jungle
all she needed to do
was run her fingers
through her long black hair
out of the city's millions
I'd see her again, again, again
she took me over
captivating me
simply walking down the street
in the spotlight
on the mattress
above in the night
have I known you a thousand years
what have you done to me
I see you, my mind goes wild
go ahead, defy society
I still lie awake at night
stabbed with dark delight
Isabella, long gone now
over the continents and seas
alone, another city
the wretched, the wonderous
Isabella
what are you thinking now
Isabella

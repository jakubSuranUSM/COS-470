Sometimes I think of the person I was
I really don't know him at all, he was lost
Someone hurt, he had to hide
Inside a shell every song was a cry
Por eso ahora ya yo no no vuelvo a querer

Now I am somebody else and I know
It's not up to me whether I open or close
Someone has come to me, she reaches for me
She didn't think twice when I gave her the key
Por eso ahora ya yo no no vuelvo a querer

I got no words left, there's nothing to say
I was reborn on the Champs DÃƒ?lysee
Someone to listen, somebody to share
I fell in love this time, someone was there
To catch me
And I know it's not a dream
And we know who we are, who is we
And we're together

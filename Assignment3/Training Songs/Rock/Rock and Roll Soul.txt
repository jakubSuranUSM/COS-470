We're having a party, yeah, yeah, everybody's invited,
The new generation along with the old.
If you could get with it just a little more, it don't take much trying,
You'll find out if you've got some rock & roll soul, baby.

Ain't everybody in the world. So when you know what you got, let everybody know,
You got some rock & roll soul.
So when you know what you got, let everybody know,
You got some rock & roll soul.

I know it when I'm feeling groovy,
It's kind of funky like an old-time movie.
I can feel it and it's really something,
It's really something when my heart starts pumping, yeah.

Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.

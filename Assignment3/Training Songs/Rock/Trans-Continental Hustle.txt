When death comes, I won't be there
In fact I will not be found anywhere
Not in Nevada, not in Sahara
On Chomolungma or Guadalajara
'Cause I'll be climbing top of Never-Neverest
With my contaminated friends

Gah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, yah

Na prallelyach i meridianach
Again I am vajo, Vasco da Gama
In my headphones is Bob Marley and a-Joe Strummer
I'm on a quest for solar amalgamar
I'm on a quest for the Never-Neverest
With my contaminated friends, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, yah

Old schools, they were just nomadic forces
Kill all the men, steal all the women and the horses
Then later on moved on to the pursuit of spices
And finally the rest of all devices

But in the wake of the Trans-continental hustle
Governing cloak, it went up in flames
And by the time we builded up the muscle
There was no time or space left to claim

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho, who-oh-oh-whoa-ho
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho, who-oh-oh-whoa-ho
Iglesia de la calla transcontinentau
Cigano urbano maracatu rurau
Samba

We gonna build new kind of globalizer
Without the pantzer-foust or a shmiser
And may the sound of our contaminated beat
Sweep all the Nazi purists off their feet

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Party

Contamination, amalgamation
Cross-pollination is on the way
Yes, it's on the way, yes, it's on the way
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hali hali, ho, hali hali, hey
Cross-pollination, hali, ho, is on the way
Contamination, hali, ho, hey hali, ho, hey hali, ho, hey hali ha, ha

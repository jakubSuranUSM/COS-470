She was only a child
Someone to hold on
Only a child
Someone to believe in
Only a child
Someone to love

Ah........

She was "17"
Beauty queen
I met her in a magazine
Heart of fire
Loves desire
Reachin' out
Higher, higher

Runaway
One more day
A broken hearted child at play
I pray for you
Baby blue
In the name of love
I reach for you

In the darkness comes
The evil of the night
Think about it

You better wait
Stop yourself before you fall
You better wait
Stop before you lose it all
Somewhere there's love

Oh somewhere, somewhere

Precious girl
Little pearl
Temptation is a lonely world
Eyes deceive
They believe
In everything they wanna see, yeah

And the neon lights
Reflect your life
Only you know
Where you hide baby

You better wait
Stop yourself before you fall
You better wait
Stop before you lose it all
'Cause somewhere there's love
You better wait
Stop before you start
Don't look back
Don't lose heart

(guitar solo)

Don't look
Don't look
Don't look back baby

Ah......

Don't

Ah......

Don't look
Don't look
Don't look back baby

Queen of the hours, lies 
Waiting for the wind, 
To blow away the veil of time 
Slowly now the threads of age

Are starting to unwind
Queen of the hours, 
Along, along, along the path of time, of time 
She is still, the clock shall tell, 
The tale when all is well, is well

Black was the night that 
Came in from the east 
And caused the land to sleep 
Riding on a storm it carved 
A message in the Isabella Creek.

Dawn is the death wish 
Night has passed away 
It left a sacred flower 
Open up the grave and bowed itÂ´s life 
Unto the Queen of the hours.

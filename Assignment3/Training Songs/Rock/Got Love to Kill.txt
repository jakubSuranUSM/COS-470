Woman, skip in and walk
Like you own the place, baby
Move on, you gotta get
Your groove on and take it all

Didn't you want to change the world
Like a child in flight
But then you turn and walk away
Say goodbye to another day

Strong man, you trying to raise
Your fists with nothing to fight
Slow down, ain't no enemy
But yourself, lover

Didn't you want to change the world
Like a child in flight
But then you turn and walk away
Say goodbye to another day

What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be, do you want me?
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be, do you want me?
Is that even a question in your mind?

So don't love me discontent
Like your love is spent
When I'm lying alone
Baby, where's your home?

You're looking for me, it's all for free
I got love to kill for my man of steel
Burning cold, telling me no, you're burning cold
And I can't let you go, I can't let you go

What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be, do you want me?
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be, do you want me?

What's it gonna be, baby
What's it gonna be, do you want me?
What's it gonna be
What's it gonna be, do you want me?
Is that even a question in your mind?

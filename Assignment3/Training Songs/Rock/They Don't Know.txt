You've been around for such a long time now
Oh
Maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely ev'ry night
When I can be with you
Oh yes
You make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say that you're bad for me
And I should turn you away 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
I get a feeling when I look at you wherever you go now I want to be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care

And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve?
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose
Baby
There's no need for living in the past

Now I've found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others
Don't bother me
'Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

No
I don't listen to their wasted lines

Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
No
I don't listen to their wasted lines

Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
'Cause they don't know about us and they've never heard of love

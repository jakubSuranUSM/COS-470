She was  just sixteen and all alone
When I came to be
So we grew up together
My mama child and me
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby

And she would sing sha na na na na na na na
It will be all right sha na na na na na
Sha na na na na na na na
Now just hold on tight

Sing it to me mama (mama mama ma)
Sing it sweet and clear, oh!
Mama let me hear that old rock and roll lullaby

We made it through the lonely days
But Lord the nights were long
And we'd dream of better moments
When mama sang her song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
'Cause I just knew lots of love came through
In that rock and roll lullaby

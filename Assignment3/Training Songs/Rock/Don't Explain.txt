Hush now, don't explain
There ain't nothin' to gain
I'm glad that your back
Don't' explain

Quiet baby, don't explain
There is nothing to gain.
Skip back the lipstick
Don't explain.

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts of you
For I'm so completely yours
Don't want to hear folks chatter
Cause I know you cheat
Right n' wrong don't matter
When your with me my sweet..

Hush now don't explain
Don't you know your my joy and your my pain.
My life is yours love
Don't explain

All my thoughts of you, for I'm so completely yours.
I don't want to hear nobody chatter
Cause I know you cheat,
Right n' wrong don't matter
When your with me my sweet.

Hush now, don't explain
Your my joy, your my pain
My life is yours love
Don't explain.

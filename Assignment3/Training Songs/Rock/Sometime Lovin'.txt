I don't want your sometime lovin', 
That falls like summers rain. 
For I've slept through two long winters, 
And love's been where my head has lain. 
When you've wandered through the snowfall, 
Through the pines on Witches Lane, 
When you've seen the way she holds them, 
Come and hold me once again. 
And when you've heard a river laughing, 
As she bends the rocks and sand. 
Seen a wave crossing an ocean, 
Come and take me by the hand. 
When you've seen a hungry grassland, 
Reach out to kiss the rain. 
When you've seen how strong her kiss is, 
Come and kiss me once again. 
And when the earth has turned her season, 
And her love has brought the grain. 
If you find that love inside you, 
Come and live with me again.

Is it me or is it you
And can I find the answer
There's a new beginning, wooo
I wanna see you there
Is it me or is it you
Where my heart is calling

{Chorus}:
Shall we wake up and live
Kiss the next one you see
I told you once so I'll tell you twice
Yes, you can come with me
Then we'll share a dream
All day, all night

Is it me or is it you
And did you see the morning
There's a new beginning, wooo
Where the fields are young
Is it me or is it you
Where my heart is always

{Chorus}

Is it me or is it you
Now we see the sunshine
In a new beginning, wooo
Where our days will change
Is it me or is it you
Now we've seen the morning

Shall we wake up and live
Kiss the next one you see
Another world song, yo ho
Sitting in our hand
I told you once so I'll tell you twice
Yes, you can come with me
Then we'll share a dream
All day, all night

Is it me or you 
And can I find out, whoa-oh
Is it me or you
And can I find out, whoa-oh
Is it me or you
And can I find out, whoa-oh

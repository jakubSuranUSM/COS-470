There`s a storm coming
But there will be no rain
Bringing clouds of anger
From a thousand years of pain

For some of us there is no shelter
From the change in the weather
It will find you wherever you run
So if you`re down for what`s right

There`s no reason to hide
For you there is no fear

People dying and crying
The sound of shattered dreams
Drowning the voice of the future
With negativity

For some of us there is no answer
To the change in the weather
Cloud`s will cover the sun
So if you`re down for what`s right

There is no reason to run
For you there is no fear

Run Run Run Run...
But you can`t hide...
From the storm
Lightning from the sky
Will strike you down
I have no fear [Repeat: x 2]

There`s a hurt coming
But who will feel the pain
And the tears of sadness
Falling down like rain

Run Run Run Run...
But you can`t hide...
From the storm

Lightning from the sky
Will strike you down
I have no fear [Repeat: x 2]

There`s a storm coming
But there will be no rain

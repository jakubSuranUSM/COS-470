Water and sand and the rising beyond my view
Alone I stand here it's calling you
There is a reason to be here and cry
I know the ocean will understand why

The feeling the way I do
Tasting the salt and the wind cries your name again
Sharpened so cold makes me feel I've lost a friend
There's a reason that I'll never know 

I couldn't follow why you had to go 
And I can't comprehend 
The wind blows away my fears 
The ocean will drown all my tears 

'Cause I've got to survive though I need your loving here
Seagull ... take my love wherever you may fly 
Seagull ... bury all my feelings for her 
To a place somewhere in the sky 

There's a reason that I'll never know 
I couldn't follow why you had to go 
And I can't comprehend 
The wind blows away my fears 

The ocean willl drown all my tears 
'Cause I've got to survive though I need your loving here
Seagull ... take my love wherever you may fly 
Seagull ... bury all my feelings for her 

To a place somewhere in the sky 
Oh oh oh

Seagull ... take my love wherever you may fly
Seagull ... bury all my feelings for her 
To a place somewhere in the sky

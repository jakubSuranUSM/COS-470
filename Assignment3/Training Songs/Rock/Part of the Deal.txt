Don't lose hope for your boy
He's a responsible man
Just know that he will
Just know that I can under the circumstances at hand
It's part of the deal...
Don't give up on us now
You're the one that will be showing us 
How we will all come together naturally
It's part of the deal...
Saving my life
It's all part of the deal
Saving my life
It's part of the deal
Don't give up on the world
We weren't just born to die
We weren't born just to fade away 
What do you think mistakes are for 
To walk through naturally
It's part of the deal
You're saving my life
It's all part of the deal
Saving my life
It's part of the deal
Ready to go 
Ready to go 
Ready to go
It's all part of the deal
You're saving my life

I'm back on the street
baby
I'm downbeat.
You know it's you I see in every girl I meet.
I'm giving you up
and it's getting me down

Everybody's talk
talking at me
it's all the same sound.

I hang up the phone
I go out alone

There's nothing left to say
baby

love's just a heartache away.
When I lost you
baby
I lost it all.
They say in love and romance we all take a fall.
I got to places we'd go
I talk to people we know

I'll get over you someday
love's just a heartache away.

I hang up the phone
I go out alone
. . .
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
. . .

I'm giving you up
and it's getting me down

Everybody's talk
talking at me
it's all the same damn sound.
I hang up the phone
I go out alone
. . .
I hong vp the phone
I go out olone
. . .

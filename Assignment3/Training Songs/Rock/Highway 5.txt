Well love is power and i play to rule
well love is power and as an absolute corrupts entirely all our minds and sets a course that we can't sail 

Well love is power and i play to rule
well love is power and as an absolute corrupts entirely all our minds and it's a language we can't use

Well what if i should call your name at night 
what if she can't cope with me if we should come to fight
and what if i can't never be nobody else's

Baby got lost on highway 5 and called my name out loud said she broke down and cried about we can't live apart
and all the people they were driving by watched her like she was mad
but she know she would never suffer from the madness that they had

baby takes off in a DC-10 stares down highway 5
she said she looked down and wondered why we can' live apart 
and all the people they were sitting there like a smile on a foolish face
flying 500 miles an hour with no sense of time nor space

come on believe me baby for i would never lie to you
come on believe me baby

baby knelt down in a church of god 10 miles down highway 5
she said she looked up and asked why we can't live apart
and all the people were standing up and singing like they were mad
but she don't get no answers to the questions that she had

heaven saw a knife in a young girl's heart burn through on highway 5
said it takes time and big mistakes for us to realize
we need each other like the air we breathe ain't nothing we can do
and no-one else will ever make me quite as mad as you do

Well that disco thing can sure get funky 
All them pretty songs seem too slow 
I like to sit and pick with them good old boys 
Maybe New Wave's in, I just don't know 
When the critics try to analyses the current trend 
I just sit back and watch 'em come and go 
'cause I can play that rock and roll 
Oh, now I can play that rock and roll 
Hey now, I can play that rocking rock and roll 

If you, if you want to party at the next election 
Only one way to go 
Put on a rocking rock and roll selection 
Turn up and vote 
And you can check out anytime you want 
Just call me Joe 
And I can play that rock and roll for ya... 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I can play that rock and roll 
Yeah, now now, I, I, I, well I can play that rock and roll 
Well I can play that rock and roll 
I can play that rock and roll

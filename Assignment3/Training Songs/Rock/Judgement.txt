Asleep is the rose, in tired innocence
Dreaming time away
Secure in the comfort of slumbers faint embrace
Blissfully ignorant, unaware of the imminence

Recurring memories emerge from the deep
Of old secrets unforgotten sleep
They sink beneath the surface just long enough for you to breathe
Then return to choke you when you wake up alone

Shredded inside

There's one place left to turn
A long-term problem, a temporary remedy,
But f*ck it all anyway you can pretend to be happy
So many years of pathetic lies, empty promises

And unfulfilled dreams are scattered like dust into the winds
Looking for the sun that eclipsed behind black feathered wings
Tomorrow never comes, there was only ever one day
But now it's too late

The inequity of fate
The pains of love and hate
The heart-sick memories
That brought you to your knees

And the times when we were young
When life seemed so long
Now you are left alone
Where did it all go wrong
Day after day
You burned it all away
(And it's too late)

All the hate that feeds your needs
All the sickness you conceive
All the horror you create
Will bring you to your knees

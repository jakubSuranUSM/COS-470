Hey, Rusty, come hold Luther’s hand
It’s deja-vu, it’s not like I planned
Looks like I’m going where I’ve already been

I’m going down the drain, again

Is this really worth it?
I got a prison cough
A three-headed monster cut Denny’s head right off
You can’t be too chill
You can’t be too zen

I’m going down the drain, again
I’m going down the drain, again 
I’m going down the drain, again 

Up the hill to have him killed and he still hadn’t died 
He talked a while and walked six mile down to riverside

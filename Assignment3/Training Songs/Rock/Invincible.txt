And 5, 6, 7, 8...

[Verse 1]
Anything we wanna do we gonna do it right
Always gonna win
Because we don't give up the fight
Workin' out to think about the possibilities
Strong enough to do
And we got everything we need
Nothin' eva gonna slow us down, no, because we know that we are...

[Chorus]
Invincible (Invincible!)
Invincible (Invincible!)
Standin' up together
Yeah, we never gonna fall
Invincible (Invincible)
Ohhh...

[Verse 2]
Never under estimate the power that ya got
You can take a situation
Make it what you want
Knowin' what ya gotta do
And workin' out a plan
All that you have gotta do 
Is 'lieve in that ya can
Nothin' eva gonna slow us down, no
Once ya know that ya are...

[Chorus]
Invincible (Invincible!)
Invincible (Invincible!)
Standin' up together
Yeah, we gonna fall
Invincible (Ivincible)
Oh!

[Chorus]
Invincible (Invincible!)
Invincible (Invincible!)
Takin' down the world
We are the girls that win it all
Invincible (Invincible)
Ohhh...

Invincible...

Ssshhh, ahh
Seems this worlds gotch you down
Your feelin' bad vibrations frown
Well, open your eyes girl, look at me 
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

We're gonna' have a good thing
Such a good thing baby

And when your world don't seem just right
And life's gettin' you uptight
You can change that wrong to right (wrong to right)
Cause I was there myself last night (there last night)

Girl, I really had a good thing
Such a good thing baby
I, I, I won't have no one now
No one around, to bring you down
Well... groovy world, girl 
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing girl

Gotta hear me, you can't please them all, should you try
They don't care if you live or die
Cause their losers, what a shame (what a shame)
I'm gonna show you to a brand new game (brand new game)

Girl, we're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

I won't tell you no,no, no lies
When I'm through, you'll realize 
For the first time it seems right (feels so right)
I'm gonna stay right here tonight (stay tonight)

Girl, we'll really have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

Nobody, no one around, to bring you down
Well... groovy world, girl 
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing
such a good thing, girl
such a good thing, baby
such a, such a, such a, good thing, baby

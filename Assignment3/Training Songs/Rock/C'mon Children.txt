Way up on that mountain children 
Reachin' up there for ya children 
Need ya back down here my children 
To plant your pretty flowers children 
(C'mon children, c'mon children) 

Hey, hey-hey, hey 
Come on down and lend a hand 
Need your love, to save the land 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
(C'mon children, c'mon children) 

The world needs the children 
Cryin' for the children 
The world needs the children

Need ya back down here my children 
To plant your pretty flowers children 
Come on children 
Need your love to save the land 
Need your love to save the land 
To save the land, save the land 
To save the land, save the land 

Need ya back down here my children 
To plant your pretty flowers children 
Come on children 
Need your love to save the land 
Need your love to save the land 
To save the land, save the land 
To save the land, save the land

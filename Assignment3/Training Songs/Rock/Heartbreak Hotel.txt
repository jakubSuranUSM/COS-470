Well since my baby left me
Well I found a new place to dwell
Well it's down at the end of Lonely Street
That's Heartbreak Hotel, where I'll be

I'll be just so lonely baby, 
Well I'm so lonely,
I'll be so lonely I could die.

Although it's always crowded, 
You still can find some room 
For broken hearted lovers 
To cry there in the gloom, and be so

They'll be just so lonely baby 
They'll be just so lonely, 
Well they're so lonely they could die.

Now, the bell hop's tears keep flowin',
And the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back, and they'll be

They'll be just so lonely, baby 
Well they're so lonely 
Well they're so lonely they could die.

Well now, if your baby leaves you, 
You've got a tale to tell. 
Well just take a walk down Lonely Street 
To Heartbreak Hotel, where you will be

You'll be so lonely baby, 
Well you'll be lonely,
You'll be so lonely you could die.

Although it's always crowded, 
You still can find some room. 
For broken hearted lovers 
To cry there in the gloom, and be so

They'll be just so lonely baby 
Well they're so lonely, 
Well they're so lonely they could die

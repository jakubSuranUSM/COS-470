I never knew that I was dealing with a graduate
With a major in defensive and a minor in excuses
It's not that hard to say you're wrong, admit oh, go on, go on

You know I wouldn't want to make you feel worse than you should
But if you were me you'd do the same (you know you would, you know you would)
It's not that hard to say you're wrong, admit oh, go on, go on

It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me 
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on

I know you know it's all your fault and I should let this go
But I need to hear you say it love
(it's principle, it's principle) 
It's not that hard to say you're wrong, admit it oh, go on, go on

It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on

That I was right and you were wrong, go on, go on (go on, go on)

It would mean everything
(but you're so smart with those clever eyes)
So I tell you that I love you, and blow you a kiss
(but until you say you're sorry, well that's all you're gonna get)
Oh, that's all you gonna get, oh...

oh oh oh...(x2)

It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on 

That I was right and you were wrong, it's no that hard, go on, go on

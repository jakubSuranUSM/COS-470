So much of me is you I don't know just who I am 
Now I just can't believe in myself or in anything 
And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 

I gave you my soul I gave you control of me 
Now I just can't believe in myself or anything 

And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me 

Can't you just believe "you are my everything" 

And this is what you take from me 
And this is what you take from me

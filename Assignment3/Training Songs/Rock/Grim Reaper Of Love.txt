Movin' on slowly, sittin' forlornly 
Looks through her window, clouds hide the sun 
She thinks of her love, gone like the wild ones 
She knows he'll never return 

[Chorus] 
Grim reaper of love, grim reaper of love 
Grim reaper of love, grim reaper of love 
Killing the living & living to kill 
Grim reaper of love thrives on pain; people, beware 

Missed her sadness of the loss of his loaning 
But in his past thinking, love can't last 
We were so happy, peaceful and dear 
But now his life's a little miser 

[Chorus]

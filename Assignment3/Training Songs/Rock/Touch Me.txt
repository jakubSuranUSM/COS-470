Real life, killed me on the school bus
Real life, wise guys never weep
Real life, dying to be famous
Real life, happens on TV

Real life, covered up in make-up
Real life, it's only make believe
Real life, I meet you when I wake up
Real life, I touch you on a screen

Touch me, touch me
I long to live for real
Touch me, touch me
I'm just as human as a human can be
Please touch me

Real life, full of imitations
Real life, I talk to you in codes
Real life, real imagination
Real life, I hide behind these clothes

Touch me, touch me
I long to live for real
Touch me, touch me
I'm just as human as a human can be
Please touch me

Touch me, (touch me) touch me (touch me)
I long to live for real
Touch me, (touch me)  touch me (touch me)
I long to live for real
Touch me, touch me
I'm just as human as a human can be

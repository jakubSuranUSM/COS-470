In the village
Of Leboga
Lies a body
Cold and dead
For the venom
Of the cobra
Has with
The body wed
I can hear
A little girl
As she cries 
All around
For the snake
Has killed the father
Tell me where it
Can help be found
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
Then all the people
Sound the drums
Call the mongoose
>From his lair
Through the jungle
He flies alone
To a tunnel
On a hill
In the dark
The cobra waits
In his eyes a
Glow of red
Like a flash
Comes the mongoose
For the battle
Head to head
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
Said the mongoose
To the cobra
"See that panther
In that tree"
As the cobra 
Turned its head
Mongoose caught it
In his teeth
Then the people
Started singing
For the snake
Killed them all
Cobra eggs
Now are hatching
Baby cobras
Back for more!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!

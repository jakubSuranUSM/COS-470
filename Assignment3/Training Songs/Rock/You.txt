Whispering only birds could hear 
Thinking only of you 
Sighing softly, I see your face again 

Stepping through gentle pools of rain 
Rippling off our reflection 
Will we be as we are today, my love? 

CHORUS (x2): 
Time has brought us together 
This we feel with our hearts 
Living seems all the better 
Love is like a flower start

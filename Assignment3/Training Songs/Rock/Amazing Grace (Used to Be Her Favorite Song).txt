Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
She was all I ever wanted
She was an angel for sure
She stands even now in my memory
So sweet and pure
But all that made me happy
Was a bottle and a song
Used to stay out drinkin'
While she cried all night long
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

She thought she could make me
Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile
I guess the pull of the bottle 
Was just a little bit to strong
Now she's left me and 
I don't know where she's gone
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

And then one night she said "I'm goin'"
But she didn't say where
It didn't seem to matter
And I didn't really care
But now that I'm sober
And I can see it all
I know I'm to blame for her part
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
Lord where's my good girl gone?

Don't bother cryin', don't bother crawlin'
 It's all over now, no use in stallin'
 The love I once felt, I don't feel anymore for you
 This time I'll even open the door for you
 You walked out when I was down
 Well now I'm well off
 And look who's comin' round
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where were you when I wanted you
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where..ere...ere
 You're lookin' good, it's hard to fight it
 But no use explainin', I've already decided
 That livin' with you, it's worse than without you
 I won't spend a lifetime a-worryin' about you
 Oh, things got rough and you disappeared
 Now I'm back on my feet
 But look, look who's standing there
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where were you when I wanted you
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where..ere...ere
 Oh, you were so young, and you were so wild
 I knew you were nobody's innocent child
 That first day I saw you, you really got to me
 I thought I could change you, what good did it do me
 Oh, things got rough and you wouldn't wait
 Now you're tripping back
 But babe, it's too late
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where were you when I wanted you
 Where were you when I needed you
 Where..ere...ere

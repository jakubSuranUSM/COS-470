I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most

I got a car that I bought
Won't get me far
I gotta wish on a star
Tell me mama

I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most

I got friends who like me 'cause I got lots of dough
The people recognize me wherever I go
I don't got trouble gettin' high
But if I don't get you, I believe I will die

I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most

I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
I got everything I need, almost
But I don't got you
And you're the thing I need the most

Turning around I see someone
That I thought I used to know
You wide eyed in the crowd
How does it feel to see the world
And not turn cold

I wanna hold you
And protect you from the change
Though I know it's gonna happen anyway

Take this veil, I'll dry your eyes
In a world like ours you're nobody's child

I'm dependin' on you to teach me
All the things I forgot I ever knew
Baby, you can lean on me
I may lean a little too
Whatever gets us through

And I feel a mountain movin' deep within
At the end of the revival we begin

Take this veil, it'll dry your eyes
In a world like ours, our nobody's child

And I feel a mountain movin' deep within
At the end of the revival we begin

Take this veil, dry these eyes
You see me prayin', but I'm nobody's child

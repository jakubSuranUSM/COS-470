Woke up this morning, yeah
With this warning
My premonition will come true
(Well) I'm no psychic man
I am no skeptic but
I got news for you (yeah)

I woke up dreaming
With a message in my head
Is someone playing games with me
You have to watch out for
A black cat across your path
Or seven years will pass, oh

Chorus

You keep on doing
What you're doing
All the time, oh
Any day I'll be loose
I know the feeling
When you lose all control

Hey you turn around
Look down and feel the ground
You won't come close to fire
To yourself, you're just a liar, yeah

Woke up this morning, yeah
With this warning
My premonition will come true

I woke up dreaming
With a message in my head
Is someone playing tricks on me
You have to watch out for
A black cat across your path
Or seven years will pass, oh

Chorus

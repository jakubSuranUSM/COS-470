(Willcox/Sidelnyc)
Fingers cross my lips
Drawing pretty maps
With my bright red lipstick
Pictures of deviation
I read in the dictionary
That I'm a miscreation
A nonconformist
Make it quick, make it quick,
I make a livin' off-a this
This is your fifteen minute call ladies and gentlemen fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
God you're beatiful.
Na na don't use the back breaks honey
Forget my lips just let the muscle fix fit
Pr..pr..prostitute
Pr..pr..prostitute
Now don't quote Karl Marx to me
What's yours is yours,
What's mine is ours
When you touch me
I feel the media printing porn
Across my female form
Cigarette burns on your jacksaw chin
Come on man
I need a girl
If you can't do
What she can man.
They say, when something begins, there is no sin...
Na na don't use the back breaks honey
Forget my lips just let the muscle fix fit
Pr..pr..prostitute
Pr..pr..prostitute
Come on baby, baby, baby, baby
Reach my maturity
No bones about it
Slow burn speed car racing
Three point turn
B..b..body tracing
We're heading for that wall
We're heading for that wall

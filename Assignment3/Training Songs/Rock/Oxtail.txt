Hammer lock, a victim away
Sandpaper tongue like a brand new thing
Your better days are all behind you now
Branded and burned away

Skyway down on you
Knotted by the screen door
Kidney stones for your black Irish
Praying by the steam heat
Built a ship to needle out of tune and well connected, skyway down...

Cold hands, poor circulation
Dalmatian skin, oxtail downtown lights
Thunder port-wine sex
I don't want jealous, greed & vain

Skyway down on you
Knotted by the screen door
Kidney stones for your black Irish
Praying by the steam heat
Built a ship to needle out of tune and well connected, skyway down...

This is "my home town song"
A "how it's like at home song"
Spending hours all alone
Waiting by the phone

It's hard to say come closer
When you're so far away
And sometimes it's hard to remember that
Tomorrow is as close as yesterday

This is my home town
I'm dossing up and down these streets,
Where nothing ever seems to change
Where wet green grass meets dust and dirt
That's where love no longer hurts

I've never been a loner,
At least I've never wanted to be one
So whatever you do, remember one thing:
My home is where my heart is and...

This is my home town
It's hard to say "come closer"
When you're so far away
Whatever you do, remember one thing:
My home is where my heart is!

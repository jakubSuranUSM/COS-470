Down and out in London
Los Angeles and Paris too
I drank a river In my time
Just to get on through yeah

Well the night rise above you, rise above me
And the blues they swirl around me

To the heart of soul
You gotta bleed a little while you sing
Less the words don't mean no thing
Get to the heart of soul
Gotta get to the heart of soul, yeah

Get to the hip now baby
'Fore the hip get to you, lil' woman
Try to bend me out of shape
Can't tell me what to do, a lil' honey

Well the night it rise above me yeah
And those blues they swirl around me

To the heart of soul
You gotta bleed a little while you sing
Lest the words don't mean no thing
Get to the heart of soul
Gotta get to the heart of soul, yeah

You gotta bleed a little while you sing
Lest the words don't mean no thing
Get to the heart of soul
Baby heart of soul, ow

From the delta
Down on the river
We need some heart of soul
In the world today now
A lil' bit of heart of soul now
In the world today
A lil' bit of heart of soul now
A lil' heart of so so so so soul

(You gotta bleed a while your singin')
Lest the words don't mean nothin', no they don't, no
Get to the heart of soul, yea
Ow, baby, heart of soul

(You gotta bleed lil' a while your singin')
Lest the words don't mean nothin', no they don't, no
Get to the heart of soul

Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb
Kookie, Kookie?
Well now, let's take it from the top and grab some wheels
We're well along and talk about some cuckoo deals
But Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb
Kookie, Kookie?
Now you're on the way, miss, and I'm readin' you just fine
Don't cut out of here till we get on Cloud Nine
But Kookie, Kookie?
I've got smog in the noggin ever since you made the scene
You're the utmost
If you ever tool me out
Dead, I'm the saddest, like a brain
The very utmost
Kookie, lend me your comb
Kookie, Kookie?
Man, I got my British lighters and my flapsy-colored pen
You're gonna send me to that planet called
You know it, baby, the end

Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb
Kookie, Kookie?
If you ever cut out, you might be a stray cat
'Cause when I'm flyin' solo, nowhere's we're on that!
Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb
Kookie, Kookie?
What's with this comb caper, baby?
Why do you wanna latch up with my comb?
I just want you to stop combing your hair and kiss me
You're the maximum utmost
Well, I'm beat and I'm dreams goin', I'm movin' right now
'Cause that's the kind of scene that I dig
Baby, you're the ginchiest!

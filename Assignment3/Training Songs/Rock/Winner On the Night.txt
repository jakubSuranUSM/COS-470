Sometimes you're feeling sad and lonely 
And things ain't goin' right for you 
You're looking for somebody 
So tired of bein' all alone 

Don't throw your life away, remember 
When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside of you 

Hold on and things will be alright 
And in the end when it's all over 
You'll be the winner on the night 
And in the end when it's all over 

You're not the same you used to be 
You know it wasn't easy 
But with experience you'll see 
You'll make it out if you remember 

When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside of you 
Hold on and things will be alright 

And in the end when it's all over 
You'll be the winner on the night 
When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 

Just believe in the power deep inside of you 
Hold on and things will be alright 
And in the end when it's all over 
You'll be the winner on the night 

When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside of you 
Hold on and things will be alright 

And in the end when it's all over 
You'll be the winner on the night 
When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside...

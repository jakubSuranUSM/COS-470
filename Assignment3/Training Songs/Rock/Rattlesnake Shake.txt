I got hell hounds on my trail
Bad luck and trouble ride on my tail
I got rattlesnake blood runnin through my veins
You turn around and I'm gone again
People know me ever where I go
Men don't understand but the little girls know
I pick em up and I put em down
It makes em nervous when I move around
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the get-goin fever in my travelin bones
I got the rattlesnake shake and I gotta move on
Been everwhere and back again
I need to move I'm a movin' man
I got highway fever I'm a rollin stone
The shirt on my back is all own
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the get-goin fever in my travelin bones
I got the rattlesnake shake and I gotta move on
Guitar
People know me ever where I go
Men don't understand but the little girls know
I pick em up and I put em down
It makes em nervous when I move around
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the get-goin fever in my travelin bones
I got the rattlesnake shake and I gotta move on
I got hell hounds on my trail
Bad luck and trouble ride on my tail
I got rattlesnake blood runnin through my veins
You turn around and I'm gone again
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the shake I got the rattlesnake shake
I got the get-goin fever in my travelin bones
I got the rattlesnake shake and I gotta move on

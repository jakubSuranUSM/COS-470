We came here to ask if you’d stop selling them
My body is broken and bruised
My body is broken and bruised
We came here to ask if you'd stop selling them
We've been press ganged and hurriedly held
We've been forgotten quicker than felled

And you're taken aback by the length of the list you've been thrown on
The tailback of timorous souls who've been dropped on the grey road from branches
The leaves that fall louder than backfire all orange and Hallowe'en red
On a beautiful road

We came here to ask if you’d stop selling them
My calibre craters in skin
From the trouble I've found myself in
We came here to ask if you'd stop selling them
In the god-fearing home of the brave
As I crawl out the pram to the grave

And you're taken aback by the length of the list you've been thrown on
The tailback of timorous souls who've been dropped on the grey road from branches
The leaves that fall louder than backfire all orange and Hallowe'en red
On a beautiful road

It harks back to tree bursts in snow
It harks back to tree bursts in snow
It harks back to tree bursts in snow
It harks back to tree bursts in snow

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

And you're taken aback by the length of the list you've been thrown on
The tailback of timorous souls who've been dropped on the grey road from branches
The leaves that fall louder than backfire all orage and Hallowe'en red
On a beautiful road

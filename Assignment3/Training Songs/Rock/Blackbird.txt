Call me a thief of your heart
Call me anything that you want
I'm over the sentiment that was here
In this body of mine years ago

So give us the pieces, give us the part
Put it together make a new start
Come out of the corners, out of the dark
Light up a new one, light up a new spark

And I could be happy if I had a friend who loved all of me
All the way to the end, all the way from A to Z
When you're down and out as low as you can be

Let's go out tonight, put on something black
Go out for drinks, take it all back
We'll take it real slow, we'll do it with care
When you're rebuilding lives, you gotta start somewhere

Like a blackbird singing around your head tonight
When you're out late and you're walking around
Corners keeping you tight and passengers sleeping
High above your head on the aeroplane's journey
To the moon and back again

You play it so cool but something's withheld
When you're riding with me, you got nothing to tell
Can see it in your eyes, see it in your sweat
On the count of three, you can let go of it

And sometimes I sleep through it all
Sometimes I break through the wall
Then I wake up it starts again
The evil inside of my head

Like a blackbird singing around your head tonight
When you're out late and you're walking around
Corners keeping you tight and the passengers sleeping
High above your head on the aeroplane's journey
To the moon, to the moon and back again

Like a blackbird, oh like a blackbird
Oh like a blackbird, blackbird, blackbird

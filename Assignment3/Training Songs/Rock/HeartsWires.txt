Nothing can save me now
It's what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all I see

Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision of dreams about you
Came true for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And died on your heart
Writhe 'till the end

Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you first save yourself
And then come for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And died on your heart
Writhe to the end
Break through
Collect the wires
And writhe in your heart
Writhe 'till the end

Away, away, away
Down deep into your veins
All the way
All the way
Down deep in your heart
All the way
All the way, away

Cut through (away)
This razor wire (away)
Writhe 'till the end
Break through (away)
Collect the wire (away)
Died on your heart
Writhe 'till the end

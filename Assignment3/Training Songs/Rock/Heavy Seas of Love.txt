When your soul isn't right
And it's raw to the night
It's in your
Hands
When the traces of dark come
To fade in the light
You're in safe hands

Heavy seas of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below on the
Heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
We come together in you
Counting out the new moons on the
Heavy seas of love

If the world is too tall
You can jump you won't fall
You're in safe hands
What the day will now give
How those seeds will now live
It's in your hands

Heavy seeds of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below on the
Heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
We come together in you
Counting out the new moons on the
Heavy seas of love

Heavy seeds of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below on the
Heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
Radiance is in you
Counting out the new moons on the
Heavy seas of love

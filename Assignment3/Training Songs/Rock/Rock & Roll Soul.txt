We're having a party, yeah, yeah, everybody's invited,
The new generation along with the old.
If you could get with it just a little more, it don't take much tryin',
You'll find out if you've got some rock & roll soul, baby.

Ain't everybody in the world. So when you know what you got, let everybody know,
You got some rock & roll soul.
So when you know what you got, let everybody know,
You got some rock & roll soul.

I know it when I'm feelin' groovy,
It's kind of funky like an old-time movie.
I can feel it and it's really something,
It's really something when my heart starts pumpin', yeah.

Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.
Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.

Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.
Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.

Tell everybody you know, you got some rock 'n roll soul.

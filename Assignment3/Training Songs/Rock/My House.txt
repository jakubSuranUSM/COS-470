In my house there's a place I can hide
When I feel a surge of self pity
In my house there's a place where I sit
And watch the violence on the telly
In my house there's a kitchen
Where we eat drink and cook
And in my house there's an attic at the top
Where my sister and her boyfriend go
My house get down the stairs
My house 'till your dad gets home
My house listen son there's a few rules you should know
About living in my house do as you're told
My house have you got that straight
My house if you wanna own it then you just better wait

In my house there's a bathroom
It's a lovely shade of green
In my house there's a best room
And mum keeps that real clean
In my house there's five bedrooms
And there's only four of us
In my house there's an alley down the back
And a hut that ain't up to much

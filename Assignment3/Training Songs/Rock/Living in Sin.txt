I know you write me sexy letters
And you send your pictures for my wall
You found the hotel where I'm stayin'
And you built up the nerves and then you called

I'm living in sin
(At the Holiday Inn)
At the Holiday Inn, yeah
(Living in sin)

I'm living in sin
(At the Holiday Inn)
At the Holiday Inn
(Just living in sin)

You tell me, you want me to protect you
But sometimes my love can go too far
Deep in your heart you wanna love me
Come closer, I know who you are

I'm living in sin
(At the Holiday Inn)
At the Holiday Inn, yeah

I'm living in sin
(At the Holiday Inn)

Deep in your heart you wanna love me
Come closer, I know who you are
I know who you are

Huh, hello baby
Hello, oh, is this Gene Simmons?
Oh, can I, aw, oh my God, oh, uh, what room is
Is it true what they say about you
That you get to show your face personally
Gene, uh, oh my God

But sometimes my love can go too far

I could've been Miss Punta Blanca
I could've but I didn't want ta
I think I could've been a winner
If I'd gone dancing after dinner

I could've rhumba'd by the pool side
I could've samba'd with the tour guide
Instead I took a motorcycle ride
With my friend Mike, this guy I really like
He rents the motorbikes

So light me a cigar, my love
And tell me your name, I, I know your name
Let's pour me a drink now
Let's have a toast to who we really are

And I'll sing you a song right in your ear
On this beautiful Cuban moonlit night
Oh, I need another, another light

I could've been Miss Punta Blanca
I could've but I didn't want ta
I could've but I said no thank ya
I said I didn't want ta

Anyways, it was Ruby who won the contest
And two hours later she was passed out by the pool

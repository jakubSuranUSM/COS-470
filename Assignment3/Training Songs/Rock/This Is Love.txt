Here am I, lost in a world behind me,
All alone, just like before you found me.
Now I stare out on the traffic in the city,
Even in the dark,
And the rain falls on my window sill.
This is love, girl, call it what you will,
This is love.

As I sit, thoughts of the past surround me,
All around, like the sound of the wind in Winter,
Now I walk among the buildings of the city,
Always in the dark,
And the rain falls, spray from passing wheels,
This is love, girl, call it what you will,
This is love.

Do what you want, do what you want, you've got to,
Be what you want, be what you want, you've got to

Before, my life was a waste without you,
What do I do now that I'm gonna lose you?
But you're gonna do exactly what you want to,
Finish my world if I don't get to hold you again.

Now I walk among the buildings of the city,
Always in the dark,
And the rain falls, spray from passing wheels,
This is love, girl, call it what you will,
This is love.

And if ever you want me again, I will be there,
If your world seems to need me again, I will be there,
Now I stare out on the traffic in the city,
Even in the dark,
And the rain falls on my window sill,
This is love, girl, call it what you will,
This is love, girl, call it what you will,
Oh this is love.

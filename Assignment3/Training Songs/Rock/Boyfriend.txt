I've got your boyfriend on my mind
I think you know she stayed with me last night
I held his world in my hands
I threw it out to see where it would land

You came to me for entropy and I gave you all I had
He makes a better man than me
So I know he won't feel bad

It's fine 'cause I am just a girl
"It doesn't count"
He knows a woman needs a man to make her shout

I hope your boyfriend doesn't mind (I know he doesn't mind)
You tell me that you love me every time (You love me all the time)
I held his girl in my hands (I know he doesn't mind)
She likes it 'cause they're softer than a man's (I like to moisturize)

Heaven knows we're meant to be
But it's turned into a mess
No one takes us seriously just because I wear a dress

It's fine 'cause I am just a girl
"It's just a dream"
A woman really needs a man to make her scream

"I can't do any higher"

You came to me for entropy and I gave you all I had
He makes a better man than me
So I know he won't feel bad

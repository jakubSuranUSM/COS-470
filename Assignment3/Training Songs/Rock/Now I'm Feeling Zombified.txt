Now I'm feeling zombiefied!

Face is white
And my eyes is tired

I'll hug and I'll squeeze you till you're hypnotised!
Show you faces and places that'll make you terrified to be alive!

Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Zombiefied!

Curiouser and curiouser and curiouser still
When you get depressed you make us all ill
Curiouser and curiouser and curiouser still
Some present you gave me, the bitterest pill

My eyes is all grey
And I haven't slept in days
Locked up in your dungeon
Running around in your maze

Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Zombiefied!

Look in a dustbin for something to eat
You find a dead rat and you think it's a treat
Yeah look in a dustbin for something to eat
You found a dead rat and you think it's a treat

Curiouser and curiouser and curiouser still
When you get depressed you make us all ill.
Curiouser and curiouser and curiouser still
Some present you gave me, the bitterest pill.

Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied!
Zombiefied!

Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Now I'm feeling zombiefied
Face is white
My eyes is tired!
Zombiefied
Zombiefied

Woo! woo!

Zombie, Zombie, Zombiefied
Zombie, Zombie, Zombiefied!

Zombie, Zombie, Zombiefied
Zombie, Zombie, Zombiefied!

Zombie, Zombie, Zombiefied
Face is white
Eyes is tired
Eyes is - tired
My eyes is tired
Wooo! wooo! ooh!
Woo! woo!

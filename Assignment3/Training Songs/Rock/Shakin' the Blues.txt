I've been waitin' at a train depot
Tryin' to find a reason why I shouldn't go
My bags are done packed so I can't back down
Don't try to stop 'cause I'm railway bound

Get off your knees
There ain't nothin' you can do
I'm gonna ride these tracks
'Till it shakes these blues away

Shakin' these blues away
I don't care if it takes all night
I'm gonna ride that, I'm gonna ride that line

River-bridge movin' at the speed of sound
Conductor man say, "We're gonna stop at the next town"
I get off the train, I gotta look new
Next time you see me I'll be shakin' these blues away

Shakin' these blues away
I don't care if it takes all night
I'm gonna ride that, I'm gonna ride that line

Tupelo shadow cast in my view
Delta show, whore, help me sing my blues
Number 89's on time
Ready to take me to the Texas line

I'm shakin' these blues away
I don't care if it takes all night
I'm gonna ride that, I'm gonna ride that line
I'm gonna ride that [Incomprehensible]

dogs they roam
remember where their home is
everyone they meet
chase away their enemies
hang out in the shade
always in the shade
when it's time to mate they're
not too particular
dogs they rule the night!
they rule the night
dogs they rule the night!
finish every meal
settle for a snack
chasing cars
like to hang out in the park
dogs they rule the night!
they rule the night
dogs they rule the night!
in the pack they're very brave
they're very brave
and then after dark...
underneath the moon!
know what i mean?
ever watch 'em go?
in to town when the sun goes down
dogs they rule the night!
they rule the night
dogs they rule the night!

We shall overcome, we shall overcome
We shall overcome someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We shall overcome someday

We'll walk hand in hand, we'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We'll walk hand in hand someday

We shall live in peace, we shall live in peace
We shall live in peace someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We shall live in peace someday

We are not afraid, we are not afraid
We shall overcome someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We shall overcome someday

We shall overcome, we shall overcome
We shall overcome someday
Here in my heart, I do believe
We shall overcome someday

We shall overcome someday

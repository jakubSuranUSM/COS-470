Got a girl named Lucinda
We call her the great pretender

And when she talks
She says, "bama lama loo"

Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, now, woo
Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo

Now, I dig that style, it's 'bout to drive me wild
With bama lama, bama loo

I asked my baby for kiss
She shook her head like this, woo
I asked my little girl for kiss
She shook her head around like this
She said, "Ooh, yeah"

Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo

Now, I dig that style, it's 'bout to drive me wild
With bama lama, bama loo, ooh

I asked my baby for kiss
She shook her head like, woo
Asked my little girl for kiss
She shook her head around like this
She said, "ooh, yeah"

Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, now, woo
Bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo

Now, I dig that style, it's 'bout to drive me wild
With bama lama, bama loo, ooh

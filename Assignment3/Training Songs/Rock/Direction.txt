Break down!

I've been breaking sweats in the night-time
I was growing my hair
And I could not care
What they think

Cause my eyes were turned up
Like you tore open the ceiling
I've been singing songs in the night-time
I was banging my head

And I could not care
What they think
I said don't open the door
Even if you hear me screaming

I built a raft and got carried away
In my new direction
And there's where I stay
Cause, you should have known

That this boy wasn't grown
So you can go away
Go away
If you want to leave
If you want to leave

Now get down!

I was catching glimpses of bright lights
And they attracted my steps
'Till I was so scared
Of what could be

Hidden underneath the rocks
So we're never in position
I was singing songs of a lost mind
But I am still with my friends

So I am not scared
Of anything
I said don't open the door
Even if you hear me screaming

I met a boy who got carried away
In my direction
And there's where he stays
Well, you should have known

That this boy wasn't grown
So you can go away
Go away
If you want to leave

And now don't you hide
'Cause you've got a treasure to find
So shed those leaves that you lie underneath (underneath)
And now don't you stray
If you feel that you've lost your way
Share this feeling that came over me (over me)

Break down!

I've been breaking sweats in the night-time
I was growing my hair
And I could not care
What they think
I said 
Don't open the door, even if you hear me screaming

I am the boy who got carried away
In my new direction
And there's where I stay
Well, you should have known

That this boy wasn't grown
So you can go away
Go away
If you want to leave
If you want to leave

You should have known
That this boy wasn't grown
So you can go away
Go away
If you want to leave
If you want to leave

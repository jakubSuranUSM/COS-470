Who needs a nurse?
Who called the hearse?
Who took the chance?
Who wants to dance?
Who'll lift the curse?

Swim in a lake
Get up and shake
Turn up the noise
Turn off the boys
Give us a break

Man on the telephone won't ever let me
Man on the telephone say
Hey hey you say

Spike up the nerve 
Don't miss the serve
Cheat in the game 
It's all the same
Fall of the earth

Gather the flock
It's not a shock
Sick of the sauce
We're at a loss
We wanna rock

Man on the telephone won't ever let me
Man on the telephone won't ever catch me
Man on the telephone won't ever hear me
Man on the telephone say
Hey hey you say

Here it comes and there it goes
Another day of decomposing light
In a world called catastrophe my native tongue is blasphemy
So that's the one I'll write
And baby can you feel it?
And don't it make you want to lay down and close your eyes?

Remember how we started because since then I'm a waste
Since then I'm a fool
Since then I'm a dog
In a world called catastrophe
Since then I'm a waste

Here it comes and there it goes
Another day of getting up to fight
In a world called catastrophe my native tongue is blasphemy
So that's the one I'll write
And baby can you hear it?
And don't it make you want to wake up and open your eyes?

Remember how we started because since then I'm a waste
Since then I'm a fool
Since then I'm a dog
In a world called catastrophe
Since then I'm a waste

Here's my chance to say thank you to a place where
All my memories are fond and an essence of my heart
Waiting there with open arms
There's Melissa full of charm
How I miss her so, she's such a sight of love down in

Oh Virginia down the higway to 64
East way to Newport News
There you'll find an open door in
Oh Virginia all my friends are there to greet me
Just a smile down 64 along the open road

At the Patton Hotel I spent lots of time there
That's where we decided this is where we wanted to be
And down the road on Jefferson you'll find Steamer's close by
If you see Mark and Steve Breen
Tell 'em Jeff and I both said "hi"

But we were younger then never knowing then
That she would take us as her own
And make us part of her life
Highway to the sun we had so much fun
I can't wait to get there and tell 'em that I miss my second home

Oh Virginia down the way we'll be there in no time
Oh Virginia just a ride down 64
Oh Virginia I can see those signs from here
Oh Virginia 25 miles to Hampton Roads

We got friends in Yorktown we got friends in Williamsburg
We got friends in Newport News
We want all of y'all from Portsmouth sing
We got friends in Bluefield we got friends in Richmond
We got friends in Hampton Roads
And down by the beach let me hear everybody, yeah

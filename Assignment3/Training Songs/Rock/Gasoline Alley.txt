I think I'm goin' mad and it's makin' me sad
It's a yearnin' for my old back door
I realize maybe I was born to lead
Better swallow my silly country pride

Goin' home, running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I started from
Goin' home, and I'm running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I was born

When the weather's better and rails unfreeze
And the wind won't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch you in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Goin' home, running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I started from
Goin' home, and I'm running' home
Down the gasoline alley where I was born

But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could

And if I'm goin' away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' of you
Don't bury me here it's too cold

Take me back carry me back
Down to gasoline alley where I started from
Take me back, won't cha carry me home down
The gasoline alley where I started from

Take me back carry me back
Down the gasoline alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back down
The gasoline alley where I started from

Take me back carry me back
Down the gasoline alley where I started from

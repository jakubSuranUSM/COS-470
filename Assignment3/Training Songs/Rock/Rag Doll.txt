She walks in the field that's just across the way
And picks all the flowers that brighten up a day.
And the blue velvet cape that she wore around her neck,
And the red in her cheeks gave a Rag Doll effect. 

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad song,
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long.
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me,
And bring back the Rag Doll to me. 

Oh, how I long to have her back here by my side.
The happiness of yesterday, it damn near cost my pride.
There ain't nothin' worse than losin' when you've everything to gain.
I've just got to get that woman back or nothing will be the same. 

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad, sad song,
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long.
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me,
And bring back the Rag Doll to me.
And bring back the Rag Doll to me.

If you've got a picture of your face
Could you leave it on your way out the door
I don't care if it's color or black or white
I just need something to remember you by

Oh, before my life went dim
Oh, before my life went dim
No one told me the trouble I was in
Before my life went dim

I painted half my face green
Don't you know I painted half my face blue
In hopes of showing you
Both sides of me, both sides of me
I guess it came down to
Don't you love me, don't you love me

Oh, before my life went dim
Before my life went dim
No one told me the trouble I was in
Before my life went dim

Can't this car go any faster
Can't this car go any faster
Can't this car go any faster
Faster, faster
Can't this car go cause I can still see where I am

Oh, before my life went dim
Oh, before my life
Before my life went dim
You should have told me
The trouble I was in
Before my life went dim

You don't get your dreamjob
'Cause you're too tall
You miss your wakeup-call
A drunken guy crashed in your car
Can't pay for your drinks at the bar
Your boss said it was nice to work
With you, you think he's just a jerk
The new shoes you bought
Are ruined after a mile

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
What's up buddy
Everthing's so funny
Living in the land, the land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey

And now your girlfriend sold
Your favourite cd
They've towed your car away
While watching girls you fell from a tree
And that was hard
But now the best
You haven't seen one girl undressed
Mummy said they'll take you
Out of college

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
What's up buddy
Everthing's so funny
Living in the land, the land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey, yeah
The land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey, yeah

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
(Living in the land of milk and honey)

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
(Living in the land of milk and honey)

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
(Living in the land of milk and honey)

The sheets are warm
The fridge is filled
In the land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey, yeah
The land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey, yeah

Yeah, hey hey
Yeah, hey hey
The land of milk and honey

You don't get your dream job 'cause you're too tall
You miss your wakeup call
A drunken guy crashed in your car
Can't pay for your drinks at the bar

Your boss said, it was nice to work with you
You think he's just a jerk
The new shoes you bought
Are ruined after a mile

The sheets are warm, the fridge is filled
What's up buddy? Everything so funny
Living in the land, the land of milk and honey
The land of milk and honey

And now, your girlfriend sold your favorite CD
They've towed your car away
While watching girls, you fell from a tree and that was hard
But now the best you haven't seen one girl undressed
Mummy said, they'll take you out of college

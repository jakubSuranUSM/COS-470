You've got a way with words
You've got a way that makes me feel so complicated
Your message meets the floor
The horizon meets your horse and your deliberated
I'm only clearing my throat

Don't you eva wish for just one thing you might never see
Don't you eva wish for just one thing you might never know
You might never know

You've got a way with words
You've got a way that makes me feel so complicated
A wall keeps you from me
You'd raise the door just so you could find the key
The wolves are waiting

Don't you Eva wish for just one thing you might never see
Don't you Eva wish for just one thing you might never know
You might never know

I'm underground
As the words just spin around
and you hunt them down
try to pin them to the ground
there will be no sound
as the words just tumble out
and you won't be found
by the time you hit the ground

You've got a way with words
You've got a way with words
You've got a way with words
(with words, with words, with words)

Don't you eva wish for just one thing you might never see
Don't you eva wish for just one thing you might never know
You might never know
(Dont you eva wish for, don't you eva wish for)
You might never know
(Dont you eva wish for, don't you eva wish for)
Oh you might never know

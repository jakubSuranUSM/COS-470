I gave you my heart
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Now you're tearing it apart

You wrote me a letter
You found someone better
Better than me
This I can't believe

When I come home
Tell me all about it
When I come home
Tell me all about it

I work all day
Earnin' my pay
I work all night
To make you feel all right

When I come home
Tell me all about it
When I come home
Tell me all about it

When I come home
Tell me all about it
When I come home
Tell me all about it

When I come home
Tell me all about it
When I come home
Tell me all about it

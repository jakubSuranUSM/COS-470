Do you remember the festival
We took those drugs I never thought
I'd get into that pumpin' stuff
A thousand eyes won't recognize us

'Cause I know you and you know me
that's all you need and all I think of
I know this ain't nothing very deep but it's good fun
So don't run into the crowd

We got on there way too soon
Cause it takes some time to get the picture
6 to 60 camera zoom oh my god I hate this mixture
of all those crazy crazy tunes
that keep on buzzin' in my head now

I know this ain't nothing very deep but it's good fun
So don't run into the crowd

Pa Pa Pa Pa - Pa Pa Pa Pa
Don't run into the crowd (2 times)

Do you remember the festival
in '94 with 90 fuckups
Don't want to meet all of your friends, the ones you like
the ones you'd lock up

'Cause you're out there in the atmosphere
It makes me sick just to think about it
I know this ain't nothing very deep
But it's good fun so don't run into the crowd!!

Pa Pa Pa Pa - Pa Pa Pa Pa
Don't run into the crowd (4 times)

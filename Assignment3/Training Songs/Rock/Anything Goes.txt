In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

Good authors too
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose, anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today

When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So, though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes, anything goes
Anything goes, anything goes
Anything goes, anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got

From that news you've got
And those pains you've got
If any brains you've got
From those little radios

So, though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose
(When I propose)
Anything goes, anything goes, anything goes

Love is overrated
I'm afraid it's one big joke
Pin your heart on an atom bomb
Watch it blow up in a puff of smoke
You lover her and she loves you
For a little while it's cake
You'll crawl on your belly like a reptile boy
And dig your own sweet grave

Done That, been there
Now I just don't care
No one can touch me 'cause

I'm just a fly on a wall
High, high above it all
I will never fall
I made my great escape
Give my broken heart a break
I'm just a fly on wall

I've been left blind sided

Cut and dried, and tied in knots.
Turned the other cheek, and was good to go
Baby, I just dusted myself right off
She hates her and you hate you
Colour yourself red,
You can't Mister Fix-It being sexual
Cause you're only banging heads

Done That, been there
No I just don't care
No one can touch me cause

I'm just a fly on a wall
High, high above it all
I will never fall
I made my great escape
Give my broken heart a break
I'm just a fly on wall

Well it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready now go cat go.
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes.
You Can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place.
Do anything that you want to do
But uh uh honey lay off of my shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house, you can steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh uh honey lay off of my shoes
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes.
Well you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

Well it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, Now go cat go
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes yeh!
Well blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

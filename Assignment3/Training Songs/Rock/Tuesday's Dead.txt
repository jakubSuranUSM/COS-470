If I make a mark in time, I can't say the mark is mine
I'm only the underline of the word
Yes, I'm like him, just like you, I can't tell you what to do
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard

Whoa, where do you go? 
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead

Oh preacher won't you paint my dream, won't you show me where you've been
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind
'Cause I will learn to understand, if I have a helping hand
I wouldn't make another demand all my life

Whoa, where do you go? 
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead

What's my sex, what's my name, all in all it's all the same
Everybody plays a different game, that is all
The man may live, the man may die, searching for the question why
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall

Whoa, where do you go? 
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead

Now every second on the nose, the humdrum of the city grows
Reaching out beyond the throes of our time
We must try to shake it down
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time
Yeah, we must try to shake it down
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time

Whoa, where do you go? 
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead

Jesus fucking Christ, oh god no!

From the moment that you realize
Most of this Isn't real
To the moment that you decide
Shall we go out tonight
And we'll swim from these island shores
Till there's a fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning

Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favorite island shore
And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifully
(So beautifully)

Ah

And all the money in the world
Won't help you now
The only way is down
And you know from way out here
There is a little fear
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning

Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favorite island shore
And how long has it been
How long has it been

And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifully

Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favorite island shore
And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifully

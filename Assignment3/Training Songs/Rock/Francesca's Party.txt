Two, three

Staring at a shopping list
Of drugs they take
Happiness is all I have
But you can't spend that here
In love with themselves
Francesca's party
In love with themselves
Francesca's party

Luck will have hopes of SOHO
There they hang
And the midnight winks at them
The curtains hang
In love with themselves
Francesca's party
In love with themselves
Francesca's party

They're just perfect
They're just perfect
They're just perfect
They're just perfect

Staring at a shopping list
Of drugs they take
Happiness is all I have
But you can't spend that here
In love with myself
Francesca's party
In love with myself
Francesca's party

No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace
No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace
No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace
No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace
No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace
No matter how hard
You try, you fall from grace

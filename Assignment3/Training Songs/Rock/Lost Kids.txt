How long can we pretend
That we know just who we are
Lost kids with nothing left
Throwing rocks into the dark

Outside, a street of fire
Broken glass and aching hearts
Petrified as we divide
Screaming out a war of words

We're not fighting to be heard
We just wanna watch you burn

Let it all come undone
Cut it down, down tonight

And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway
And I can't find my way
Already buried any, buried anyway

How long can we pretend
That we know just who we are
Lost kids with nothing left
Throwing rocks into the dark

Something here has gotta give,
But we'll never understand
The reason why we cannot hide
Is trembling in our hands

We're not not fighting to be heard
We just wanna watch you burn

Let it all come undone
Cut it down, down tonight

And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway
And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway

And we're tied up so tight
Another city in the night
And I can't find my way
Already buried any, buried anyway

And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway
And I can't find my way
Already buried anyway

And we're tied up so tight
Another city in the night
And I can't find my way
Already buried any, buried anyway

Kiss my lips, hold my hand
Tell me you love me, I'm your loverman
I'm in love, in love with a wonderful girl

My heart is in pain
All my love is in all in vain
I'm in love, in love with a wonderful girl
Oh yes, wonderful girl

So baby, those feeling, yes, those feelings
They run up and down my spine
So, baby, they say, yes, they say
They make me lose my heart

You're my love, you're my love
Believe me, I'll swear it by the stars above
'Cause I'm in love, in love with a wonderful girl
Oh yes, wonderful girl

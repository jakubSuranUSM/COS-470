Daylight again, memories fall like rain
Remind you to take it slow
One step at a time, baby
'Til you find your way
Back to the big show
Places you been
Things that you done
Somehow you're still on the run

Just another rider
On that train to nowhere
Just another fool
Too far from home
Just another stranger
Tryin' to get somewhere
Somewhere, but you're still all alone

Watching the world passin' you by
'Cause you tell everybody that you must be cursed
Tell them all how you try, try, try
But your luck keeps gettin' worse
Seems like such a long long time
Since you've had, a little piece of mind

Just another rider
On that train to nowhere
Just another fool too far from home
Just another stranger
Tryin' to get somewhere
Somewhere but you're still all alone

Punch your ticket, drop your load
Time for you, time for you to get on board
I know you love it
You know it too
What in the world has become of you
Do you remember, blue skies were shinin'
Money flowed, flowed like wine
You had a real good woman
Yes, she was sure, she was sure enough fine
Storm clouds risin' in from the sea
Winds are blowin' cold reality

Just another rider
On that train to nowhere
Just another fool, too far from home
Just another stranger
Tryin' to get somewhere
Somewhere but you're still all alone

Just another rider
On that train to nowhere
Just another fool, too far from home
Just another stranger
Tryin' to get somewhere
Somewhere but you're still all alone

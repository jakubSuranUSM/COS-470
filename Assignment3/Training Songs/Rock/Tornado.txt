Sit down by the window and watch the tornado
Wait for the sheriff to bring some dirty water by
Help yourself out to some of my disaster
Its movin' faster

Than the last time I was on speed
Don't you know what I mean
Cause it's ways and means and your ways are mean
By definition
I could fill this page up with this boys ambition
But I don't audition
Oh yes that's true
I could never act for you

Heard you saw some friends of mine last winter
Then again, I heard you disappeared into ether
I don't laugh and you smile because I'm tired
I'm feelin wired oh so weary
And oh so old
Am I being too bold
Bold enough to ask you if you really love me

In my shadows and in my dreams
And just one last thing
Please let me say
And that is please,
Oh please, please stay away, from me

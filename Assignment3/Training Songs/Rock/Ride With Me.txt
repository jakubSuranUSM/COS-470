How ya gonna make it baby?
That's the question to be asked
Life goes on around you
In so many different ways
I know my share of histry
How hard it is to be free
From wearing masks that turn to skin
Hiding what could have been

And I, I, I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose?
Ride with me baby 'til the end of the day

Mama's home philosophy
Make's everyone a freak but me
Though I'm starvin' in the streets
And can't predict the future
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sanest of us all? 
Is he with me or one of them?
How does he dress, who are his friends?

And I, I, I'm so confused
Which way, which way to choose?
Ride with me baby 'til the end of the day

Mama's home philosophy
Makes everyone a freak but me
Though I'm starvin' in the streets
And can't predict the future
Can I have my vision back?
I'll live outside your city walls
You don't have to be afraid
Until I come together

Ride with me Baby
'Til the end of the day

Inspiration, move me brightly
light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
statements just seem vain at last

Some rise
some fall
some climb
to get to terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
all are dim but one is bright
The spiral light of Venus
rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner 
of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing
a rare and different tune
Terrapin station

In the shadow of the moon, terrapin station
And I know we'll be there soon, terrapin 
I can't figure out, terrapin
if it's the end or beginning, terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, terrapin

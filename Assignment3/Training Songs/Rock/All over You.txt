Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone
For me all day
Our love is like water/angels
Pinned down and abused
All over you  all over me
The sun  the fields  the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun  the fields  the tide
Pay me now  lay me down

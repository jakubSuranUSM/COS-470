I was much too far out all my life and not waving but drowning

First there is an ocean then there is no ocean then there is
And then we have a mountain range and then a plain and a range again
Last there is a desert then a fertile plain then dry again
Once there was a people then there were none then some more did live

Then there was a city then a pile of rocks and a town again
Then they made a weapon that destroyed the lot in a cloud of rain
Then they raised a temple to a god who died and failed them
Then they left and traveled far and then they flew back home again

In the gardens of the dead when the disembodied entity said
Let there be body let there be mind let there be man unkind
She gave the reasoning to me and now the guilt is all on me

I entered in & my seed spread generations spawned from the visions in my head
We raised it up and we pulled it down we advertised and marketed up town
She gave the reasoning to me and now the guilt is all on me

I can tell the world the ravages of time will seek you out
I can tell the world the savageness of mind will find you out

I was destroyed and I lived again my unborn children strengthening the strain
Countless lives marching throughout time marking out the details of my crime
She gave the reasoning to me and now the guilt is all on me

I can tell the world the ravages of time will seek you out
I can tell the world the savageness of mind will find you out

And the knowledge that I have gained has been lost again and again and again
But it's really all the same all that has changed is the name
She gave the reasoning to me and now the guilt is all on me

I can tell the world the ravages of time will seek you out
I can tell the world the savageness of mind will find you out

I can tell the world the ravages of time will seek you out
I can tell the world the savageness of mind will find you out

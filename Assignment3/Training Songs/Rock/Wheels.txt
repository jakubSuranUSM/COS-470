When I first started travelling
When I left on my own
When I first started travelling
When I left on my own
You're never quit are you?
Ever gonna slow down

I left old Bristol city
Got my star in Bristol city
You're never quit are you?
Ever gonna slow down

Wheels turn beneath my feet
Wheels turn beneath my feet
Wheels turn

You're never gonna quite are you?
Ever gonna slow down
Mmh

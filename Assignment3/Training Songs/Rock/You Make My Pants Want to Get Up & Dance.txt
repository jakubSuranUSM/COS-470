You make my pants wanna get up and dance
You make my face wanna grin
You make my knees wanna kneel down say please
Honey, won't you kiss me again

You make my pants wanna get up and dance
You make my face wanna grin
You make my knees wanna kneel down say please
Honey, won't you kiss me again

I was a lost and lonely man
Now I get through life the best I can
'Til the day I laid my eye on you
That day I decided what I had to do

You make my pants wanna get up and dance
You make my face wanna grin
You make my knees wanna kneel down say please
Honey, won't you kiss me again

Start the music strike up the band
I never done the boogie but I believe I can
Never met a girl half as sweet as you
Nobody's ever moved half the moves you do

You make my pants wanna get up and dance
You make my face wanna grin
You make my knees wanna kneel down say please
Honey, won't you kiss me again

You make my pants wanna get up and dance
You make my face wanna grin
You make my knees wanna kneel down say please
Honey, won't you kiss me again

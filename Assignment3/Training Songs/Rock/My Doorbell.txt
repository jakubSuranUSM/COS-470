Oh, well

Well with me and chipinÂ´ me and kisses?
Not the man in my life I know
And I been going to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back when you said little girl
And while youÂ´re at it take yourself back too
Woman whatcha gonna do now, whatcha gonna do about it

IÂ´m thinkinÂ´ about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when ya gonna ring it

Oh, yeah

You donÂ´t seem to come around
Point your finger and make a sound
You donÂ´t seem to come around
Not since I said you knocked it down?

Oh, well

Make a sound and IÂ´ll make you feel right
Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody got...?
But how come itÂ´s so easy to you
You know itÂ´s like me at times I can be careless
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I donÂ´t need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends
TheyÂ´re all above me

And I've been thinkinÂ´ about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it
Yeah, I've been thinkinÂ´ about the doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they gonna ring it oh

Push the finger and make a sound

Maybe they theyÂ´ll knock Â´em down

Oh, well

Make a sound and IÂ´ll make you feel right
Right at home

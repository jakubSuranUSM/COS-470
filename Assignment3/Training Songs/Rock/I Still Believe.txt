I been in a cave for forty days
Only a spark to light my way
I wanna give out, I wanna give in
This is our crime, this is our sin

But I still believe, I still believe
Through the pain and through the grief
Through the lives, through the storms
Through the cries and through the wars

Oh, I still believe

And flat on my back out at sea
Hopin' these waves, don't cover me
I'm turned and tossed upon the waves
When the darkness comes, I feel the grave

But I still believe, I still believe
Through the cold and through the heat
Through the rain and through the tears
Through the crowds and through the cheers

Oh, I still believe

I'll march this road, I'll climb this hill
Upon on my knees if I have to
I'll take my place up on this stage
I'll wait 'til the end of time for you like everybody else

I'm out on my own, walkin' the streets
Look at the faces that I meet
I feel like I, like I want to go home
What do I feel? What do I know?

But I still believe, I still believe
Through the shame and through the grief
Through the heartache, through the tears
Through the waiting, through the years

For people like us in places like this
We need all the hope that we can get

Oh, I still believe

I've got a 1980 Volvo
I get in start it up and I go
It ain't a vintage Cadillac
But it always gets me there and back
And it'll always be good to me
Always be good to me
Always be good to me
I got a beat up Supro amp
I plug in and it sound like a champ
Not a fender tweek deluxe
It cost me 150 bucks
And it'll always sound good to me
And these things are all I need

All these things are good to me
I got a girlfriend and she's so true
And no other kinda girl will do
Cause I've known some girls in the past
The kinda love they got don't last
And she'll always be true to me

Beautiful girl lovely dress
High school smiles oh yes
Beautiful girl lovely dress
Where she is now I can only guess

'Cause it's gone daddy gone 
The love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone away
'Cause it's gone daddy gone 
Your love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone away

When I see you 
Eyes will turn blue
When I see you 
Thousand eyes turnin' blue

'Cause it's gone daddy gone 
The love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone away
Yeah it's gone daddy gone 
Your love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone away

Tell by the way you that you switch and walk
I can see by the way that you baby talk
I can know by the way you treat your man
I can love you baby til it's a cryin'

'Cause it's gone daddy gone 
Your love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone 
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone 
The love is gone

Beautiful girl lovely dress
Fifteen smiles oh yes
Beautiful girl lovely dress
Where she is now I can only guess

'Cause it's gone daddy gone 
Your love is gone
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone 
Gone daddy gone 
The love is gone
Yeah it's gone daddy gone 
The love is gone away

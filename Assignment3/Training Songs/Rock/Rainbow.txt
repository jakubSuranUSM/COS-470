I don't know where I go wrong -
Everything I do just takes so long.
I don't know what's up with me
I'm swinging from a branch of my family tree...
So give me some of yours then, if you think it might get better
If you're sure you've got the answer, you know I'm going to let you...

Oh, you know it, you're shining like the rainbow
And the birds and bees all know your name
I could be black, I could be blue, I could be anything for you
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow.

I don't want your sympathy -
Just for you to worship me.
I just want to be adored, every day of every year.
So this is good, and this is bad, and I'm the only God you'll have...
Oh, do you dare to disagree?
So give me some of yours then, if you don't I'm gonna thieve it.
If you thought I was a good girl, you'd better not believe it.

Oh, you know it, you're shining like the rainbow
And the birds and bees all know your name
I could be black, I could be blue, I could be anything for you
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow.
I will be pink, I will be blue, I will be everything for you
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow...

Oh..you'd make me burn for you boy, why should I burn?
Why should I burn for you boy, why should I burn?
I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl...
I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl!

Oh, you know it, you're shining like the rainbow
And the birds and bees all know your name
I could be black, I could be blue, I could be anything for you
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow.
I will be pink, I will be blue, I will be everything for you
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow...
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow...
If you'd just shine your colour like the rainbow...

If you would have stayed
Then I would write this song for you
But as it is I am sad and blue
Because you've gone away
There's not much left to say
'Cause there's nothing left for you to do
There's nothing left for me to prove
Because you've gone away

And if I close my eyes
I always get to see your smile
The kind of smile that drives me wild
It never goes away

I have no home

I've got no home

In this world
In this world, yeah

Slowly, I look around
At every sight, for every sound
We stood with troubles deep
She is trampled on the ground

Feel the sadness inside
I'm scarlet inside

Realize far too late
As her life dissipates
No truth, no reason why
Just the fear and the hatred

Feel the sadness inside
I'm scarlet inside

I'm scarlet inside

This life is such a lie
Now I don't even try
Never (a good thing done)
I never saw eye to eye

Feel the sadness inside
I'm scarlet inside

I'm scarlet inside

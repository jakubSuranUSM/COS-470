[Chorus: ]
Set me free, why don't ya babe
Get out of my life, why don't ya babe
You really don't want me, you just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me, but ya keep me hangin' on

Why do ya keep a'comin' around playin' with my heart
Why don't cha get out of my life and let me make a new start
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
There ain't nothing I can do about it

[Chorus: ]

[Repeat: 2x]
Get out of my life, why don't ya babe

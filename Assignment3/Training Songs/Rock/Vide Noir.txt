Many nights have I heard her voice
Whisper my name without making a noise
Calling out from a pure, black void

Tears of sorrow or tears of joy
Drops in my cup as my mind is destroyed
Staring into a pure, black void

So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?

Many evils have I enjoyed
Prowling the night raising hell with the boys
Getting high on a pure, black void

I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void

So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?

Where can you go when it’s all in your head?
These are the last words that I ever said
Where can you go when it’s all in your head?

I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void
I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void

You found out you went wrong
So I tried to keep you from pain
But you feared my love would never remain
Then my heart cried for you

I could stand all our trouble
By only seeing the fun
Nothing worse than seeing myself with a gun

Still my heart cries for you
Still my heart cries for you

Watching a house burning down
Watching a smile turn to frown
But the images fade

We have been living in sin
Waiting for pain to begin
But the images fade

The images of you will always stay with me
As it is
We blew it somehow
But the images of you will always stay with me

Gone the years, now the past
Whatever you do
Still my heart cries for you

I thought you were so innocent
Until I got my fingers burnt
You think me strange and quite peculiar
Let the first appearance fool ya

Even though you're not my mum
I've got to get my washing done
Who calls the tune must pay the piper
Fix the plug and catch the spider

Something hesitated in the sky
When I found you
Something emanated from your eyes
My dream came true

I love someone who looks like you
The way you do but isn't you
It's still the same sad sordid story
Suffering sinner slave to glory

Now you say you want someone new
I knew you do you left a clue
The vows of love that you've recanted
Say you're taking me for granted

Something hesitated in the sky
When I found you
Something emanated from your eyes
My dream came true

Innocent, innocent

Something hesitated in the sky
When I found you
Something emanated from your eyes
My dream came true

Innocent, innocent

Something hesitated in the sky
When I found you
Something emanated from your eyes
My dream came true

Something hesitated in your eyes
When I found you
Something emanated from the sky
My dream came true

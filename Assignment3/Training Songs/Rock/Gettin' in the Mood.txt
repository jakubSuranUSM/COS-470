We're gonna party
I know how
To get it started
In the mood
I'm good to boogie
Blow that jivin' music now

And When the party's over
I just know where to go
Where after hours people
Boogie you know
I want to hang a while
Where the lights are real low
Whisper to my baby
And be takin' it slow
And baby if you're ready
Then I'm ready to blow
Baby,now I'm really getting
In the mood

I'm in the mood
The joint is jumpin'
In the groove
We're onto somethin'
In the mood
The band is pumpin'
Swingin' and a swayin'
And a rock and rollin'
Come on now
We're gonna party
I know how
To get it started
In the mood
I'm good to boogie
Blow that jivin' music now

I got on my best threads 
And my favorite shoes
Now it's my time to play got 
No love for the blues 
Understand what I'm sayin 
Or you better get back
Got no time to waste cause I'm 
One hip cat and when I start it 
Werkin I cruise like ?? flows 
And when I'm in the mood I spread it 
All around I might the be man want his 
Party on the run and when you see me comin call me big king fun...HAH

When the party's over
I just know where to go
Where the after hours people
Boogie you know
I want to hang a while
Where the lights are low
And whisper to my baby
And be takin' it slow
Baby if your ready
Then I'm ready to blow

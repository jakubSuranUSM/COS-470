Pretty little angel eyes,
Pretty little angel eyes,
Pretty little angel,
Pretty little angel,

Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little angel.
Pretty little little little angel eyes.
Angel eyes, I really love you so,
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go,

Because I love you, my darling angel eyes.
Pretty little little little angel eyes.
Angel eyes, you are so good to me,
And when I'm in your arms, it feels so heavenly,

You know I love you, my darling angel eyes.
I know you were sent from, heaven above,
To fill my life with your wonderful love,
I know we will be happy for eternity,

Cause I know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow that our life is real.
Angel eyes, I really love you so,
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, my darling angel eyes.

Pretty little angel eyes,
Pretty little angel eyes,
Pretty little angel,
Pretty little angel

Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little angel.
Angel eyes, I really love you so,
Angel eyes, I'll never let you go,
Because I love you, my darling angel eyes.
Pretty little little little angel eyes.

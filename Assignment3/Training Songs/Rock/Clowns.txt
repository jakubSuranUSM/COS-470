Only clowns would play with those balloons
What d'ya wanna look like Barbie for
Dear oh Lord, it's easy

Roasting, roasting, roasting deed
Mahogany
Titties that live on and on and on and on

Only clowns would play with those balloons
What d'ya wanna look like Barbie for
Dear oh Lord, it's easy

Only clowns would play with those balloons
Passive when I'm in record
Day and night I'm watching you

Roasting, roasting, roasting deed
Mahogany
Titties that live on and on and on and on

Only clowns would play with those balloons
What d'ya wanna look like Barbie for
Dear oh Lord, it's easy

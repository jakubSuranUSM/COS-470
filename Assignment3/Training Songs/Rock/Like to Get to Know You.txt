Yes, I would like to get to know you, if I could
Like to get to know you
Finally I found, searching all around
Just was not the answer
One I thought was true 
Looked a bit like you
Figured I might chance her
Hardly need to say 
She went on her way 
Said it was all over
Well it's been some time
And I guess that I'm just meant to be a rover

Now I can't promise that I'll spend a day with you
Can't promise that I'll find a way with you
Can't promise no
I can't promise that I'll love you 
But I'd like to get to know you
Yes I would if I could

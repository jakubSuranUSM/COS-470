I haven’t got a pick up truck
To take me into town
I don’t have the ways and means
To lay my money down
Lay it down
But I got gold, underneath the ground

Rise me up before the sun lays the bad boys down
I’ll go out into the yard, and kick my feet around
I’ll kick 'em around
'Cause I got gold, underneath the ground

Bill collectors ring my phone
Keep me on the run
But they don’t know the ways I’ve got
The ways of having fun
I have fun,
I got gold, underneath the ground

Do a Jigg above a twig, spin yourself around.
Dig down low below the soil that's, where I'll be found, 
I'll be found. 
Digging gold, underneath the ground
Spending gold, underneath the ground
I got gold, underneath the ground.

Take me, and you won’t be sorry
No I don’t wanna run, I brake for authority
Firebrand my breath, ember it to end [?]
For my dark part of my body

And know what is it like to feel the endless open
In slow motion I tasted it, the sound of hunger
In my heart, sparking the flame in me
You stung my ocean
Damned devotion

Dream it, and you won’t be sorry
Just tell me how, do it now, how I ache for authority
Mmm, simmer down, but how can I deny
What I believe is a thief cold heart [?]

And know what is it like to feel the endless open
In slow motion I tasted it, the sound of hunger
In my heart, sparking the flame in me
You stung my ocean
Damned devotion

I wanna see you more
I wanna know you more
I wanna touch you more
So we

Oh, what is it like to feel the endless open
In slow motion I tasted it, the pound of thunder
In my heart, sparking the flame in me
You stung my ocean
Damned devotion
Devotion

One rode into the east
Another to the west
In a fit of desperation
In to die, got sovereign trails

As the crowds began to gather 
Oh, I wailed like a new-born babe
New-born babe
And opened the book
Of bad decisions I have made
I have made

I walked into the station
Covered in blood
The watchman came out
“You can’t be here, son”

So I threw down my suitcase
Oh, I wailed like a new-born babe
New-born babe
And wrote another chapter
Of bad decisions I have made
I have made

I saw my belle
Looking lonesome in her time
I picked up a receiver
And dropped a dime
When I heard you answer
Oh, I wailed like a new-born babe
New-born babe
And read a dedication
From the book of bad decisions I have made
I have made

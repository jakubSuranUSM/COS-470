No I don't think it's a good thing,

Without a second thought you put your hand on my shoulder,
Without a second look you took me miles away,
What happened after that, I couldn't see and I lost you?
And I stumbled around until I found you again,

Cos' you are my only hideaway, you make the world seem bigger,
You are my only hideaway, you do,

Without a second thought you found the words to explain me,
Without a second look you tried to open my mind,
Well I know that you are waiting and your patience is failing,
But I know that I'll get there in a matter of time,

Cos' you are my only hideaway, you make the world seem bigger,
Oh you are my only hideaway, you do,

And so tonight we'll set the motion right,
And so tonight, we've time to make it alright,

Feel me
Sneaking around again
Am I hanging around again
Can't you see
That my heart lies
My heart lies to you
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That My heart lies to you
Never have me true
(I lie I lie)
Please don't
Please don't make ammends
See me 
See me slip again
Break my heart
Carve the fate
Seal the deal
My heart lies

My heart lies to you
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That my heart lies to you
You'll never have me true
I followed the waves to you
I've got to see it through
That my heart lies to you
I'll never stay with you
Between my fire sighs 
And my burning eyes
My heart burns wildly in his eyes
He's just a drunken gambling man
Dealing with the hands of desires span
I'm gonna shuffle his deck clean
I'm gonna shuffle his deck clean

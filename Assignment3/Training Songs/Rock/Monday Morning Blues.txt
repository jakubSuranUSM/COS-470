God knows I work, so many hours
I need a change of scene
I know some day I will fight the power
To be a man of means

Be a part of that game
Where your money's talking
Ride that train to where your fortune's smiling
Leave behind a poor man's life
His days are bitches
I have dreams of trading rags for riches

Monday morning blues
You know a prayer will see me through
Monday morning blues
You know I'll make my dreams come true.

It's so routine, this life I'm leading
I've got to break away
I must to be mad, it's soul destroying
No man should live this way.

Should I reach for the sky
Or just wait for mercy
Don't ask why then leave the answer to history
If a man should know his place
Some men live in sorrow
With or without grace I'll fight for tomorrow

Monday morning blues
You know a prayer will see me through
Monday morning blues
You know I'll make my dreams come true.

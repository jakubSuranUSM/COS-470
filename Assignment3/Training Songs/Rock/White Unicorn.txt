Have you been to the carnival
I would like to see you
There's a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you
With the white unicorn, across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might of been
Someone who's older, ahh yeah

Oh, its on your eyes,
With a drink from her wine.
But we drank for the seventh time, 
Now we live in another time
We could live together

She lives on the borderline, that they call hazel
And the tent that she lives in,has the name of her lover,
As she lays down to rest, she dreamt of another
Of a time when she once had

Oh, oh, its on your eyes, 
With a drink from her wine.
But we drank for the seventh time, 
Now we live in another time
We could live together

Oh, oh, its on your eyes, 
With a drink from her wine.
But we drank for the seventh time, 
Now we live in another time
We could live together
We could live together

There is a love
There is a life that we share
Hand in glove
They won't separate us

Climb once again
Cast off your sorrows
The long night will end
Dance on the morning dew

Casting a line to you
Safe from a slinging arrow
Think of the love we knew
How it goes on

Five days of love
There is a scent in the air
Above & beyond
The one who named us

Climb once again
Cast off your sorrows
The long night will end
Won't get the best of you

Casting a line to you
Love is a winning arrow
Fire it straight and true to wherever you are

Casting a line to you
Love is a winning arrow

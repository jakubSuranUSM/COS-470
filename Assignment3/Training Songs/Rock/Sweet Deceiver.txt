I`ve been up all night with a kind of light 
Burning in my brain 
The flames is cold .... freezing, 
But it takes away my pain 
I don`t feel any pain 
No, I don`t feel any pain 
Just sit here listening to the rain tonight 

No no no you sweet deceiver, you 
Though it`s cold the pain is bright 
Clearer vision through the night 
If helps me see that it`s alright with me

You sweet deceiver you 
You sweet deceiver you 
Oh no no no oh, no no you sweet deceiver you

Though it`s cold it`s pain is bright 
Clearer vision through the night 
And it helps me see then it`s alright with me 
I`ve been up all night with a kind of light
Burning in my brain 
I don`t feel any pain 
No, I don`t feel any pain 
I know it`s coming back again tonight

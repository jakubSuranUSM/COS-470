You said you was going away, I said I didn't mind
And I'm sitting in here today with all the things you left behind
Now I'm sitting on the front step where the flowers seem to cry
And if you don't come back today I'm sure that they will die

I know that I would die

So won't you come on back, baby please come back
Baby come on home, I'm all alone
I want to sing to you, make love to you - come on!

Everything reminds me of you, yes everywhere I turn
I looked on the table, I saw a long cigarette burn
I'm listenin' to that song, the song you used to sing
There's a hole in the wall where your picture used to hang

Yes where your picture used to hang

So won't you come on back, baby please come back
Baby come on home, I'm all alone
I want to sing to you, make love to you - come on!

You told me that you love me, you know lying doesn't pay
You said you'll be with me until Judgment Day
Until Judgment Day

So won't you come on back, baby please come back
Baby come on home, I'm all alone

I'm all alone
I'm all alone
Oh won't you come on back
Oh won't you come on back
Baby please come back
Baby come on home
I'm all alone
I'm all alone

before I met you baby
the little things in life just passed me by
the sound of children's laughter
the tune to some forgotten lullaby
i was out of town on business
back when i had no place to call my home
i was arrrested by your beauty
we locked into a cell of all our own

chorus:
you know i love you baby
ah honey what else could i do?
so let me know if there's anything
just anything i can do for you

when i was just a youngster
i collected crazy songs in my head
yeah the scene from 'the night porter'
a broken jelly jar crushed by the bed
yes at times our love was fragile
like a hand me down watch that slows down when its old
but our love could last forever
like a sacred ring of precious stones and gold

chorus

before I met you baby
the little things in life just passed me by
the color of the twilight
the reflection of my smile in your eyes

chorus

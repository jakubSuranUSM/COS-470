Got stones in my passway,
And my road seems dark at night,
I got stones in my passway,
And my road seems dark at night,
I got pains in my heart,
They done taken my appetite.

Now when I first saw you, I heard the angels sing,
I thought of Adam and Eve and that love thing,
Oh I was blinded by the light and I just couldn't see,
Papa hiding up in your apple tree.

I really hope you're satisfied,
I just came back to say goodbye

Girl I found your little black book
I opened it up to get a second look
I saw my best friends' name upon the page
Five gold stars beside his name.

I really hope you're satisfied,
I just came back to say goodbye

I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back)
Goodbye baby
I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back)
Goodbye baby

I felt real bad, thought I'd give you a call,
I didn't look up the number, I just looked on the wall.
You know your best friend said you'd gone for the night
Going downtown with your jeans on tight.

I really hope you're satisfied,
I just came back to say goodbye

I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back)
Goodbye baby
I just came back to say goodbye
(I just came back)
Goodbye baby

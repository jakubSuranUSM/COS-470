Broke my heart
We're apart
Thinks she's smart

I met a girl a month ago
I thought that she would love me so
But in time I realized
She had a pair of roving eyes

I remember the nights we dated
Always acting sophisticated
Talking 'bout high society
Oh, then she tried to make a fool out of me

They call her, whoa (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Broke my heart now (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Thinks she's smart now (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
We're apart now, whoa-oh-whoa (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)

Pretty little girl, you're just having fun
You're running all around and breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the five and ten cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's the girl next door

They call her (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Broke my heart now (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Thinks she's smart now (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
We're apart, whoa-oh(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)

Pretty little girl, you're just having fun
You're running all around, you're breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the five and ten cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's Donna next door

Whoa-oh (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Whoa-oh (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Whoa-oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna) whoa, now tell me
Whoa-oh-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (Donna, Donna the Prima Donna) 
(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna) whoa-whoa

No I'm not ready for big bad step in the direction
No I'm not ready for downtown trash before collection
For blocks run and hide
Don't walk around at night
City scape city change before they die
For blocks such a mention in a song
If I want to get along to change who doesn't want to change this
I know you feel it too
These words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too
It all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
No we're not ready for fair distribution
Just determine the solution for
No we're not ready for hell hell no for hell hell no
For days wide awake wide slide along and say
Goes afraid go to change just move away
For days that I mention in a song move along
Get ahead get a hand to bring home with you
I know you feel it too
These words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too
It all seems so untrue
When you get up and over it and over them
For ways to remove all the bad that we do
From the heart and the soul of the city side and cold
For ways to collect what we say and what we save
To discard and discover a brand new way
I know you feel it too
These words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too
It all seems so untrue
And you get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too
These words get overused
When we get up and over it and over them
Up and over it and over them
I know you feel it too
It all seems so untrue
And you get up and over it and over them

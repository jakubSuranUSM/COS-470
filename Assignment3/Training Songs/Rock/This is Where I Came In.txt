I've seen the story
I've read it over once or twice
I said that you say
A little bit of bad advice
I've been in trouble
Happened to me all of my life
I've lied and you lie
And who would get the sharpest knife

You know I couldn't be somebody like that
I'm not the kind of man to throw his hat
Into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down following through
The day turns into night

Oh, oh, oh,
This is just where I came in

Hope rides on
But I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them all their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me

Oh, oh, oh,
This is just where I came in

Fade into color
Color into black and white
Under the bedclothes
Everything will be alright
I know that you know
Nothing ever stays the same
Said so, I said so
The love will never speak its name

Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run

Hope rides on
But I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

I always told myself
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside

Oh, oh, oh,
This is just where I came in

I can't fly
But I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me

Oh, oh, oh,
This is just where I came in
Oh, oh, oh

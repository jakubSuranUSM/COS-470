(So long, I've waited so long,
So long, I've waited so long)

I've waited so long, a lifetime it seems
For someone to step right out of my dreams
All that an angel could be
And meant for only me.

Play me a tune, haunting and blue
Tell me of dreams that never come true
Sing me a lonely song
Till she comes along

It will be so wonderful
When love comes my way
No more lonely hours
They'll just fade away

Some day we'll meet, somewhere I know
We'll kiss and say "I love you so"
Darling, surely I can't be so wrong
For I've waited, yes I've waited
So very lo-o-ong

So long, my darling
So long, my darling, darling

Sick of politicians
Harassment and laws
All we do is get screwed up
By other people's flaws

World turned upside down now
Nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles
House block seven view

And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
I'm tellin' you that it ain't no joke

Think you know the answers
We don't tell no lies
We can take you anyway
Seven different highs

World turned upside down now
Nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles
House block seven view

And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
And I'm tellin' you that it ain't no joke

Sick of politicians
Harassment and laws
All we do is get screwed up
By other people's flaws

World turned upside down now
Nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles
House block seven view

And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You could disappear in smoke
And I'm tellin' you that it ain't no joke

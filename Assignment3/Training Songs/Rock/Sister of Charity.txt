A new day for a mission
Another sunrise in your heart

Gimme tears of the wrong
The hate of convicts
The glamous of the damned
Rule of Benedict

I've never seen the dawn like this before
Tears on the night turn to diamonds on your eyes
In the face of the world's ugliness
Sister of charity
Remains a mystery

Love shines over aggression
Another wound heals in your heart

Gimme fears of the strong
The warfare politics
The decay of the west
Rule of Benedict

I've never seen the dawn like this before
Tears on the night turn to diamonds on your eyes
In the face of the world's ugliness
Sister of charity
Remains a mystery

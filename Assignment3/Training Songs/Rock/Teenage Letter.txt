Teenage letter, rock 'n' roll state
'Scuse me, baby, I've a-got to wait
'Cause I love you
Oh Lord, I love you, Oh yeah!
And I'm gonna love you baby
I've gotta prove it in my own way
Oh Yeah!

One and one is two, two and two makes four
Squeeze me baby, love me just just a little bit more
'Cause I love you
Oh, I love you
And I'm gonna love you baby
I'm gonna prove it in my own way
Oh yeah! Go now!

Four and four make eight, five and five makes ten

Squeeze me baby, love me one more again
'Cause I need it,
Oh, I need it, need it, need it
I gotta have it
Oh! I'm gonna love you baby
And I'm gonna prove it in my own way

Oh Yeah! Let's go now! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Come on baby!
Oh yeah!
I'm gonna love you baby
I'm gotta love you baby
I've gotta prove it in my own way
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Oh yeah! Come on baby!

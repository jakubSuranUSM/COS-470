And what she gets she doesn't want
And what she gets she doesn't want

We swam across the bay
A single plane flew across the sky
Then we lay on our backs and made pictures with the clouds
I tasted the ocean when I kissed her fingers

And what she gets she doesn't want
And what she gets she doesn't want

A warm breeze carried her scent to me
She said: I know I've hurt you
She took my hand and sighed
But in the middle of the night you will think of me

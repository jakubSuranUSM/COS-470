Hey listen up I've got something to say
I lost my head when the poor wind blew
So will you make it right, think I'll lose the fight
And it's gonna happen soon

Said I give it up for you
You can't lie 'cause it isn't true
Someone is waiting to call out
You're all new

[Chorus]
Tonight you're mine, we're to fall from number one
We will be gone in a minute
Why don't we waste our time
Tonight you're mine, we're to fall from number one
We will be gone in a minute
Why don't we waste our time

Watch it now, I have to close the scene
When I tell you were I stand
There's no other way but myself to blame
Than a helping hand

Now that we've come this far
Or should I say that we've gone too far
Tomorrow's waiting to decide
What we are

[Chorus: x4]

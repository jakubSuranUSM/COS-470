Standing on a building
Waiting for her to fall
Thousand people watches
As he clenches against the wall
He’s so big and tall
Man he sees it all
He’s so big and tall
He stands above them all
King Kong

King Kong
King Kong

Almost at the top
He’s looking oh so mean
Thousand people watching
Thinking this must be a dream
Come to the skies
To see the airplanes
Here come fight the fighter
His kingdom for the freedom
King Kong

King Kong 
King Kong

Is it duty of the beast
Who really takes the blame
Million people watching
Who all shout his name
King Kong

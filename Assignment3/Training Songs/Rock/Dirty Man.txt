[Chorus]
Dirty man thinks he can get away with it
Not too bright where's the light
The occupant of his mind

Clean man, dirty thoughts should know better
After time he will find
That things don't work out his way

And if he were to be the public enemy
If he were to be the public enemy
And made a part of his hey
Made a part of his hey
Made a part of history

Like I was born on Saturday
Got buried on Sunday
Thought I'd never get caught
Feel like I just got married
And divorced in the one day
And it's not my fault
And it's not my fault
Now I've thrown it all away
And I have nowhere to go

Blind man, can't you see what you've become
All you made didn't pay
Now you're outside to dry

On the run, thought you could get away with it
Not too bright where's the light
The occupant of his mind

[Chorus]

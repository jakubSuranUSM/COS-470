So you're winnin' more than anyone should
And you're feelin' a feelin' you never felt
Sit yourself down, boy
Come on and think about it all
Can't you see you're headed for a fall?

Once before, you thought you were
You played the winner
But this old and lonely life that
Now only sucked you
But now you've been through that
And you're happy up again
Be careful now, you're headed for a fall
Headed for a fall

You're headed for a fall
Headed for a fall
Headed for a fall
Headed for a fall

Hearts on a string 
Like an older fashioned phone can 
Bang bringy bring and you think you're gonna get some 
Thing you can bring to a party at your wake not 
Thinking of the thing that you pay back when you take it 
Take it, like rats in a cage 
Pushed the button got the shock trick 
Stickers in your bag 
Had your number but I lost it 
Bets are all off, you're a little lilly giver 
Indie in the hidden cost, you're a sucker and you win it 

Doesn't matter if you want it back, 
You've given it away, you've given it away 
It doesn't matter if you want it back, 
You've given it away away away away away away 

He's already on the outskirts 
I'm still pulling at his sweatshit 
He says "Fate is not a factor" 
I'm in love with every actor. 

So, once when you're gone and I wanna do it backwards 
Just like the song, we're addicted to the L word 
Up past your head, down your back, around your ankles 
Ready for attack, you're obsessioned and then strangled 
Cringe like you're cursed 
With your wreckingbally necklace 
I saw it first and I crushed it with my hamfist 
High for the contest, who's the better nazi 
Eye to eye to eye, now I'm blind and you can catch me 
Catch me if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can. 

It doesn't matter if you want it back 
You've given it away, you've given it away 
It doesn't matter if you want it back 
You've given it away, you've given it away 
It doesn't matter if you want it back 
You've given it away, you've given it away 
It doesn't matter if you want it back 
You've given it away, away, away, away, away 

He's already on the outskirts, 
I'm still pulling at his sweatshirt 
He says "Fate is not a factor" 
I'm in love with every actor. 

He's already on the outskirts, 
I'm still pulling at his sweatshirt 
He says "Fate is not a factor" 
I will let you go if you would let some 
I will let you go if you would let somebody 
I will let you go if you would let somebody love you 
I will let you go if you would let somebody love you like 
I will let you go if you would let somebody love you like I do. 
Like I do, like I do.

Here we are on a summer night, staring at the sea 
Tell me is there something wrong? 
You know you can talk to me 
I can hear it in your voice, I can see it in your eyes 
There's a stillness in the air that makes me want to cry 

Strange weather, dark clouds in the sky 
Strange weather for you and I 
We've been through so much together, 
But nothing quite like this 
Something's come between us now, 

I can't feel it in your kiss 
So tell me girl what's in your heart, 
Just put your hand in mine 
I feel the storm is coming soon 
And we're running out of time 

Strange weather, somehow we'll survive 
Strange weather, we'll keep our love alive 
Strange weather, dark clouds in the sky 
Strange weather for you and I 

So think it over one last time, don't say this is the end 
'Cause I remember how it use to be, 
And it can be that way again 

Strange weather, somehow we'll survive 
Strange weather, we'll keep our love alive 
Strange weather, dark clouds in the sky 
Strange weather, for you and I

I'm jaded
And you're beautiful
I'm deluded
And I'm envious of you
You're carin'
That I'm hurtin'
But I'm laughing
'Cause I'm lyin'

You believe what I say to be true
This is the way God made me
No self-reliance
No social skills
You're confident
And you express yourself so well
You're learned
Degrees upon your wall
I'm jealous
No invitations to the ball

[Chorus: x2]

No self esteem
You're picture perfect
You walk about so contented
The trees call out your name
You're clean
And I'm so ignorant
I'm basic
And I'm jaded
My excuses are so lame

[Chorus]

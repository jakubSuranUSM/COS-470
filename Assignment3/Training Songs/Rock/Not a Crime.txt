Drop the charges!

The fire and the power, you know

In the old time it was not a crime, drop the charges
You people don't you realize the sun rises?

(Drop the charges, man! Drop the charges) 

(Right you are! And this time, let the people know)

In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime (what are you talking about?)
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a, not a crime

Not a crime!
(It's all nonsensical)
Not a crime!

In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a, not a crime

Not a crime
(Drop the charges)
Not a crime
Not a crime
Reality

Spices, creation, realization, naturalization
What are you talking about? It's all about time 'cos today you go to nature

(Not a crime)
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime
In the old time, in the old time
In the old time it was not a crime

(Not a crime, not a crime)
Not a crime
Not a crime
Not a crime

Drop the charges
Not a crime

Not a crime

Not a crime

(It's not a crime, it's legal, perfectly natural)

Rosie you're my lucky charm
When you're in my arms
I'm happy as can be
Oh Rosie, everytime we meet

My heart skips a beat
I'm happy to repeat
Oh Rosie Oh Rosie
You are the one

Tell me oh tell me
You'll be my number one
Hot doggie
I tell ya

Rosie give me your answer do
I promise to be true
Oh just you wait and see
Oh Rosie Oh Rosie

Don't make me lose my self control
Girl
Rosie Rosie you've got a little heart of gold
Everybody loves ya

I know the reason why
You put the sunshine
Way up in the sky
There's really somethin'

The way you drive me wild
You make my heart sing
With your Mona-Lisa smile
Rosie Oh Rosie

You are the one
Tell me girl tell me
You'll be my number one
Uh huh

I tell ya
Rosie give me your answer do
I promise to be true
Oh just you wait and see

Oh Rosie Oh Rosie
Don't make me lose my self control
Girl

Rosie Rosie
You've got a little heart of gold
Rosie Rosie
You've got a little heart of gold

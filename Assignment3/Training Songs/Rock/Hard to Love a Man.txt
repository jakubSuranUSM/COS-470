It was hard to love a man like you
Goodbye was half the words you knew
While you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love, I sent my love

In a life built out of only goodbyes
Is there even room for you to try
While you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love, I sent my love

It was hard to love a man like you
Goodbye was just what you do
In a life built out of only goodbye
Is there even room for you
Is there even room for you

While you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love, I sent my love

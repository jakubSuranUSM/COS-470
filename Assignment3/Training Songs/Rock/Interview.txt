Yes it's been hard, going a long time
And we're together even now.
Why do you ask? Surely you know it!
Isn't it clear just when and how.
What can we tell you?
At the beginning had no direction,
Any other way.
After the fourth one, realization,
Finding our road, the same as if today.

Well we all hear, everyone, no-one,
Not to not say, we like a lot.
Want to be seen rock and roll music,
Don't take us something that we're not.
True it looks better, tide looks like turning,
So all in all we feel we are alright.
Yes we had troubles, much more than many,
Rather have none and do we think what's right.

What are your plans for the future now?
And can you say who does the writing then?
How did you get who gave the name of the band?

Now that he's gone, turn off our faces,
Wait for the new man to arrive.
Soon the same song, sung for the next one,
Saying our piece, though not alive.
What can we tell you?
At the beginning had no direction,
Any other way.
After the fourth one, realization,
Finding our road, the same as if today.

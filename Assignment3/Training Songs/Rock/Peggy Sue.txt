If you knew Peggy Sue, then you'd know why I feel blue
About Peggy, 'bout Peggy Sue
Oh, well, I love you gal, yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, Peggy Sue
Oh, my Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh, well, I love you gal, and I need you, Peggy Sue

I love you Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh, Peggy, My Peggy Sue
Oh, well, I love you gal, yes, I want you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, Oh how my heart years for you
Oh, Pa-he-ggy, my Pa-he-ggy Sue
Oh, well, I love you gal, and I need you, Peggy Sue
Oh, well, I love you gal, yes, I want you, Peggy Sue

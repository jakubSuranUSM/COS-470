To compose, and decompose, to decompose
The ebb and flow of the darkness
The ebb and flow de ma paresse
To compose, decompose, and recompose

From a minute to another
From minuscule to the grandeur
To compose, decompose, I wander and I slip
Get all those ghosts out of my sight
They devour all of my might

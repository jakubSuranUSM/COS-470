Ninety miles outside Chicago
Can't stop driving
Don't know why
So many questions
I need an answer
Two years later you're still on my mind
What ever happened to Amelia Earhart
Who holds the stars up in the sky
Is true love once in a lifetime
Did the captain of the titanic cry

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you

Does anybody know the way to Atlantis
Or what the wind says when she cries
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
For the ninety seventh time tonight

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you

Someday we'll know
Why Sampson loved Delilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
I watched the stars crash into the sea
If I could ask God just one question
Why aren't you here with me

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Why Sampson loved Delilah
One day I'll go 
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you

Seeing you in February was great
Cliches all come true 'time heals all wounds'
I went to get us our ninth drink
And you ran out the door with another guy
I woke up on the floor with my shoes on
A smile on my face and I didn't even care

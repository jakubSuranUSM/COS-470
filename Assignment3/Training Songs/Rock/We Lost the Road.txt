We must have lost the road. 
Don't you think it's getting late? 
Maybe if it's colder, 
We can stop and wait. 

We must have lost the words, 
All the little things we said. 
And now the world is frozen. 
Only you in my head. 

Aah, we lost the road. [Repeat: x4]

We must have lost the tune. 
Where did I step out of line? 
I'll search for the melody 
That calls you mine. 

Aah, we lost the road. [Repeat: x4]

Aah, we lost the road (we lost the road, we lost the road, yeah). 
Aah, we lost the road (ah, we lost, yeah, yeah). 
Aah, we lost the road (we lost the road, we lost the road, oh yeah). 
Ah, we lost the road (we lost the road,don't you know we lost the road). 

Aah, we lost the road

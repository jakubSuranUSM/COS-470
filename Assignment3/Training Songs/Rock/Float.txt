Little red rover
Let your thoughts come over here
Four leaf clover
Does your luck run over fear
Butterflies hold the skies open
For rain
Spread your wings like angels do and
Float away
There's no way send me away
Little red rover
Let your thoughts come over here
You had me believing
That you would still be here
Butterflies hold the skies open
For rain
Spread you wings like angels do and
Float away

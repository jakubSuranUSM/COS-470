This life I'm livin is too fast for me
I gotta lay off that LSD 

STP, STP I'd rather have you than that LSD

18 years of rotten luck
Stuck in Missouri and they took my truck

STP, STP I'd rather have you than that LSD
STP, STP I can't get enough of that LSD, Hey!

If you take those drugs it'll blow your mind
Nothing but the blob is left behind.
The hippie said don't drive a truck?
But I'd rather have that, than my mind f***ed on

STP, STP I'd rather have you than that LSD
STP, STP I'd rather have you than that LSD
STP, STP I can't get enough of that LSD.

Yeah this life's too fast man.

I woke the dawn
Saw horses growing out the lawn
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 

I glimpsed a bat with butterfly wings 
Oh what marvelous things
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Dark nights hold tight and sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright and keep us here safely
I followed a rabbit through rows of mermaids entwined shrubbery
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh what marvelous things

But they are they are they are giving me the creeps
Dark nights hold tight and sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright and keep us here safely
Oh lying in the sun 

Everyday feeling all of the magic and might find the wonder
Dark nights hold tight and sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright and keep us here safely
Morning light shall burst bright and keep us here safely

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh

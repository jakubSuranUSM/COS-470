Do you remember who you believe angel
When the chart was in the rise
Do you remember your leader angel
For the people and the lies ¡­. mmmm, yeah

Does she remember oh those heartaches
And the taste of bittersweet
She turns the color to the voices in her mind
Sounds so far, too far to me

She was a noble heart
She was a noble heart
She's a child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way
Child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way

Lead

Take your weapon, dare to see her face again
¡®cause you'll be sad cause she's on the move
Will you ask the one outside to take your place?
The child that helped you rove

She was a noble heart
She was a noble heart
She's a child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way
Child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way

Do you remember little sister
Do you accept the tears won't go
Do you remember little sister
Child that's left out in the cold

She's in your heart
She's in your heart

I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon, her
Young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love her till the end
I am gonna love her till the end
I will love her till I die
I will see her in the sky
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

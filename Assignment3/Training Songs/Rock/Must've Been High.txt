I kind of bump around and I wonder
What I'm feeling like and what I do
I take a look around and I'm underwhelmed
With my big bad self

I will walk in hell, so are you

I kind of roll along without anger
When they're giving me their evil eye
'Cause I've been coming down like a stranger
Something 'bout 'em rings the bell

[Incomprehensible]
You must've have been high
I walked the hell, I must've been high

Yeah, I kind of bump around and I wonder
What I'm feeling like and why
I take a look around and I'm underwhelm
With my big bad self

[Incomprehensible]
I must've been high
I know they look and tell
I must've have been high

Say I couldn't feel this world
(I must've have been high)
And I laugh until I cry
(I must've have been high)

And I started looking for today
(I must've have been high)
Yeah, I must've have been high
I must've have been high

I must've have been high
I must've have been high
I must've have been high
I must've have been high

I must've have been high
I must've have been high
I must've have been high
I must've have been high

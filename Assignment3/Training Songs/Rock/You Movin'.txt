Well, I've been watching you dance
For a while little girl
And I'd like to have a chance
To learn your style little girl

'Cause you have a way of moving
That I hope to be able to do
I am girl so fascinated watching

You moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, yeah

Now the way you toss your hair
When you swing, swing to the right
There's a feeling I get there
That is way, way out of sight

And I want to be with you
And I want to be doing it to
I am falling so in love watching

You moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, yeah

Now if I could be with you
And if we could be a pair
And you showed me how you step
Step with your dance, dance anywhere

'Cause you have a way of moving
That I hope to be able to do
I am falling so in love watching

You moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, you moving
Oh, yeah

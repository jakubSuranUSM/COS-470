I hear a sound, a sound above my head
Distant sound of thunder, moving out on the moor

Blackbirds flew in and to the cooling towers
I'll pack my bags
Thinking of one of those hours
With you, waiting for you

My god, it takes an ocean of trust
In the kingdom of rust

I long to feel some beauty in my heart
As I go searching, right to the start
The road back to Preston
Was jutted out in snow
As I went looking for that stolen heart
For you, waiting for you

My god, it takes an ocean of trust
Takes an effort it does
My god, it takes an ocean of trust
It's in the kingdom of rust

Oh in the kingdom of rust

I long to feel that wince in my heart
As I went looking
I couldn't stop
Now I'm waiting for you

oh yes it does
I know it takes an ocean of trust
In the kingdom of rust

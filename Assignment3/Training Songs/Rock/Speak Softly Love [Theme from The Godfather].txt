Speak softly love and hold me warm against your heart
I feel your words the tender trembling moments starts
We're a world, our very own
Sharing a love that only few have ever known

Wine colored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly love

Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly love

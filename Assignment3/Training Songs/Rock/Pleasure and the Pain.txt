As the years come around
With our triumphs and downs
We were there for the pleasure and the pain
Not in our wildest dreams
Did we know that we'd sing
Twenty summers of songs that stage
There's no one to blame
We put ourselves on the frame
That's just part of the pleasure and pain
We're not tired of the game
We just dropped on to play
And you are no stranger, today
I see a bright sky, no rain
And as time seems to fade
It's all been a pleasure, no pain.

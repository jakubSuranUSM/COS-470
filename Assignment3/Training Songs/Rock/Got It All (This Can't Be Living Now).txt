This can't be living now, if so then show me how 
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away 
We shook, shook, shook the night away. 

Want to love like this love was young 
But will I die as I become one,
At the bottom of it all.

You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 
You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 

I'm not alive (the revolution comes) 
'Cause my teacher taught me everything 
I'm not alive but then it's nothing it would be 

When I was born I defied your times
But they were nothing, nothing like mine 
We'll shake, shake, shake the night away 
We shook, shook, shook the night away. 

Fools like screwed up pain 
But long as you're right there now
At the bottom of it all 

You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 
You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 

I'm not alive 'cause my teacher taught me everything 
I'm not alive but then it's nothing it would be 

We shook, shook, shook the night away. 
We shook, shook, shook the night away. 

This can't be living now, if so then show me how 
It will find it
At the bottom of it all 

You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 
You got it all 
You got it all 
You got it all 
'Til the revolution comes 

I'm not alive 'cause my teacher taught me everything 
I'm not alive but then it's nothing it would be 

Ah, ah, ah, ah

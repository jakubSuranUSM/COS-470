(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh uh oh oh)
(Uh uh oh oh)

Say you're wasting away
Say you're wasting your days
I don't believe you
Say you're going through a phase
You're acting your age
I don't believe

Oh
There's nothing we can do
If I don't believe you

Uh oh oh
(Uh uh oh oh)
(Uh uh oh oh)

Say you're feeling kinda ill
You're just feeling rather sick
I don't believe
You're just feeling from the pill
You just wanna make it stick
I don't believe you

Oh
There's nothing we can do
If I don't believe you

Yeah
Our history is incomplete
I don't believe you
I don't believe you 
I don't believe you

Uh oh oh
(Uh uh oh oh)
(Uh uh oh oh)

Say you're wasting away
Say you're wasting your days
I don't believe you
Say you're going far away
Say you're leaving in day
I don't believe you

Oh
There's nothing we can do
If I don't believe you

Our history is incomplete
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
Oh

Uh oh oh

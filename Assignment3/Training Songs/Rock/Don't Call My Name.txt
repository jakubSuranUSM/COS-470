The party's over
It's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away

It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over
The candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right

Just being with him
Now you must wake up
All dreams must end
Take off your makeup

The party's over
It's all over, my friend
Now you must wake up
All dreams must end

Take off your makeup
The party's over
It's all over, my friend

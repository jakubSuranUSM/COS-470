Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together 
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music 
To get you through the stormy weather
And do whatever you feel
when you let go 
Nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll 

So come on, put you hands together
You know it's now or never 
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll 

[Chorus]
Oh are you feelin' satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Oh are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride 
You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride 

Oh that funky feelin' 
Is what you need to get you through
You oughta know 
I'll tell you somethin'
Don't let your troubles get to you
'Cause win or lose it's alright 
Well take control 
And nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll 

So come on
Put you hands together
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll 

[Chorus]

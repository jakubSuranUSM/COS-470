I'm not mad 
I'm just bored 
And everything I do is only because 
There's nothing much else for me to do 
And that includes you 
Messing around with you 
Piss away potential 
Everyday is a waste 
And I'm wasted everyday 
There's nothing much else for me to do 
And that includes you   and that includes you 
Messing around with you 
You see me now a little bit clearer 
The face I make when I'm looking in the mirror 
It gives me away 
The things that I say 
You think you know where I'm coming from 
The words I say when I'm playing dumb 
It gives me away 
It gives me away 
One more thing before we go 
I've stepped over everyone I know 
Everyone I know 
You see me now a little bit clearer 
The face I make when I'm looking in the mirror 
It gives me away 
You think you know where I'm coming from 
The words I say when I'm playing dumb 
It gives me away 
It gives me away 
It gives me away 
I'm always ashamed 
I'm always ashamed 
And that's no way to be

One fine summer morning
When the dawn is softly calling
To a day that's showing promise
Of a lovely summer evening
I will take you to the forest
Where the mountain meets the ocean
We will share the fine silence
Another sneaking of devotion
And there'll be no need for a dream

There's no footsteps there behind us
There is no one that can find us
There is nothing that combines
The feeling shared between us
And there'll be no need for a dream?

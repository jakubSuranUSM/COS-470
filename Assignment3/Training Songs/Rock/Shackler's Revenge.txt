I've got a funny feeling there's something wrong today
I've got a funny feeling and it won't go away

I've got an itchy finger and there'll be hell to pay
I'm gonna pull the trigger and blow them all away

Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you were there for me

[Chorus]
I don't believe there's a reason (I hope you see this)
I don't believe there's a reason (I don't regret this)

I've got a wicked demon inside that never fades
I've got an empty feeling I won't be home today

Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you were there for me

[Chorus: Repeat x2]

I want you to stop and help out with doing what you want to do
No one is guilty here now, there's nothing new now

[Chorus: Repeat x2]

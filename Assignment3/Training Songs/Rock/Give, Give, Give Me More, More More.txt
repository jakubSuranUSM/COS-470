Well I hope I make more money than this in the next world.
I hope there's a lot more in it there for me.
I'd like my trousers pressed and my shoes
Shined up by a rich girl,

Who's only care in the world is me.
"but are these all the brains I'm entitled to have?
Don't try to make me happy, when I'm happy feeling bad.
I've got no manners or a hand you shake,

And when I won't tell the truth it's easier to fake."
So....(sing title)
I'd like it all.
Is the bank big enough?

Coming ready or not to the next world.
I hope there's a whole lot more in it there for me.
I'd like my friends to be rich and I'll never do a stitch,
In the next world, and my only care in the world is me.

"is the bank big enough
Coming ready or not to the next world"

Mountains shed water, islands need sea
Take me over the river, electricity

Gold in your pockets, lose some for me
I sense them coming, electricity

Promise, promise me, return the dead
This heart burns electricity

We have a life together, we have ties to break
Our past's an island we have set to sea

Promise me, promise me, return the dead
This heart burns electricity

Mountains shed water, islands need sea
Take me over the river, electricity

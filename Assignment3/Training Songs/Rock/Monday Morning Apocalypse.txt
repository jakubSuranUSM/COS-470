How long have you held me in this water 
Much too long since my body is numb 
How long have I been and where a I 
And why are my hands tied 
How long have I been your little altar 
Your little toy and sacrifice 
How long have you kept me in these waters 
In a world where you're god 
And we are all your servants 

If I had known how to get out of solitude 
I would have done it all to help you. 
If we had known about the pain we caused you 
We would have stopped just to save you. 

How far did he go to get to know her 
Much too far and we all must have been blind 
It was an ordinary morning 
Monday morning just before 9.00 

And you are all my servants. 
The guilt is yours not mine. 

If I had known how to get out of solitude. 
I would have done it all to help you. 
If we had known about the pain we caused you. 
We would have stopped just to save you. 

And you are all my servants. 
You will all oblige. 
This will teach the lesson. 
The guilt is yours not mine. 

If I had known how to get out of solitude. 
I would have done it all to help you. 
And If I had known about the pain we caused you. 
I would have saved you.

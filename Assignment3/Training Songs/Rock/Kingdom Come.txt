Well, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard the voice that cries "it's all in vain"
The face of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord, I just need one day

[Chorus:]
Well, I'll be breaking these rocks until the kingdom comes
And I'll be cuttin' this hay until the kingdom comes
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks until the kingdom comes
It's my price to pay until the Kingdom comes

The river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please give me the night.

[Chorus]

The sun keeps beating down, the wall's a mile high
Up in the towers they're watching me, hoping I'm gonna die
But they'll open these cells when the kingdom comes
I won't be breaking no rocks when the kingdom comes
Yes, they'll open these cells when the kingdom comes
I won't hear their talk when the kingdom comes
I'm going up for a pardon when the kingdom comes
Well, pardon me when the kingdom comes
I won't be breaking no rock
I won't be breaking no rock
I won't be breaking no rock
When the kingdom comes

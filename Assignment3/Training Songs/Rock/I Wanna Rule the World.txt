I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around

I want to do it right
I want to do it right away
I want to do it right now
I want to do it right away
I want to do it now

Don't want to be a dancer in the Bolshoi Ballet
Don't want to work for daddy
In daddy's shop, 0K
I get confused, so confused
I get a pain, I get a pain up here in the Shirley Temples

What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it

Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit

Sssh, not too loud, don't tell everybody
Don't give away the game
Oh, I ain't quite ready to reveal my campaign

This is not the time
My hero's are alive and well in a cave
I'm keeping them on ice in suspended animation
Till the very right occasion comes along

To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along
To our rally come along
Come along to our rally
Come along to our rally come along

A Brave new world will rise from the ashes
And there upon a rock titanic
I'll cast a giant shadow on the face of the deep
And never again will they dare to call me
A freckled, spotty, specky, four eyed, weedy, little creep

No more tremblin' and quakin' in the gym
No more come on fellas, let's get him

What you gonna do
How you gonna do it
What you gonna do
How you gonna do it

Little by little, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Little by little, ooh, ooh
Little by little, bit by bit
Bit by bit, bit by bit

Everyone's going to be free
But they'll have to agree to be free
They'll have to agree to be less free than me
'Cause I rule the world you see
So wait for the army of kiddy-winkies
And terrible tiny tots
In armored school buses
Firing poison pea-shooters
And sinking their milk teeth into your thighs
Delapsus resurgam when I fall I shall rise

I want to be a boss
I want to be a big boss
I want to boss the world around
I want to be the biggest boss
That ever bossed the world around

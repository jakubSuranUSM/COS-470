It's quiet now and what it brings is everything
Comes calling back a brilliant night
I'm still awake I looked ahead
I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me to tell you now
That nothing can compare

[Chorus]
You might've laughed if I told you
You might have hidden your frown
You might've succeeded in changing me
I might've been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet and what it brings
I tried to take
The loneliness it wears me out
It lies in wait
And on a loss still in my eyes
Shatter a necklace across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream
But I swear this is real
Memory fuses, and shatters like glass
Mercurial future forget the past
But it's you, it's what I feel

[Chorus]

You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart, (change)

I told you forever I love you it's forever
I told you if I love you, I love you forever
I told you forever I love you it's forever
I told you if I love you, I love you forever
You never, you never, you told me it's forever!

[Chorus:]

I've been a be	-bad boy baby 
I've been a bad boy all night long, oh yes I have, 
Yes, I've been a bad boy honey, 
I've been a bad boy all night long, 
That woman, she don't even let me, 
She did not even telephone. 

I'm gonna leave my little honey, 
Like a rabbit leaves the hole, 
A-ow-ah leave my little honey baby, 
Just like that little bunny rabbit leaves the hole, 
I got a weasel in my pocket, 
I'm gonna stick that weasel down my mamma, 
I'm gonna stick it down that little hole. 

I'm never gonna get out of this prison baby, 
The only way I get out is climb over the wall, 
Oh baby, the only way out is that I get a ladder 
And climb over the wall 
Well I can't climb the ladder baby, 
'Cause I'm afraid that I, that I might fall. 
Come on yeah! 

I'm staying in this Folsom prison honey, 
Yeah, I'm gonna stay in this prison till the day that I day, 
Oh, I'll stay in Folsom prison baby, 
Oh, till the day, until the day that I die, 
Hear more, I'm gonna kill nobody, 
Oh my baby you know, you know that I'm staying alive 

'Cause I know baby, that's gonna be a great big lie, 
(You know I'm livin' in this F-Fol' prison)

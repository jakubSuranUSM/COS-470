As she played, magicians seeing all this on the floor,
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw.
Had myself a nightmare,
Didn't think there could be much more.
Then in walked Lord Borgaasha with the Lady Eleanor.

She tied my eyes with a ribbon,
Of a silken gossamer thread.
I gaze with troubled vision,
On an old four poster bed.
Where Eleanor had risen to kiss the neck below my head,
And made me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

She gazed with loving beauty,
Like a mother to a son.
Like living, dying, seeing, 
Being all rolled into one.
Then all at once I heard some music,
Playing in my bones.
The same old song I'd heard for years,
Reminding me of home. 

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor.
I'm alright where I am.

Then creeping on towards me,
Licking lips with tongues of fire.
A host of gold and demons,
Screaming lust and ways desired. 
And when it seemed for certain, 
That the screams could get no higher.
I heard a voice above the rest,
Screaming you're a liar.

But its alright Lady Eleanor,
Alright Lady Eleanor,
I'm alright here in your arms.

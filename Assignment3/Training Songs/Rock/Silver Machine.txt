I just took a ride in a Silver Machine
And I'm still feeling mean

Do you want to ride
See yourself going by 
Other side of the sky 
Well I got a silver machine

I've got a Silver Machine

It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your Zodiac sign

It flies out of a dream
It's antiseptically clean
You're gonna know where I've been

I've got a Silver Machine

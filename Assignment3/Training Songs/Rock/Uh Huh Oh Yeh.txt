I took a trip down boundary lane
Tryin' to find myself again
At least the part I left somewhere
Buried under a hedgerow near

A lazy bridge on a hot afternoon
Water glistening while it plays a tune
Cloud burst on a rainy day
Wiping all my sleep away

Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Always there to confuse and fool you

And in my mind I saw the place
As each memory returned to trace
Dear reminders of who I am
The very roots upon which I stand

And there they were for all to see
My long lost used to be's
And all the dreams I had to dream
Were really something not make believe

Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Always there to confuse and fool you
Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Always there to confuse and fool you

A lazy tree by a wishing well
I wish now that I could tell
If all the dreams I have to dream
Are really something I make believe
I make, make believe

Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh

A lazy tree by a wishing well
I wish now that I could tell
If all the dreams I used to dream
Are really something I make believe

Always there to confuse and fool you
Always there to confuse and fool you
Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Always there to confuse and fool you
Oh yeh, oh yeh, oh yeh

Always there to confuse and fool you
Always there to confuse and fool you
Uh huh, oh yeh, uh huh, oh yeh
Always there to confuse and fool you

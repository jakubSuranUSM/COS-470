How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what state is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes heatless fire

But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me

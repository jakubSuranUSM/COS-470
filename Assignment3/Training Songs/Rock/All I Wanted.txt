If you understand me now, well, here's a promise 
From every single piece of my body 
That though I've fallen at every corner 
I'll ask not for shelter or for charity 
For what you needed, I could not give you 
For all the love and money in this world 

All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would feel this way 
All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would see the day 

Just like my father I still love him 
But it's not easy, no not never 
Still it goes on, these roots run deep 
Beneath the lies that we speak 
Thick as thieves, us laughing up our sleeves 
Until we learn to steal from each other 

All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would feel this way 
All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would see the day 

Come on down, come on down into my kitchen 
I've got some stories, I've got some stories to tell 

If you understand me now, well, here's a promise 
From every single piece of my body 
That though I've fallen at every corner 
I'll ask not for shelter or for charity 
All I wanted ...

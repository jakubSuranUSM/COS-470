It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
Has a pretty little flowerbed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
But parked in a rickety old garage
There's a brand new shiny super-stocked Dodge
 
And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than 
The little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
 
If you see her on the strip, don't try to choose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
You might drive a go-er, but you'll never lose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now, sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator
 
And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than 
The Little Old Lady From Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
 
You can catch her all the time, just gettin' her kicks now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
With her four speed stick and a four-two-six now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length, then she'll shut 'em down
 
And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner than 
The little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

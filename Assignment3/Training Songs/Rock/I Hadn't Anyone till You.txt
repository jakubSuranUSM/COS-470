I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I don't want much
I'm happy? with what I've got
On the second floor
I pass a ruffian on the stairs
What the driver saw
Ah through the letter box of number four
I don't have much
It will be deafening when I do

And all these little shocks I'll be riding my imaginary dynamo
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't

Bless my heart
And everything will be explained
In the diaries
Especially the latter part
I'll be a somebody
I found an empty glass today at home
Give me ability
Turn up the pedal away from his hand

And all these little shocks I'll be riding my imaginary dynamo
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day? but I can't
I wish I could have just a little bit more
Just a little bit more of your time
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't

I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't 
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't

And all these little shocks I'll be riding my imaginary dynamo
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could have just a little bit more, just a little bit more of your time
I wish I could give you undivided attention every minute of the day but I can't

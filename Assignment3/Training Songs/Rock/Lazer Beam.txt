Introducing a radical new vision 
No more imperial colonial bastards 
No more romantic comedies 
This is a fanfare introduction 
To a high-powered purposeful theme 

[Repeat: x4]
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 

The resistance 
In the distance 
Creeping closer 
Have no fear 
Land in anguish 
We escape it 
In our rocket 
Propelled spaceship 

Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 

Human being 
Human doing 
Human error 
Human terror 
Human nature 
Human hate you 
Human crying 
Human leaving 

[Repeat: x4]
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 

We will conquer utopia in space chariots 

[Repeat: x8]
Take a shine of our lazer beam 
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you 

Point your random finger 
Point it to the sky 
Point your random finger 
Come on and testify 
Human kind loves money 
We just love to fly 
(Fly, fly, fly) 
So point your random finger 
Come on and testify

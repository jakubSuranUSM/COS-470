I've got that dust pneumonia, pneumonia in my lung,
I've got that dust pneumonia, pneumonia in my lung,
And I'm gonna sing ya this dust pneumonia song. 

I went to the doctor, and the doctor said, "My son,"
Yes, I went to the doctor and the doctor said, "My son,
You got that dust pneumonia and you ain't got long." 

Now there ought to be some yodelling in this song,
There ought to be some yodelling in this song,
But I can't yodel for the rattling in my lung. 

My good girl sings the dust pneumonia blues,
My good girl sings the dustpneumonia blues,
She loves me but she's got the dustpneumonia too. 

If it wasn't for choppin' my ax would turn to rust,
If it wasn't for choppin' my ax would turn to rust,
I can't find a woman in this black old texas dust. 

Down in Oklahoma the wind blows mighty strong,
Down in Oklahoma the wind blows mighty strong,
If you want to get in, mama, just sing a california song. 

Down in Texas my gal fainted in the rain,
Down in Texas my gal fainted in the rain,
I throwed a bucket o' dirt in her face just to bring her back again.

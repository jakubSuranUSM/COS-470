(Alex Chilton)

Well I'm free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,
And to be out on my own again

Well I had me a girl, but she couldn't understand
Me and my ways, and my need to be around
Left her today, took my life in my hands
And now I'm free again

Well I'm free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,
And to be out on my own again

Well I made a mistake, and thought I could turnaround,
Thought I could take, a leash on my neck, around
Now I'm gonna make, my way to another
Til my feet are back on the ground

Yes I'm free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,
And to be out on my own again

Free again, to do what I wanna do
Free again, to sing my song again
Free again, to air my longing,
To be out on my own again

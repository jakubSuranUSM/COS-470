Look out girl your headin for trouble
Look out girl oh can't you see
Look out girl your headin for trouble
Stick with me baby stick with me
He's told you so many lies
He's got you all confused
He could tell you night was day and you'de think its true
I just can not understand, how you let yourself be found
By a guy who everybody knows will drag you down

(CHORUS)
Look out girl your headin for trouble
Look out girl oh can't you see
Look out girl your headin for trouble
Stick with me baby stick with me

He'll never love you like I do
There's just one thing on his mind
And after he gets just what he wants he'll leave you cryin
It won't take long for you realize, you've made a big mistake
Oh wake up baby wake up before its to late
(REPEAT CHORUS)
Stick with me baby stick with me

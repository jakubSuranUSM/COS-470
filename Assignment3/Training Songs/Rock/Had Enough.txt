Give me a good enough reason
Why I should not cut you down
You're been taking too much
Ever since you started hanging 'round this crowd

And I’ve had enough, had enough
Yes, you let me down, let me down
And n-now I'm giving up, giving up
Guess I’ll see you ‘round, see you ‘round

Oh n-now now, hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you wipe it away-way
Won't you give me some time to understand your mind?

Ooh it's alright
Ooh it's alright

Let me say what I want
Don't you know what was on the tip of my tongue?
If you opened your eyes, took a look outside
You would see you're wrong

And I’ve had enough, had enough
Yes, you let me down, let me down
Now n-now I'm giving up, giving up
Guess I’ll see you 'round, see you 'round

Now n-now now, hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you wipe it away-way
Won't you give me some time to understand your mind?

Ooh it's alright
Ooh it's alright

Had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough

Had enough, had enough
(Let me down)
Had enough, had enough
(See you 'round)
Had enough, had enough
(Let me down)
Had enough, had enough
(I'll see you around)

Hey, hey
What's the matter with your face, face?
When you wipe it away-way
Won't you give me some time to understand your mind?

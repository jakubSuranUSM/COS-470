There's nothing to do here
So just lie and complain
In bed at the hospital
Coming and going
Asleep and awake
In bed at the hospital

I've got one friend
Laying across from me
I did not choose him
He did not choose me
We have no chance
Of recovering
Laying in hospitals
Joy and misery
Joy and misery
Joy and misery

Put out the fire boys
Don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us

Put out the fire boys
Don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us

Bring your buckets by the dozen
Bring your nieces and your cousins
Oh, put out the fire on us

Bring your buckets by the dozen
Bring your nieces and your cousins
Oh, put out the fire on us

I've got one friend
Laying across from me
I did not choose him
He did not choose me
We have no chance
Of recovering
Laying in hospitals
Joy and misery
Joy and misery
And joy and joy and joy and joy and joy and joy and misery.

Mercy speaks by Jesus' blood
Hear and sing, ye sons of God
Justice satisfied indeed
Christ has full atonement made

Jesus' blood speaks loud and sweet
Here all deity can meet
And without a jarring voice
Welcome Zion to rejoice

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

Peace of conscience, peace with God
We obtain through Jesus' blood
Jesus' blood speaks solid rest
We believe and we are blessed

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

Should the law against her roar
Jesus' blood still speaks with power

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

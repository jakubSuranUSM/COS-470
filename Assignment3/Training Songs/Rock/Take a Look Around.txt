You will never see me 
Walking around feeling low 
You will never hear there 
Goes a man who doesn t know 
Too many roads to walk 
Too many things to do 
Too many words to talk 
Moments too few 

I don't think you know 
Though you've been told a million times 
Its not clear to see 
Unless you read in between the lines 
Look out your window 
When did it start? 
Nothing's for certain 
It's just a part 

If you're feeling low, no 
And your world comes tumbling down 
If you see how time stops 
Better take a look around 
Good things must end 
They never last 
Look to tomorrow 
Forget the past

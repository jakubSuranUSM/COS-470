(Well, don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
(Now don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Ah, well there ain't no other woman that makes me feel this way
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
When she comes up close, well I just ain't got a word to say
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Ple-e-ease don't touch, I shake so much
Ple-e-ease don't touch, I sha-a-a-a-ake so much

(Well, don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
(Now don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Ah, well I get so nervous when I see her eyes that shine
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
She looks right through me and the chills run down my spine
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Ple-e-ease don't touch, I shake so much
Ple-e-ease don't touch, I sha-a-a-a-ake so much

Ah, well I don't know why she dug her claws in me
I wanna be a bachelor and fancy free
Runnin' from the preacher, boy, what a relief
I'm gonna spend my life a-shakin' like a leaf

Ah, well remembering the first time her ruby lips brushed my cheek
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
I opened up my mouth, but the rest of me just wouldn't speak
(Don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Ple-e-e-ase don't touch, I shake so much
Ple-e-e-ase don't touch, I sha-a-a-a-ake so much

(Ah, don't you touch me baby cause I'm shakin' so much)
Why, c'mon baby, don't you touch-a-me now
Because I'm shakin' so much
Why, c'mon baby, don't want ya to

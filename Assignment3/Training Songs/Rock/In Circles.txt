Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Sincerity
Trust in me
Throw myself into your door

(Well I go) in circles (running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (running down)
In circles (running down)

Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Ooh I dream to heal your wounds
But I bleed myself
Well I bleed myself

(Well I go) in circles (running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (running down)
In circles (running down)

Circles
In circles

(Well I go) in circles (running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (running down)
In circles (running down)

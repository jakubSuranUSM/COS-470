Unscrew your face from your laptop screen
See the people, the places in your magazines
They're a big headed bunch, you know what I mean
Someone made them out of plasticine.

I'm the morning rain, it's me again, I won't go away
I'm the morning rain, it's me again, I won't go away.

It may be used later in your defense
It may be used later as evidence for the

Morning rain, it's me again, I won't go away
I' the morning rain, it's me again, I won't go away.

Undo your head from the sink plug chain
Unscrew the cheap wine and drink like a drain

I'm the morning rain, it's me again, I won't go away
I'm the morning rain, don't you know my name,
Don't you know my name
I'm the morning rain, don't you know my name?

Best lookin' gal in town 
Well now, she, she, she little Sheila 
With your hair so long and brown 
Well you never-never know what my Sheila's puttin' down 

Well now, Dick Clark said you're the best lookin' girl 
On his big bandstand

And honey, I'm your man 
Well you never-never know what my Sheila's puttin' down 

Yeah, she, she, she little Sheila 
She, she, she little Sheila

Well you never-never know what my Sheila's gonna put down 

Well, she, she, she little Sheila 
Best lookin' gal around 
Well, she, she, she little Shiela 
With your hair so long and brown 
Well you never-never know what my Sheila's puttin' down

She, she, she little Sheila 
She, she, she little Sheila 
She, she, she little Sheila 
Well you never-never know what my Sheila's puttin' down

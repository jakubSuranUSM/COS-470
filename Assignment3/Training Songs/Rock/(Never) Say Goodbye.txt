Some summer Sunday
Drifting between sleep and waking
Your absence brought me to
Sick feelings filled me
Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss,
Motionless
We never said goodbye
When we gave in, but we don't mind
If we never say goodbye,
There'll be no end, there'll be no end

Stream of consciousness
Leads me to drowning dreams
Looking up, you're colored baby-blue
The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in,
Remember then, remember when you let me in
Hold on, hold on, we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other

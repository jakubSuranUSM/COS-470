Your God may come to touch you
If He needs you around
He may call the undertaker 
To put you underground 

He come to you tormented
Eased to the brink
A lover leaves you early
A lover will not rise... 

You've got to come, you've got to come
You've got to come, you've got to come 

Simmering in silence, seeking refrain
It's burning, speak to me, speak to me again 

You lie awake tormented
Eased to the brink
A lover has left you early
A lover will not rise... 

You've got to come, you've got to come
You've got to come, you've got to come 

Come, come, come, come, come 
Never wanting, seeking 
Never wanting, Never hoping,
Never asking, ______ 
Never holding, Never preaching,
Never loving, Never hating,
Never wanting, Never reaching, 
Never screaming, Never hurting, 
Never wanting, Never dreaming, 
Never touching, Never moving 

No, no , no, no , no

Out at the train tracks 
I dream of escape 
But a song comes onto my iPod 
And I realize it's getting late 

And I can't take the staring 
And the sympathy 
And I don't like the questions "How do you feel?" 
"How's it going in school?" 
And "Do you wanna talk about it?" 

Way out 
Way out of here 
Fade out
Fade out, vanish 

And I'm trying to forget you 
And I know that I will 
In a thousand years, or maybe a week 
Burn all your pictures, and cut out your face 

The shutters are down and the curtains are closed 
And I've covered my tracks 
Disposed of the car 
Trying to forget even your name and the way that you look 
When you're sleeping 
Dreaming of this 

Way out 
Way out of here 
Fade out
Fade out, vanish

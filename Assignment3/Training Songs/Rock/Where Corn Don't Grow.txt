As we sat on the front porch
Of that ole gray house where I was born and raised
And stared out at the dusty fields
Where daddy's always worked hard every day
I think it kinda hurt him when I said daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow
He just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked up
He said son I know at your age it feels like this old world is turning slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't grow
But hard times are real there's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

I remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only seventeen back then but it seems like I knew more than I do now
I can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoe
It's funny how a dream can turn around where corn don't grow
But hard times are real...
You may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

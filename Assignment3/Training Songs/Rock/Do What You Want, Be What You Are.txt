Do what you want, be what you are
Do what you want girl, but be what you are
There ain't no right er wrong way
Just a play from the heart

It ain't a sign of weakness to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on,
While the weak, weak give up and stay

[Chorus]
So do what you want to do
But be what you are ...
Do you believe in hot cars,
Leather bars, or movie stars

Is that what's real
Payin' dues, earth shoes, chicago blues
Is that how you feel?
You can change, but you can't conceal

What's deep inside you
Lt's your game, lt's your deal

[Chorus]

So do what you want to do
But be what you are...

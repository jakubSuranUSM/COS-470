I think I might have met you before,
I think its time to settle the score,
Buildings how they stretch so tall,
Steal and brick no more,
No, no.
Can I make you see.

Id sooner just wreck em down,
Never build on broads of ground,
Rows that came together,
Memory never severs, love will never sever for me.

Can't I make you see.

Some cities crush,some cities heal,
Some cities laugh while other cities steal,
Can I make you see,can I make you

Can I, can I make you see,
Can I make you

Some cities,
Some cities crush,Some cities crush
Some cities.

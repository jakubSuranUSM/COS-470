Throw the world off your shoulders tonight Mr. Smith
Throw the world off your shoulders tonight Mr. Smith

He's been looking now for a long time
It seems the more he looks the less he wants to see
He turned to the west for a long time
He turned to the east then he turned to the west again

If there's a heaven above, in the meantime
If there's a heaven above, let it be near
If there's a heaven above, in the meantime
Then let it be near, let it be near to me

We've been talking now for a long time
It seems the more we speak the less we seem to say
If there's a hell below in the meantime
Then let us shut up unless we want to pray

He saw everything real too clearly
So close that the bones would show
And to see everything so clearly
Isn't always the best thing you know

If there's a heaven above, in the meantime
If there's a heaven above then let it be near
If there's a heaven above, in the meantime
Let it be near, let it be near to me

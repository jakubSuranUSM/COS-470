The days of the week
Turn the other cheek
They don't care how you treat them
But you and he
Only disagree
And nothing gets forgiven

What do you know about him anymore?
You don't love him

I know that he
Says that we're old friends
But I've only known him fleetingly
He was a friend of a friend
This is how most friendships end
I always thought
You quite liked me

You don't love him
You don't owe him

What Monday woos
Tuesday will lose
And Wednesday caught sight
Of the weekend
The days of the week
Dare to repeat
The one friend
You can depend on

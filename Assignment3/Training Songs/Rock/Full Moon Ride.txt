The moon was bright 
On this mystical night
Our studs were saddled
And their cinches were tight

Yea on every night of the full moon
We rode through the land of our homes

On the full moon ride - on the full moon 
Ride

All night we'd let our stallions run
And we'd mellow out in the light of the sun
We will ride tonight, with evil spirits we'll fight
To protect our land, to protect our kin
They have their full might on this full moon night
But we'll make 'em understand on this land we stand

On the full moon ride - on the full moon ride

On the full moon ride man's spirit is high
And horses were aflame, a wild look in their eyes
On their backs we fly on this full moon ride
With the stars as our guide we are satisfied
Yea on every night of the full moon we rode through
The land of our homes

Yea, let's ride...open plains...
Let em horses run...

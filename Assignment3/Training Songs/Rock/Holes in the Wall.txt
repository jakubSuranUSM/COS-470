There's not enough time 
There's no room in this town 
To try and move 
You've tried me out for now 
Don't kill what's left off 
You never know it's there 
I tried to argue 
But now your skin is bare 
And I could try to make you mine 
But I haven't got the time 
To waste it all 
On someone like you 

Don't kill what's left off 
You never know it's there 
And I tried to argue 
But now your skin is bare 
And I could try to make you mine 
But I haven't got the time 
To waste it all 
On someone like you 

(Ooooh, ooooh) 
And I could try to make you mine 
But I haven't got the time 
To waste it all 
On someone like you 
And I could try to make you mine 
But I haven't got the time 
To waste it all 
On someone like you 

(Ooooh, ooooh)

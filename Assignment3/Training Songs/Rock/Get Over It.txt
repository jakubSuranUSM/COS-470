Turn your cheek, get over it
Lest you speak, get over it
Thoughts you keep, get over it
It's only life so don't get mad
It's not like time is all you had
You got your jaw set in place
It's making lines across your face

I hate to say you're not the sun
The world around is much more fun
I know it hurts to bear the shame
Of people who don't know your name

I know that this is nothing new
You find someone to drag you through
Decieve yourself about your best
Come to find you've failed the test

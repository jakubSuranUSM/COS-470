Here I go now
I'm on the prowl
For plugged in, psyched out
Fuel injected action

I'm gonna hit the lights now
You gotta hear me growl
Burnin' rubber
Total satisfaction

I'm a live wire, yeah okay
Go ahead punk make my day
Look I don't beat clocks
It's a riot on the rocks

Gotta get some kicks now
Gas I devour
Rockin' and rollin' over
I'm the main attraction

I'm a live wire, yeah okay
Go ahead punk make my day
Look I don't beat clocks
It's a riot on the rocks

I'm a live wire, yeah okay
Go ahead punk make my day
Look I don't beat clocks
It's a riot on the rocks

Alright, okay
Right now, oh yeah

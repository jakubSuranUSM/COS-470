One two, one two, one two titty
I know every nook and cranny in New York City
We're Ciccone and that's enough
I'm the royal tuff titty and you gotta taste my love
Taste my love

Yeah

Come on everybody and rock with me
I am the one on the Christmas tree
Now working at the word like a moving storm
Now walking up the stairs and cookin' up the bored
Trippin' everywhere I don't fucking care
Put on some dark eyes and waving goodbye
Yo

Ya
Oooh

Cicc
Ciccone
Ci ci Ciccone
Ci ci ci Ciccone
Ci ci ci ci ci

Oh I'm just so down

Yeah
I know

Gene Simmons is another mother

I know

Ci Ciccone

We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone

I know

Ow

I don't know

Oh

Gotta balance that's jealous that summer on crack made me go
Like a house of the ghetto
Saying all is one and one is two to many

Argh

London f*ck you're pissing me of
Hollywood Amerika-ka-ka
Won't you please let me rock you
I'm just a boy with not much to do
Everybody says there's a cup from above 
You gotta scream, taste my love
Taste my love

Ci ci ci cici ci ci ci Ciconne
Ci ci ci ci ci Ciccone
Ci ci ci ci Ciccone
Yeah we're Ciccone

Ah

Ciccone
Ci Ciccone
Ciccone
Ci Ciccone

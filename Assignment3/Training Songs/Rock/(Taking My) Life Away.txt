They reach beside 
they leech to find 
i dreamed of this so long
this used to feel so strong

Now i wait 
wish these thoughts would go away
i hope i dream of you
cause it's taking my life away
no i don't hate
but these thoughts won't go away
i hope i dream of you
cause it's taking my life away

Deep down it hides
making life a grind
i dreamed of this so long
this used to feel so strong

Now i wait 
wish these thoughts would go away
i hope i dream of you
cause it's taking my life away
no i don't hate
but these thoughts won't go away
i hope i dream of you
cause it's taking my life away

Deep down it hides
(Repeat Chorus)

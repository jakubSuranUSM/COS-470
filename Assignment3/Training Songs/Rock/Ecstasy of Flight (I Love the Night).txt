Come to my door, meet me at midnight,
I can't wait anymore, and after midnight,
We must head for the town,
Keep under cover till dawn,
With a bagful of wine;

The night is alive, look in the shadows,
Because now is the time, out in the shadows,
To be somebody else, complete transformation,
From the someone we are in the day;

I hear a noise, there is something going on,
I hear a voice, there is something going on,
I see the boys, there is something going on,
And something is happening to me, yea;

I love the night, I love the night,
I love the element of danger and the ecstasy of flight,
I love the night, I love the night,
I love to dance with a stranger and to feel her delight,
And when the dancing is through, I kick off my shoes,
And I listen to the beating of my heart

After the fall, then came the hunger,
In the hearts of us all, ooh such a hunger,
That begins after dark, hides in the heart,
Like a wolf that is waiting inside;

I see a light, there is something going on,
It's getting bright, there is something going on,
I look outside, there is something going on,
And someone is calling to me;

I love the night, I love the night,
I love the element of danger and the ecstasy of flight,
I love the night, I love the night,
I love to be with a stranger and to feel her delight,
And when the morning begins, I have to get in,
Before sunlight can fall upon my face;

I love the night, I love the night,
I love the element of danger and the ecstasy of flight,
I love the night, I love the night

Got a new lady, little bit crazy
Never a moment of doubt in my mind
Couldn't forget her, soon as I met her
Knowin' that she was one of a kind

(1)She's the kind of woman
That makes a man feel right
When she starts to lovin'
It's goin' to last all night

I'm feelin' fine, knowin' she's mine
And I have her with me, can't reason why
Knowin' that I could've always been free
I'm feelin' fine, knowin' she's mine

I used to be lonely, wonderin' if only
Someone like you, would happen my way
Ever a dreamer, always a schemer
Tryin' to find, someone who would stay

Now that I found you, waitin' for me
All of my dreams have come true
When I'm beside you, feelin' so free
I just have to tell you

I'm feelin' fine, knowin' you're mine
And you're always near me, can't reason why
Knowin' that I could've alway been free
I'm feelin' fine, knowin' you're mine

Repeat (1)

I'm feelin' fine, knowin' you're mine
And you're always near me, can't reason why
Knowin' that I could've always been free

I'm feelin' fine (feelin' fine)
I'm feelin' fine (feelin' fine)
Oh I'm feelin' fine
Oh oowhoowhoowhoo
Oh I'm feelin' fine
Oh oowhoowhoowhoo (repeat 6 times)

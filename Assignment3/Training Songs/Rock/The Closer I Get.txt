When I said I, would try and be calm
I lied to prove myself wrong

The truth is in the details first
And the writings on the walls
And the closer I get to, being strong
The less to go wrong

When he said times are changing
I thought he meant
Times where changing for the better but they weren't

The truth is in the details first
And the writings on the walls
And the closer I get to, being strong
The less to go wrong

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

They all need you
To make love to
When you awake
You'll find them on the bed
Lying beside you
They all love you
You're a good girl
And are you surprised
When you realize
Which way you're going to

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

If I told you
Where you're going to
You'd laugh in my face
It's not my place
Mind your business
They all want you
To make love to
It's a shame to play the game
The way you've been lied to

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

All right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

You could have been all right
You could have been here tonight
You could have been sweet as wine
You could have been a lady

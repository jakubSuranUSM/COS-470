Pinned by a dream state
You are fearless
And your empty arms
Waiting for no one
You wanted to be wanted

When you're head over heels
In shock
And the little green apples
Falling around you

Party to this party
You are blameless
Ask a question
You get an earful
You are wanted
You are wanted

When you're head over heels
In shock
And the little green apples
Falling around you

When you're head over heels
In shock
And the little green apples
Falling around you

In the darkest room
Where the music's loud
The mouth you're seeking
Finds your mouth
We are wanted we are wanted

When you're head over heels
In shock
And the little green apples
Falling around you

When you're head over heels
In shock
And the little green apples
Falling around you

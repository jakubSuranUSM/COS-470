And so I try to get the way
And I could fill my head with dark clouds any day
I never give anything I own
Now my choice is clear

Hang on to your everyword
Huddle around or leave for good
Hang on your everyword
Fly away

There was a man who wanted more
Had no idea what was in store
He gave away everything he owned
Now his chioce is clear

(repeat chorus)
Now you're still looking down to see
That nothing?s changed

(repeat chorus)
Hang on your everyword
Fly away just like a bird

Hang on to yur everyword
Fly away, fly away
Hang, hang
Hang on your everyword

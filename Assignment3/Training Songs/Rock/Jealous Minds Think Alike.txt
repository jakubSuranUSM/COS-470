I guess now is a good time to tell the truth
The pedigree I carry will swallow you
I am not what you are
Foolish in every way
Inside of you
And they're watching you

Sad sad sight before the so so eyes and they're heavy for the weakest of minds
You got the boys the boys oh so fine oh but I know you're wasting your time
Go
Go

You can the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Oh just imagine what I thought when I opened up that door
There was a million things you want
Oh just imagine what they'll think
When they see me lead you on
And I'll be loosing sleep
No
No

You can the ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

It's so wrong
So wrong
It's so wrong

You can be ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your

You can be ghost in my hall
You can be the smile I don't want
I'll be the fly on your wall
You can be the distance in between
You can be everything I need
You'll be the girl I don't call

Jealous minds think alike
You're a dent in time
I'm wasting all my time
You're only gone

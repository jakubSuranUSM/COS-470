I got this thing in my head, when I awake in my bed
While I was thinking about when I wondered if you thought about me
I’ve got a pain in my heart whenever we are apart
I’ve got a pain in my head when I awake in my bed

And I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me

Ah-ahah ah-ahah ah-ahah
I took the underground, I went eastbound
I went to Walthamstow
While you were waiting to see me there, I really really want you to know
I’ll never forget your kindness (ah ah), I’ll never forget your grace (ah ah)
I’ll never forget your honor (ah ah), you make the world a beautiful place (ah ah)

I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me

Lalalala, lalalala-la, lalalala-la
(Ah-ah-ah) In Walthamstow, in Walthamsto-ow-ow, Walthamsto-ow-ow
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me

Lalalala-la, lalalala-la
Lalalalaa lala, lalalalaa lalalalala
Lalalala, lalalala, lalalala

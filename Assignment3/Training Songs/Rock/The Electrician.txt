Baby its slow
When lights 
Go low
There's no help 
No
Baby its slow 
When lights 
Go low
There's no help 
No
He's
Drilling through
The spiritus sanctus 
Tonight
Through
The dark hip falls 
Screaming
Oh you mambos
Kill me
And 
Kill me 
And 
Kill me 
If I
Jerk the handle 
You'll die
In your dreams 
If I
Jerk the handle 
Jerk the handle 
You'll
Thrill me 
And
Thrill me 
And
Thrill me 
Baby it's slow 
When lights 
Go low
There's no help 
No

Why do you whisper? 
It's true, true lovers whisper 
Or don't say anything at all
The greatest story never told
Both of us are feelin' old
Been feelin' everything
And nothin' much 
Oh, look beyond

Past the cities edge 
Where the horizon dips
And all the strip mall hookers
Show promotion clips
And Life: The Movie
Portrays us working stiffs
Ah, as wastrels on
Watch ourselves again
On some wasted trip
Givin' up on love
Just for the f*ck of it
Oh Life: The Movie
So easy to forget
The angels and aliens, are restless,
Ain't gonna' stay
They're countin' down the days
Till they leave us alone
Can't see them anyway
Electric colors, cut a swath
But leave no trace
Why do we advertise,
That we have lost this race?
If we were proud, we'd hide
But since we've lost 
Watch ourselves again 
Let's call the whole thing off 

Life: The Movie ends 
When the villain says
That he will apprehend
But then rides off instead
Let us drown in peace 
Life: The Movie showin' 
Six and one-half days a week 
Life: The Movie endin'
When they kick us hard 
To make sure we're dead
And not just dreamin'
The truth of our lies 
The thrill of our wrongs 
Are these the last things on earth, 
That still turn us on? 
And in a flash
We'll feel the crash
Don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to laugh 
Look beyond 
Watch ourselves again
Life: The Movie's on 
In every single town
Life: The Movie plays 
'Til we finally beg 
Let us bleed all day 
The last hurrah 
A forecast of our times 
I refuse to fall 
You'll choose ta just go blind 
When Life: The Movie plays 
I'll turn away, I'll put out my eyes

Hello innocence
Though it seems like we've been friends for years
I'm finishing
How I wish I had never begun
Though it should be the last one
And it's dragging me down to my knees
Where I'm begging you please

Let me go
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
'Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I could change and I lied
Well there's something still moves me inside

She's a melody
That I've tried to forget but I can't
It still follows me
When I wake in the dead of the night
And I know that I can't find
That song going round in my head
Like the last things you said

Please don't go
You think I know

[Chorus]

No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back
No I won't come back

One dark morning
She left without a warning
And took the red-eye back to London town

I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now
I'm all over it now

I'm all over it now
And I can't say how glad I am about that
I'm all over it now
'Cause I worked and I cursed and I cried
And I said I would change but I lied
Yeah there's something still moves me inside

I had a soul transplant operation,
Cause my bypass didn't function,
So now I'm keeping on my toes,
Till I see your one man show.

Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic.

Wouldn't it be nice to know,
What the paper doesn't show,
What the TV doesn't say,
And what my hamster's ate today.

Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic.

God! Show me magic,
God! Show me magic,
God! Show me magic,
God! Show me magic.

Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic,
Show me magic.

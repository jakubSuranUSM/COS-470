You always hurt the one you love
I heard it yesterday
'cos you're the one i'm thinking of
In such a special way
Even in my wildest dream
i never thought this could come true
Want to touch you, want to hold you
Want to give my life away
I cut my skin to break your fall
I hate the things you say
My arms around you put me down
In such a special way
Want to touch you, want to hold you
Want to kiss my life away
Only dreaming in your side
Only dreaming, only dreaming
If love is sweet, then i am thorn
By every move you make
I lose my grip as i have found 
By this our last mistake
Even in my wildest dream
I never thought this could com true
Want to touch you, want to hold you
Want to give my life away

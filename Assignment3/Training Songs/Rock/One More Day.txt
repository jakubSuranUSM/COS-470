We would like for you to help us welcome a very distinguished speaker
He hails from the DPG
Would you please stand and welcome the one, the only
OG Nate Dogg

Now I was about eight when I caught my first case
My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace
Now I didn't do a thing, I was just standing by
Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die

Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught
While walkin to the cornerstore a big mistake was made
My big homey I was walkin with decided he needed to get paid

So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store
He said "Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more"
Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke
What I'm sayin I ain't playin, it was funny til that nigga got smoked

Can you guess who that could've been quite easily?
but it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see

[Chorus]
One more day, one more
One more day
One more day, one more
One more day

One more day, I'm hangin around so I can see
little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy
Everyday I'm sellin big dope, it's all that I know
I ain't workin and I got a baby so don't axe me what for

One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me
I gotta another story about the penitentiary
One more day, see while I was servin cavi I forgot to think
Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see

Now remember I'm sellin big dope but I'm packin my thangs
and every corner police watchin, I ain't crazy

[Chorus until fade]

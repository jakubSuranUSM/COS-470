There's no believing and no reason why
Well I'm superstitious and I can fly

I float through the ceiling
And into (the sky/your eyes)
Call me what you like
I just want to be there with you all the time
Do you want to be here with me?
All the time

There's no believing and no real surprise
Well I am a ghost here, appearing in the night

To float through the ceiling
And into your eyes
Call me what you like
I just want to be there with you all the time
Do you want to be here with me?
All the time

(Whoa)

I float through the ceiling
And into your eyes
Call me what you like
I just want to be there with you all the time
Do you want to be here with me?

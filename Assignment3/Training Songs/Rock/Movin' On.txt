Get up in the morning and it's just another day
Pack up my belongings I got to get away
Jump into a taxi and the time is getting tight
I got to keep a moving I got a show tonight

And I'm moving on, moving on from town to town
Moving on baby never see the dirt in the ground

I check in to the ticket desk a half an hour to go
Heading for the boarding gate I'm feeling kind of low
Fifteen minutes later I'm sitting on my plane
Fasten my safety belt I'm taking off again

And I'm moving on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on baby hey I'm never touching the ground

Moving on moving on from town to town
Movin' on I can't seem to stop now
Movin' on I never seem to slow down

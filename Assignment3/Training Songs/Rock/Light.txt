I can see the light between my and my mind
I can feel memories fall behind
And the light is growing brighter now
And the light is growing brighter now

I see the future is less and less there
And the past has vanished in the air
And I'm left and I'm now with a wondrous glow
I think I'm still me
But how would you know?

It a takes a few moments of whirling around
Before your feet finally leave the ground
And fending off fears and hearing the call
And finally waiting for nothing at all
And the light is growing brighter now
And the light is growing brighter now

Obstacles are stepping stones
That guide us to our goals
Fences are filters
That purify our souls

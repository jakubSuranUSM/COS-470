You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice maybe
But you didn’t listen

And you played dead, but you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissing

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
Cos it was us baby, way before then
And we’re still together

And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you
I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Cos it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you
I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
Cos it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
Cos it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

Through the storms and the lie
Baby, you stood by my side
And life is wine

But there are days in this life
When you see the teeth marks of time
Two lovers divide

Sound meets sound, babe
Her echoes, they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow?

Babe, it's time we gave something new a try
All alone we may fight, so just let us be free

And, baby, tonight
I see your lips are on fire
And life is wine

Now the windows are open, the moon is so bright
There's no one who can tell us
What love brings for you and I

Sound meets sound, babe
The echoes, they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow?

Babe, it's time we give something new a try
All alone we may fight, so just let us be free tonight

Through the storms and the lie
Baby, you stood by my side
And life is wine

You feel the sweet breath of time
It's whispering its truth, not mine
There's no "I" in threesome

And I am all for it!
Babe, it's time we give something new a try
All alone we may fight, and feathers bend like trees in the moonlight

Babe, it's time we give something new a try
All alone we may fight, so just let us be free tonight

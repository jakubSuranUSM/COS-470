Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)
Tape holds things that cannot stick
And keep leftovers in the fridge
While lessons learned go down the drain
I can't believe in everything
All the bad names gone
And the good ones were all wrong

And so I stayed up all night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking about tomorrow won't change how
I feel today

Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)

Never let your mark erase
'cause broken legs can be replaced
Two steps to the finish line
Three sips till I finish mine
A straw will always suck it out
Close your eyes and use your mouth
And tell me about your song

And so I stayed up night
Slept in all day
This is my sound
Thinking about tomorrow won't change how
I feel today

Da da da-da-da-da, da da da
Da da da-da-da-da
(repeat)

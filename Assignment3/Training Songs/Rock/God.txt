God knows I'm helpless to speak on my own behalf
God is as helpless as me caught in the negatives
We all just do as we please false transmissions
I hope god forgives me for my transgressions

It's what you want to know no consequences
It's what you need to fucking bleed
It's all too much god knows I'm helpless

God know I'm restless and weak and full of piss and vinegar
God knows we sow what we reap in the dirt of grandeur
When the darkness comes to me and fixes its gaze on me
God knows I'm helpless

It's what you want to know no consequences
It's what you need to fucking bleed
It's all too much god knows I'm helpless

You break you're back for what you can't have
You can't turn back
God knows I'm helpless

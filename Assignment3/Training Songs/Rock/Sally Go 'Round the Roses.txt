Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses
And all the roses they can hurt you
And all the roses they can hurt you
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Cause saddest thing in the whole wide world
See you baby with another girl
Sally go round the roses
Sally go round the roses
And all the roses they can hurt you
And all the roses they can hurt you
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Cause saddest thing in the whole wide world
See you baby with another girl

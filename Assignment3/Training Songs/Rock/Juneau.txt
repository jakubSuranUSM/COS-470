Tied to the testing of wills
And my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky
In your arms I'm defined

Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm thrown in the eyes of your foolishness

Was this what I'm meant for
No longer interesting
Fall forward to even the score
Just a thought to you

Tied to the testing of wills
When my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky
In your arms I'm defined

Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm thrown in the eyes of your foolishness

And I'm nothing more than a line in your book [Repeat x4]
In your book [Repeat x3]

Was this what I'm meant for
No longer interesting
Fall forward to even the score
Just a thought to you

Just a thought to you
Just a thought to you

And I'm nothing more
Yeah I'm nothing more
Than a line in your book
Yeah I'm nothing more
Than a line in your book

With your love here beside me 
Here to guide me, how can I go wrong? 

Doo, doo, doo, doo, he sent you on to me 
'Cause you were meant for me 
I know you'll always be my real destiny. 

The touch of your soft hands 
The kiss from your sweet lips 
Will meet my fingertips 

With your love 
I know there'll never be 
Another love for me 
Happiness eternally 
With your love 

With your love beside me 
Here to guide me, how can I go wrong 
With your love, with your love, with your love

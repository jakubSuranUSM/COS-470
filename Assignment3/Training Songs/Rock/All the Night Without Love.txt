We walked the aisles aimlessly
With our kills painlessly
And we go all the night without love
In the darkened lonely corners
Where we place our drive-through orders
And we go all the night without love
Without love

"Touch me" the graphic reads
On the magnetic athletic insole
She lets it go all its life without life
And can you imagine going to
“Got milk? dot com”
Do you go all the night without love
Without love

Well I once caused your cells to shimmer
And you once caused my cells to shimmer
Now we go all the night without love
Without love…

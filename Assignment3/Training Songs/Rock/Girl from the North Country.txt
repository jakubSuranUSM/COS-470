If you go in the north country far
Where the winds beat heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

If you go when the snowflakes storm
Where the rivers freeze as the summer ends
Please see that she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling wind

Please see that her hair hangs long
It rolls, flows all down her dress
Please see for me that her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've hoped and prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the the brightness of my day

If you're travellin' in the north the north country far
Where the winds beat heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

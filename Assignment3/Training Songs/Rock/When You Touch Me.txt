Projections under your black rims will hide you from the sun
And conscience keep you from the fact and the piece of mind you won
But bad news and paying dues leaves space for everyone
But bad news and paying dues leaves space for everyone

And I feel free when you touch me
I feel free when you touch me
I feel free when you touch me
Never ever felt this high

I can feel it baby I can feel it
And it's taking my mind away
My knees are knocking
My head is rocking
My heart's been shaking all the way
When you touch me

Now you're up inside the dark clouds
And the sunshine being there
Relax and let the sparkle in
To hide you from the wear

And water tangled gardens that are hidden in your hair
And water tangled gardens that are hidden in your hair

And I feel free when you touch me
I feel free when you touch me
I feel free when you touch me
Never ever felt this high

I can feel it baby I can feel it
And it's taking my mind away
My knees are knocking
My head is rocking
My heart's been shaking all the way
When you touch me

My my my my my my
I can feel it I can feel it
And it's taking my mind way
My knees are knocking
My head is rocking
My heart's been shaking all the way
When you touch me

My my my my my my...

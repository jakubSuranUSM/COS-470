Driving in the country
I passed her home
Her room was filled with a warm light glow
I was singin' into the darkness
Moonlight thick as mud
There was no way she could understand
It was a roaring in the blood

I watched her on the screen
It felt like she was watching me
I was consumed
I told her there was nothing that I wouldn't do
And then she came and burned it all away

We don't know what it's like to be hunted
We don't know what it's like to be wanted too much
They're not like us

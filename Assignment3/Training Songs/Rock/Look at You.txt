Look at you, man, look at the band
Look at the day, donÂ´t throw it away
I need a pill and a coffee re-fill
And everything is gonna be alright
I swear

Look at your cat and your eighty square flat
Look at your view over StockholmÂ´s Zoo
Maybe youÂ´re wrong but maybe IÂ´m right
'Cause I guess IÂ´m born black and white

You know you could be a rock nÂ´ roll star
No matter who you are
ItÂ´s all the same
'Cause youÂ´re a real dead end

ThatÂ´s what you are
Believe IÂ´m gonna have myself a ball
And I donÂ´t care if you donÂ´t like
How I act when IÂ´m on top of your wife
IÂ´m going down, IÂ´m running up
IÂ´m walking zig-zag and IÂ´m tripping too much
So hold your fire, IÂ´m coming through
IÂ´ve gotta kill another bottle of doom

Now everybody want to dance with you
I cannot dance 'cause my boots are stuck with glue
Everybody want to talk too much
But all I want is you

Look at your amount on your credit card account
A billion dollar tour but I just go for
Heads up, legs up, stay-ups, f*ck-ups
'Cause everything is gonna be alright, right
Well, I said, right, right, right

ThatÂ´s what you are

ThatÂ´s what you are
Believe IÂ´m gonna have myself a ball
And I donÂ´t care if you donÂ´t like
How I act when IÂ´m on top of your wife
IÂ´m going down, IÂ´m running up
IÂ´m walking zig-zag and IÂ´m tripping too much
So hold your fire, IÂ´m coming through
IÂ´ve gotta kill another bottle of doom

IÂ´m going down, IÂ´m running up
IÂ´m walking zig-zag and IÂ´m tripping too much
So hold your fire, IÂ´m coming through
IÂ´ve gotta kill another bottle of doom

Now everybody want to dance with you
I cannot dance 'cause my boots are stuck with glue
Everybody want to talk too much
But all I want is you
Yeah, all I want is you
So why canÂ´t I have you

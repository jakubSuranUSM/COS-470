If the Big Boy comes tomorrow
There'll be no more teardrops
There'll be no more sorrow
If the Big Boy comes tomorrow
Will he take you with Him?

Have you been good?
Have you been bad?
If you haven't lived the way you should
You'll wish you had

When the Big Boy brings his fiery furnace
Will He like what he sees
Or will he strike the fire and burn us?
Oh, He's so great
And He's so straight
And you know he's watching

Have you been good?
Have you been bad?
If you haven't lived the way you should
You'll wish you had

Come on, Big Boy
Come and save us

Come and look at what we've done
With what you gave us
Now I've heard it said 
That our Big Boy's dead
But I think He's hiding
I think He's hiding
I think He's hiding

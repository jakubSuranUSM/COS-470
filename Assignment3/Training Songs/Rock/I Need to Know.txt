Well the talk on the street 
Says you might go solo 
A good friend of mine 
Saw you leavin' by the back door 

I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 
If you think you're gonna leave 
Then you better say so 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 
Because I don't know how long 
I can hold on 
And if your makin' me wait 
If you're leadin' me on 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 

Who woulda thought 
That you'd fall for his line 
All of a sudden it's 
Me on the outside 

I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 
If you think you're gonna leave 
Then you better say so 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 
Because I don't know how long 
I can hold on 
And if your makin' me wait 
If you're leadin' me on 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 

I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know) 
If you think you're gonna leave 
Then you better say so 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know( I need to know) 
Because I don't know how long 
I can hold on 
And if your makin' me wait 
If you're leadin' me on 
I need to know(I need to know) 
I need to know(I need to know)

I'm navigating my way down freedom's road
Trying to make my way back home
I got my foot to the floor
But she must need bleeding
This car just don't want to roll
Freedom's road must be under construction
Sometimes you wonder what kind of freedom they're talking
If you're here looking for the devil
You'll find him on freedom's road

Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you want to take a ride
Well you've got to pay the toll
Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you're looking for the devil
He's out there on freedom's road

Sometimes there's rape sometimes there'll be murder
Sometimes just darkness everywhere
No passing signs and barbed wire fences
Misinformation but no one cares
Freedom's road can get narrow
No one wants to know you
If there's no pork in your barrel
If you're here looking for the devil
He's out there on freedom's road

Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you want to take a ride
Well you've got to pay the toll
Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you're looking for the devil
He's out there on freedom's road

You can drop your bombs
You can beat the people senseless
But that won't get you anywhere
Hide your agendas behind public consensus
And say that this world just ain't fair
Freedom's road is a promise to the people
You'll never fool us now
With all your lying and cheating
If you're here wanting a crown in heaven
It's out there on freedom's road

Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you want to take a ride
Well you've got to pay the toll
Freedom's road, freedom's road
If you're looking for the devil
He's out there on freedom's road

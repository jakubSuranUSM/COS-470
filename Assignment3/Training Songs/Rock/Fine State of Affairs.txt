When I had my wheels in motion 
Never did you think of me 
Fine thing, fine state of affairs... 
If I had my mind in motion 
Never would I think of you 
'Cause it's my fate, fine state of affairs 
No one cares, no, no 

You're not supposed to want nobody 
Not supposed to need nobody 
(Nobody... Nobody cares) 
You're not supposed to touch nobody 
(Nobody cares) 
Don't you dare go love nobody 

Ooh I miss the real exciters 
Anything with anyone 
Such a fine thing, fine state of affairs... ooh yeah 
Lining up for fast one-nighters 
When the final show was done 
Such a fine thing, fine state of affairs 
No one cares, no, no 

You're not supposed to touch nobody 
(Nobody cares) 
Not supposed to love nobody 

Fine state, state of affairs 
Fine state, state of affairs

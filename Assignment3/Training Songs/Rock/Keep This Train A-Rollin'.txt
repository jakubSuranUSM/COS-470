Back when I had a little 
I thought that I needed a lot 
A little was over rated
But a lot was a little too complicated 
You see, zero didn't satisfy me 
A million didn't make me happy 
That's when I learned the lesson 
That it's all about your perceptions
Hey, are you a pauper or a superstar?
So you act, so you feel, so you are 
It ain't about the size of your car 
It's about the size of the faith in your heart 

[Chorus]
There's hope 
It doesn't cost a thing to smile 
You don't have to pay to laugh 
You better thank God for that
There's hope 
It doesn't cost a thing to smile 
You don't have to pay to laugh 
You better thank God for that
There's hope 

Off in the back country of Brazil 
A met a young brother that made me feel 
That I could accomplish anything
(You see, just like me, he wanted to sing)
(He had) no windows and no doors 
He lived a simple life and was extremely poor 
On top of all of that, he had no eyesight
(But that didn't keep him from seein' the light)
(He said) what's it like in the USA?
And all I did was complain 
(He said) living here is paradise
He taught me paradise is in your mind; you know that...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Every time I turn on the T.V. (There's hope) 
Somebody's acting crazy (There's hope) 
If you let it, it'll drive you crazy (There's hope) 
But I'm takin' back my power today (There's hope) 
Gas prices - they just keep on rising (There's hope) 
The government - they keep on lying 
But we gotta keep on surviving 
Keep living our truth and do the best we can do 

'Cause there's hope 
It doesn't cost a thing to smile 
You don't have to pay to laugh 
You better thank God for that, yeah, yeah
There's hope 
It doesn't cost a thing to smile 
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that
There's hope

Stand up for your rights 
Keep shining your light 
And show the world your smile

Stand up for your rights 
Keep shining your light 
And show the world your smile

[Chorus]

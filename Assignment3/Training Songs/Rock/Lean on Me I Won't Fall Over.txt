One of these days you'll get away from London town
Causing chaos and delay on the underground
I'll read your letter as I pass away the time
Stuck in a tunnel on the Hammersmith and City line

I'll hurry home a little bored but still alive
Unplug the phone to keep the outside world outside
I'll take some aspirin then I'll take myself to bed
You'll be gone and you'll be dead
All because I never said,

Lean on me I won't fall over
I'm made of steel and stone cold sober
If you feel the need come over
Lean on me I won't fall over

You're off the wagon you were never really on
Chasing the dragon like you're Saint fucking George or someone
Stop punching walls don't cut yourself
Shift some burden onto somebody else

Lean on me I won't fall over
I'm made of steel and stone cold sober
If you feel the need come over
Lean on me I won't fall over

Am I made of wood am I too arrogant?
To be the last of the good samaritans?
Stop punching walls don't cut yourself
Try shifting some burden onto someone else
Don't give up hope if you think you can't cope
We should keep in touch if it gets too much
Have faith in yourself for the sake of your health
Stop sniffing glue try something new
Confide inyour friends you'll get by in the end
If nothing else works have you tried the church?

I didn't want to be so dozy darling
I should have promised you a rosy garden
And told you life is sweet, stick around and enjoy it
Flush that stupid nonsense down the toilet
And lean on me
I waon' fall over

Broken glass from the window shattered yesterday
Deep inside I feel the same
All the while reflections of the one that went away
Shine off these pale four walls

Dissonance is the only song I want to sing
I would pray if I knew that you were listening

Don't walk away, don't walk away
I surrender to you today
This bended knee is breaking me
I'll surrender, I'll surrender

Staring down on pages of saltwater memories
Emotions etched from the heart
But that was bled so dry, there's nothing left to find
But the ashes of my, of my, of my soul

Don't walk away, don't walk away
I surrender to you today
This bended knee is breaking me
I'll surrender

I'll surrender, will be better
This is my vow to change

It stands to reason that some things were never meant to be
I should have known from the start
The race has been run and all is said and done
Ashes have been swept away

Don't walk away, don't walk away
I surrender to you today
This bended knee is breaking me
So I'll surrender, I'll surrender

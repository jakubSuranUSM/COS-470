Walking through that door
Outside we came nowhere at all
Perhaps the answers here
Not there anymore

Then in our hearts the light broke through
A path lost for years is there in view

House of four doors
You'll be lost now forever
House of four doors
Rest of life's life forever

House of four doors
You'll be lost now forever
House of four doors

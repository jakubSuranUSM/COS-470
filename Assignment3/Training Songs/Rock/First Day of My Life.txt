Feel like I'm stoned
Want to be alone, just for a while, unknown
Weeks on the road a long way from home
Just shut off the phone

And you say I'll heal you, 
I'll always be yours
And you say I'll kill you, if I do something wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still fells like the first day of my life

Remember the times
Together we swore, never give up this life
Still hanging on, still going strong
Here I belong

And maybe I'm crazy
But I just can't slow down
And maybe I'm crazy 

But at least I'm still around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still fells like the first day of my life

Feels like the first day of my life, 
(feels like the first day)
Still feels like the first day of my life

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still feels like the first day of my...
Still feels like the first day of my...
Still feels like the first day of my life

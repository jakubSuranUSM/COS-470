Oh, hold on
You risk exciting me
Once in Germany someone said nein
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

Oh, hold back
Oh, don't invite me
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Once in Germany someone said nein

I'm a wheel
I will
Turn on you

Oh, I invented a sister
Populated with knives
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

I'm a wheel
I will 
Turn on you

Um...

I'm a wheel
I will

I'm a wheel
I will

I'm a wheel
I will
Turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you
Turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

I'm gonna turn on you, turn on you, turn on you

Well, there's gonna be a Freakers Ball,
Yes, yes, tonight at the Freakers Hall,
Yeah and you know that you're invited,
One and all.

c'mon babies… grease your lips…
Put on your hats, and swing your hips.
Don't forget to bring your whips.
We're goin' to the Freakers Ball.

Blow your whistle…bang your gong --
Roll up somethin' to take along.
Feels so good… it must be wrong –
Freakin' at the Freakers Ball.

All the fags and dikes, they're boogyin' together --
Leather freaks dressed in all kinds of leather.
The greatest of the Sadists and the Masochists, too,
Screamin' "Please hit me" and "I'll hit you".

F.B.I. dancin' with the junkies –
All the Straights swingin' with the Funkies
'Cross the floor and up the wall
Freakin' at the Freakers Ball.

Everybody is lovin' each other --
Brother with sister… son with mother.
Smear my body up with butter,
And take me to the Freakers Ball.

So pass that roach and pour the wine --
I'll kiss yours and you'll kiss mine.
I'm gonna boogie til I go blind --
Freakin' at the Freakers Ball.

Black ones, white ones, yellow and red ones --
Necropheliacs lookin' for dead ones.
The greatest of the Sadists and the Masochists, too --
Screaming' "Please hit me" and "I'll hit you".

Everybody ballin' in batches --
Pyromaniacs strikin' matches.
I'm gonna itch me where it scratches --
Freakin' at the Freakers Ball, y'all
Freakin' at the Freakers Ball.

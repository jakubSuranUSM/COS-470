Ego is beast
Ego is evil
But ego knows best
At least she says so
I am one
And i am all
But sometimes
I am nothing
And you know you know my little insecurities
Like someday
I may fade away
I can't find my way to heaven
I can't find my way to heaven
Who's at you your dark door
Calling my name
And who walks on these floors
Who walks on these floors
Who's at the back door
Calling my name
Pass the red light
Pass the red light
Red light
Ego is beast
Ego is evil

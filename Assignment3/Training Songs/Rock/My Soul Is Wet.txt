My soul is wet
And I can feel your pain
My soul is wet
And I can see your shame
My soul is wet
You don't know my name
My soul is wet
But I own my shame
My soul is wet
I don't like to change
My soul is wet
But I can rearrange
My soul is wet
Don't ask my name
My soul is wet
To die
To cry
You
Beat me down [x2]

My soul is wet
And I can feel your pain
My soul is wet
And I can see your pain
My soul is wet
You don't know my name
My soul is wet
I own my shame
My soul is wet
I don't like to change
My soul is wet
But I can rearrange
My soul is wet
Don't ask my name

My soul is wet
To die
To cry
You
Beat me till I cry
Till I die
Till I can't stand up
You won't beat me no more
Beat in a corner
Far away
I can't ask for no more

Slip away, your vanity is gone, I'm falling out of place
We all fall down, the pain goes on
We bear through the war and turn the lost away
We all fall down, the pain goes on

And I'll be the fire that dries the flood

As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated

Stripped away, we rise above it all, forgotten and betrayed
We all fall down, the pain goes on
No better than before, still broken and afraid
We all fall down, the pain goes on

And I'll be the cloud that hides the sun

As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated

I'm falling to pieces, (Pained and used)
I know what I needed, it's not you
It's not you

As I fight for one last prayer, I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down, I will stand alone
No longer defeated

No longer defeated
No longer defeated

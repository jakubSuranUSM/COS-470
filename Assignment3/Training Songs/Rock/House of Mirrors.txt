Faces in the hallway
Cracks up in the ceiling
Shadows coming my way
In your house of stolen mirrors

Echoes in the alleyway
Footsteps in the hall
In this house of stolen mirrors
In your house of stolen mirrors

And it's time for me to come and stay
Now it's time for me to find a way
And it's time for me to come and stay
In the house of mirrors

Echoes in the alleyway
Footsteps on the floor
I never thought I'd see the day
At this house of stolen mirrors
Is there anybody out there
I saw it coming my way

But this house is full of mirrors
In this house of many mirrors
It's time for you to come and stay
And it's time for you to find a way

Every room and every hall
Seen your face
It's time for me to come and stay
In the house of mirrors

Have seen us

Faces in the hallway
(faces in the hallway)
Shadows on the ceiling
(shadows on the ceiling)
The ship ? is coming my way
In this house of stolen mirrors

Echoes in the alleyway
Footsteps in the hall
Now love is coming my way
In this house of many mirrors

Every room in every hall has seen your face
Now it's time for me to come and stay
In the house of mirrors.

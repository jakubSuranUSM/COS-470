Hide your feelings
Hide from the postman
Or the night spent falling down
In the night
In Butcher town
The night spent crawling like a snail
On Black Velvet.

Found me a language
That talks without blackmail
Without words
I called for you
Without words
I called for you
And you answered like a kiss
On Black Velvet.

Bring me the sunshine
Bring me the ocean
To its knees
The ocean fell to its knees
And we walked softly
Like snow so silent under foot
Or Black Velvet

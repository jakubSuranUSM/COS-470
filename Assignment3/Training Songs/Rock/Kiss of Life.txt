Oh, yeah
Why can't I be like you?
Flying so high as a kite
Never knowing what you do it for

When you are young
No one tells you anything
They just hope you don't make the same mistake and become
Just like them

Oh, I would wait a thousand years
I'd roll a thousand stars
I'd wait until the sun eclipsed the moon
Oh, I would give the kiss of life

If only you would say
Oh, come live with me and love me
And, I will surely stay
I will stay

Oh, why can't I be like you?
Always so wrong, but so right
Never knowing what you'd do it for
For you are young, no one tells you anything

I just hope you don't make the same mistakes and become
Just like them
And, I would wait a thousand years
I'd roll a thousand stars

I'd wait until the sun eclipsed the moon
Then, I would give the kiss of life
If only you would say
Come lay with me and love me

And, I would surely stay, I will stay
(What are you wondering?)
(What are you hungry for?)
(Why do you worry?)

Oh, I will wait a thousand years
To share my world with you
I'll wait until the sun should kiss the sky
Oh, I would give the kiss of life

If only you would say
Oh, come lay with me and love me
Ah, tell me that you'll stay, I'll stay
Tell me you'll stay, tell me you'll stay

Say you'll you'll stay
(What are you wondering?)
(What you hungry for?)
(Why do you worry?)

(What are you waiting for?)
I would give
I would give
I would give you the stars

Till the moon is lovers own
I will follow wherever you are
(My kiss for your dreams)
Oh, I would give the kiss of life

If only you would stay
Come lay with me and love me
And I will surely stay, I will stay

Ooh! wrawgh! huh!
Down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around on a real O-mind
Seein' pretty things

ain't no walls
Seein' pretty things
ain't no walls

No walls!
No walls!
No walls!
No walls!

Yea, deep in the night I'm lost in love
Yea, deep in the night I'm lost in love
Thousand lights look at you
Thousand lights look at you

At you!
At you!
At you!

Yeah, at you! Come on! Pow-pow-pow!
Yeah! 
Yeah! 

Brrhhhhhuh! huh! huh huh!!
Ooh-no oh-no oh-no no-no-no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no

Faces shine
Real O-mind
Real O-mind

I'm the real O-mind
Real O-mind

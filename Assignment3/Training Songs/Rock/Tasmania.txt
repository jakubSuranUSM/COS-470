Hey, ain't you clever to be loaded in?
Pursed lips and exploded
I heard a click and noted, I froze and floated
Just to check in how my gums have eroded
You didn't look like you were joking
When you said you're into choking
Well, I guess if we're not smoking
Then you gotta get your kicks
Well, I gave what I had to give, with forty-eight hours in Tel-Aviv
Seems these kids just wanna live and let live
So take my love and get your kicks with it

I might, I might go shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes
And paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who knows?

Good luck with the service
I know you don't deserve this
By the time I've heard this,â€‹ I'll be far, far
Just another antipodean
But to Americans, I'm an alien
Dyed his hair again
How could I know where I've been
When I don't know who I am?

I might, I might go shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes
And paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who knows?

I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe real air again
I wanna go back, wanna go back
I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe

I left my phone in Sydney
'Cause all the stress outdid me
Should I be worried 'bout my kidney or worried 'bout war?

Well, I'll Be Doggone if I would work all day
And I'll Be Doggone if I would bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around,
blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone 
Hey, Hey!  I'd be long gone.
Then I wouldn't be doggone (Baby!)
I'd be long gone. mm mm
Now, hey, hey, hey!
 
I'll be Doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be Doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred year old,
if you ever let that spring turn cold
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey, Hey!  I'd be long gone.
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone (Baby)
I'd be long gone.  mm mm
Now, did you hear me?
Well, now, what I say oh, believe me.
 
Well, ev'ry woman should try to be whatever her man wants her to be.
And I don't want much, all I want from you is for you to be true to me.
 
I'll be Doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll Be Doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could, 
if I ever found out that you're no good 
Then I wouldn't be doggone 
Well, I wouldn't be doggone (Baby!)
I'd be long gone.
I wouldn't be doggone 
(gonna catch me a train)
Naw, baby, I wouldn't be doggone
I wouldn't be doggone 
(gonna catch me a plane)

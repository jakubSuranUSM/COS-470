Oh well here she comes now oh I'm on the run now
Pretending just pretending that I don't see her
Just to teach her but darling how much longer
Can I keep on living this lie

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me

She means nothing to me no more
Oh she's my world oh not just some girl
Harder it's getting harder to fool anyone
Not just her but I act like a man

She'd expect me to
No tears win her respect
Who am I fooling if I can't fool me
Who believes what their eyes don't see

But I keep on lying
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird

Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
All my dreams are depending on her
And how good I am at pretending that

She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me

She means nothing to me no more
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird

Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)

I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more

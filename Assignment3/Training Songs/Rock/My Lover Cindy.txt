If I was a liar, I would call you my friend
Let's hope the feeling's mutual in the end
Symbiosis, can we keep it how it was?
Now the levy is broken
I want more

'Cause I'm a greedy pig
I'm gonna get my fill
I'm gonna keep my eyes on the prize
And I'll suck you dry, I will

I'm no pariah, but I'll try to pretend
I hope you keep your distance now and then
Same prognosis, it was fated from the start
We could be together, take my heart

But I'm a lousy lover, even if I try
I can go for a couple of weeks and the feeling's calcified

And it burns away my mind
(I don't know why, I don't know why, but I like you)

'Cause I'm a greedy pig
I'm gonna get my fill
I'm gonna keep my eyes on the prize
And I'll suck you dry, I will

'Cause I'm a fucking pig
I'm gonna get my fill
I'm gonna keep my eyes on the prize
And I'll suck you dry, I will

Oh, I will

I gave her the means, she had the will
I kept on pushin', for the kill
I never thought, she'd finish me
As she shot me down and left me to bleed
With my gun (x6)
Mmmmmm

Open my eyes, my body cold
It shouldn't end this way, I want to grow old
Scramble to my feet and stumbled home
I forgave my girl, I don't want to be alone
She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling 'cause she won
But one day I'll get back
My gun (x6)
Yeah

She took me back and stitched me up
The whole time smiling 'cause she won
But one day I'll get back
My gun (x6)
But one day I'll get back
My gun (x6)

The pressure’s all I’m feelin’
It’s the air in the street
Somewhere I’m dealin’
I’ve got to be discrete
I’m dreamin’ up a number
And when you hear the sound
Y’all know that I’m feelin’
Feelin’ of comin’ around

Comin’ around to see ya
I couldn’t let you down
If I can’t go out and see ya
I’ll get there underground

You know you got what I want
And I’ve got what you need
We should be keepin’ ourselves inside
There’s heat in the street

The street is made of fire
I will not get burnt
Why wait to retire
To get what I have earned
I’m stayin’ undercover
Till the time to meet
Not today maybe tomorrow
Cause there’s heat in the street

I can take it people
Because I’ve found the shade
I travel incognito
That’s part of the price I pay

You know you got what I want
And I’ve got what you need
We should be keepin’ ourselves inside
There’s heat in the street

The temperature is climbin’
And the air is thick
Can’t affect my timin’
I’ve been movin’ quick
I won’t be made a fool of
You’d better take a seat
I’ve just gotta cool off
Cool off the heat in the street

Comin’ around to see ya
I couldn’t let you down
If I can’t go out and see ya
I’ll get there underground

You know you got what I want
And I’ve got what you need
We should be keepin’ ourselves outside
Forget about the heat in the street

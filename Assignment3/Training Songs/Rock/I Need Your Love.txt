Can't help this feeling
Can't help this feeling

I can't believe it's open for discussion
We've said our goodbyes
I've been a fool not to see the repercussions
You've had in my life
I'm at the point of no return
I've finally crossed the line
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
'Cause I can't stand to see you stay behind

[Chorus]
I need your love
I want you every way
I need your love
Can't help this feeling coming back everyday

I stayed around hoping you'd discover
How much there was to lose
I spelled it out, I led you to the water
But you're too blind to choose
I gave it everything and more to make it
I've waited for so long
I saw the chance to run and had to take it
But something's missing and I know it's wrong

[Chorus]

I've passed the point of no return
And all the tears have dried
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
'Cause I keep wishing I was on your side

I need your love
I want you every way
And I need your love
Can't help this feeling

[Chorus]

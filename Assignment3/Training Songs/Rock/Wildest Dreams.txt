In my wildest dreams
Oh, in my wildest dreams
Anything can happen
When I close my eyes
I can take you with me
Should I wait for you tonight
Oh
In my wildest dreams

Where do you go
And what do you see
Who do you touch
And how does it feel
In your wildest dreams

In my wildest dreams

Are you in my future
Or someone from my past
I wake up with this feeling
That I've been with you at last
Oh
In my wildest dreams

Where do you go
And what do you see
Who do you touch
And how does it feel
In your wildest dreams

Where do you go
And what do you see
Who do you touch
And how does it feel
In your wildest dreams

Oh oh

Where do you go
And what do you see
Who do you touch
And how does it feel
In your wildest dreams

Where do you go
And what do you see
Who do you touch
And how does it feel
In your wildest dreams

In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams
In my wildest dreams

Unholy passion, I feel for you
Unholy passion, I feel for you
This thing that hangs down my leg
I feel for you

I know
It's unholy
It's a garden and a death of soul
It's unholy
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'

When a body is set ablaze
We supplely snake on by
Pray before my years we gonna do it (here come the fury?)
'Cause the burning is a hip of yours

I know
It's unholy
It's a garden and a death of soul
It's unholy

Unholy passion, I feel for you
Dreadful emotion, that comes from here
This thing that hangs down my leg
I feel for you

I know
It's unholy
Sinful garden and a sinful tongue
It's unholy
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'
Unholy burnin'

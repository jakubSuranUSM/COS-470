From the Albums:
* Prisoner of the night
* 2nd Live

Shortcomings I can't explain
Of body and brain
I feel I'm caught in inside a bubble
I suggest we're in trouble
Let's be optimistic - pessimistic makes me sick
C'mon optimistic - get up - make it big
I can't fight cause I'm a prisoner of the night
I can't fight cause I'm a prisoner of the
Mean wheel prisoner of the night
Big deal for a prisoner of the night
Runnin' real prisoner of the night
Escape - when daylight strikes - yeah
And you won't come down no more

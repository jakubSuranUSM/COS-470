You went away and left me
'Cause you thought
You could hurt me
But I got news for you

I'm still strong
And you are wrong
To think you'd leave
And I'd turn blue

Everything's the same
There ain't nothing changed
The sun still shines
And the rain still rains

And I'm still me and
You're still you, too, you see
Everything's the same
There ain't nothing changed

Since you've been gone
I still do what I do
No, I haven't changed
My habits a bit

I still eat, I still sleep
I still go to work
And when my workday's done, I git

Everything's the same
(Everything's the same)
There ain't nothing changed
(Ain't nothing changed)
The sun still shines
(The sun still shines)
And the rain still rains

And I'm still me and
You're still you, too, you see
Everything's the same
Honey, nothing's changed

Everything's the same
(Everything's the same)
There ain't nothing changed
(Ain't nothing changed)
The sun still shines
(The sun still shines)
And the rain still rains

Too much too soon, sure was sweet
Foreign cars soft leather seats
Foreign prices can't compete
We can't go back, were in too deep

Man overboard
For rich or poor
They all want more
We've gone too far, man overboard

Man overboard
You can't ignore
It's so hard core
We've gone too far, man overboard

Man get laid off, he can't eat, vietnam vet., he can't sleep
Big rolls royce drivin' down the street two sexy blodes in the back seat !

Man overboard
When it rains, it pours
I vote against
I don't vote for
We've gone too far, man overboard

Man overboard
No he can't afford
You've got enough
But we want more
He's gone to far, man overboard

I'm bored over everything i read
I'm bored over everything on t.v.
I'm bored over you
I'm bored over me
I'm overboard
Way overboard
Man overboard !

Man overboard
I'm falling overboard
We'll i'm so bored
They've gone too far, man overboard

Man overboard
It's all their fault
I've think i gone too far, man overboard

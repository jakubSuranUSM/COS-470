I have no other way, there is a price to pay
For what the man will say that I was a million miles away
In a promise full of steam, it could take no vacant dream
To persuade me to believe

I think just don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is, if you don't know what it is

I left my heart in places, forgot everyone of their faces
And tried to navigate a broken path
Of which I may have helped create
In any incident, this is never no accident
To stand alone and let the silence make itself at home

Ah, give it up, those dirty tricks
No quick fix, can undo it
Ah, give it up, I won't resist
My answers always this

I said, don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is, if you don't know what it is

Just don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is, if you don't know what it is

Where has my light gone? Where has my fight gone?
What keeps us burning when the fire is long gone?
When I can’t relate to that voice without a face
Should I be afraid or is it just a voice I did create?

Ah, give it up, those dirty tricks
No quick fix, can undo it
Ah, give it up, I won't resist
My answers always this

I said don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is, if you don't know what it is

Just don't fight it, don't fight it, don't fight it
If you don't know what it is, if you don't know what it is

No, don’t fight it
Don’t know what it is, don’t know what it is
No, don’t fight it
Don’t know what it is, don’t know what it is
No, don’t fight it
Don’t know what it is, don’t know what it is

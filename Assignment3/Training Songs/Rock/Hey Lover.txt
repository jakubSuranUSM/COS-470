Someone plays a solo on a saxophone
Oh, you never seen somebody throw their head so slow
And I see her cringe her lips and drop her ear that way
Scratch a dog behind its ears and it might do the same

Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover

Blue and white racing striped pick up truck
And when did I decide to grow this beard and gut
Well, I may be white but I don't like my people much
But I want to raise with you and watch our younglings hatch
Fuckin' make the first letters of their first names match

Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover 
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover

Well, I'm back into a boring life that I once led
Stuck in white spread asshole on a sofa bed
Sometimes I hate myself for trying to be so bold
But nothing ever seems to get this story told

Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover

I'll never tell her when she plays a song I never heard
Because I always learn the music and forget the words
But I want to ride with her, and I wish I sung that well
Just copy, paste, Google-search, and send it to myself

Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, hey lover

All my windows were barred, the sun made stripes of shade
I was sitting round like a zombie, feeding my own face
I was carrying my cheek, I was digging my strange
I was taken you for granted, you were holding the reigns

But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you, but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

It's a slippery slope, like that mouse trap game
Inside my tunnel vision you stepped on my train

But I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Now I can hear you louder than ever

I don't wanna ignore, you were the past of my feelings
We're probably gonna get out of this just hear me out anyway
The darkness snuck in, and now I'm down in on all my promises
Don't try to pull me out of this just lay down by me away

'Cause I can hear you louder than ever
Whisper to me, help me remember
I can't see you but we're still together
Yeah I can hear you louder than ever

[Repeat: x5]
I can hear you louder than ever

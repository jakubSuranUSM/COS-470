Every since the first time I lay eyes upon you
You don't know how hard it is to let you go
Even in the first when we were started
I told you man was here to live but he had to go
So you killed jesus
You killed Abraham too
You killed Martin

What you here to do
Now we're gonna play you the feelings
That theey all left behind
Oh you make it hurt so bad
Why you make it hurt so bad
Take everything I had
Everything I had
Everything I had

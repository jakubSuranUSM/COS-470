I don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Shall I tell you a story
Shall I tell you a dream
They think I'm crazy
They don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here
I get everything for free
Have you been here before
Shall I show you around
It's really pretty
Have you come here to stay
Well you sure picked a day
My name is Billy
It's my birthday, you're invited
To my party down the hall
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
I'm not troubled or sad
I'm just ready for bed
It's been a long day
Before they switch off the lights
That truly was a delight
They think I'm crazy
They don't know that I like it here
It's nice in here
I get everything for free
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
Where I'll go, what I'll become or who I am or what I'll be I'll never know
But I am sure that I'll get everything for free
everything for free
I don't know who you are
But you seem very nice
So will you talk to me
Have you been here before
Well you sure picked a day
they think I'm crazy

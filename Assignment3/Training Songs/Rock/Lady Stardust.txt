Stardust, 
Lady Stardust spread your hair a
Cross your universe of magic, 
Let us in.

Let's fly into the milky-way, 
Climb these concrete walls 
And say don't ever close us in.

Like every city needs a distance, 
Every sky demands a moon,
Every winter needs a snowfall,
Every summer wants a June.
Money is just a piece of paper,
Gold is blinding, don't you see.

Fame is just our own illusion, 
Of what life is meant to be.
But I don't need a perfect mirror, 
I don't care for queens and kings.
We are free and we are perfect, 
When Lady Stardust sings

Play on

Oh, Lady Stardust sing. Play on
Lady Stardust sing

Stardust, 
Lady Stardust let us cruise 
Around your universe of magic, I'm in.

Let's play this song, on and on, 
Until the dawn and never let them win.
And every minute needs the hour, 
Every day demands a night, 
Every giant supernova hits the city with your light.

Movie-stars and grand directors, 
Silver screens and MTV's, 
Gods and angels all around me 
Fills the air like little bees.

I don't need no superheroes, 
I don't care for gods with wings, 
I hear teardrops on the pavement 
When Lady Stardust sings. 
Play on.

Lady Stardust sing, play on.
Lady Stardust sing

And I don't need no superheroes, 
I don't care for gods with wings, 
I hear teardrops on the pavement 
When Lady Stardust sings.
Oh Lady stardust sing.
Lady stardust sing.

Na, na, na, na, na, now she sings
Na, na, na, na, na, now she sings
Na, na, na, na, I'll sing for you.

I'll sing this song, so please hold on,
I'll sing this song for you 
And say something that matters 
And say something that matters.
Try to say something that matters to you, 
So please hold on.
Try to say something that matters

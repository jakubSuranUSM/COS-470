I'm trying to find the words to say
To make you feel much better fay
And turn your head around and break it down

Don't you want a better view?
Oh come on yeah please say you do
And the wind'll change
And part the dark clouds over you

There's nothing to be gained by 
Running all those bad times through your head again
Stormaths ablaze with hellfire
But don't you know that these things
Always end the same

Your pretty face is full of pain
Your act is getting harder to sustain
But I see and I hear it there are other ways
Forget the people who don't care for you
Oh I love you
You know its true
Its so hard
But stay with me I'll see you through

There's nothing to be gained by 
Running all those bad times through your head again
Stormaths ablaze with hellfire
But don't you know that these things
Always end the same

In simple words I try to say
Everything will be ok
The grey will fade
And there'll be rainbow skies above you fay

Lets go somewhere we don't know
Its not running away
Just trying to take control
The sunshine and the blue
Maybe you'll find something there for you
Oh I hope so 
So lets go

Working hard to make a living
Bringing shelter from the rain
A father's son left to carry on
Blue denim in his vein
Oh oh oh, he's a working class man

Well he's a steel town disciple
He's a legend of his kind
He's running like a cyclone
Across the wild mid western sky
Oh oh oh, he's a working class man

He believes in god and Elvis
He gets out when he can
He did his time in Vietnam
Still mad at Uncle Sam
He's a simple man
With a heart of gold
In a complicated land
Oh he's a working class man

Well he loves a little woman
Someday he'll make his wife
Saving all the overtime
For the one love of his life
He ain't worried about tomorrow
'Cause he just made up his mind
Life's too short for burning bridges
Take it one day at a time
Oh oh oh, he's a working class man
Oh oh oh, he's a working class man
Oh yeah
Yes he is
Well he's a working class man
Oh
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma

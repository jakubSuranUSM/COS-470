I suppose that I'm all right now,
When all you ever gave was nothing,
I suppose you taught me well now,
When all I ever learned was something,

I suppose that I'm all right now,
I'm all right now and I suppose it,
They suppose they taught me well now,
You taught me hell now and no one knows it,

All right now, all right now, all right now,

There's no horses left to bet on,
And all your pretty purse is blown away,
Someone shows me I've been stepped on,
And now I'm left with nothing more to say,

And I propose we're not all right now,
But I'm all right now, and I propose it,
They suppose they taught me well now,
You taught me hell now and no one knows it,

You're getting sucked in little by little,
And I suppose you feel all right now, all right now, don't feel,
You're getting shot down a little by little,
And I suppose you feel all right now and no one knows it,

( I've got nothing and I feel fine)
(I'm right now, I'm right now)
Have you lost your feeling?
Have you lost your sense of breathing?
Have you gained that tainted feeling?
So, so cold,
Someone poisoned what you're eating,

You're getting shot down, you're getting pushed in, a little by little,
And I suppose you feel all right now, all right now, don't feel,
You're getting shot down a little by little,
And I suppose you feel all right now, all right now, don't feel,
You're getting pushed in a little by little,
And I'm all right now and no one knows it,

And no one knows it, and no one knows it,
And no one knows it, and no one knows it.

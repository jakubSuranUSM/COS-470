You know I love you
Want you to love me too
Let's get together
Like old folks used to do
We'll get married
Go to Paris
Come here, it's me
It's you I love

I'll be your little boy
You'll be my little girl
We'd go round and round
Round this great big world
Even in the rain
We'll go hand-in-hand
Come here, kiss me
It's you I love

No matter what the people say
We'll do things our way
We'd be together
Each and every day
When you are blue
I'd be there with you
Come here, kiss me me
It's you I love

You know I love you
Want you to love me too
Let's get together
Like old folks used to do
We'll get married
Go to Paris
Come here, it's me
It's you I love

I'll be your little boy
You'll be my little girl
We'd go round and round
Round this great big world
Even in the rain
We'll go hand-in-hand
Come here, kiss me
It's you I love

Clouds move in 
From off the horizon 
Feels like nighttime 
In the middle of the day 
And I don't know why 
But it's still so suprisin' 
How a love grows stronger 
Or it just fades away

But you look older today 
Than I've ever seen you 
I think I know the reason 
We might wash all our tears away 
But you got to bundle up baby
For the rainy season

I hear you breathing heavy 
On the telephone tonight 
I can feel the air is thick as thieves 
Sometimes I just want to tell you 
We'll be all right
At least that's what some part of me believes

But you look older today 
Than I've ever seen you 
Think I know the reason 
We might wash all our tears away 
But you got to bundle up, bundle up, bundle up
For the rainy season 

Oh, oh I've been holding on so long 
Holding on and holding on so long 
Oh, oh I've been holding on so long 
Won't you bundle up baby 
Could you bundle up, bundle up, bundle up
For the rainy season

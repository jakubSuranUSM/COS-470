Girls like that
Girls like that don't go for guys like us
I want to see the facts
And she says simply "no, ah ah"
The Julio Iglesias
He just ain't scientific

I'll keep on lookin' for that lovin' feelin'
I'll keep on lookin' for that lovin' feelin'
All of the chemists and witch doctors they know
What I'll never ever know

Now listen,
Girls like that
Girls like that don't go for guys like us
I still want to see the facts
But this time she's serious

She says there's too too many worlds
Too many worlds wrapped up in science fiction
Tiny boys and tiny girls
I may well live to regret this in the morning
For I am considering, a move to South America

To keep on lookin' for that lovin' feelin'
I'll keep on lookin' for that lovin' feelin'
All of the chemists and witch doctors they know
What I'll never ever know

They know they know they know that lovin' feelin'
They know the chemists and witch doctors know it
They know they know they know that lovin' feelin'
That feelin'
That feelin'

Woo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo

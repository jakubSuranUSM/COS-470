Oh I was sweet and gentle
(He was sweet and gentle)
Kind of sentimental
(Kind of sentimental)
No one will deny it
(No one will deny it)
I was once so quiet
And then the magic night 
I learned to do the cha cha
And now I'll never be the same
For I have turned into a dancing Cucaracha
And my muchacha is to blame
How can I be gentle
Sweet and sentimental
While the cha cha's playing
And my heart is swaying
I find that I am even dancing 
when I'm walking
I'm haunted by that cha cha beat
I hear the rhythm start
When we are talking
I do the cha cha in my sleep

I was sweet and gentle
(He was sweet and gentle)
Kind of sentimental
(Kind of sentimental)
No one will deny it
(No one will deny it)
I was once so quiet
And then the magic night 
I learned to do the cha cha
And now I'll never be the same
For I have turned into a dancing Cucaracha
And my muchacha is to blame

Please be sweet and gentle
(Please be sweet and gentle)
Treat me sentimental
(Treat him sentimental)
For I'm tempermental
(Cha cha cha cha)
When I cha cha with you
Cha cha cha, cha cha cha
Cha cha cha
Ooo

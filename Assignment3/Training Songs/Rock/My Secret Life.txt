This is my confession it came to me late last night
I want you to understand baby you are my secret life

I saw you this morning you where moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip on the past
But I miss you so much and there's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In my secret life

I smile when I'm angry and I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I die for the truth
In my secret life

I look in the papers it makes you want to cry

Nobody cares if the people live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life

I bite my lip and I bite when I'm told
From the latest hits to the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone and my heart is like ice
And it's so crowded and cold
In my secret life
In my secret life (In my secret life)
In my secret life  (In my secret life)
Dream will come true (In my secret life)
In my secret life (In my secret life)
In my secret life

There's one too many, two too many holes
Getting bigger in the garden wall
And the people looking in are getting busy,getting bad
Trying to suss it all
They're trying to get to me, to take my liberty

Got to o, go, go on, get out of here,'cause
This means nothing to me
The way we were is the way I want to be

They're sending in the elite, complete with guns
To advertise the way to go
Faxing through the fax to make it clear 
That they're the ones who know
They;re trying to get to me, to take my liberty

Got to o, go, go on, get out of here,'cause
This means nothing to me
The way we were is the way I want to be

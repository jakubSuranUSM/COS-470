Get ready baby, when things start to move
Stand out the way, yeah, when she starts to groan
She's livin' her live just as much as she can
Just her and the music of a rock and roll band
It's music that takes her away nearly every day

No folkie, no, is gonna make her feel good
That blue grass music just don't do what it should
That classical gas stuff, well it don't mean a thing
Cause she's only happy in a rock and roll scene

It's the music that takes her away
And the feelin' that gets her near most every day
She's a rock and roll kinda woman
She's definitely one of a kind, she is
With her neon suspenders, yeah
Sure 'nuff blows my mind

Rock steady baby, just a keep a movin' on
You gotta dance to the music till the music's all gone
And it's special, that feelin', that comes over you
And you're stompin' your feet and there ain't nothin' you can do

It's the music that takes her away
She can't stand still when the boys start to play
Cause she's a rock and roll kinda woman
Strictly one of a kind, she is
With her neon suspenders, yeah
Sure 'nuff blows my mind

Alright, come on, do it baby
It feels good, don't care what nobody says

Be careful what you dream of
It may come up and surprise you
I can't confess my life's a mess
I've come to idolise you

You liken it to walking on hot coals
I'll keep my boots on
Wisen up and fly straight
There's a shape on the horizon 

In a hollow horse I'll steal my way
Inside your guarded heart
So selfishly the needs I harbour
When we are apart

My past strung out behind me,
Contradiction and disaster
I'm in search of charity,
A union I could master 

We'll be as we are
When all the fools
Who doubt us fade away
Fortune deep and wide

Intimidated, restless in the wait 
Things I chose to value
I no longer have a use for
I ridicule myself for all the things 

Those symbols stood for
When vanity has played a part
In every leader's downfall
Wait to storm the gates, what's left

Undone to hang around for 
We'll be as we are
When all the fools
Who doubt us fade away

Fortune deep and wide
Intimidated, restless in the wait

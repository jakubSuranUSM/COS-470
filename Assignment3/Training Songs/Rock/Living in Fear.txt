Well, I thought I was headed for the Hebrides Islands
Look at me now, here I am two miles from the Panama canal
Oh, baby you let me down
Oh, you let me down, yeah

Well, I thought I was healthy and free from temptation
I'm a long away from home and you were so
So full of competence that I let you take over
Oh, how I let you take over

And I left it up to you, babe
But you left it up to me
I don't believe in no authority

I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in a fool's paradise
I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in fear, living in fear

Well, I left it up to you, baby
But you left it up to me
I can't believe in no authority

I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in a fool's paradise, fool's paradise
I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in fear, living in fear

And I thought I was looking for someone to lean on
Now I'm leaning on a lamp post at the corner of the street
But I'm goin' home
Yeah, I'm goin' home

Well, I thought I was headed for the Hebrides islands
Here I am two minutes from the Panama canal
Oh, baby, it's the last time, it's the last time
It's the last time I do, it's the last time I do

Cause I left it up to you, baby
But you left it up to me
I don't believe in no authority

I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in a fool's paradise
I'm just living in a false sense of security
I'm just living in fear, living in fear, living in fear

Oh, baby, you let me down, yeah

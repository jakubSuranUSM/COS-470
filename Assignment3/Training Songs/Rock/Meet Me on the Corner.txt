Hey mister dream seller
Where have you been.
Tell me have you dreams I can see?
I came along, just to bring you this song,
Can you spare one dream for me?

You wont have met me,
And you'll soon forget.
So don't mind me tugging at your sleeve.
I'm asking you,
If I can fix a rendezvous,
For your dreams are all I believe.

[Chorus]
Meet me on the corner,
When the lights are coming on,
And I'll be there.
I promise I'll be there.
Down the empty streets,
We'll disappear into the dawn,
If you have dreams enough to share.

Lay down your bundles,
Of rags and reminders,
And spread your wears on the ground.
Well I've got time,
If you're dealing mine,
I'm just hanging around.

[Chorus]

Hey mister dream seller, 
Where have you been.
Tell me have you dreams I can see?
I came along, just to bring you this song,
Can you spare one dream for me?

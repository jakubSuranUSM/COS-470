Mountains wouldn't part for me
They have no uncertainty
I'm just a passing emotion
Just hoping they take notice

And you are an opportunity
Without an opportunity
Another passing emotion
And hope that someone will take notice

And did I hear you sing
That we exist without existing
Or did I hear you sing
That we'll land where we begin

I understand it but I don't show it
So I won't think it
And maybe we'll be there
Maybe we will be there

I understand it but I don't show it
So I won't think it
And maybe we'll be there
Maybe one day we will be there

I thought I heard you say
That I must be disappearing
But I'm sure I heard you sing
We won't begin

You have no sense in emptiness
Will you try a little harder
You have no sense in emptiness
Will you try, try, try a little harder

Woke up in smoke and flames
Had a lie with a stranger
5 dozen photographs
solemn burnt up in anger

Am I asleep still?
Tell me, I could have been
Don't let it tear us apart again limb from limb
please let me in

[Chorus:]
But I don't want to look at you this way
I'm staring through your window
I don't want to think of you this way
I'm begging, baby, Let me in
Baby, just let me in
I'm begging at your door just let me in
Just let me in

I drink the wine of youth
Ended up in a coma
Your wicked silver tounge
No wonder nobody told you
That I'm awake now
First time I've ever been able to see what I should have seen
way back when you let me in

[Chorus]

It's my fault for waiting
Just won't end up saving
Guess this is farewell
Somehow, you let me in

hey

See, I'm awake now
First time I've ever been able to see what I should have seen
Way back when you let me in

[Chorus]

There's fault for waiting
Just won't end up saving
Guess this is farewell
Somehow, you let me in

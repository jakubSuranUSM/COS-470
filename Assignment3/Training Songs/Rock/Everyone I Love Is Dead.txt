Seems three years 
Though maybe four 
Someone drops dead 
Whom I adore 
You love someone 
There will be grief 
The kiss of death 
Lips of a thief 

Goddamnit 

A dusty stack 
of photographs 
Of times I've cried 
But mostly laughed 
Commit the past 
Into blue flame 
Acrid smoke 
Cowardly shame 

Goddamnit 

At times I'm truly terrified 
'Cause dope and booze 
Don't help to hide 
They're used to mask 
A weakling's hurt 
It's just like painting 
Over dirt 

Everyone I love is dead (ha-ha) 

Life's a game I cannot win 
Both good and bad 
Must surely end 
The mirrors 
Always tell the truth 
I love myself 
For hating you

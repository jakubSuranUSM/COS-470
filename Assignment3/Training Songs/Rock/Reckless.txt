Nothin's changin' but the shadows on the wall
I wish I could leave myself at the end of the hall
Always pushin' pushin' away what I need the most
Well here I go again but this time we got so close

I was reckless reckless
I was reckless to the end
I was foolish and careless
And reckless once again

It looks like I really led myself astray
And even I don't believe half the things I say
Always runnin' and I still don't know where I am
I just can't afford to let you slip right thru my hands

I was reckless reckless
I was reckless to the end
I was foolish and careless
And reckless once again

All the right words remain unspoken
Another promise made
Another promise broken

I was reckless reckless
I was reckless to the end
I was foolish and careless
And reckless once again

I was reckless once again ...

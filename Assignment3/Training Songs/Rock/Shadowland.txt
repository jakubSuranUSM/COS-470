You want to know why this cold wind blows
I guess you find the answer on your mind
To speak no word and to be not heard
It's maybe the price you pay to modern life

This world reminds me of a land of fairy-tales
Sinners are kings in a land full of darkness
Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear
That's where is shadowland

You search for an answer in the bunch full of lies
And sometimes you see a fool in disguise
What is it good for? What does it mean to life?
A stupid shareware of dreams, a colorful nightmare till your dying day

This world reminds me of a land of fairy-tales
Sinners are kings in a land full of darkness
Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear
That's where is shadowland

Uh, now they are trying to hide their souls inside
And they praying heads to their foolish pride

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear
That's where is shadowland

Peace, 
Peace will, 
Peace will come, 
And let it begin with me. 
We, 
We need, 
We need peace, 
And let it begin with me. 
Oh, my own life 
Is all I can hope to control. 
Oh, let my life, 
Be lived for the good, 
Good of my soul. 
Let it bring peace, 
Sweet peace, 
Peace will come, 
And let it begin with me.

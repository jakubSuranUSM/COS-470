I went out in the street for a walk in the night
Had to loosen my head, it's been wound too tight
I've been standing on the edge after picking a fight with you

Sometimes my world seems so damn small
I can't think of nothing 'cept for me at all
And my thoughts surround me like a prison wall, it's true

I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now

It takes all my strength to slow myself down
My thoughts are screaming, I can't hear a sound
Sometimes I wish there was no one around but you

Oh, tell me you know what I'm talking about
Sometimes you're the sail like confusion and doubt
And then it hurts so bad, you just wanna shout, "I'm through"

I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now

Please forgive these things I might've said
You see they come from my frustration, not my head
And the last thing that I wanna do
Is create a distance between me and you

I wanna get closer to you now
I gotta get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I gotta get closer to you now

Well, there seem to be two states of mind
One is visionary, the other blind
And the best that we can hope to find
Is to meet somewhere in between

Well, the night air has pulled me back a bit
Just when I was about to quit, trying to get a candle lit
That lets me see what can't be seen

I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now

I gotta get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now
I wanna get closer to you now

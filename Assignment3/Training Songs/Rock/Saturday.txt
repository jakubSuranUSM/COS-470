Saturday,
Began much the same as other days,
But ended up different in may ways,
Love is my world since Saturday.

Mornin' came, 
But somehow it didn't seem the same.
The sadness of Friday had somehow changed 
To the happy sounds of Saturday,

Saturday, ever lovin' Saturday.
I whistle to blue birds, 
I try to tell them how you brought me sunshine.
My head's full of new words, 
That sing to the sounds of the day after Friday.

Come and see 
The flowers of love she gave to me; 
The touches of laughter and harmony
To the happy sounds of Saturday,

Saturday, ever lovin' Saturday.
I whistle to blue birds, 
I try to tell them how you brought me sunshine.
My head's full of new words, 
That sing to the sounds of the day after Friday.	
Day after Friday.

Come and see 
The flowers of love she gave to me; 
The touches of laughter and harmony 
To the happy sounds of Saturday, 
Saturday, ever lovin' Saturday.

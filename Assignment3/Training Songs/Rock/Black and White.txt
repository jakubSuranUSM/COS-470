Black and white
Always fighting
Blue and green
It'll soon be spring
In the sky
Face and I
Look for time
Candles bind

Orange and Red
The sun falls dead
Chased by the moon
Who's losing his room
So much is happening all around
Listen to the lake
And absorb the sound

(chorus)
It's calling me from another world
And the stars in your eyes
It's calling me from another world
In your eyes

Purple and blue
While the sun's shining through
The cats on the table
Think we'll always be able
To live in the colors
That were given by the mothers
Stolen by the one
Who returns holding none

(chorus)

Black and white
Always fighting
Blue and green
It'll soon be spring

It'll soon be spring
It'll soon be spring
etc.

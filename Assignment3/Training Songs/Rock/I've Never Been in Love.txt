Oh
No I can't write my name
Oh - don't you know I'm so blasted.
How this revelation it is hotter
Than a matchhead
And I'm ready to go
Ready to fly away with you
And I may lose everything
But I don't give a damn if I do.
Because I've never been in love
Never been in love
Never been in love
Never been in love
I've never been in love like this before
Oh - what did I miss before.
Well
This good luck.
It's breaking out of bounds
And I just got to tell it
Tell it
Tell it
Oh scream and shout.
Well
You came like a hurricane
And sent me into the clouds
Oh
And I haven't seen my feet for days
'Cause I'm miles above the ground.
Because I've never been in love
...
Well
Who says I need a doctor
'Cause I'm a second-hand crazed.
I've been laughing so much
Oh
They want to put me away.
And I'm really gonna take these chains
Of off my life 'cause this lightening I know
I would never ever strike twice.
Because I've never been in love
...

Find me out
I'm not the same person
This machine
Just ain't worth it

Find me out
Find me out
Find me out
Find me out

Never be
Stuck believing
Let it be
Know that I'm leaving

Never be
Never be
Never be
Never be

Look at her
She not the same
Look at her
You can't be blamed

Look at her
Look at her
Look at her
Look at her

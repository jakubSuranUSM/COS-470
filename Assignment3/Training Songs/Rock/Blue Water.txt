Move back, step outside yourself
Just move back, step outside yourself

Just move back stepping outside yourself
Feel I'm falling upwards looking at hell
{Blue Blue, What am I supposed to do?
{Well life looks a little hazy
{Looking at my self {These 3 lines are on 12"}
Sea green, if you know what I mean? 
Please unleash this animal inside
Out of my mind

[Chorus]
Well it's the perspiration, it's draining my head
Perspiration, is draining my head
Perspiration, is draining my head
Perspiration, is draining my head

Blue angel
In this night fall {This night for us??}
It's substance, it dawns {The suffocation stops??}
In this night form

The constant pain, the constant pain  {The Astral Plane??}

Bluewater
It keeps grinning {It's got to bleed}

Blue Blue, I'm preying for you
Get out the electrostatic hotwire
I've got a drain on you

[Chorus]

Blue angel
In this night form
It's substance, it dawns
We feed at nightfall
Blue angel
This stillness night form
Minion
Come down
Minion
In the depths

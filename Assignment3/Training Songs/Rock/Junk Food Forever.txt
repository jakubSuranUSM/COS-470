Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Junk food forever
Late nights together
Jackets in leather
I can't forget ya'

Have I changed for better
Now we're not together?
Now junk food forever
When it's getting too late to find somebody new

Don't wanna' be alone, don't wanna' be alone
Yeah
Don't wanna' be alone
'Cause it feels like forever when I'm stuck here on my own, my own

Now, junk food forever
It's better late than never
I'm feeling the pressure
Forgetting to remember

Have I changed for better
Now we're not together?
Junk food forever
When it's getting too late to find somebody new

Don't wanna' be alone, don't wanna' be alone, yeah
Don't wanna' be alone
'Cause it feels like forever when I'm stuck here on my own

Yeah

Don't wanna' be alone, don't wanna' be alone
Yeah
Don't wanna' be alone
'Cause it feels like forever when I'm stuck here on my own

Say yeah, yeah, yeah

Well I went down to the bunny station
Cause I wanted love for a week or two
I wanted you on a week vacation
Cause its costing me but its killing you

NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa NaNa Naa
Alright

Well I got a friend in the fire department
He was telling me I'm on the road to Rome
He said you'd better find out where you're going
Cause your wife can't fight out all the fires alone

NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa NaNa Naa
Hit me

Well we passed the time in there but we got thrown out
It was falling down and it was overgrown
He said I can see you now ask the captain
He says boy you're really on the road to Rome

NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa
NaNa Naaa NaNa NaNa Naa

Get my clothes to her,
And the only thing I wanted her to take,
But I never said a word,
I'll explain myself so nothing else remains,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
Burning her down,
It's typical of her,
If there's something wrong, she makes it worse again,
But I'm free as a cage bird,
I'll explain myself so nothing else remains,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
There's a long way to go,
You're so down 'cause you can't get out,
And you never get born again,
Because you feel so down,
I've never said a word,
I'll never try to explain,
That you feel the same thing for her,
So I'll never call your name,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I'm on fire, well I let go,
I find it hard to explain.

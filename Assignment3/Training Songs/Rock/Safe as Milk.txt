Well, my cigarette died when I washed my face 
Dropped some drops in an ashtray; hit a wrong place
Woman at my blinds to see spiders spinning lines
It's a safe as milk; it's a safe as milk
I never heard it put quite that way
The shape I'm in is a gone away
They called a day; they called a day
Yesterday's paper headlines approach rain gutter, teasing rusty cat, sneezing
Soppin' wet hammer dusty and wheezing 
Lusty alley, whining trashcan blues
Children running after rainbows, stocking poor
Gracious ladies' nylon, hanging on to line
Jumping onto leg, looking mighty fine 
Sorrows, lollipop lands, stick-broken on a dark carnival ground
Pop-up toaster, cracklin' aluminium, rhythm and sound
Ev'ry day pencil, lazy and sharp
The icebox inside, looking like a harp
Electric bulb been out for years; Freezer fumes feed the gas tears
Cheese in the corner with a mile-long beard
Beggin' blue bread dog-eared 
Beggin' blue bread dog-eared
I may be hungry, but I sure ain't weird

There isn't anything to talk about
You know I don't mean any harm
You know I don't mean anything at all

If we both understand what's going on
It's pretty clear we'll get along
It's pretty clear we'll get it

I don't bite, but you can't believe it

This isn't quite what I was counting on
I wish I knew just what you want
I wish that I knew anything at all

I though the point here was to have some fun
I only wanna get it done
I only want to get it

I don't bite, but you can't believe it

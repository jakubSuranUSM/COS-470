Isn't it funny how you never really screamed at my face
But your anger's so unspoken and unchanneled
Permeates my essence to the point where I
Don't want to see you, hear you, be anywhere near you
You probably think I'm threatened by you 
But your illusionary power doesn't threaten me

Actually I think it's kinda funny 
That you create an illusion that is a mirror
I don't appreciate you 
And I know that that surprises you
I suppose you see that those who follow their heart always win
Those with integrity have won the match before it's begun

So rather than being kicked around 
I'm gonna kick you to the curb
So rather than being pushed around 
I'm gonna push you away first
So rather than trying to protect you 
I'm gonna cover my bases first
So rather than trying to open my heart 
I'm gonna lock it with a key
So that only the special ones 
Can ever get through to me

Some can see beyond the barrier of threshold
Where as others can see beyond their sculptured mold
You could offer me nothing 
You could offer me nothing that I need
Do you think I'm asking too much
A kind of respect and trust that shouldn't ever be questioned
How can I open my heart 
With dishonesty sitting next to me
I've honored your honor to the point of embarrassment
But innocence in the hands of the guilt-free is kicked to
Is kicked to the curb
I was ashamed of my innocence
I was ashamed of my innocence
But now with clarity I see that 
Your bullshit is just not worthy of me

So rather than being kicked around
I'm gonna kick you to the curb
So rather than being pushed around
I'm gonna push you away first
So rather than trying to protect you

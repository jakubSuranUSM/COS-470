As the feeling is
wrapped in a million things
God its good to be back home
While we're casting doubt
We're sitting talking about
The many ways of getting back, yeah

Five star dreams are still my call
You said that I'm insane but I'm not sure,
yeah, yeah, yeah
While I'm passing out don't fall
We've been here before, who's keeping score?

The company I keep
It puts my heart to sleep
Better to be someone you know
While I'm casting doubt
We're sitting talking about
The many ways of getting stoned.

Five star dreams are still my call
You said that I'm insane but I'm not sure
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
While I'm passing out don't fall
We've been here before, who's keeping score?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.

Five star dreams are still my call.
Five star dreams are still my call.
Five star dreams are still my call.
Five star dreams are still my call.

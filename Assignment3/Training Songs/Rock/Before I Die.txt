I’m out here on my own
I’m giving it a go alone
I’m begging on my knees
Is there a God to save me
I’ve been a retched soul
From my heart down to my toes
I was lost in my disease
And you were right there screaming

Don’t change when it’s too late

Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

From the valley of the dead
I’m hearing every word you said
I’m trying to apologize
But I can’t feel my feelings
Are you giving us some room to grow
Or digging us a deeper hole
You’re killing any shred of hope
For us to believe in

Don’t change when it it’s too late

Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

I’m out here on my own
I’m sick of being here alone
I know where I belong
But I can’t find my way home

Find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way home
Find my way

Maybe I said the right things wrong
But one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

Will live for you before I die
I will live for you before I die

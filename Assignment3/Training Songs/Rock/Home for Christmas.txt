The leaves are falling
December is calling
Feels like that time of the year
Ooh, and a chill in my bones
Got me thinking of home
Home and the one I hold dear

I think that I missed my connection
Stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road treated me
I always can find my way home

'Cause you know that you're in my heart, yeah
And I always come home for Christmas
Oh, near or apart, oh, so close, oh, so far
I still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day, oh
But I still come home for Christmas
Oh, how I wish I could stay
'Cause the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I always come home
Ooh, yes, I always come home, mm

I see all the lights
Someone told me tonight
They're putting the star on the tree
Yeah, it's a feeling I know
I'll never out grow
Like my first holiday memory

Sometimes we'll! miss our connections
We're stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road seem to be
We always can find our way home

'Cause you know that you're in my heart, yeah
And I always come home for Christmas
Oh, whether we're near or apart
Oh, so dose, oh, so far
I still come home for Christmas every year
It might be just for a day
But I still come home for Christmas
Oh, how I wish (I could stay)
'Cause the years slip away
I come home for Christmas, yeah

Ooh, no matter how mean

L always can find my way home

Oh, you're in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas, yeah
Oh, we're near (Or apart)
Oh, so dose (Oh, so far)

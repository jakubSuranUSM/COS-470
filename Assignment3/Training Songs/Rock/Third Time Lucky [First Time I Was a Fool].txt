It's all behind me, there's good luck up ahead,
Can't break what's left of my heart.
Once bitten, twice shy, this time it feels so good,
I'd hate to see it fall apart.

First love I had was seventeen, and I was younger,
Love to us was some kind of game.
In all my letters, said I never would forget her - now,
I can't recall her name.

The first time I was a fool, I never knew that love could be so cruel.
It happened to me again - Third time lucky.

{Instrumental}
I was in love one time, I thought it was the real thing,
But I kept the feelings to myself.
Afraid to show it, expected her to know,
It was the reason she found someone else.

Its all behind me, there's good luck up ahead,
Can't break what's left of my heart.
Once bitten, twice shy, this time it feels so good,
I'd hate to see it fall apart.

The first time I was a fool, I never knew that love could be so cruel.
It happened to me again - Third time lucky. Oh yeah, yeah.

The first time I was a fool, I never knew that love could be so cruel.
It happened to me again - Third time lucky. Oh yea-ee-yeah

The first time I was a fool, I never knew that love could be so cruel.
It happened to me again - Third time lucky. Oh yea-ee-yeah.

The first time I was a fool, I never knew that love could be so cruel.
It happened to me again - Third time lucky. Oh yea-ee-yeah...
The first time I was a fool...

I was your boyfriend when we were 15, it's the happiest that I've ever been.
Even though we didn't understand how to do much more than just hold hands.
There's so much about you I miss, the clumsy way we used to kiss.
I wish I'd convinced you you'd made a mistake, if memory serves we're still on a break.
Other girls went and other girls came, I can't get over my old flame.

I'm still in love with, Emily Kane.
Every girl I've seen since looks just like you when I squint.
I know you said it's for the best, I still don't understand why you left.
There's so much about you I miss, every time I see a couple kiss.

I hope this song finds you fame, I want school kids on busses singing your name.
Other girls went and other girls came, I can't get over my old flame.
I'm still in love with, Emily Kane.
I don't even know where she lives.

I've not seen her in 10 years, 9 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, 6 hours, 13 minutes, 5 seconds.
Other girls went and other girls came, I can't get over my old flame.
All my friends think I'm insane, I'm still in love with Emily Kane.
There's a beast in my soul that can't be tamed, I'm still in love with Emily Kane.

I thought I'd never love again, I'm still in love with Emily Kane.
The torch I hold is always a flame, I'm still in love with Emily Kane.
I hope this song finds you fame, I want school kids on busses singing your name.
All my friends think I'm insane, I'm still in love with Emily Kane.

Emily Kane, Emily Kane, Emily Kane.

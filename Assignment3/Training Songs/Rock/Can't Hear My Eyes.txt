I'm a man of many talents
But I got one thing left to do
I gotta get a blindfold and close my eyes
Before I get one look at you

Because I see love (see love)
In a special way
And I see you (see you)
So beautiful lady
You make my eyes go boom
And that tells me (tells me)
I need you soon

But I can't hear my eyes
They don't speak, they're just the spies
Said I can't hear my eyes
Cause when I see her, they slowly rise
Do it one more time

I want a lady as beautiful as a sunset on a strip
Light auburn hair and hips that don't care
Really makes me tick

And I see love (see love)
In a special way
And I see you (see you)
So beautiful lady
You make my eyes go boom
And that tells me (tells me)
I need you soon

But I can't hear my eyes
They don't speak, they're just the spies
Said I can't hear my eyes
Cause when I see her, they slowly rise
Do it one more time

Can't hear my eyes
They don't speak, they're just the spies
Said I can't hear my eyes
They don't speak, they're just the spies

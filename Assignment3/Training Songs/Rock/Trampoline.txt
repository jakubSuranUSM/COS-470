The floor will have its way it seems
It fights me like a trampoline
It won't let me on the ground
So this time I'm not coming down

I've been talking in my sleep
You once kissed me not to hear me speak
You loved me just so you could leave
Every bit of life wrung out of me

And this time I'm not coming down
This time I'm not coming down
Trampoline
Trampoline

The whole platoon is overfed
And we're in this thing over our head
My mind it's never been so clear
But I stutter like an auctioneer

As the night has come alive with dreams
That hoot and holler, spit and scream
Every one of them is sick with lust
But every one of them will outlive us

And this time I'm not coming down
This time I'm not coming down
Trampoline
Trampoline

And if I really thought I could
I'd give up your ghost for good
But I'm not sure it isn't you
That keeps my ghost from leaving too

But I don't miss you half as much
As who you made me think I was
When I could see myself the way you do
I could almost see myself in you

This time I'm not coming down
This time I'm not coming down
Trampoline
Trampoline

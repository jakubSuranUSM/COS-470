Found your picture and I remembered all the lovely things we used to do
I could never get enough
I could never get enough
Darkness falls and my heart calls
It's crying out for you, I wonder
Do I ever cross your mind
Could I get you on the line
Baby I know you say that the devil is a lonely night
I can't help myself, I feel the pull and I deal number
Two thousand heart are breaking, breaking
But you can always take me to the light
I miss you like crazy
Do you miss me?
Sounds so sweet when you talk to me
You say you wanna be my boyfriend
We'll sleep on into light
We'll sleep on into light
Feels so nice that I think twice before I let you go again
I'm coming back around
I'm coming back around
Baby I know you say that the devil is a lonely night
I can't help myself, I feel the pull and I deal number
Two thousand hearts are breaking, breaking
But you can always take me to the light
I miss you like crazy
Do you miss me
Do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I think you do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Baby I know you say that the devil is a lonely night
I can't help myself, I feel the pull and I am numb but
Two thousand hearts are breaking, breaking
But you can always take me to the light
I miss you like crazy
Do you miss me
Do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I think you do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I think you do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
I think you do oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

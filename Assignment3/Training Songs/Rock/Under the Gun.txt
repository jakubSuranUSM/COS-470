See the man riding high in the desert near the Rio Grande
Runs for his life, doesn't sleep, doesn't take time to understand
Cause the girl that he loved went away and ran off with another man
But he followed them both and he shot at the throat, couldn't stop his hand.
So now he's under the gun.

He was born and raised and he lived like the son of an honest man
And who would've thought that one day he might gun down another man
But his heart gave away to the gun in his hand
Couldn't stop it, No
So now he's gotta run, and he' weak from the sun got nowhere to go.

Because he's under the gun, under the gun
Just a fugitive, out on the run
Under the gun, under the gun
Never see, the setting sun
He's under the gun.

Well now he's on the run, 'cause he's under cause a gun
Got nowhere to go
Well now pray for him sister, watch out for him mister
He'll let you know
That's he's under the gun, under the gun
Just a fugitive, out on the run, under then gun
Under the gun
Never see the setting sun
He's under cause a gun
Under the gun...

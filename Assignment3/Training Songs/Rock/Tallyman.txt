To our house on a Friday 
A man calls every week 
We give him a pound 
When he calls his round 

To our house on a Friday 
A man calls every week 
We give and we get 
And we're always in dept 

With his plan he carries all we're needing 
With his plan most anything is ours 
He's the tallyman 
Oh yeah 
He's the tallyman 

Shoes and socks hard wearing for the children 
Village frocks all in the latest style 
From the tallyman 
Oh yeah 
From the tallyman 

To our house on a Friday 
A man calls every week 
We've made him a friend 
So here's to the end 

From cradle to grave 
We respect him to say 
Here's tick to the end 
So we've made him a friend 
Here's tick to the end 
So we've made him a friend

This house goes on sale ev'ry Wednesday morning
And taken off the market in the afternoon.
You can buy a piece of it if you want to
It's been good to me if it's been good for you.

Take the grand look now the fire is burning
Is that your reflection on the wall?
I can show you this room and some others
If you came to see the house at all.

Careful up the stairs, a few are missing
I haven't had the time to make repairs
First step is the hardest one to master
Last one I'm not really sure is there.

This room here once had childish laughter
And I come back to hear it now and again
I can't say that I'm certain what you're after
But in this room, a part of you will remain.

Second floor, the lady sleeps in waiting
Past the lantern, tiptoe in its glance
In the room the soft brown arms of shadow
This room the hardest one to pass.

How much will you pay to live in the attic?
The shavings off your mind are the only rent
I left some would there if you thought you couldn't
Or if the shouldn't that you've bought has been spent.

This house goes on sale ev'ry Wednesday morning
And taken off the market in the afternoon.
You can buy a piece of it if you want to
It's been good for me if it's been good for you.

I had a heart
But I buried it someplace
I had a brain
But my body won the race
I dream in pictures
Pictures of you
A figure of eight
Just won't do
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You picked the fruit
That gave you a sweet taste
You walk the tightrope
Unwilling to see straight
You pick me up
Then you pull me down
Made up your mind
That I'm the clown
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Accidentally
We talked about the past
Accidentally
We talked about the past
Accidentally
We talked too much
"Was it magic
That redefined
The missing link
To blow your mind?"
You had a dream
And you thought it religious
You had a taste
And it made it contagious
It rips you up
Then it spits you out
Makes you know
What it's all about
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Accidentally
We walked away too fast
Accidentally
We walked away too fast
Accidentally
We took too much
"Was it magic
That redefined
The missing link
To blow your mind?"
Accidentally
We talked about the past
Accidentally
We talked about the past
Accidentally
We talked about the past
Accidentally
We took too much
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
"Was it magic
That redefined
The missing link
To blow your mind?
Was there tragedy
In the things we did
Now I know
There's no place for it."

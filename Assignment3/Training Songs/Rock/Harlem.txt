I spend my money on the regular miracles
Just like you like me like everybody else
Up on the sun looking sad and beautiful
Just like you like me like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it’s too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah smoke em if you got em

Here come the jets hide my money in your tube socks
Run like me, like hell, like everybody else
Hair metal on a Japanese boom box
Kicks like you like me like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it’s too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah smoke em if you got em
When it gets soft, I shake it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
You’re so sweet, but I like it rough
Light it up yeah smoke em if you got em

Making a movie on the couch with a flip phone
Just like you like I like fingers in your mouth
Up on the sun playing drums with a bleached bone
Just like you like me like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it’s too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah smoke em if you got em

Ego selfish Prima Donna
Dancing in your poisoned cage
Thinking that your consciences clearer
If you drink your dreams away

Feed your anger to the devil
In yourself built wishing well
Take a swim in muddy waters
All the dirt will leave a trail

Had enough symphonies of sorrow
Be so brave and breath away
Masterpiece of treachery

Built a wall and made me crumble
Just because I am in love
Don't you cry, now you get all the
Dolls and toys that you have got

Smash the mirror of the virgin
With the dagger that you made
Mirror, mirror, is there someone
Who can make your day today?

Had enough symphonies of sorrow
Be so brave and breath away
Had enough symphonies of sorrow
Be so brave and breath away
Masterpiece of treachery

Kept my thoughts buried in a box
With it shut I still kept it locked
You drew a play written with my blood
Went ahead just to feed the lot

Had enough symphonies of sorrow
Be so brave and breath away
Had enough symphonies of agony
Be so brave and breath away
Masterpiece of treachery

Goodbye gray sky
I see my heart comin' round the bend
The sun's comin' up on the Poet In My Window
Her saving grace is my old friend
I'll never lose if my heart goes flyin'

If I sail it true and set it free
It'll come flyin' home
Be waitin' in my window
Callin' for the poet in me
I wish you well for your old lines

I've watched you change within the new
You've got a pocket full of gold dust
Waitin' just around the corner
To free that poet in your moon
You'll never lose if your heart goes flyin'

If you set it free and you sail it true
It'll come flyin' home
Be waitin' in your window
Callin' for the poet in you
I never lose if my heart goes flyin'

If I sail it true and I set it free
It comes flyin' home
It's waitin' in my window
Callin' for the poet in me
Fly your poet's wings with a freed heart
Love'll find you strong and young again

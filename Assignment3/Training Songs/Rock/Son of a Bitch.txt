He's the son of the bitch
He's the son of a fool
Sign of the times
No exception he's the rule
He's down on his luck
He's down on his knees
Cut really deep
He knows how to bleed

He's the son of the dog
You'll see him run with the pack
He won't look you in the eyes
He'll stab you in the back
The son of the dog
Only runs with the pack
He'll take your life
He won't look back

Son of a, he's a son of a bitch
He's a son of a,
He's a son of a bitch

Hear the woman of the streets
She never learned how to cry
She'll spread her wings
She'll never fly
Woman of the night
She hangs like a bat
She'll scratch at your eyes
Fight like a cat

Hear the lost, hear the lonely
Hear the fool, that won't get to see
Hear the lost, hear the lonely
And don't, don't pity me

Son of the bitch
He's a son of a,
Oh, the son of a bitch

He's the son of the poor
The son of the rich
The son of the dog
The son of the bitch
Woman of the night
Hangs like a bat
She'll scratch at your eyes
She fights like a cat

He's the son of the bitch
He's the son of a fool
A sign of the times
No exception he's the rule
Down on his luck
Down on his knees
Cut really deep
So he knows how to bleed

He's a sign of the times
He's the son of a,
Son of a bitch
The son of a bitch

Shoulda kept my distance
Shoulda known what I be riskin
But nothin' short of holding you would ever do
Darling
If we could be together
I would wait for you forever
But how'm I gonna win
If you never lose
I could feel the pressure
I could see you were something special
I couldn't walk away from you if I'd tried
Darling

I wanna be near you
If only you'd feel like I do
I must've had it wrong, I should've known

Somebody like you could break my heart
Somebody like you could tear my world apart
Oh yeah
Somebody like you could keep me in the dark
Somebody like you could break my heart
Yeah yeah

I knew that I was fallin'
I could hear your heart beat callin'
I was hopin' you'd be mine before the night was thru
Darling
I could keep on loving you
If there's a chance to somehow break thru
I must've had it wrong
I should've known

Somebody like you could break my heart
Somebody like you baby
Somebody like you I'm tellin' you
Somebody like you could break my heart
Yeah yeah yeah

Guess I new right from the start
That you were a pretender
But it was you who held my heart
I got love I wanna send you
Yeah, are you ready to surrender
Oh yeah 

Somebody like you could break my heart
Somebody like you could tear my world apart
Oh yeah
Somebody like you could keep me in the dark
Somebody like you baby
Somebody like you I'm tellin' you
Somebody like you could break my heart

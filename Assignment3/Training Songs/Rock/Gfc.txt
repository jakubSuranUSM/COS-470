Inside me
There's a sad machine
Want's to start moving
I disagree
For the things you do
You should stop doing

All the while
All the while

I want my frustrations
To know that
I've always done what
I was doing
You played a fool 

Hold my hand
It's about to fall 
All that is happenin'
Got what you wouldn't change
For me
If you had it coming

All the while
All the while

[Repeat}
I want my frustrations
To know that
I've always done what
I was doing
You played a fool

Well I hate Nathan Bedford Forrest 
He's the featured artist in the devil's chorus 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

They say put an end to all your joking 
You lost your friends when you quit smoking 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me now 

The print the proof it disappoints 
And damn you're running late 
The fall the spills are picking up 
And it's their best effort to date 

You see your pitchfork I-rock saviors 
And I'm sorry I still prefer Jim Neighbors 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

It's said that those who wait will be rewarded 
But I think those who are waiting will soon be deported 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

Now Insurance of the past is gone away 
And how we've overcome the weakness for the altered statements 
And hey you know we're dressed like that 
And hey, that's rather silly 
And hey, I made a bet with you 
That it's not T mobility 

One more week of the preacher's blend 
Then I'll be back from on the mend 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

Soon I can do just what I please 
But I still hold my hip each time I sneeze 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

Oh, The goose, the golden grams 
And all the flock is fleeced 
And as a man comes up short of ram 
His memory's increased 
A trying situation over rated 
And gone is comedy 
And I've been quoted for the criminal suggestions that were made to me 
And by your other people's projects 
You are mostly trusted and complex 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

And I can catch and I can ground in 
These awkward places that I found 
And damn they're looking ugly to me 
Damn they're looking ugly to me 

Now 
It's all of me please don't 
And all you didn't know 
You hush your mind you won't 
How little you have grown 
And I'm still alone 
But you're good looking 

You're good looking

Oh, my, but you have a pretty face
You favor a girl that I knew
I imagine that she's still in Tennessee
And by God, I should be there, too
I've a sadness too sad to be true

But I left Tennessee in a hurry, dear
In the same way that I'm leaving you
Because love is mainly just memories
And everyone's got him a few
So when I'm gone, I'll be glad to love you

At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
You were literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
There's no telling who will be there

When I leave it'll be like I found you, love
Descending Victorian stairs
I'm feeling like one of your photographs
Trapped while I was putting on airs
And gettin' even by sayin', "who cares?"

At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
You were literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
There's no telling who will be there

So have all of your passionate violins
Play a tune for a Tennessee kid
Who's feeling, like leaving another town
With no place to go if he did
'Cause they'll catch you wherever you're hid

At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
You were literally waltzing on air
At the brand new Tennessee Waltz
There's no telling who will be there

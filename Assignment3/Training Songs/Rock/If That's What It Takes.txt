How do I please you
How do I please you
How do I please you
How do I please you
Girl, in your one way heart
In your one track mind
How do I please you
How do I please you
Oh, when I say that you're the only one
I'm not tryin' to fool you, baby
Well, I'm only here to get the job done
'Cause you're so used to getting what you want
Well, look no further, baby

[Chorus:]
If that's what it takes
I don't need to know anymore
Ain't no doubt about it
That's what I came here for
So how do I please you
How do I please you
Girl, in your one way heart
In your one track mind
How do I please you
How do I please you

Well, I don't know much about the life you lead
But it ain't enough just to offer my heart
Girl, I know I could get you what you need
'Cause you're so use to getting what you want
Well, look no further, baby

[Chorus:]
If that's what it takes
I ain't gonna lose any time
Whatever you want from me, baby
Whatever it takes to make you mine

Monday Friday
 Weekday Holiday Yeah
 Every single empty day
 You're on my mind 
 Yeah, you are my mind
 Ireland Germany
 When I'm away you, I say
 Every lonely place I go 
 You're on my mind
 Oh yeah, you're on my mind
 I tried forgettin' you
 Tried to maintain my cool
 But the existence of you affects my life
 If you would forget the past
 And maybe someday take me back
 I'd rest easy in my bed tonight
 You know I'd say now
 Daytime nighttime
 Good times bad times
 When I was down and showed up B.
 You're on my mind
 Oh yeah, you're on my mind
 I tried forgettin' you girl
 Tried to maintain my cool, yeah
 But your existence affects my life
 Baby, if you would forget the past 
 And maybe take me back
 I'd rest easy in my lonely bed tonight
 You know I mean it 
 Monday Friday
 Weekday Saturday
 Holiday Yeah
 Every single empty day
 You're on my mind 
 Oh yeah, you are my mind
 Yeah you're on my mind

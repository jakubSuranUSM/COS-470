Walk little walk
Small talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
'Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe two gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm going to kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, yeah I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me, stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things

I run they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride boat ride piggy back ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride
One two three close your eyes and count to four
I gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayon on the walls
Color on the wall
I'll draw until I've broken every law

I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things

Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop

Don't stop, don't stop don't stop don't stop
Talking with me, stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things, stop don't stop don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop me

[Chorus]
Well I-I, I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your man
I want you to understand

And I-I, I wanna open your door
And love you 'til you're sore
That works for, wait a minute, wait a minute!
Yeah

I wanna be your thing, your anything your everything oh yeah

And I-I, I wanna fill your cup (cup cup cup)
Fill it up, fill it up to the brim with love
That works for, wait a minute, wait a minute!

You'll never have to ask
I'll give you my sweet grass
I'm gonna mesmerize your ass
Just give me my first chance, it's gonna be the last
I'm gonna make you wanna stay

I-I I wanna be your cow
Give you all the milk around town
Let me see, let me see you drink it down
I-I, I wanna be the pear tree
I want you to climb all over me
Try my fruit and taste my seed

Climb right on me, lay it on me
C-climb right on me, l-lay it on me!

Just let my do my thing
Until you start to sing
I'm going down all you night long
I'm gonna build a bond
I'm pullin' out my wand
Feels so right it can't be wrong!

Yeah!

[Chorus]

And I-I, I wanna be you lover baby
I wanna be your girl
Blow a kiss and change the world, yeah

We're gonna make it through
You got me and I got you
Your bleedin' heart's at my command
If you don't love me to
Then bein' friends will do
Long as you let me in your bed!

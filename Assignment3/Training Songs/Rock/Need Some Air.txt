You wanna pick somethin' up, you've gotta lay it down
You wanna turn somethin' on, you gotta set it off
You wanna let something in, you've gotta tear it out
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air

The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna feel the light, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground
I just need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

You wanna lift somethin' up, you've gotta pin it down
You wanna pull somethin' in, you gotta let it out
You wanna light something up, you've gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air

The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna turn it on, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground
I just need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

You wanna pick somethin' up, you've gotta lay it down
You wanna turn somethin' on, you gotta set it off
You wanna light somethin' up, you've gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air
I need some air, I need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

It's not the prayer you repeat at night, oh
It's not the saint that has seen the light, oh
It's just the breath that you hold inside, oh
Just keep your cool, it will be alright, oh

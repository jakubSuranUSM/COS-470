Stop kissing me, I told you alright
It doesn’t have to be this way
Stop kissing me, turn on the light
I know I’m gonna have to pay 

'Cause some maybe missed her (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And you say I'll be a headlong man, and that’s hideous
And something got me stumbling like I’d poke under one
But you just keep on kissing like their ain’t nothing wrong
So hey, stop kissing me, 'cause I know I couldn’t treat you right 

Stop kissing me I told you alright
It never had to be so bad
From your head to your backbone
I'm gonna make you kiss me, well

I made a mixture (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I know I’ve done something bad (oh yeah yeah yeah)
And quaking in your boots, and you're carrying on
'cause you don’t know what's happening when the kissings begun 
So hey, stop kissing me, 'cause you know I couldn’t treat you right
'cause you know I couldn’t treat you right 

Well you made a mixture (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I know I’ve done something bad, oh oh oh
And quaking in your boots, with your carrying on
Why such a big mistake, I felt the kissing is gone 

So hey, stop kissing me 'cause you know I couldn't treat you right
So hey, stop kissing me 'cause you know I couldn't treat you
So hey, stop kissing me 'cause you know I couldn't

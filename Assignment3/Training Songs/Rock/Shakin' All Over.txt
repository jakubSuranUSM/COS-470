When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the chills all over me
Quivers down my backbone
Got me shaking in my thigh bone
Shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Every time you say goodnight to me
Brings this feelin' oh inside of me
Quivers down my backbone
Put the shaking in my thigh bone
Shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Quivers down my backbone
Yeah the shakes in my knee bone
I got the tremors in my thigh bone
Shakin' all over

When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the chills all over me
Quivers down my backbone
Got me shaking in my thigh bone
Shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Shake shake shake
Shake shake shake
Shake shake shake
Shake shake shake

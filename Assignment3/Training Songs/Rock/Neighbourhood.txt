Who lives in a house like this?

In number 69 there lives a transvestite
He's a man by day
But he's a woman at night
There's a man in number 4 who swears he's Saddam Hussein
Say's he's on a chore to start
The Third World War

Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood

In 110 they haven't paid the rent
So there goes the TV with the
Repo men
In 999 they make a living from crime
The house is always empty 'cause they're
All doing time

Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood

In number 18 there lives a big butch queen
He's bigger than Tyson
And he's twice as mean
In 666 there lives a Mr Miller
He's our local vicar
And a serial killer

Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood

Who lives in a house like this?
Who lives here man?
Who lives in a house like this?

Oh they want to knock us down
'cause they think we're scum
But we will all be waiting
When the bulldozers come
In a neighbourhood like this you know
It's hard to survive
So you'd better come prepared
'cause they won't take us alive

Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood

Leaves turn blue and the sky green
A little drop of dreams can go so far
I know you've got the anger of a burning sun
Say hold up just a minute, don't burn me down
If you burn me down you'll never find your way
If you burn me down, it's true, a little drop of dreams

Locked in a cage, for a really long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a really long time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time

Locked in a cage
Locked in a cage

All this time I've been lied to
You're always in between, I go too far
You know I got the anger of a burning sun
Say hold up just a minute, don't burn me now
If you burn me down you'll never find your way
If you burn me down, it's true, a little drop of dreams

Locked in a cage, for a really long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a really long time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time

Locked in a cage
Locked in a cage

Show us all what we have earned
We'll keep your words and show the world
A drop of dreams is all it takes
A drop of dreams to show, to show the world, to show the world
A drop of dreams to show the world
So show us all what we have earned
We'll keep your words to show

Locked in a cage, for a really long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time
Locked in a cage, for a really long time
Locked in a cage, for a long time, time, time

Locked in a cage
Locked in a cage

I know 
I've been foolin' myself too long 
I'm never right but always wrong 
Goodbye, Baby, so long 

You know 
You never let this thing catch on 
You never let me be that strong 
Goodbye, Baby, so long 

There was a cold wind blowing on the night we met 
The leaves fell from the trees 
You made a lot of promises I ain't seen yet 
And I ain't gonna ask you please 

We know 
None of us are gonna cry 
It wasn't even worth the try 
So long, Baby, Goodbye 

(Musical Interlude)

There was a cold wind blowing on the night we met 
The windows were rolled up tight 
We both asked for something we could never get 
Now I'll do the thing that's right 

We know 
None of us are gonna cry 
It wasn't even worth the try 
So long, Baby, Goodbye

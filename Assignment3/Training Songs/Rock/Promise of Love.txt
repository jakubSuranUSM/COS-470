Oh no you get so drunk that you can't tell
Or maybe you're too young and you can't tell
But you know, you know, you know that it's pretend
You know, you know, you know 'cause it don't end

Oh maybe you're too drunk and you can't tell
Or maybe you're too young and you can't tell
But I know, I know, I know that it's pretend
And I know, I know, I know 'cause it don't end
No it don't end

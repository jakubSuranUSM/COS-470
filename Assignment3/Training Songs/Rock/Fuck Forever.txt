How d'you choose between death and glory? 
How d'you choose between death and glory? 
Happy endings don't bore me 
Happy endings, they never bored me 
They, they have a way 
They have a way to make you pay 
And to make you toe the line 
Sever the ties 
Oh I'm so clever 
But clever ain't wise 
F*ck forever 
If you don't mind 
I'm stuck forever 
Stuck in your mind 

How'd you choose between death and glory? 
But I musta choose between death and glory? 
New Labor and Tory 
Purgatory and happy families 

Oh, we won't have a say 
We won't have a say, no 
We won't have a say 
Won't have a say 
Oh they'll have a way 
They'll find a way to make you pay 
And to make you toe the line 
Sever the ties 
Oh, you're so clever 
But you're not very nice 
So f*ck forever 
If you don't mind 
F*ck forever 
If you don't mind 

They, they'll find a way 
Find a way to make you pay 
And to make you toe the line 
Sever the ties 
I'm stuck forever 
And that is your mind 
F*ck forever 
I'm out of your mind 
F*ck forever 
I'm out of your mind

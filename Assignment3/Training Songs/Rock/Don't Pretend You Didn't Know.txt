Waiting on the top
All the people all the time
Waiting as a crew
Don't pretend you didn't know
I know is no end
I know a sick game

Waiting on the top
All the people thinking 
Waiting not to shoot
I got off, but 
I know, know, know
I know, know, know

Calling all the time..
Feeling back  and deeper, deeper, deeper
Running for a sign
I'm back to changing facts
Will say that she's a  she's a keeper

Waiting as a crew

Don't pretend cause I don't know
Waiting not to do
Not the way I feel this is
I know it's far from 
I know it I know

Crying all the time,
Discharge is a sign
Can't only  if that look is gonna last the end 
I'm on the ride, don't let me 

Waiting on the shelf
I don't need it, what it is?
Waiting, easy friend
Not despite what you just said
I know 
Waiting, waiting, waiting!
Waiting, waiting, waiting!

[Chorus]
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife,
Somebody stole my wife, yeah they did,
Somebody stole my wife, yeah,
Somebody stole my wife,
Somebody stole my wife.

I went away one weekend, When I came back she'd left me,
And I cried every night, Somebody stole my wife.

I never thought she'd leave me, Never thought she would deceive me,
But I was wrong not right, Somebody stole my wife.

My nights are getting longer, And my love is getting stronger,
I've lost my appetite, Somebody stole my wife.

I can't get my boots clean, You know just what I mean,
And my shirts are not white, Somebody stole my wife.

Here's comes the rumour mill
and I'm not even trying
It's a game of cat and mouse
but I can't tell who's lying
He's spreading rumours

You can tell by the way I walk
That I am frightened
They're bearing down on me
What have I done to spite them?

They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
Can't hear myself over the sound of the chatter
They keep on lying to you, they keep on lying to you

Here comes the vango man
It seems he's delirious
He keeps mocking me
I can't tell if he's serious
He's serious!

Have you seen how he jokes and he smiles?
Yet he sleeps like a child

Tall tales cliques and whispers
Tell of secret kisses

They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
Can't hear myself over the sound of the chatter
They keep on lying to you, they keep on lying to you

Here comes the bitter pill
But I don't think he'll take it
I won't take it
Like you I'm scared of everything they're saying
But I know there's no other way, there's no other way

Tall tales cliques and whispers
Tell of secret kisses

They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
Can't hear myself over the sound of the chatter
And you'll be sorry when you...

They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
They keep on lying like they won't really matter
And then those lies they just scatter and scatter
Can't hear myself over the sound of the chatter
They keep on lying to you 
And you'll be sorry when you came to your senses!

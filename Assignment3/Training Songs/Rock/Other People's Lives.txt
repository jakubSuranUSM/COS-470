This is how it seems to be
Other people's lives seem more interesting 'cause they ain't mine
Well I'm fed up and I need to go
Out of existence or just down the road forever
Later that night on the side of the road
I'm outta gas and I should have known better
Well a guy shows up he's 25 years old
Always stealing kisses, such a mama's boy
He said, and that's what he said
He's been in the army and he did some speed
He went down to Thailand, and he did the did the deed
Oh yeah, he did it for the boys
A cop shows up, way damn late
I was excited, but usually I hate to see them
Other people's lives
Seem more interesting
'cause they ain't mine
Other people's lives
Seem more innocent
'cause they ain't mine
Later that night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better, yeah
I'm fed up and I need to go
Out of existence or just down the road forever, oh yeah
Well a guy shows up he's 25 years old
Always steals kisses, such a mama's boy
He said, and that's what he said
Palm tree houses
I was excited but usually I hate to see them, yeah

On the road
Out of road
Going out
Out of gas
Out of road
Out of car
Out of everything at last
Out, out rent a car
Got yourself a crazy walk
Said, bowlegged walk
Late at night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better, oh yeah
Palm tree houses, way down lane
I was excited but usually I hate to see them, yeah

Out of gas
And nothing left

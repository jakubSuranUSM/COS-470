I can't get to sleep.
I think about the implications
Diving in too deep.
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
Perhaps it's just imagination
Day after day
It reappears
Night after night
My heartbeat shows the fears
Ghosts appear and fade away
I'm know between the sheets
But it only brings exasperation
It's time to wake the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nummifies the night 
From overkill
Day after day
It reappears
Night after night
My heartbeat shows the fears
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day
I can't get to sleep.
I think about the implications
Diving in too deep.
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be alright
It's just overkill?

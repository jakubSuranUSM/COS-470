Said the momma to the baby in the corn 
You are my first born 
You shall here on in be known as The Spotlight Kid 
And the mornin' cry of the rooster 
The baby lay alone 
And the old cow in the green grass 
Shed white tears in the red hot sun 
And The Spotlight Kid stood under the moon that evenin' 
Givin' her alibis and eatin' her a la modes 
And the green frogs croakin' around his abode 
And the mud cat pond by the old willow road 
All night the village waited and The Spotlight Kid never showed 
She was up on the mountain 
Tellin' her alibis and eatin' her a la modes 
Momma still knew she was the one 
She was the one who stole the pie from old Momma Eye 
Window bare rockin' chair groanin' like a grizzly bear 
And the ice cream searchin' high and low 
For his a la modes for his a la modes 
All night the village waited and The Spotlight Kid never showed 
She was up on the mountain tellin' her alibis 
And eatin' her a la modes

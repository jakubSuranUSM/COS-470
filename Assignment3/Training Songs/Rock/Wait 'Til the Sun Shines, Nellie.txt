Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie
Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie
By and by

Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie
And the clouds go a-drifting by
We will be happy, Nellie
Don't you cry

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander
Sweethearts you and I
Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie
By and by

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander
Sweethearts you and I
Wait 'till the sun shines, Nellie
By and by

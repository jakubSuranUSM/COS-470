I got the church key
Moving in the night
Don't you wish you could live this lie?

I couldn't talk about
Filling up with longing
Pale horse, green eyes

'Cause I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and there's no way
I can see through you
I can see through
I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and there's no way
I can see through you
I can see through
La la la la la

Some people see you
To me you're just see-through
No one remembers your name
No one tries

And let you step outside
In the fever of evening
No one remembers your name
No one tries

'Cause I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and there's no way
I can see through you
I can see through
'Cause I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and what you are
I can see through you
I can see through
La la la la la

'Cause I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and there's no way
I can see through you
I can see through
'Cause I can see through you and I don't get it
I can see through you and there's no way
I can see through you
I can see through
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

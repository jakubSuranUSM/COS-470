First love, Last love
Only love, it's only love

First love, Last love
Only love, it's only love

Do you miss home?
Do you miss home?
And are you cool?
Symmetrical?

Oh Oh Oh
Let's get married
And tick the boxes
Oh lets get married
And tick the boxes

Do you wanna be alone?
Do you wanna be alone?
And are you cool?
Symmetrical,
Analytical
Hypocritical
So critical
Nothing's perfect, I'm hoping I'll do

Oh nothing's perfect; I'm hoping I'll do

My mistake
And no mistake
And I would take it back if I could
So stay with me tonight

I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it
Enticing with its leopard print
I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it
Enticing with its leopard print
And matching velvet duvet

First love, Last love
Only love, it's only love

First love, Last love
Only love, it's only love
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love

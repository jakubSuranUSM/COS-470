Well I'm standing in the queue
And I can't stand anymore missing you
And I can't stand the pain
Cause I can't get home 'cause of a hurricane
Dead set on destruction

There's no flights home today
And no services out on the motorway
And I can't leave the ground
And I can't find a place now to put her down

The Atlantic winds are high
There's only one virgin and she don't fly
And they can't land the plane
And they can't get home 'cause of a hurricane

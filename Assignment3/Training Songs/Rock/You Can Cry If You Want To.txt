You're the girl that 
I love best 
You're the one that hugs my chest 
Turns me on when 

I feel blue 
Doin' things You Don't normally do 
You can cry 
You can cry if you want 

Say goodbye 
Say goodbye if you want 
You can cry 
You can cry if you want 

You're the one 
Yeah 
You're the one 
You're the one for me 

We love the simple 
Things in life 
A country walk 
A summer night 

We carved a message 
In a tree 
I love you and you love me? 
You can cry 

You can cry if you want 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye if you want 
You can cry 

You can cry if you want 
But you're the one 
Yeah 
You're the one 

You're the one for me 
Without your love I could cry 
Without your love I could die 
I love to feel you holding me 

Doing things so pleasantly 
Kiss me in the special way 
At the end of everyday 
You can cry 

You can cry if you want 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye if you want 
You can cry 

You can cry if you want 
But you're the one 
Yeah 
You're the one 

You're the one for me 
You're the one for me 
You're the one for me

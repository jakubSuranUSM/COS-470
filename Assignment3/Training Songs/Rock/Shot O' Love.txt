Ah satisfaction...when you gonna show
Dyin' for some action...dontcha wanna go
Down to the mainline...betcha gonna crawl
Dance across the table...drink until you fall

When you feel it you gotta move
When you steal it you found the groove
Take me higher still it's not enough
One more desire to get me off

Shot o' love...

Steppin' out from undercover...we'll be oilin' up the fire
Gonna blow up your street...we go down to the wire
The scent is gonna lead you blind
Never know what you're sure to find
Gets you higher still it's not enough
One more desire to get me off

Shot o' love

When you step into the engine-room
Feel the system when it's all in tune
You push the power still it's not enough
Hands on a vision--gotta hang tough baby
The music gonna set you free
Roll it over when you turn the key
Come on baby--shoot me blind
Gimme everything...everything...lemme know you're mine

Shot o' love

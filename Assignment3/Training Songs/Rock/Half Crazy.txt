When you were locked up in your room alone
Neglecting even to touch the phone
Salty tears rolling down your cheeks
Like they had many times before

Did you fear that every time you speak
Would be the very final word that creeps
Between your teeth and off your tongue
Before you collapse of a broken heart

Well, I've gone half crazy
Read about you, about you
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Well, my left eye's gone hazy
Read about you, about you
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Every morning were you petrified
That nobody could ever pacify
The sinking feeling that you had deep down
That kept your heart on hold

My shoulder was an easy place to hide
I didn't mind cause I could pass the time
Counting the thousand little lies you kept
Inside of your broken heart

Night has drawn the curtain 
covered up their eyes 
the angels will not hear you 
your spirit starts to rise 
there's music from the bar 
drunken laughter down the hall 
is it pain or is it pleasure 
you are bearing through the wall?

`Cruising for a bruising' 
tattooed above the heart 
it'd take the strength of Mary 
to bold the boys apart
they flicker in their footsteps 
a voltage overload 
dazzling the dancers like they're
fixing to explode 
you find `em later lying in be road

  Granite years
  Harbour lights city nights and bitter tears
  (And you don't care where you're going)
  Say that I was foolish
  Say that I was blind
  Never say that I got left behind

Love you for a lifetime, but
I haven't time to try
if I loved you for an hour
it wouldn't be a lie
say that I was foolish
say that I was blind
a seller bought a buyer
and the buyer didn't mind
anything you ask I'll pay in kind

The wind is off the sea tonight 
it whistles through his soul 
the solitary copper 
hopes that God is on patrol 
a single star is shining 
across the evening sky 
sending us a message
they are waving us goodbye 
they are waving us a long long goodbye 
thousands of lightyears... goodbye

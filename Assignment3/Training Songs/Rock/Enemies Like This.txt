Anything we should know about your change? -- I was a prisoner in a factory
I can keep nothing for myself
Missing convenience 
Won't remember me at all
And now i'm relying on the well
I kept the questions to a murmur
You had an answer for them all
How am i take it home
How am i get you alone
How am i take you home
How am i get you alone
To remember why
They hung you out to dry
We're all alone
And unaware
You can't say what you want to say
?
I hope that you prepare

You keep on waiting
Listen
Turn around
I always say it's gonna change now
Scaring with fire
Despite, we don't go anywhere now
Scaring with fire
Despite, no one goes anywhere now

Can you remember why
They hung us out to dry
We're all alone
Beyond your half
You can't say what you want to say
?
I'll be too prepared

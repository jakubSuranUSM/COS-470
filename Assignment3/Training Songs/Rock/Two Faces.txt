Two faces of a girl
I used to know
One for where she stays
One for where she goes

Two faces side by side
One's like fire, one's like ice
Both for show
But what do I know?
All alone... 

Two faces of a girl
Inside a dream

One's for love
And one's for mystery

Two faces in the night
One's the shadow, 
One's the light
Both for show
But what do I know?
All alone

Two faces of a girl
I used to know

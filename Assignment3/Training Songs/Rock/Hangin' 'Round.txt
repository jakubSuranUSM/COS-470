Harry was a rich young man who would become a priest.
He dug up his dear father, who was recently deceased.
He did it with tarot cards and a mystically attuned mind,
And shortly there and after he did find...

Jeanny was a spoiled young brat, she thought she knew it all.
She smoked mentholated cigarettes, and she had sex in the hall.
But she was not my kind or even of my sign,
The kind of animal that I would be about.

Oh, oh, oh, you keep hangin' 'round me,
And I'm not so glad you found me.
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago.
Oh, oh, oh, you keep hangin' 'round me,
And I'm not so glad you found me.
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago.
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round.

Cathy was a bit surreal, she painted all her toes;
And on her face she wore dentures clamped tightly to her nose.
And when she finally spoke her twang, her glasses broke.
And no one else could smoke while she was in the room.

Hark the herald angels sang, and reached out for a phone,
And plucking it with ivory hand dialed long distance home.
But it was all too much sprinkling angel dust to AT and T,
Who didn't wish you well.

Oh, oh, oh, you keep hangin' 'round me,
And I'm not so glad you found me.
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago.
Oh, oh, oh, you keep hangin' 'round me,
And I'm not so glad you found me.
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago.
Hangin' 'round, hangin' 'round.

No sleep ‘till you pass, now you got to
(no sleep this time)
Motherfucker, say, I don’t wanna back now
No second chances will be hiding in the background
(no sleep this time)
The only thing you got to do is keep your head down

You say you wanna, you want it all
You’re back in future, but he won’t call
You want a future? Forget your past
Well, I got something more for you to answer for
24 hours and I’m lying on the kitchen floor
You wanna use me? Well, use me fast

No sleep ‘till you pass, now you got to
(no sleep this time)
Motherfucker, say, I don’t wanna back now
No second chances will be hiding in the background
(no sleep this time)
The only thing you got to do is keep your head down

Keep both your eyes light up, is used for an brent up
You think that is old and done? I don’t think I’m old
And I’m lying on the kitchen floor, lying on the kitchen floor
Keep both your eyes light up, is used for an brent up
You think that is old and done? I don’t think I’m old
And I’m lying on the kitchen floor, lying on the kitchen floor

No sleep ‘till you pass, now you got to
(no sleep this time)
Motherfucker, say, I don’t wanna back now
No second chances will be hiding in the background
(no sleep this time)
The only thing you got to do is keep your head down

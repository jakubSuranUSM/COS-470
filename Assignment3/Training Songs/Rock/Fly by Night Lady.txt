You're tellin' me that you ain't no fly by night lady
But I've seen you goin' down
When you thought nobody else was around
Well all your runnin' round is goin' to drive you crazy
You better learn to keep your feet on the ground

Fly by night lady, hey woman of the night
Do you think that it's alright, hey lady
When the darkness takes the night
You can fly by the night

You say you don't understand what's goin' on around you
But I know that what you say isn't really in your brain
You're out late at night, always looking around behind you
Since you've been flying by the night, you're just not the same

Fly by night lady, hey woman of the night
Do you think that it's alright, hey lady
When the darkness takes the night
You can fly by the night

Hey woman of the night
Do you think that it's alright, hey lady
When the darkness takes the light
You can fly by the night

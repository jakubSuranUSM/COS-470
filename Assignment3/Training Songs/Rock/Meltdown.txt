I look at my watch to find out
The right time of day
I look at her libido
Hey hey hey
Gotta get up and climb her
And run around the hay to roll her on the hey
Makin' her sweat, temperature rise
All through the day

Man it's gettin' hot hot hot
I said man it's gettin' hot hot hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man it's getting hot hot 
Getting hot around here

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

I can feel it in my bones 
I been rackin' my brains out 
All night long
Stokin' up the fire
Take it right up to the wire
Burnin on and on
Burnin' on

Man it's gettin hot, hot, hot
I said man it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man it's getting hot, hot
Getting hot around here

Yeah 

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

(my brains)

Man it's gettin' hot, hot, hot
I said man it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
Getting hotter
And hotter
And hotter

It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
Gonna burn
It's a meltdown
I said burn down 
It's a meltdown
Meltdown
Meltdown

It's a meltdown

It's a meltdown

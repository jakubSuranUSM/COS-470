I get a thrill outta playing with fire
Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightning and
Tearing through the night hollering your name

I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming and you wake up dead
It's a long night can I spend it with you
Cause you're oh so pretty when you stand on the edge

Oh little darlin' don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin' don't you like falling down
Through the sky like a diving plane
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

What is life? Only visions
When I die, I'm coming right on back for you
Who am I? An illusion
Would I lie? I'm coming right on back for you

Oh little darlin' don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

Oh little darlin' don't you get lonely
Look in my eyes gimme one more day
Real or imagined - what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

I turned myself unto myself 
And asked myself who you are
Well, you made me 
But what do I love 
When I'm with you
I wonder where your tongue has been 
Before you tasted mine
But you'll never let me know 
I've been bad and I have sinned
But you'll never let me go
I've done some grim things
I've done really bad things 
But I'll never let you know
It's you that I love 
In sleep when I'm awake
I won't think as long as you don't
I wonder where your lips have been
Before they tasted mine
Where have your lips been tonight?
You've wrapped a ring around my neck and
You'll never let me go
Do you think of me do you think of me?
Do you think of me when you are in me?
I just want to know think I ought to know
What you fell
Do you turn on me do you turn on me?
Do you turn on me like I turn on you?
Don't play tricks on me-don't you lie to me
Answer me

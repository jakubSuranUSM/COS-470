Find it hard to see you in the dark
I looked around
You were beside me

Don't you realize it's hard to dream
Without your helping hand to guide me

This could be the one, girl
If you will be my sun

Shine on
Me, shine on me
Let it shine on
Shine on
All I have to so is let it shine on

Please look about and tell me what you see
All noise and dirt and plastic people
Cause love is clean
And ours has been a bluer shade of jade
Than black or white is

Take me on a ride, girl
Right there by my side, Oh

Shine on
Shine on me, shine on you
Let it shine on
Shine on
All I have to do is let it shine on

[Repeat: x2]
Shine on
Shine on me, shine on you
Let it shine on
Shine on
All I have to do is let it shine on

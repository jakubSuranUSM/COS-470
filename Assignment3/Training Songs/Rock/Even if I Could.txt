Now I know just how you feel, it was real
When I broke your heart.
Now I know just why you cried when I lied 
And I broke your heart.
Now I know just how you feel,
(Now I know just how you feel...)
And I know that it was real 
(And I know that it was real...)
Now I know just why you cried 
When I lied (I lied), I lied, I lied.

But I want it understood 
When it was, it was very good.
And I would not trade away, 
Not a day, even if I could.
Now I know just how you feel,
(Now I know just how you feel...)
And I know that it was real,
(Now I know that it was real...)
And now you know just why I cried 
When she lied (she lied), she lied, she lied.
But I want it understood 
When it was, it was good.
And I would not trade a day, not a day
No not an hour of the day
Though she's left and gone away
Even if I could...even if I could.

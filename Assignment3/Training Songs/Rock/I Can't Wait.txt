I can't wait to shake this joint
No, I can't wait to fully illustrate my point
I can't wait to let it flow
No, I can't wait to bring down the house with my microphone

I can't wait
I can't wait to indoctrinate
No, I can't wait to retune everyone to the Brassy way
I can't wait to introduce

No, I can't wait for individual gurus
I can't wait
I can't wait for all the rest
No, I can't wait, this is for the ones who think I'm second best

I can't wait to see your face
No, I can't wait, looking like you've finally learned your place
I can't wait
I can't wait to throw it down

No, I can't wait to stun you with my lyrical know-how
I can't wait to show you what
No, I can't wait, what we're gonna do, when we o it non-stop
I can't wait

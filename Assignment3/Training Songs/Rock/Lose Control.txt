Lately I've been going through
One or two things that would make the nurses on the ward turn blue
Rabbit in the headlights with no place else to go
Can you pinpoint the place where you lost control?

Where did you lose control?
Where did you lose control?
You looked amazing, radiant like the sun
I was hold up in the hall of holes hiding from everyone
If I dried up, then I'll come back drowned
Welcome to this town

Where did you lose control?
Where did you lose control?

Rabbit in the headlights with no place else to go
Can you pinpoint the place where you lost control?

Where did you lose control?

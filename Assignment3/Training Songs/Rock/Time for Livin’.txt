I kicked off my shoes and felt the good earth under my feet
I loosened my tie and saw what it feels like to breathe
I found the secret to life
I took some time for livin'

I took off my watch and found I had all the time in the world
I opened my arms so I could hold life like a beautiful girl
I laid down  all of my hangups forever
Hey look, I've changed
My attitude's been rearranged
From now on I'm taking some

Time for livin', groovin' on everything
Life is givin', from now on I'm taking
Time...
For life

Too busy to stop and notice the things that are real
embarrassed to talk about all the things that I feel
It's so strange never noticed the world all around me
Hey look, I've changed
My attitude's been rearranged
From now on I'm taking some

Time for livin', groovin' on everything
Life is givin', from now on I'm taking
Time...
For life

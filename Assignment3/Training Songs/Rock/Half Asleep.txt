Sometimes I go whole days
Listening bored, half sleep
I won't say anything
That's worth a thing to me
One day, suddenly, time
Took a turn that once felt so brief
I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly

What begins as an unguarded
Train of thoughts slowly can become
An addiction to the slumber
Of disconnection and the resonance
Of memory that no longer has a shape
But keeps you numb through
The hours till gone is another day

Be aware, my darling
These things I say I mean
Are just traces of something
I long to feel again
I see our time expand
In the air almost forcibly,
Spreading thinner till it dissolves completely

Shoop-bop,shoop-bop

My mama told me she didn't like that rock and roll
I said,"Please,mama,please, mama
You just don't know I don't want
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)"

"Hang up my rock and roll shoes
You know I get that feelin'
Every time I hear those blues
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)"

That music's got a beat that will keep you alive
The kids are rock and rillin' from eight to twenty five 
I don't want
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Because I get that feelin'
Every time I heart those blues
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

Yes,I will do my homework
Clean the yard ever day
Yes, I will wipe those dishes
I'll do anything you say

They say that rock and roll will soon fade away
No matter what they say,rock and roll is here to stay
I don't want
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

Hang up my rock and roll shoes
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)
Because my feet start movin'
Every time I hear those blues
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

Let's rock
Let's roll

They say that rock and roll will soon fade away
No matter what they say, rock and roll is here to stay
I don't want
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

Hang up my rock and roll shoes
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)
Because I get that feelin'
Every time I heart those blues

(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)
Because my feet start movin'
Every time I hear those blues
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)
(Shoop-bop,shoop-bop)

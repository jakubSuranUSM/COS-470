I had my life
I know my place
I belong in your arms again
And I've been waiting for you
To belong to me

Some might say
I'm a silly woman to wait
But I know you still hold my love

Some people think that
I'm heading for a meltdown
That I'm sitting by the phone
That I worry but no

When I feel your body close
I burn up in smoke
And I swore I keep waiting

Now I see this city
Won't hold my love
For armini
I know he's close
N' I dream
I just keep waiting
I keep waiting

Some people think that
I'm heading for a meltdown
That I'm sitting by the phone
That I worry but no

This I know
She doesn't love you like I do
Yes it's clear
She'll never love you like me

You people say
That I'm heading for a meltdown
That I'm just sitting by the phone
That I worry but no

I don't worry cause I know

Me and Armini
Me and my Armini

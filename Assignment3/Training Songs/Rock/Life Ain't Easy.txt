Well here I am in the wind again,
Floating where it takes me
Laughin' and a splashin' in the summer sun,
Until the alarm clock awakes me

Then it's coffee and a kiss and two cigarettes,
And I'm back out in the cold, cold weather
Chasin' my dream but I just can't seem to rub two coins together
(Sing it)

Life ain't easy, they never said it would be
Life ain't easy, whoever said it should be
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy, tell me all about it
Life ain't easy, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, for you or me

That woman she don't understand, the way my mind keeps driftin'
And the Lord don't always lend a hand, when my poor heart needs liftin'
Is home and kids really all there is, or is there something better?
And how much soul must a poor man sell to rub two coins together?

Don't you know that
Life ain't easy, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy, whoever said it would be
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free

Life ain't easy, can you hear me
Life ain't easy, tell me all about it
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, free, free, free
Life ain't easy, tell me all about it

Life ain't easy, no, no, no, no
Life ain't easy, and nothing comes free, for you or me
Life ain't easy
Life ain't easy...

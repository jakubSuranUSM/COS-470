The day I had to tell myself
Don't you let her words sink in
She said I was in the wrong lane
On the wrong road
Heading for a dead end
I thought that you were right
For a moment
I almost took your advice
That lit up this fire
I made you a liar

[Chorus]
You always said that I'd be the first 
To give in
Never believed and pushed me away 
From livin' it
But all of your words and your memories
Just faded
I'll never stop
Now here I am 
Livin' it

I just got your letter
It's funny how your tone has changed
Like I wouldn't remember
Every time you turned me away
Now you think that you're the one
Who lit up this fire
I'll make you a liar

You always said that I'd be the first 
To give in
Never believed and pushed me away 
From livin' it

But all of your words and your memories
Just faded
I'll never stop
Now here I am 
Livin' it

Livin' it
Livin' it
Ya, I'm living it, oh yeah
Livin' it
Livin' it

You always said that I'd be the first 
To give in
Never believed and pushed me away 
From livin' it
But all of your words and your memories
Just faded
I'll never stop
Now here I am 
Livin' it

You always said that I'd be the first 
To give in (oh yeah)
Never believed and pushed me away 
From livin' it
But all of your words and your memory
Just faded
I'll never stop
Now here I am 
Ya, I'm livin' it
Oh, oh, oh yeah, 
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it
Oh, oh, oh yeah, 
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it
Livin' it

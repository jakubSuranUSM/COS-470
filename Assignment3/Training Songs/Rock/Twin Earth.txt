See the dead pigs on the highway
Not enough to feed my soul
You've had your chance, now you'll do it my way
All badges go down that hole
I'm alone in the buckets of a Mach one
And down inside I know you love me too
So have a beer with Christ or Hoover
Twin Earth's comin' down on you

Yeah, this righteous thing

Got a friend in the Belmar speed ball
Crushed inside my head for a year
Now it's time to tear some asshole
From revelation and straight to you
Hey Ma'am do you want my baby
Hey Satan want a hole in your head
The mighty ocean parts before me
I'm heading down to New Orleans

Yeah, this righteous thing baby
Yeah, this righteous thing
Yeah, this righteous thing baby
Yeah, this righteous thing

See the dead pigs on the highway
Not enough to feed my soul
You've had your chance, now you'll do it my way
All badges go down that hole
Hey Ma'am do you want my baby
Hey Satan want a hole in your head
The mighty ocean parts before me
I'm heading down to New Orleans

Yeah, this righteous thing baby
Yeah, this righteous thing
Yeah, this righteous thing baby
Yeah, this righteous thing

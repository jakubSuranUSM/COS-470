All the stones inside my head
Were carefully removed
By the doctor's perfumed scarlet hands
She delved in deep for your savage teeth
That sparkled diamonds fire blue
Eating me and thrilling you
The voices have now gone
I'm looking forward to living alone

Now it's time to say goodbye
I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words
So here's the jar of your hate
Returned complete, sincerely yours, fully restored

But peace perfect peace
Could belong to me I'd bottle it
For love's like the sea
They're hungry gods with careless hands
That wrap themselves around our lives
So hard to resist
They swallowed me, you swallowed me
I closed my eyes, I disappeared

Now it's time to say goodbye
I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words

No, I suppose it's colder when you're dead
Your violent gift, I bottled it
Now it's gone, I'm in bloom

Give me strength give me hope
Give me no-one new to hold
If I saw you lately what would I say?
Give me peace please walk away
You have nothing new to say
If I saw you falling how wide could I smile?

Moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easier mission
Holding onto how I picture﻿ you

Showing only bits and pieces
'Till the tide betrays you and your empty allocution

Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility
Searching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of it
Searching your eyes for humility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace
I'm still searching searching

Showing all the missing pieces
'Till the light betrays you and your empty allocution
Saw the Piper﻿ by and down the river
Caught his crippled alchemy
From pounding waves of adoration

Pied Piper float on down the river
Bloated carcass crippled me
The weight of adoration

Moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easy mission
Holding on to how I picture you

Someone's sleeping on the sidewalk 
As the winter sun goes down 
Someone's drinking cold champagne 
In another part of town 

And the only thing he thinks about 
As he sips his glass of wine 
It sure feels good sitting here tonight 
Now that I've got mine 

I've got mine, I've got mine 
This isn't such a bitter world 
'Cause I've got mine 
Someone's wandering the streets tonight 

No way to warm his hands 
Someone's turning up their fireplace 
Making travel plans 
His mind is on some sandy beach 

Where the sun is gonna shine 
He thinks "I don't have to hang around 
Now that I've got mine" 
You see them in their limousines 

You see the way they stare 
They don't see us looking back 
Because they don't really care (they say) 
I've got mine, I've got mine 

The world is as it's meant to be 
'Cause I've got mine 
So I make a small donation 
What more can I do 

You know I didn't make this world 
I'm in it just like you 
I've worked all my life on this house of cards 
To keep it all in line 

I can't take care of everyone 
Now that I've got mine 
There's another kind of poverty 
That only rich men know 

A moral malnutrition 
That starves their very souls 
And they can't be saved with money 
They're all running out of time 

And all the while they're thinking 
"It's ok 'Cause I've got mine" 
I've got mine, I've got mine 
I don't want a thing to change 
'Cause I've got mine, I've got mine

My feet plow on
From light to dawn
My empty belly and my body aches
Ain’t hard to take
Next to the weight

I carry in my chest
A pound of flesh
Could never tip the scale that I’ve made
I should have stayed
But I was never wise

I hear your voices in the wind that cuts the night
And I pray to whatever is listening things'll be all right

Oh, my boy, you're alive
Your heart's still beating
So don’t you mind, don’t you mind
We all drift sometimes

I can still hear your feet as you ran from the house
Knowing you won’t be back doesn’t mean that I will stop waiting
You told me then, hold me down, hold me up to the fire
But don’t you dare hold me back

Whoa

I see your face's in the clouds that scar the night
And I pray to whoever is listening things'll be all right

Then today I wake up feeling easy
And find I’m on the more familiar roads
I got a darkness wrapped inside me
But now it ain’t so hard to let it go
So keep a candle burning in the window
I’m almost home

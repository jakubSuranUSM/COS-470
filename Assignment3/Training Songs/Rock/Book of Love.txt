They say for every boy there's a girl and she's waitin' somewhere in this world
It's all been planned to someone up above and I know it's written in the book of love
Written there for all the world to see written there to last eternally
Night and day it's you I'm dreaming of and I know our names are in that book of love
Now I love you since the day we met really love you without a reason or regret
Night and day it's you I'm dreaming of and I know our names are in that book of love
[ strings ]
Night and day it's you I'm dreaming of and I know our names are in that book of love
Yes I know our names are in that book of love

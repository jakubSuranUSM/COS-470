Straight signs, crooked signals 
Strike down my stereo 
Heavens bending 
While the world begins to break 
Life is ending 
Time has come to escape 
Down to the chambers 

[Chorus:]
Drink this blood and we'll become 
Immortal baby 
This love is breaking the one last bond 

We chose the silence 
Hatred, cruel violence 
We should be ashamed 
We had a chance that we ignored 
Now its too late 
And its knocking on the door 
Ready to frame us 

[Chorus]

Surrender to my love 
And sacrifice your soul 
You're picturing the fate 
Its fading like a ghost 
Never say goodbye 
Never be alone 
Never say goodnight 
Never say did I 

[Chorus]

Immortal love is breaking the one last bond

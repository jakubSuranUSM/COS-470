Lost icka toe rest
Might like a sender doe ree
Your make a doll a ray day sender bright like a penalty
Exit ease my ray day member half lost a beat away
Purst in like a one-way sender
War give a heart like a fay
'Cause I can ford a red reed
Only street wide, a reed land
Diamond make a mid-evil bike
A sake like a reed caste
'Cause I can ford a red reed 
Only street wide, a reed land
On a reed land
Find a reed land
You sink my swan
Rolly get a worst in
Maybe minus way far central
Poor forty duck a pin
Milk maid dud bean
Master a load a head
Pill pop a dope
A well-run general hash pump gonna led

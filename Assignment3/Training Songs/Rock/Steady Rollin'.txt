You might have seen me underneath the pool-hall lights
Well baby, I go back each night
If you got a throat, I got a knife
Steady rollin' and I keep goin'

And I don't mind how quick the seasons change
You know too me there's everyone the same
The sweetest sunshine drips the drain
And it's comin' and I'm still runnin'

Well, I come from the old time, baby
Too late for you to save me
If I remain then I'm to blame
But if you should ever need me
I'll go where you lead me
It's all the same
The same old game

My love and baby, she's a ball and chain
I still can travel but my speed is changed
I bring the money, I take the blame
Steady rollin' and I keep goin'

But I shot my wife today
Dropped her body in the Frisco Bay
I had no choice, it was the only way
And it's comin' and I'm still runnin'

Well, I come from the old time, baby
Too late for you to save me
If I remain then I'm to blame
But if you should ever need me
I'll go where you lead me
It's all the same
The same old game

Out waltzing with the holy ghost
From the Bowery to the Barbary coast
The land I'm from you know I love the most
Steady rollin' and I keep goin'

And every day is just another town
The more I search and though the less I found
Me I'm a sucker just a slave to sound
And it's comin and I'm still runnin'

Well, I come from the old time, baby
Where all the kids are crazy
If I remain then I'm to blame
But if you should ever need me
I'll go where you lead me
It's all the same
The same old game

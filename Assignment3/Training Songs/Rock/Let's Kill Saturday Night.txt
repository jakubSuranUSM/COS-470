A dollar I make is a buck I owe 
And a forty-hour week leaves ten to blow 
But every game in this town is nickel-and-dime 
When the sun goes down it feels like the last time 
Down the main drag we ride with our engines roaring 
If there's a fire inside, it's the one thing going 

I got a Mustang loaded 
I got a wrong to right 
I got a little red bullet 
Let's kill Saturday night 
Knock it out of its misery 
Nail that coffin tight 
High living, it's history 
Let's kill Saturday night 

The little man's lot is a prince's life 
A prince with a lousy job, a prince with a working wife 
Something in the big frame moved, it never was so hard 
To keep a twenty-inch tube and a fenced in yard 
But give me one night with the moon high and the radio pounding 
And brother, this town's gonna go down kicking and shouting 

I got a Mustang loaded 
I got a wrong to right 
I got a little red bullet 
Let's kill Saturday night 
Knock it out of its misery 
Nail that coffin tight 
High living, it's history 
Let's kill Saturday night

Things weren't so natural in the beginning
We just let our hearts beat, this was love
We lived from one day to another, the difference didn't bother us at all
Then the day came, you took me home to your place
I still can see them stare at my face, oh
 [Chorus:]
We should not be apart, just listen to your heart
Different worlds keep us apart
Then, from that day on, things were changing
I could feel love slipping through my hands
You started listening to their talking, suddenly one morning you were gone
We shouldn't have lost, though we're from different worlds
But you should let love show you the way, instead of them

Love´s a surprise to me
Brings out the heights in me
That´s not the way it used to be
I used to be blue

Then you showed me the love of near
And that´s all I have to hear
I can´t believe that dreams come true
Till I run with you

Now I can´t sleep at night
Till I run with you
Till I do nothing will be right
I´m goin´ downtown takin´ in a look or two
Till I run with you
What else can I do?

You came one lonely day
It took me another way
I´d pack up my heart and run away
But I got some things to do
I´ll have to wait another day
Till I run with you
Oh, oh..

Nothin´ will be right
Till I run with you
Until I run with you
Nothin´ will be right
Till I run with you
Till I run with you

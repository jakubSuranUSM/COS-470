Things change
And people don't stay the same
It's all just one big game
Until I realized

She was the one
Who stood there by my side
God knows that woman tried
To make me better

But I let here down
And the fight was never fair
I took more than my share
And kept on takin'

White noise
Like the peaceful highway home
I grew numb to the sound
Of her heart breakin'

Things change
And people don't stay the same
It's all just one big game
Until you realize
That you gotta put some skin in
Give up everything you've known
'Til the thought of bein' alone
Don't keep you up at night
Things change

I wasn't well
My will was anything but strong
If there was a wrong turn to take
I took it

'Til all that was left
Was a shell of who I was
Burned out on love
Broke down and bitter

She pulled me out
My sacred siren song
She came alone
To spark the dyin' embers

Things change
And people don't stay the same
It's all just one big game
Until you realize
That you gotta put some skin in
Give up everything you've known
'Til the thought of bein' alone
Don't keep you up at night
Things change

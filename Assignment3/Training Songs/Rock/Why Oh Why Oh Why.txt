Why is it you must be so very cruel to me  in order to be kind  Why when I hold you close do you insist your toes  are being stood on by mine    Why when I kiss your lips do you astound me  saying that you won't put your arms around me  No one should be that cold  Whatever I've done surely I've a right to know  Oh why, oh why, oh why    Why is it every time we visit friends of mine  You never want to go  Why when I'm feeling good you act as if  I should be at an all-time low    Why after all these years we've been together  must you behave as if we'd hardly ever spoken  let alone met  It seems that you're happy as long as I'm upset  Oh why, oh why, oh why    Is it that you don't love me oh why  Have you had enough of me   Oh why, Do I have cry myself to sleep  Seven days a week    la, la, la, la, la, la......    Why in the name of God are you so angry  Could It be that you can no longer stand me  Tell me and I will go  You're breaking my heart just in case you didn't know  Oh why, oh why, oh why  Oh why, oh why, oh why

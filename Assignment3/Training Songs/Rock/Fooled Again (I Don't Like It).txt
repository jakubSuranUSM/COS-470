Tellin' me I better leave you 'lone 
Why won't somebody say what's goin' on 
Oh, oh, I think I've been through this before 

Looks like I've been fooled again 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
I don't like it, I don't like it 

You never said you had no longer to 
I need to know 'bout it if you do 
If two is one, I might as well be three 
It's good to see you think so much of me 

Looks like I've been fooled again 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
I don't like it, I don't like it 

You never said you had no longer to 
I need to know 'bout it if you do 
If two is one, I might as well be three 
It's good to see you think so much of me 

Looks like I've been fooled again 
Looks like I'm the fool again 
I don't like it, I do n't like it

Please keep your distance
Stay out of view
Avoid the tension between us two
I have my reasons
You have your lies
I'll keep my truths alive inside when all else dies
I don't even know your name
Yes to me you are all the same
Lies and deceit is your favorite game
I hurt you, you hurt me, I'll hurt you

Why don't you give me some room to breathe
You're always pushing me I'm begging you please
Why don't you give me some room to breathe
Don't share your values I don't want your disease

Please stay away from me
Why can't you let me be

You make a promise
You cannot keep
Knee high in bullshit
And getting deep
I'm antisocial
I'm anti you
I'm anti everything you'd turn my world into

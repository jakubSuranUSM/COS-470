Do you know what it's like, to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out, 'till you got no more

Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world

Hey man, now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything (oh sha la la)
And you really can't be wrong, you're game (oh sha la la)
Now you're really living, what this life is all about

Well I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill

Hey man, now I'm really living

Do you know what it's like, to care too much
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch

Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh cut grass
Thought about the moment and when it will pass

Hey man, now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything (oh sha la la)
And you really can't be wrong, you're game (oh sha la la)
Now you're really living, what this life is all about

Now what would you say if I told you that
Every one thing's your crazy old cat

Hey man, now you're really living

Do you know what it's like, to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out, 'till you got no more

Hey man, now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world

Hey man, now you're really living

Do you know what it's like, to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out, 'till you got no more

Hey man, now you're really living

Well I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill

Hey man, now I'm really living

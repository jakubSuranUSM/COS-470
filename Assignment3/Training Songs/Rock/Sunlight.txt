Have you seen the sunlight pourin' through her hair?
Felt her warm mouth on you in the summers, yeah
Runnin' in a field of brown
Laughin', rollin' on the ground now
Smilin' as she pulls you down

That's the way she feels about you
That's the way she feels about you

If your dreams can wake you screaming in the night
She can touch your face and take away your fright
Like a tree in the meadow wind
She will bend to take you in now
Makes no difference of where you been

That's the way she feels about you
That's the way she feels about you

If you wake up screamin'
Scared about what you're dreamin'
You know, she is there, she can share
You're aware she cares about you

In the mornin' wake up laughing with the day
She will smile and ask you with her eyes to stay
Like the sunshine warms the sand
She will touch you with her hands now
Touchin' makes you understand

That's the way she feels about you
That's the way she feels about you

Like the sunlight warms the sand
She will touch you with her hands now
Touchin' makes you understand

That's the way she feels about you
That's the way she feels about you, yeah
That's the way she feels about you

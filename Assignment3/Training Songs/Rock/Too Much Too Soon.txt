Stay in my arms, Cinderella, 
While the clock is striking I'll hold you 
At the stroke of twelve don't run away 
Oh, can't you hear my heart, it begged you to 
Stay in my arms, Cinderella, 
Maybe I'm that fellow Prince Charming, 
Since I met you Iâ€˜ve had one design 
Your wedding shoes placed next to mine 
Midnight of midnights and so divine 
Cinderella, stay in my arms!

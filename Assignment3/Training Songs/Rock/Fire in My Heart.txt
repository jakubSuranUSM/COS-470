I've got a fire in my heart for you
I've got a fire in my heart for you
I've got a fire in my heart
Though I'm falling apart
I've got a fire in my heart for you

I've got pins and needles for you
I've got pins and needles for you
You've got needles and pins
And the seven deadly sins
Still I've got a fire in my heart for you

I've a butterfly stomach for you
I've a butterfly stomach for you
And as the cars fly by
I just break down and cry
Still I've got a fire in my heart for you

Well the monkey puzzle tree
Has some questions
For the watchdogs of the profane
And I ask is it sad
That I'm driving myself mad
As this fire in my heart turns blue

Timeless favour, there might be strings tied,
Speeches, restless interrogation,
There lies on streets, lie there with me,
Catching fever, I don't think of life as out of reach

Jealous, fertile, cut from the safety of,
This life, these faces, I've walked in place at which point I'll ignore

A motiveless crime
I've witnessed

Timeless favour, there might be strings attached,
Catching fever, I don't think of life as obsolete,

A motiveless crime,
I've witnessed

Someone must have sent me to heaven
Blue madonna down by the pool
Just want to make her feel like a virgin
A version of herself that she once knew

But I just wanna watch her
Like a candle in the moonlight
Hotter than a blueberry flame
Whats her name?

Smoke rising in the distance
She glides in a swan dive
Cooler than a strawberry shake

All the rivers run back into the sea
But baby donâ€™t you leave
I only want you running back to me

Blue madonna in my head now
Blue madonna in my bed now
Blue madonna cherry red now
In this light

Blue madonna in my head now
Blue madonna in my bed now
Blue madonna cherry red now
Tonight
Tonight

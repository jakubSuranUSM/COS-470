Your soul a pit of stone, 
the depths I wish I could have known 
Dangerous, black and full of spite, 
thoughts of you fill my night 
But now we lay naked on the floor 
I'm lost, I'm drowning in your soul 
I was searching for some answer in your eyes 
I find malicious laughter and a love that has died 
You are haunting my reality 
Your lies are the only truth that I believe 
You are haunting my reality 
Now every time I think about you I die 

Hatred runs through me marrow deep 
I long to tear your eyes out in your sleep 
This passion can lead to evil crimes 
Do I kill you or do I choose to die? 
Acid burn etched in my brain 
Someone dies before I go insane 
I was searching for some answer in your eyes 
I find malicious laughter and a love that has died 

You are haunting my reality 
Your lies are the only truth that I believe 
You are haunting my reality 
Now every time I think about you I die 
Lies 

Soon now you'll be gone 
I wish to God I could've known 
I love you I hate you every night 
This longing for your soul has got me scared 
But now we lay naked on the floor 
I'm lost, i'm drowning in your soul 
I was searching for some answer in your eyes 
I find malicious laughter, hate and lies fucking lies 

You are haunting my reality 
Your lies are the only truth that I believe 
You are haunting my reality 
Now every time I think about you I die (repeat) 
Lies

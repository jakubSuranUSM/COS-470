Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' 'round the bend
Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' 'round the bend
Long as he keeps pickin', guitar trouble gonna corner the end

Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' down the line
Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' down the line
Long as he keeps pickin', all these people gonna feel fine

Well here comes guitar trouble, totin' down wire and wood
When he bugs after him again, ya know, you don't mean no good
Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' 'round the bend
Long as he keeps pickin', guitar trouble gonna corner the end

Sharon calls me Wally, Pritchard calls him Shane
He's a woman's pet, and the man's your vet
And the young girl's called his name
Pick up guitar trouble, guitar trouble comin' down the line
Long as he keeps pickin', all these women gonna feel fine
Guitar trouble...trouble...trouble...

Let me show you what I'm made of 
Good intentions are not enough 
To get me though today and this life. 
You're in the basement watching the TV, 

I'm on the second floor watching the ceiling. 
We sleep underneath the same big sky at night. 
I dream the same dream we can fly 
You can run from me 

You can hide form me 
But I am right beside you 
In this life. 
Let me tell you who you really are 

You're my comfort 
You're not a superstar 
I can reach up and bring you back down to the ground 
And give you everything you dream about 

You can run from me 
You can hide from me 
But I am right beside you 
In this life. 

I'll give you all the things that I never get 
Give you all I have and have no regret 
Take you to the places that I've never been 
Forgive you all the things that you can't forget 

Take away the pain with my healing hands 
Wash away your sins and set your spirit free 
You can run from me 
You can hide from me 

But I am right beside you 
In this life. 
Let me show you what I'm made of

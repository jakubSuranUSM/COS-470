Arrhythmia
Accepting that you live with uncertainty
If you're lonely press play
Die lady die
The aspects that you pass on when traveling
When you're lonely press play
'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me
To improve
Right here
When I'm lonely I press play

Swimming in blue
After new year into the mirror she flew
When I'm lonely I press play
Can I get any closer
One anecdote cannot not bring to you
When I'm lonely I press play
'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me
To improve
Right here
When I'm lonely I press play
Arrhythmia
Accepting that you live with uncertainty
If you're lonely press play
Can I get any closer
One anecdote cannot bring to you
When I'm lonely I press play
'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me

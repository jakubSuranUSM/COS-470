I'm sittin' on this train 
And I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
I'm sittin' on this train 
And I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
I've got my bag and I'm ready to go
I wish this train didn't move so slow
I'm sittin' on this train 
And I'm ridin' home, ridin' home
This train don't move 
Like it used to, ridin' home
This train don't move 
Like it used to, ridin' home
This train don't move 
Down the railroad track
Fast enough to get my baby back
This train don't move 
Like it used to, ridin' home

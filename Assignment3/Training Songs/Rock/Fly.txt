Alienated lying there with myself
Myself is someone else
There's no one handcuffed in the place on that day
Redo the day or die
That's all I think of 'but' for no lies I will deny

That I hate myself - that I hate myself
For all the blackened days that came with myself;
Caught ourselves
And I can't deny that I feel I'll die that I feel I'll die

If I can't - if I can't
If I can't - if I can't

Fly - fly - fly - fly away
Fly - fly - fly - fly away

Failures of the old unforgiven I am
I am told by myself
No one else fights to fall asleep
So deep the wound broke so deep

The cut it stings
It stings
I suffer in silence for my mistakes
Please cut me loose from my own stake

So I can - so I can
So I can - so I can

Fly - fly - fly - fly away
Fly - fly - fly - fly away

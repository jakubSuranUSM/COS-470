If you could see me now, blended in like a ninja
You'd wonder why you bothered
How someone, somewhere is already bored of you
And all I can ask, when I get back, that you could
Leave
The light on if you're not staying out

She says it's written in the stars
But I don't look at the stars anymore
I just want someone to die for
You're as good, you're as good as anyone
The right lighting and a little less distant
How distance eroded you
Did doubt fill up your shoes with problems you could
Dance to?

You should be wary what you listen to
How every song you love will turn into one note
That echos on everything, one note

Sweaty kids on pills aren't kids anymore
You're 24 and still chewing your insides out

We don't care what your scene's about
So many shows and no one turns out
All the girls in the front row stare at your hands
All the guys at the back bar talking shit about our
Band

You should be wary what you listen to
How every song you love will turn into one note
That echos on everything, one note

Some party scenes I wish to god I never walked in on
Some unmarked cars I wish I never stepped out in front
Of
You let that guy in your house
And now your house is on fire
And now your house is on fire

Took all your strength to hold your tongue
You have to make your own mistakes to make you learn
You almost prayed for a sudden ending
One note

This world it is not safe, 
We must make plans to leave this place, 
We'll build a colony, 
On nearby planets known to me, 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to all the
Ones I'll miss, 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to war and
Politics, 

No time to warn your friends, 
That they'll stay here and meet their ends, 
Sneak up without a trace, 
And start a brand new human race, 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to all the
Ones I'll miss, 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to war and
Politics, 

Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rockets ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 

This world it is not safe, 
We must make plans to leave this place, 
We'll build a colony, 
On nearby planets known to me, 

This world it is not safe, 
We must make plans to leave this place, 
We'll build a colony, 
On nearby planets known to me, 

I tried, I tried, I tired, I tired, I tried to warn
Them it's too late, 
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try my
Luck in outer space, 

Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rockets ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 

We won't need a doctor; we won't need a scientist, 
We won't need an army, or a TV we'll just need you and
Me, 

Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 
Farewell rocket ship, 

We won't need an army, or a TV we'll just need you and
Me.

Drift away let tomorrow have today
While your dreams take tomorrow
They don't fail, even when you fail
Restless soul

It drove you on 25 years ago
It'll drive you tomorrow
It can't stop it'll drive you till you drop
Restless soul

You're always looking for
A place your mind can rest
It's not there, it's not there

You feel like there's a curse
Putting you to the test
But you've been blessed

You're always looking for
A place your mind can rest
It's not there, it's not there

You feel like there's a curse
Putting you to the test
But you've been blessed

So drift away let tomorrow have today
While your dreams take tomorrow
They don't fail even when you fail
Restless soul

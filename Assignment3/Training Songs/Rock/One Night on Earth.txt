I shook from my dream, I wasn't here
To shake, shake from my own sight
Shake, shake from the light of everything
Shake, shake for that which sinks but can't drown

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away is to back down

I'm not so alone in here tonight
The light shines off the pennies in the street
And love feels such a plausible delight
And now I've learnt the lyrics in full to Auld Lang Sine

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away is to back down

Now the wolves all howl
And the birds all sing it
"She backed down"

Now the wolves all howl
And the birds all sing it
"He backed down"

Now the wolves all howl
And the birds all sing it
"He backed down"

The wolves all howl
And the birds all sing it
"She backed down"

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away is to back down

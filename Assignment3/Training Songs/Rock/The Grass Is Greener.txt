I had the world when you were mine
But I threw it away
I thought the grass was greener there
Where I wandered one day
I left your arms for someone else
But he was never true
I thought the grass was greener there
Now here am I so blue

Now another, now another, holds your hand
And there's nothing, there's nothing left for me
And it hurts so much to see her stand
Where I once used to be
It breaks my heart when you walk by
So near and yet so far
And the grass is really greener there
For that's just where you are
I know the grass is greener there
For that's just where you are

There's something I'd like to see
From God's home movie
The story of the universe
And my baby.
I'd see you as a child
Playing by the sea
Just like the stories you've told
From memory.
I watch the course of your life
Like watching the beads fall
From broken thread.
I know you now that you've grown,
Going your own sweet way,
A way I love.
I'm only looking
Looking for you.
This is the story
Story of you.
I have a love I'll keep forever.
This is the story
Story of you.
This is the story.
There's something I'd like to see
From God's home movie
The story of the universe
And my baby.
I'd see discoveries made
Fire and flat earth.
Columbus sailing the sea
or how Noah survived
Or when God was a girl.
Rewind and freezing the frame
On heroes and martyrs
And empires' rise and fall.
There's still the future to see.
The story continues of me and my baby.

Am in chains you’re in chains too I wear uniforms, you wear uniforms too 
I'm a prisoner, you’re a prisoner too Mr Jailer

I have fears you have fear too I will die, you sef go die too 
Life is beautiful don’t you think so too Mr Jailer

Am talking to you jailer Stop calling me a prisoner 
Let he who is without sin be the first to cast the stone Mr Jailer

You suppress all my strategy 
You oppress every part of me 
What you don’t know, you’re a victim too Mr Jailer

You don’t care about my point of view 
If I die another will work for you 
So you threat me like a modern slave Mr Jailer

You don’t care about my point of view 
If I die another will work for you 
So you threat me like a modern slave Mr Jailer

If you walking in a market place 
Don’t throw stones 
Even if you do you just might hit 
One of your own 
Life is not about your policies 
All the time 
So you better rearrange your 
Philosophies and be good to your fellow man jailer

I hear my baby say I wan be president 
I wan chop money 
From my government 
What he don’t know 
Be say Mr Jailer

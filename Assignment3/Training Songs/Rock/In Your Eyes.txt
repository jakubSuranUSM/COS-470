I can hardly taste the wine, I'm homesick
And if you see me down, walk away, walk away
I can hear it in your voice, in your voice
I can feel it in your heart, in your heart

And if you want to go
Then I'll let you go now, you don't have to stay
Sometimes I get tired
And I know you've got to find your own way
I see it in the sky, I'll see it in your eyes

The point I'm trying to make is
I'm changing my mind
The politics of life are obscure
I can sense it in your smile, in your smile
I can touch it from afar, from afar

Someday soon I'll leave this City
Someday soon I'll find a new place
Back to the country, the scenic life
Where I intend to cut myself off

And if you want to go
Then I'll let you go now, you don't have to stay
Sometimes I get tired
And I know you've got to find your own way
I see it in the sky, I'll see it in your eyes

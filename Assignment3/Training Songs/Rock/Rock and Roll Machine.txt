Tonight, tonight, everybody's at the show
The girls, and boys, came to hear the Rocket blow
You can't stop when the Rocket's playin'
Everybody jump and shout
Let's Rock 'n' Reel in, anyway you feel it, that's what this is all about

[Chorus]
Rock 'n' Roll Machine, faster then you've ever seen
Rock 'n' Roll Machine, all those just a'lookin at you

Ooh baby, you crazy, if you try to steal the show
Get set, get ready, time to watch the Rocket blow
Rock and Roll Machine plays faster, easy as a'ringin a bell
Fireball steamer, Heavy Metal screamer, playin'licks hotter then hell

[Chorus]

Tonight, tonight, everybody's at the show
The girls, and boys, came to hear the Rocket blow
You can't stop when the Rocket's playin'
Everybody jump and shout
Let's Rock 'n' Reel in, anyway you feel it, that's what this is all about

[Chorus]

Rock 'n' Roll Machine, faster then you've ever seen
Rock 'n' Roll Machine, everybodys just a'lookin at you

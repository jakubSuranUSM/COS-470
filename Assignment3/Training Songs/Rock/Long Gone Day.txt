So much blood I'm starting to drown
It runs from cold to colder
Time to time the skies come down
And help me lose my way
Tears and lies for answers
You and open veins
God knows I'm gone
Girl I just want you to
Come on down
Lord there's a storm in my head and if all these Sins are mine and I've done wrong 
Though they come on down
Long gone day
Oh whoever said we'd wash away with the rain
See you all from time to time
Isn't it so strange how far away we all are now
Am I the only one who remembers that summer
Oh I remember everyday each time a place was saved
The music that we made
The wind has carried all of that away
Long gone day 
Mmmmmmmm whoever said we'd wash away with the rain
So many tears I'm startin to drown
The rains in heaven must all come down
Silver spoons that fix the crown
The luckless ones are broken
Fears and lies for answers
You and open flames
God knows I'm gone and I just want you to come on down
Lord there's a storm in my head and if all these Sins are mine and I've done wrong I want you to Oh I just want you to come on down
I fear again like then I lost my way
Shout to god to bring my sunny day

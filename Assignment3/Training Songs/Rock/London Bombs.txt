Drag me by my ankles
To the bottom of the ocean
There I'll stay forever
Until you come back from England

The London bombs

I stayed up forever
Tried to call your number
But you were lost forever
In the early days of winter

The London bombs

Dirty little town on the Thames is calling you away

I stay up forever
Try to find the answer.
In the sun I wait for you

The London bombs

Dirty little town on the Thames is calling you away

The London bombs

One day my prayers are gonna be answered
For so long I been hungry for something else
Where there's a will and there's a way
I work hard 'cause at the end of the day
The Lord helps those who help themselves

Hey hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'

Right now somebody's counting my money
So much they can't see the top of the stack
Where there's a will and  there's a way
Money's gonna find my hand one day
When it does I ain't looking back

Hey, hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on

Hey, hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down, but I keep on swingin'
Keep on swingin', keep on swingin', keep on swingin', keep on swingin'

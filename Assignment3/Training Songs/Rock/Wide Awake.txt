Softly the darkness unfolds in silent embrace
And the strange longing never sleeps
Inside of my head, for you
Yet, there's something in my nature
That makes this hard to say
Every second is a chance that slips away
Now I'm wide awake, I'm not sleeping, oh no
And this room feels like a cage, driving me crazy
And I wish I could be there upon your pillow
I can recognize the silence
As it hangs endlessly on line
And the words never spoken
Seem so little yet means so much

[Chorus:]

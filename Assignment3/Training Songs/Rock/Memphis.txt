Long distance information, give me memphis tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but i know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from memphis tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the mississippi bridge

Help me, information, more than that i cannot add
Only that i miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in memphis tennessee

Last time i saw marie she's waving me good-bye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Try to put me through to her in memphis tennessee

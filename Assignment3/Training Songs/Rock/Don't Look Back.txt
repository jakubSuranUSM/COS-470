Don't Look Back

Oh, there is a place where the wild men go,
When it's late at night and on the radio,
They're telling everybody, stay at home,
It's no time for you to be alone,
It is a place on the edge of town,
Just shining in a hell-fire light, (they're waiting,)
And if you're there, keep going on,
They're waiting deep inside, I'm telling you,

Don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to take your heart away,
I'm telling you don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to steal your heart away,
I should have known better;

Well Jimmy Pellin was a friend of mine,
But he went out there one too many times,
I saw him running down the railroad track,
And I tell you boys he ain't coming back,
The early morning is their favourite time,
To find somebody out on their own, (they're waiting,)
They're waving arms and flashing lights,
Standing out on the road, I'm telling you,

Don't look back, women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to take your heart away,
I should have known better, I should have known better,

So if you're going to the edge of town,
Don't lose in a hell-fire light, (they're waiting,)
And if you're passing, keep going on,
They're waiting there tonight, I'm begging you,

Don't look back, don't look back,
I beg you don't look back,
Women in the red and black,
Don't look back, they're going to steal your heart away,

I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better don't look back,
I should have known better.

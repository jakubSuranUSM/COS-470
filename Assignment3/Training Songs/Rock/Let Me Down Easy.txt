Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
When I rest my weary head
After all my words are said
When my eyelids close with the weight of a hundred years
Please Let Me Down Easy Let Me Down Easy
My boat can slip away into a calmer sea
Let Me Down Easy
I know there'll be nothing to fear
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
My body slips away out into weightlessness
Let Me Down Easy
Now I know that there's nothing to fear
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
When I rest my aching heart
After it's been torn apart
When my tears have flowed on the tide of a hundred seas
Please Let Me Down Easy Let Me Down Easy
Affection slips away into my memory
Let Me Down Easy
There's a better time waiting for me
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy
Let Me Down Easy

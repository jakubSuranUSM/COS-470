All alone, with no one to help or guide me
On my own, with no one to walk beside me
Then (then) you (you) came (came) my (my) 
Way (way) and (and) now 
 
You make it move - I love you girl
You make it move - Come on, come on, come on
You make it move
 
Thru the night, I just long for you to hold me
Sleeplessly, I remember things you told me
Come (come) on (on) back (back) where (where)
You (you) be (be) long 
 
You make it move - You drive me crazy girl
You make it move - Come on, come on, come on
You make it move
 
Then (then) you (you) came (came) my (my) 
Way (way) and (and) now 
 
You make it move - You drive me crazy girl
You make it move - Come on, come on, come on
You make it move
 
Thru the nightâ€¦
 
You make it move - I love you girl
You make it move - Come on, come on, come on
You make it move

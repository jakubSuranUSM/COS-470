​Our stucco arms are forever tied loose
Your velvet touch sends me back to the moon
Daddy’s coming home but mammas looking guilty
Brothers in the basement ’til he's thirty
Wolf child’s heavy with the weight of the world
Storing all his love in an adolescent girl
​
There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
Singing to the drunks like they're mom and dad
All we ever knew is what we didn't have

Never really knew if I did something wrong
All I ever heard was "it wasn't my fault"
But what good is truth if you don't understand
Nothing but a pair of calloused hands?

There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
Singing to the drunks like our momma did
All we ever knew is what we didn't have
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya

There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya

There's sunlight dripping off the apricot tree
Lost to the night tide growing in me
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
Singing to the drunks like our momma did
All we ever knew is what we didn't have
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya
I’ve been saying to ya

When you're ascending you glow
When you hit a dead end you know
It's not just a feeling you get
It's a feeling that you fight against
It's a feeling that you fight against

At the top you relax
You only wait patient the past
You're only filling up space
You only exist to be replaced
You only exist to be replaced

You only exist to be replaced

When you're descending you burn
Every death, every lesson you learned
It's not just a feeling you get
It's a feeling that you learn to protect
In time

You're only free on the ground
When you fall you never make a sound
It's not a feeling at all
It's not like any other feeling you call
Perfect

It's not like any other feeling you call
Perfect

When you're in motion you own
When you speed, every touch and tone
It's not a feeling at all
It's not like any other feeling you call
Perfect
Perfect

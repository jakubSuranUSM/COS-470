Every time Petula sings
One of her French songs
Every time Petula sings
One of her French songs
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done
My dancing days are done
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come

Do you recall the ball rushes
We would pick for my mom
Do you recall the ball rushes
We would pick for my mom
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done

Me in my only suit
You your best dress on
Meeting for the one night
Would last us the week long
Me in my only suit, You in your best dress on
Meeting for the one night, Would last us the week long
Now one night is only one night, leaving
Another six to go!

My dancing days are done
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done

Do you recall the ball rushes
We would pick for my mom
Just to see her face light up
After you'd walked me home
Do you recall the ball rushes, We would pick for my mom
Just to see her face a-smile, After you walked me home
The bull rush pond has been dug up

To be replaced by a road
My dancing days are done
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done

Every time Petula sings
One of her French songs
I remember dance halls
Up and down goes my heart
Every time Petula sings, One of her French songs
I remember dance halls, Up and down goes my heart
Getting to hear her voice, on the radio
Is getting to be so rare!
My dancing days are done
And I thought tomorrow wouldn't come
My dancing days are done

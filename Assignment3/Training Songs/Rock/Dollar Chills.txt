Could it be an honest lie
Crop our suits in business tiles
Cotton of the bathroom, sister of the night 
You’re best friends with the mirror guy

Everybody tells you that you’re something else
Well, guess we’ll see, time will tell
The only thing that people likely ever know
Is how to be someone else

Could it be an honest time
Spray your skin, retan in lines
Cotton of the bathroom, sister of the night 
You’re best friends with the mirror guy

Everybody tells you that you’re something else
Well, guess we’ll see, time will tell
The only thing that people likely ever know
Is how to be someone else

Dollar still gives chills and dollar still gives chills
And dollar still…
Dollar still gives chills and dollar still gives chills
And dollar chills
Dollar still gives chills and dollar still gives chills
And dollar still
Dollar still gives chills and dollar still gives chills
And dollar chills

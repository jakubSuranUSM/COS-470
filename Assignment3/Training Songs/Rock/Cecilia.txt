Cecilia,
You didn't wanna give your heart away

You tear apart with angel eyes like bluebells
With trembling hearts, you leave your empty shells

Cecilia,
You didn't wanna leave it all behind

Here I am
Flesh and bones
Here I am
Flesh and bones

Did he touch you?
Shameful and disgraced?
Did he rob your joy of the embrace?

Cecilia,
You didn't wanna give your heart away

Cecilia,
You didn't wanna leave it all behind

Here I am
Flesh and bones
Here I am
Flesh and bones
Here I am
Flesh and bones

You took me up to Heaven
When you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your beauty
Blinded by your charms
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

Now when you told me that you loved me
Well, then I gave my heart to you
Oh, well, I wonder if there could be
Any truth in love so new
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

The whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
But when I saw you glance at a new romance
You know my love came tumbling down

Well, you treat me kinda coolish
And you never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish
And because I love you so
I still get lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

Well, the whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
But when I saw you glance at a new romance
You know my love came tumbling down

You know, you treat me kinda coolish
And you never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish
Because I love you so
I still get lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise

Yes, I still get lost in a fool's paradise
So god-darn lost in a fool's paradise

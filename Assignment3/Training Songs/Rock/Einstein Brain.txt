She gave me a six month sentence
For not being charming towards her friends
With two hands you eat
One hand to greet
Everything she said
Sounded like a repeat

Since 1983 we did not once agree
So let's get busy throwing arguments like
"Good taste is equal to censorship"
But you can't milk a cow with your hands in your pants

Complexity
Of the human psyche
She's flushing my grey cells down the drain
Tomorrow I'll have
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)

I said "I hope to see you
The 23rd of june"
She said "there seems to be an illusion
That escapes me"
Felt like james cagney running outta coca cola
But you can't milk a cow with your hands in your pants

Complexity
Of the human psyche
She's flushing my grey cells down the drain
Tomorrow I'll have
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)

Take it away, Pauly

Maybe God wanted to make
Something ugly but in great shape
As a complexity
Of the human psyche

I used to go to the opera
I used to explain
It's good to explore
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
Einstein brain (Einstein brain)
My Einstein brain (Einstein brain)

Pre>lead guitar intro em bm a em bm d a bm then bm g

Bm g bm g
Crimson autograph is what we leave behind, everywhere man set foot.
Em bm f#m bm
War mongers laughing loud behind a painted face
Em bm f#m bm
Throwing titbits to the crowd then blowing up the place.

Chorus

Bm g
Hey lord don't ask me questions, hey lord don't ask me questions
Bm f#m
Hey lord don't ask me questions please!
Bm g
Hey lord don't ask me questions, hey lord don't ask me questions
Bm f#m bm
Hey lord ain't no answer in me. (solo)

Well I stand up for liberty but can't liberate
Pent up agony I see you take first place.
Well who does this treachery I shout with bleeding hand
Is it you or is it me well I never will understand.

Chorus then solo

Well I see the thousands screaming rushing for the cliffs
Just like lemmings into the sea, well well well
Who waves his mighty hand and breaks the precious rules?
Well the same one must understand who wasted all these fools.

Chorus

Ain't no answer in me no, ain't no answer in me
Fade on uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh /pre>

It seems the whole world wants to turn their backs on me 
Can't seem to find someone to give a little love to me 
(La la la la la la ooo)
Wonderin' just what to do, wonderin' just where to go 
Waiting here all alone, waiting for love to show 
Will love ever ever come my way? 
Looking for someone's love, looking so hard I cry 
Wanting someone to care, wanting as time goes by 
Will love ever ever come my way? 
I'm just like a lonely drifter, I'm goin' on my way 
Hoping that I will find love someday, some way 
Dreaming of love and fun, dreaming the long nights through 
Wishing on stars above, wishing sounds sad but true 
Will love ever ever come my way? 
[Fade]
(La la la la la la ooo)

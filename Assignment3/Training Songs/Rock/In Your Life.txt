Time doesn't have any exit signs, just lights that string you along
The vacancy you're forced to fill is only going to prove, only going to prove that you were wrong
And you're forced to listen, you're forced to listen, that you have nothing left

In your life, you had it in your life
You threw away your life
Throw it to me

Don't ever trust their projection
Just gonna lead you nowhere
Just gonna lead you into marking time
They say you should embrace the danger,
So cross the street into the traffic
You know you'll be okay
Just let them go on by
You're stuck with me, you're stuck with me yeah, I'm hanging by... 

In your life, you had it in your life
You threw away your life
Throw it to me

A road that only leads you, leads you under mine,
Gives you no chance to breathe

They threw you in the deep end and they left you floating
Stood on the sidelines and laughed at your place in life
Now you can't do the dog paddle and it's humiliating
Guessing games and calling names: undermined by love and life
Scattered sun and terror: doesn't make it any clearer
You can't say return to sender

In your life, I live in your life
I live in your life
And that's all that saves me

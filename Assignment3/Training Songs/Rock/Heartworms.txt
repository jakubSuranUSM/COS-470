La-la-la

Well I guess I'm just here to test your patience
'Cause you're so smart my tricks don't work at all
Is it my lack of education? Just tell me why
You never call

Behind your symmetry lies a fundamental difference
There are those who own the minds and those who crawl
No offense but, in between the lines I'm reading
Look out for your own, and you're gonna look at me that way

And it's true
So what can I do?

Everything you get's slowing your affection (what can I do?)
And maybe impress you with a song (what can I do?)
I'm trying to minimize the damage done 'cause there ain't no one like you

I found that postcard from that trip you took to Thailand
I remember studying all the words written in your pretty hand
The little lines and little curls that held a sacred meaning
Or so I thought, but I had it wrong

Now I'm trying to figure out when it was you gave me these heartworms
I feel them wriggling in my blood, gonna do me harm
By now I'd rather lose this losing feeling that came on when you cooled off
Started treating me in this friendly way

And it's true
So what can I do?

Oh won't you be still for a moment (what can I do?)
So I can push a feather through your heart (what can I do?)
I'm trying to minimize damage done 'cause there ain't no one like you

So what can I do?

When I get lonely to distraction (what can I do?)
Maybe impress you with a song (what can I do?)
No reason waiting round in your saddest dream, it never came true

La-la-la

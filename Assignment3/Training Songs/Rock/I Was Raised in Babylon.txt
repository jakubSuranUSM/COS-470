I was raised in Babylon
Our priests taught us how to worship the sun
Wo! Where did we go wrong?
They used to call us civilised - but those days are gone

I came to guard the Pharaoh
Bring him wine and women
Oh Lord! Where is he now?
We used call him the highest - till the wave took him down

I was born in the Holy Land
They told me it was by God's command
Wo! Where are the others from?
I thought that we were the chosen - I must've been wrong

I loved to march with the Sultan
And his diamond turban
Oh Lord! Then the world took hold
Let go of the rope of God - for a handful of gold

I used to serve the Empire
On which the sun set, never
Oh! Now times have turned
We thought our white skins would save us - then we got burned

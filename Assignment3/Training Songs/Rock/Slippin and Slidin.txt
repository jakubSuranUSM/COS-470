Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hiddin',
Been told a long time ago   
I've been told, baby, you've been told,
I won't be your fool no more !!

Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive  
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hiddin',
Won't be your fool no more !!

Oh, Malinda, she's a solid sender,
You know you better surrender   
Slippin' and slidin', peepin' and a-hiddin',
Won't be your fool no more

It's o.k, it's alright
All alone, summer night, with words you said to me
"Our lives lead other lives when all our senses are 
Revealed"

It's o.k, it's alright
In Hollywood, rivers fly
In Hollywood, the skies alive
In Hollywood, your fears come out to play

What have you become, a fool in love 
Around and around a million ways 
To get there 
We don't care, who would believe 
All those things we said that night

It's o.k, it's alright
In Hollywood, rivers fly
In Hollywood, the skies alive
In Hollywood, your fears come out to play

I love you

In Hollywood, rivers fly
In Hollywood, the skies alive
In Hollywood, change your life today

I had a woman
She had me too
She was subverted
Convincing youth
She was so loaded,
And mesmerizing,
I had to follow
Her black horizon

No, I will not kill for her again
No, I will not kill for her again

She had precision,
A perfect view
Clear out the chambers,
Seducing youth
It was so brutal
The way she moved
The perfect sniper,
One hundred proof

She took us to the killing field

It's just a heart she's stealing
It's just a heart she's given
It's just a life that's taken to
It's just a life that's taken
It's just your life that's taken
It's just your life that's given

There was a city
That we all knew
She stole its freedom
And then she flew
A broken angel
Inside the room
Took all the children
And then she flew

No, I will not kill for her again
No, I will not kill for her again

It's just your heart she's stealing
It's just your heart she's giving
It's just your life she's taking to
It's just your life she has taken
It's just your blood that's taken
It's just your blood that's taken

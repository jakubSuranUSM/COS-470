Feel so sure of our love
I'll write a song about us breaking up.
"The Traffic Lights on the Street of Love"
Have just turned red, turned red, and

[Chorus]
Man o'sand to girl o'sea
Says it's love you'll get from me
Man o'sand to girl o'sea
Says it's love you'll get from me

I want you back,
Say it isn't so.
Tears for certain there's no relief
I feel no better with wet cheeks.
And man I stand up to you
I feel it now, I do, and

[Chorus]

So we break up, you leave my life
Leave, leave me alone, and
Man o'sand to girl o'sea says it's love
Man o'sand to girl o'sea says it's love

[Chorus]

I want you back, I want you back, I want you back
Because I
Feel no better, Feel no better, Feel no better

[Chorus]

You're the one, the one I need, need in times
Times like these

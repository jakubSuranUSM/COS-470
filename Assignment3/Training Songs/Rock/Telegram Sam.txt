You-you're my main man

Golden nose slim
I know
I know where you been

P-p-purple pie pete
His lips are like lightning
Girls melt in the heat

You're my main man
You're my main man

I said Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet
He's just outta sight

I say Jungle face Jake
I said make no mistake about Jungle face Jake

I said Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet 
He's just outta sight

I said automatic shoes
Give me 3-D vision
And the California blues

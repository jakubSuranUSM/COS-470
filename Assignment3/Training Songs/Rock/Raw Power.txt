Dance to the beat of the livin dead
Lose sleep, baby, and stay away from bed
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
If you're alone and you got no fear
So am I baby let's move on out of here
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
Raw power got a magic touch
Raw power is much too much
Happiness is guaranteed
It was made for you and me
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, it can't be beat
Poppin' eyes and flashin' feet
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryin to tell me what to do

Look in the eyes of a savage girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you 
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I, baby and I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
Raw power got a healin' hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power, it's more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, honey, can't be beat
Get down, baby and a kiss my feet
Everybody always tryin' to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryin' to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do

Raw power has got no place to go
Raw power, honey, it don't want to know
Raw power is a guaranteed O.D
Raw power is laughin' at you and me

This is what I wanna know
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Oh, honey, feel it
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Raw power

Raw power
Can you feel it?
Feel it
Raw power
Raw power

Raw power
Raw power
Raw power
Can you feel it, baby?

You're no rock n' roll fun
Like a party that's over 
Before it's begun
You're no walk in the park
More like a shot in the dark
With clues left for no one

And all the boys in the band
Know how to get down
Fill our Christmas socks
With whiskey drinks 
And chocolate bars
And when the evening ends we won't
Be thinking of you then
Although the best man 
Won't hang out with the girl band!

You're no rock n' roll fun
Like a piece of art
That no one can touch
Your head is always up in the clouds
Writing your songs
Won't you ever come down?

And all the boys in the band
Know how to get down
Fill our Christmas socks
With whiskey drinks 
And chocolate bars
And when the evening ends we won't
Be thinking of you then
Even if your song 
Is playing on the jukebox

You want to party with the lights on
Come on I like it dark!
You always want to hear the same old song
Come on play another song!

You're no rock n' roll fun

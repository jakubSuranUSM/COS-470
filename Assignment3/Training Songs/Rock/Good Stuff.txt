Coming out of my mouth
Into your eyes
Not once, but twice

Choosing the others eye
Always why
Forever yielding
You should have seen your face
Can you imagine how I must appear

Let me do it for you
Let me do it for me
Let me give me some more of your good stuff

Help me out with my hair
How I have come to resemble those things you like No
Hidden seams are here

No happy faces
Guided by stellar voices

Now let me do it for you
Let me do it for me
Let me give me some more of your good stuff

We are the content
And we drink them all night
Out through a curly straw
Let's suck our poisonous juices! 
Oh, that's good
Let me do it for you
Let me do it for me
Let me give me some more of your good stuff

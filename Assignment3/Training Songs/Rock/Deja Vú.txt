Light globes wash up all along the beach
And they light me up with, and they light me up with certainty
But you calculate coincidence, and circumstance and turbulence
Gotta see what it is, and it's everything, and it's endless

Cause baby can't see through all this matter and make up and Deja Vú
Yeah we drift here alone, with nothing to do
Until one of us makes the other one come true

She wants to meet her fate, but travel by free will
But you can't have both and you can't stand still, still, still
I'll be the luckiest man in the universe if cause and effect doesn't get there first
But she keeps looking for patterns and the world just happens

Cause baby can't see through all this matter and make up and Deja Vú
Yeah we drift here alone with nothing to do
Until one of us makes the other one come true
Yeah one of us makes the other one come true

Yeah 'cause baby can't see through,
Through all this matter and make up and Deja Vú  	
Yeah we drift here alone, we drift here alone
Yeah we drift here alone, we drift here alone
Yeah we drift here alone with nothing to do
Until one of us makes the other one come true
Yeah one of us makes the other one come true
She said these questions don't answer like other questions do
So just let me be here with you

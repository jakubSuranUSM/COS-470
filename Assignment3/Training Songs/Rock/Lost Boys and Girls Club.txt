Avoiding my head
The hole in my heart
I fill them with things
Which all fall apart

I enlist the gods
And all the frauds
We are hand and glove
Daisy chains of love

There's no particular place we are going
Still we are going (yes we are)
There's no particular place we are going
Still we are going (yes we are)

I rise and shine
And I look behind
Your eyes are black x's
Of hate and of hexes

My soul of vapor
I'm light as a feather
And I bind together
The pain, the pleasure

There's no particular place we are going
Still we are going (yes we are)

Check your life span.
Do like ya want.
Fuse the power of now.
Fuse the power of never.
It's no apocalypse.
Just burn like ya don't exist.
My idea of fun.
Can I burn with ya?
As out there as anyone,
In the black hole dream.
I know you can still feel me,
In the black hole scene.
Do ya still dream?
Check ya pulse.
Read my mind.
You got the access.
Treat me like I don't exist.

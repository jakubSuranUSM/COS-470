Lady-oh, Lady-oh
I walked the streets again last night
I saw you in the city light
Like a vision, Lady-oh

Lady I, Lady I
I've been waitin' around
Such a long, long time
Believin' I could make you mine
Just wanting you, Lady-oh

But here I am and there you are
Much too far to even hear me
Hurts a lot, you know it does
It hurts a lot, oh, Lady-oh
Am I gonna ever learn
What I never learned before

City lights, city lights
Burn so warm and they burn so bright
But me, I walk the city night
To forget you, Lady-oh

But here I am and there you are
Much too far to hear me
Hurts a lot, you know it does 
It hurts a lot, hey, Lady-oh
Am I gonna ever learn
What I never learned before

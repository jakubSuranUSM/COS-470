You set the fire in me, see, see
It's like I've learn how to breathe easily
Photograph for a fashion magazine
It's just New York on a mean
I know it can't be easy for you
I know it can't be easy for you

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me

Like a hobbit you'd rather see me
Seems all I can do without is bleed
We should go down to the sea
It's just you, oh god, and me
I know it can't be easy for you
I know it can't be easy for you

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me

You set the fire 
You set the fire 
You set the fire 
You set the fire 

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me, see, see
You set the fire in me, see, see

See, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see

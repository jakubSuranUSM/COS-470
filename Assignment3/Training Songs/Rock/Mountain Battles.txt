My heart's so full and fat
Go get her
A mouth full of low [unknown]
A bog of faith
Sue a ballet [unknown]

Mountain battles
Indoctered minds
I ride shot gun
From the facility

Whistling blues
And shrieking luck
Oh yeah

Tonight
Rush shines a gloom [unknown]
My wilting heart
The shadow on the moon
Fantastic view
Thinking of things to do

Shrieking luck
Thinking of things to do

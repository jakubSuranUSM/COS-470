Oh Mr. pit
Oh Mr. pit
Mr. pitiful
Who let you down?
Who let you down?
Who let you down?

You still don't believe
You don't believe
You don't believe
That greed's for a show
Your soap box unfolds

But, please come down from that cloud
You see at all I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
Just wanna know how you've been
Don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Started it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends, to still be friends, to still be my friend

So where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
While I was out
While I was out
While I was out

Well I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe
Everything was seen
And if you don't like the movie then quit at me

But, please come down from that cloud
You see at all I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
Just wanna know how you've been
Don?t make me feel bad that we're still friends
Started it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends, still be friends, still be friends, to still be my friend, still be my friend, still be my friend

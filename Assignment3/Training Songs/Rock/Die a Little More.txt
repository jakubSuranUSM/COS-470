Why didn't I embrace
Those days you spent with me
For now when I look back in time
It's too easy to see

While I lived my dream
I was seeking a fantasy
And here I lie all alone again
Drown in memories

You're so far away from me

I live to love again
But it won't do you any good to see me 
When I die a little more
And all the vanity

Has vanished from my world
Just to show me 
How I die a little more

I'm bound to stumble
Every time I try to fly
Can't get up, can't take a breath
I fall down, I cry

No light in the end
Storm after the rain
Only thing that I've got left
Is the blood inside my veins

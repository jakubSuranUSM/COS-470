The joker is what they call me
My friends say Ive never seemed so gay
But if they only knew how much I cry for you
The laughter would surely fade away

The joker is always laughing
And so he's the gayest guy in town
He plays a winning part while memories crush his heart
Yet he goes on laughing like a clown

I tried so hard to pretend dear
That losing you meant nothing to me
But 'til you're mine once again dear
Make believe is all my life will be
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha

The joker, though he seems happy
Because you have found that someone new
But somewhere deep inside beneath his strange disguise
The joker is crying over you

Oh-oh-oh-oh - o - o - oho
That losing you meant something to me
Oh-oh-oh-oh - o - o - oho
Make believe is all my life will be
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha

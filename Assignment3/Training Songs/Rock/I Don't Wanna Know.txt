I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love

Sometime it gets kinda hard to listen
Hard for me to use my eyes
And all around the gold is glistening
Making sure it keeps me down to size

And I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know one thing about evil
I only want to know about love

I'm waiting for the plains to tumble
Waiting for the towns to fall
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble
Waiting till I hear the call

It's getting kinda hard to listen
Hard for us to use our eyes
All around the gold is glistening
Making sure it keeps us hypnotized

Yeah, I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
Yeah, I don't want to know one thing about evil
I only want to know about love

And I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know nothing about evil
I only want to know about love

Yeah, I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know one thing about evil
I only want to know about love

My lips just can't kiss enough of
My arms just can't squeeze enough of
My heart just can't love enough of you (wo-ho woa-a-ho)

We just don't seem to date enough of
Can't wait until we're close together
I know our little dream is true (woo-who who)

I see a gleam in her eye-hi-hi
I know it's time to say goodbye-hi-hi
Hand in hand, I walk her to the door-oor-oor oh
She won't go in til she kisses me some more

Oh, don't care for a diamond ring
Just you, you're my everything
My heart just can't love enough of you (wo-ho woa-a ho)

My lips just can't kiss enough of
My arms just can't squeeze enough of
My heart just can't love enough of you (wo-ho woa-a ho)

We just don't seem to date enough of
Can't wait until we're close together
I know our little dream is true (woo-who wo-whoo)

I see a gleam in her eye-hi-hi
I know it's time to say goodbye-hi-hi
Hand in hand, I walk her to the door-oor-oor oh
She won't go in til she kisses me some more

Oh, don't care for a diamond ring
Just you, you're my everything
My heart just can't love enough of you (wo a-ho woa-a ho)

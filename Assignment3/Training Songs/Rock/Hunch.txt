She's so small
Tiny and crushed up
Fifty four, the size of a child
Long pale hair
Her eyes are all red
She's got skin the color of bread
He's all bald
Crusty and oozing
Got six arms, lips like a frog
Great big hump
Tiny and hunched up
He can't speak, just barks like a dog
Don't come outside with those freak show eyes
Don't look at me with those freak show eyes
I'm not like you at all
Don't touch me, you must be crazy
I don't like the shape that you're in
The way you look reminds me of something
It's all because you're nothing like me
Don't come outside with your freak show eyes
Don't look at me with those freak show eyes
Just stay inside I'll be safe
Don't come outside I'll feel safe
Don't visit me with your freak show
I'm not like you at all

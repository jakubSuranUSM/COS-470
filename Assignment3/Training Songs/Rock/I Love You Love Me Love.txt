We're still together after all that we've been through
They tried to tell you I was not the one for you
They didn't like my hair, the clothes I love to wear
They didn't' realize that I was strong enough for two

I love you, love you love me too, love I love you
Love me love I love you, love my only true love I
Love you love me love

The things they said about the two of us were lies
I knew they couldn't see the sparkle in your eyes
They said I wouldn't dare to show how much I care
They didn't know that we were just two angels in disguises

I love you, love you love me too, love I love you
Love me love I love you, love my only true love I
Love you love me love

So here we are alone, we made it on our own
And though they tried, they can't deny
The way I really showed 'em

I love you, love you love me too, love I love you
Love me love I love you, love my only true love I
Love you love me love

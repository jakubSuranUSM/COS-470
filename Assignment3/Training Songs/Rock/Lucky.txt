I think it's a miracle
That you're laying here right by my side
Someone so beautiful,
Long brown hair, and your pretty green eyes

Maybe I've done something along the way
Sure seems someone's smilin' down on me
And I'll never have to look for love again

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh honey I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful, I got lucky with you

Sometime it takes a while
And other times it comes naturally
But I give one look at you
I knew that you were meant for me

You know I'm not gonna walk away
Be here tomorrow just like today
And I'll never have to look for love again

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh baby I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful, I got lucky with you

It's such a simple thing
But it's so beautiful
That you're mine, I'm yours

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh baby I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful

So lucky I found you
So happy I'm with you
Oh baby I know that
There's no mistaking I met up with you
And I'm grateful, grateful, grateful, I got lucky with you

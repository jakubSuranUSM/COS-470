Got no bags and baggage to slow me down
I'm traveling so fast my feet ain't touching the ground
Traveling' light, traveling' light
Well I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight

No comb and no toothbrush
I've got nothing to haul
I'm carryin' only
A pocket full of dreams
A hand full of love 
And they weigh nothing at all

Soon I'm going to see that love look in her eyes
I'm a hoot and a holler away from paradise
Traveling' light, traveling' light
I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight

No comb and no toothbrush
I've got nothing to haul
I'm carryin' only
A pocket full of dreams
A hand full of love 
And they weigh nothing at all

Soon I'm going to see that love look in her eyes
I'm a hoot and a holler away from paradise
Traveling' light
Well I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight

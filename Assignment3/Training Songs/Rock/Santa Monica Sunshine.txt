I'm traveling fast on a south down highway
Into the sun where I know that I can with my way
Movin' down the highway

A ticket to rise way down across the border
Into the sunshine of South California my way
Straight down the highway

Well, I'll drive, drive, drive
Soon I'll arrive
In that Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman
Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman

I'm taking the road straight to Sacramento
Over the long I'll soon in San Francisco
That's the way you gotta go

My way leaves Golden Gates far behind me
You look all alive I'm sure gonna find Miano
That's the way you gotta go

Well, I'll drive, drive, drive
Soon I'll arrive
In that Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman
Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman

Well, that's Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman
Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman

With that's Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman
Santa Monica sunshine
Santa Monica, San Jeroman

This empty space I've held so long
You come around, and now I'm warm
I thought that I was havin' fun
And now I see the way it's done
I thought we'd led a life before
And who we were, well I'm not sure
But one thing I know is right
I loved you then
I'm gonna love you tonight

I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

So don't take your time, it's gettin' late
We might lose if we hesitate
'Cause bein' free is lots of fun
For me, though I'm just twenty one
I got things to do, and things to see
Might even have to leave you be
But till that time, let's give our all
And don't look back, until we fall

I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

It'd be a shame, if our games, were doin' us
With all the time spent on tryin'
Then to lose your lovin'

So come on girl, we'll raise the sky
We'll break on through, we'll get so high
And don't worry about tomorrow's world
The time is now, I need you girl

I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

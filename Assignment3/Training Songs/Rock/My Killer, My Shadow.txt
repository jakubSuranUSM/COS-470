Any where you go - I will follow - I will follow
Every time you call - I can hear you
My killer my shadow - where ever I go, you follow
Through the busy street - straight and narrow - wide and shallow
Yeah
(Where ever you go) - you make me forget all my yesterdays
You made me care not for my tomorrow
(Where ever you go) - my my my my killer
You make me understand - understand
All the way to the end - yeah!
That I'll be damned, damned, damned in Amsterdam
Yeah I'll be damned, damned, damned in Amsterdam
American poker - Russian roulette
Who's that floatin' underneath the bridge
When the lights go dim - And the crowd go home
I can feel you - I can feel you - Amsterdam
I can feel - I can feel
My killer my shadow - you make me beg, steal and borrow
(where ever you go) where ever I go
(in the moonlight) - you lead me to a certain fate
(in the nightlife) - tell me now - don't wait
(where ever you go)
(in the moonlight) - hesitate
(in the neon light) - tell me before it's too late
Will I be damned, damned, damned in Amsterdam
Will I be damned, damned, damned in Amsterdam
Will I be damned, damned, damned in Amsterdam
(where ever you go) - killer - killer - shadow - shadow
(in the moonlight) - uh - I can feel the heat
(in the nightlife) - in the busy street
(where ever you go) - killer - killer - shadow - shadow
(in the moonlight) - yeah -
(in the neon light) - you make me care not for my yesterday
You make me care not for my tomorrow - where ever you go
(in the moonlight) - my killer - in the nightlife
(where ever you go) - my killer, my shadow - in the neon light
(where ever you go) - my killer

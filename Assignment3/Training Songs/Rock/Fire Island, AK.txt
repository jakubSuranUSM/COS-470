Here's how I found out
A man called my house
He asked me what I knew
They found my letter

And I don't have to wonder
No I don't have to wonder
So I don't have to wonder
Did it reach you? Did it reach you?

Good morning Fire Island
I'm not sure who to ask
They said wait until tomorrow
They found my letter

And I don't have to wonder
So I don't have to wonder
No I don't have to wonder
Did it reach you? Did it reach you?

Cinders in the garden
From the cars parked on the lawn
They're tracking up the carpet
They found my letter

And I don't have to wonder
No I don't have to wonder
So I don't have to wonder
Did it reach you? Did it reach you?

You've got to start the car the ice has come

Poetry of politics and lost entities
Government is loneliness, on this we agree
High are the angels and low are the decree
Love only burns when fueled by belief

Home, welcome home, take a little walk
Take a little walk right through my
Home, this is home
Take a little walk, take a little walk right through my
Home

Climb up the mountains and then slide to the seas
Beauty adores us, on this we agree
God is a witness, and God is a tease
Pick up your faith, yeah everybody come with me

Home, welcome home, take a little walk
Take a little walk right through my
Home, this is home
Take a little walk, take a little walk right through my
Home

Home

Home, welcome home, take a little walk
Take a little walk right through my
Home, this is home
Take a little walk, take a little walk right through my
Home

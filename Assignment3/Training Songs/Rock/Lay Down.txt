(safka)

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each other's wounds
We all caught the same disease
We all sang our songs of peace

Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown

Oh raise the candles high
'cause if you don't we can't stand black against the light
Oh raise them high again
'cause if you do we can stand dry against the rain

Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each other's wounds
We all caught the same disease
We all sang our songs of peace
Some came to sing some came to pray
Some came to keep the night away

Oh raise the candles high
'cause if you don't we can't stand black against the light
Oh raise them high again
'cause if you do we can stand dry against the rain

Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down, let it all down
Let your bright face smile up at the ones who stand and frown

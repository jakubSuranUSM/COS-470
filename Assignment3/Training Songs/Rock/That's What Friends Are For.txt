Oh I, never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I've got a chance to to say
That I do believe I love you

And if I, I should ever go away
Well than close your eyes
And try to feel the way we do today
And then if you can't remember

Keep smiling (smiling)
Keep shining (shining)
Knowing you can always count on me
For sure
That's what friends are for
For the good times (good times)
And the bad times (bad times)
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for
Yeah

And I, though you heard it all before
Well I'll tell you one more time
So I can be completely sure
So you know how much I love
And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we feel this day
And then if you can't remember

Keep smiling (smiling)
Keep shining (shining)
Knowing you can always count on me
For sure
That's what friends are for
Oh in good times (good times)
And in bad times (bad times)
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

Ooh, these feet carry me far
Oh, my body,oh so tired
Mouth is dry
Hardly speak
Holy spirit rise in me

Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
In this life
I'll join everyone
When I die

Have my body
Have my mind
Have my coat
Take my tie
These are borrowed
Borrowed so far
Turn to dust
Fall apart

Here I swear
Forever is just a minute to me

And I'll take everything!
Mmm,mmm.mmm
In this life!
I'll join everyone
Oh, and understand
'Cause all men die ('cause all men die)
'Cause all men die

And I'll take everything!
Mmm,mmm,mmm
In this life!
I'll join everyone!
Ooo, since I'm gonna die
And I'll take everything!

Mmm,mmm,mmm
In this life!
I'll join everyone!
Cause all men die

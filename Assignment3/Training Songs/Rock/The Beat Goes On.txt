Thought that I died today
Walked off the stage
Faded away up through the clouds
To 'the gig in the sky'
And when I arrived, the angels were singing this song
Yeah you know the one, are you singing along?

Thought I'd know just what to do
That it'd be how I wanted it to
The Ox and Moon were counting me in
I had to give in
Make the thunder and lightning sing
In the eye of the storm, there's no right and no wrong

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

I thought it was the end of the world
Beat with guitars, and all that I understand
Is air through metal and wood
I'm misunderstood
And wasted on money and fame
I'll throw it away
Just to prove that I can
I'm the last of a dying breed
And it's not the end of the world, oh no
It's not even the end of the day

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on

What's that sound you're listening for?
Sounds like you want some more
Going round once or twice
Someone thought it might be nice
But we don't care about
We don't care about it, no, no

What's that sign you're feeling for?
Sounds like you want some more
Funny how took in the day
Same feelings yesterday
But we don't care about
We don't care about it, no, no

What are we looking for?
Darkness and calmness
What are we looking for
Don't you know?

What's that touch you're feeling for?
Looks like you want some more
Funny how it touches you
Once it makes you want it more
But we don't care about
We don't care about it, no, no

What's that feeling you're looking for?
Feels like you want some more
Your pities are taking more
They are taking more
But we don't care about
We don't care about it, no, no

What are we looking for?
Darkness and calmness
What are we looking for
Don't you know?

What are we looking for?
Darkness and calmness
What are we looking for
Don't you know?
No, no, no, no

That's what you're feeling
Feeling, feeling, oh

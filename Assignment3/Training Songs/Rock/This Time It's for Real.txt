Baby, you can't slow me down 
I've come too far to ever turn back now 
I've spent my whole life working
Working so hard for it, yes I did

Baby, I changed the odds today 
Gonna push the scales, baby, till they tilt my way 
Pass that bottle, deal the cards 
'Cause I ain't waiting no more, no more 

You can say what you want to 
But there ain't nothing gonna change my mind 

Baby, this time it's for real 
I know, I know it, baby 
This time it's for real
It's got to be real, baby 

The time has come and I've paid the bill 
I'll keep the glass raised 'till my cup is filled 
I'm gonna keep on shaking 
'Till it all comes tumblin' down
Yes I will, baby 

Baby, don't give me no advice 
Gonna shoot it all, baby, on a roll of the dice 
When you start with nothing 
You ain't got nothing to lose 
Listen, baby

Well you can do what you want to 
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now 

Baby, this time it's for real 
I know, I know it baby 
This time it's for real
I said, said come on
Got to be, baby 

You can stay if you want to 
It don't make a bit of difference to me 

Baby, this time it's for real 
I know, I know it baby 
This time it's for real

I know it's got to be real now
I know it this time, baby
I know it, come on, baby
I know, I know, I know it
Baby, this time it's for real
I know it's got to be real
Got to be, got to be real
I know it
It's got to be, got to be real

Time will prove
I am not like you
Ten big bags of pain
That's all I got from you

I never pay my rent
That's what I learned to do
TV is not working today
Call me when it gets blue

Love aches!
I need you just to tell me what to do! (it aches!)
I can't stand the pain
You really need another flashback!

If I knew
What you were gonna do...
Ten big bags of pain
That's all I got from you

I never call my friends 
That's what I learned to do
TV is not working today
Call me when it gets blue

Love aches!
I need you just to tell me what to do! (it aches!)

I can't stand the pain
You really need another flashback!

Could you close the door
My heart is frozen
I just got it new
They told me to keep it covered
I didn't know that you were aware
But I told you twice
Just tell me who I am!

Wind and storm, goes the sun
From the stars, my dark has come
You've gone from me, oh oh tragedy

Oh come back, have me near
Hold me, love, be sincere
You've gone from me, oh oh tragedy

By smoke from a fire of love, oh oh
Our dreams have all gone above, oh oh

Blown by wind, kissed by snow
All that's left is a dark below
You've gone from me, oh oh tragedy

Oh come back, have me near
Hold me, love, be sincere
You've gone from me, oh oh tragedy

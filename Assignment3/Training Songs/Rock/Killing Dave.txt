Killing Dave!
Blueprint of a dark sepulchre
Bursting from this poisoned mind
(Wine, soft music, tasteless powder)
Lolling eyes, the naked martyr
To the seat his limbs I bind
(Spinning wheel and metal shower)

Oh, I think it's so obscene
Killing Dave is what I mean

Killing Dave!
Twist the blade to ruby handle
Gently split and part the fig
(Beating, beating, horror luscious)
Red the wax from dripping candle
Black the shadow at the dig
(Looting, looting, treasures precious)

Oh, I think it's so obscene
Killing Dave is what I mean

Killing Dave!
Grinning madly, seeing nothing
Naked from his plundered suit
(Two red slug-lips, rubber keepsakes)
From the rowan's branches hanging
Gaudy trinkets, passion fruit
(Ripe and dripping, treacle sweet lakes)

Oh, I think it's so obscene
Killing Dave is what I mean

Killing Dave!

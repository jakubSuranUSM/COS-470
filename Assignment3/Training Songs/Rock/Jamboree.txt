I try to walk away 
To prove I was in control
Thereâ??s got to be a cure
This canâ??t go on no more
Dressed in black in the midday sun
Break the ice and on the run
Keep this up there wonâ??t be none

I try to be real cool
You lock me in a room 
You try to take off your dress
We both know what happened next
And when my skirt begins to ache
I realize that itâ??s too late
To love you like a chocolate cake
Because we both know youâ??re my dream date

Wear an old potato sack
Trailer for a hat
Haircut for a bowl
Two eyes made of coal
One two three, one two four
The bees are hop, the bees are ho
But thatâ??s one thing sheâ??ll never know

Oh no, why can't you get along?
Ok I know it's not my place
I've got to say something
I've got to say something
I've got speak

She'll never leave
And you can never throw her out
Impossible to conceive
You'd rather be with than without

That's just the fear talking
That just the fear talking
That's just the fear

Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me, fear
Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me, fear

Remember the good old days
But love is like a dragonfly
So beautiful, it will die
And disappear before your eyes

I'm no philosopher
I am no poet
I'm just trying to help you out

Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me, fear
Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me

And so you sit and wait
For another man to take your place
And when, when he comes
Would you welcome him with open arms?
You'll feel a hundred years younger
You'll feel a hundred years younger
You'll fee no fear

Don't let it take you
Like it nearly took me, fear
Don't let it fool you
Like it nearly fooled me, fear
Don't kill you
Like it nearly killed me, fear

In times of despair I think about the good things you've done
And though you're not there I sometimes ask myself is anyone?
It's hard being human when the whole world's uptight
But somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright

I might lose my patience but won't you please try to understand
I've got obligations and I intend to face them and take my stand
Oh, it's so hard being human with only troubles in sight
But somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright 
Yes I do, yeah!

Stick by me baby in spite of my faults
That's all I want you to do and try to help me (Help me) 
When I'm down (Help me) and I'll take good care of you
I want to thank you for all the tender loving that you give
It brightens my feelings and gives me strength and need to live
Oh, it's so hard being human with only troubles in sight
But somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright
Somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright

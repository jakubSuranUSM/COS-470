Dreamed I was a fireman. 
I just smoked and watched you burn. 
Dreamed I was an astronaut. 
I shot you down like a juggernaut. 
Dreamed we were still going out. 
Had that one a few times now. 
Woke up to find we were not. 
It's good to be awake. 
Dreamed I was a tidal wave. 
I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors. 
Dreamed I was your landlord. 
I showed your place when you had lovers. 
If I was a vampire, 
I wouldn't suck your blood. 
Then I dreamed I was you. 
Sweetest dream I have had. 
If you could hear the dreams I've had, my dear, 
They would give you nightmares for a week. 
But you're not here and I can never sleep. 
Come home so I can be a creep. 
Dreamed I was a dream. 
I stole you away in your sleep. 
Saved you from a fire, a gun for hire, 
I introduced you to a vampire. 
A wave crashed on the beach. 
We rolled around in its foamy grasp. 
Kissing in the chaos of a kelpy sea. 
Seems I couldn't save you from me. 
Maybe I'm obsessive to think like this. 
Probably not impressing you with my cheap tricks. 
Honey, it's depressing 
What depression does to some. 
I'll play the part for hours 
But I know you'll never come.

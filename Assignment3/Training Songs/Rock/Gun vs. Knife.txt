Well I heard of jealous guys
But this one takes the cake
And he wants to murder me
But I've never seen his face
But if he wants it, tell him "bring it on!"
And I'm not gonna be scared at all

But I've seen him in my dreams
Now I'm afraid to go to sleep
And he haunts me in the night
And he's got a vendetta and he thinks he's right
He's got a vendetta and he thinks he's right
Oww

He thinks I took his girl
But it simply isn't true
And I know he's got a gun
And I don't know what he'll do
But if he wants it tell him bring it on
And I'm not gonna be scared at all

Well go talk to your man
And try to make him understand
If he still thinks that's he's right
Well bring your gun and I'll bring my knife
Bring your gun and I'll bring my knife
You can strike me down, it won't make it right
Strike me down, it won't make it right
Ow

Well I know he's got that pistol
And he waves it in his hand
And he thinks that your his girl
And he still thinks he's your man
But if he wants it tell him BRING IT ON
And I ain't gonna be scared at all

But I've seen him in my dreams
Now I'm afraid to go to sleep
And he haunts me in the night
And he's got a vendetta and he thinks he's right
You can bring your gun and I'll bring my knife
Strike me down it won't make it right
Strike me down it won't make it right
Oww

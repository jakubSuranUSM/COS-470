Please die Ana
For as long as you're here we're not
You make the sound of laughter
And sharpened nails seem softer
And I need you now somehow
And I need you now somehow

Open fire 
On the needs designed on my knees for you
Open fire 
On my knees desires what I need from you

Imagine pageant
In my head the flesh seems thicker
Sandpaper tears corrode the film

And I need you now somehow
And I need you now somehow

Open fire 
On the needs designed on my knees for you
Open fire 
On my knees desires what I need from you

And you're my obsession
I love you to the bones
And Ana wrecks your life
Like an Anorexia life

Open fire 
On the needs designed on my knees for you
Open fire 
On my knees desires what I need from you

Open fire 
On the needs designed 
Open fire 
On my knees desires what I need from you

Out here in the country
Where stars they shine
You can even take a walk by moonshine
Though I long to stay
I've just got to go
Where money is made
Cold winds blow

How I long to feel that Summer
In my heart

And the days were so long
And nothing could go wrong
With my heart
And the days were so long
And nothing could go wrong
With my heart

How I long to feel that Summer
In my heart

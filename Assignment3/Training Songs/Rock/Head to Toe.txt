Like a road, you're somewhere to go
Head to toe, twenty three
What rock with me

Your face looks good to me [Repeat: x3]
I
You're somewhere to go
There's someone's home
Someone's home

Your face looks good to me
You're alright boy you look right boy

Head to toe, you're somewhere to go
Twenty three
What rock with me

Your face looks good to me [Repeat: x3]
You're alright boy you look right boy

Your face looks good to me [Repeat: x3]
You look right boy
Comfortably 
Comfortably

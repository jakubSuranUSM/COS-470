I'm startin' to feel
A bit like Frankenstein
'Cause I know how it feels to wake up
And be some other guy

Every little movement
I'm forced to modify
I know everyone does it
So I won't apologize

I'm not just the one you think you see
Today I'm gonna look one way
The one they should know
Can't you see the other side of me?

Tonight you're gonna see me change
And not just my clothes

[Chorus]
Oh... the shape I'm in
Would you know at a glance
If it's me or him?

Every little action
Is somehow magnified
I know everyone does it
Is it any wonder why?

I'm not just the one you think you see
Today I'm gonna look one way
The one they should know
Can't you see the other side of me?

Tonight you're gonna see me change
And not just my clothes

[Chorus]

I wear this disguise like a
second skin
Oh... the shape I'm in
Oh... the shape I'm in

[Chorus: x 2]

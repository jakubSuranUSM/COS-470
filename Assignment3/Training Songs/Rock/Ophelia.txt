Ophelia was a bride of God 
A novice Carmelite 
In sister cells 
The cloister bells tolled on her wedding night 

Ophelia was the rebel girl 
A blue stocking suffragette 
Who remedied society between her cigarettes 
And Ophelia was the sweetheart 

To a nation overnight 
Curvaceous thighs 
Vivacious eyes 
Love was at first sight 

Love was at first sight 
Ophelia was a demigoddess in pre war Babylon 
So statuesque a silhouette in black satin evening gowns 
Ophelia was the mistress 

To a Vegas gambling man 
Signora Ophelia Maraschina 
Mafia courtesan 
Ophelia was the circus queen 

The female cannonball 
Projected through five flaming hoops 
To wild and shocked applause 
To wild and shocked applause 

Ophelia was a tempest cyclone 
A goddamn hurricane 
Your common sense, your best defense 
Lay wasted and in vain 

For Ophelia'd know your every woe 
And every pain you'd ever had 
She'd sympathize and dry your eyes 
And help you to forget 

Help you to forget 
And help you to forget 
Ophelia's mind went wandering 
You'd wonder where she'd gone 

Through secret doors down corridors 
She wanders them alone 
All alone 
fade to different spoken languages

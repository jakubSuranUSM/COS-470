Mummy was a hostess Daddy was a drunk
'Cause they didn't love me then I turned out a punk
An ex house full of memories memories and junk
Never had a childhood I turned out a punk

Better learn how to play guitar with a plink and a plunk
I didn't like jazz I didn't like funk
I turned out a punk
I turned out a punk

Slowly started slipping down till my ship was sunk
Going nowhere in my life I turned out a punk
Didn't care 'bout anyone sat round smoking skunk
Didn't know what I had done I turned out a punk

Better learn how to play guitar with a plink and a plunk
I didn't like jazz I didn't like funk
I turned out a punk
I turned out a punk

Better learn how to play guitar with a plink and a plunk
I didn't like jazz I didn't like funk
I turned out a punk
I turned out a punk

Woke up one afternoon with a mout full of gunk
Blob out with my video I turned out a punk
Took my disabilities packed them in a trunk
Rock 'n roll's alright by me I turned out a punk

Better learn how to play guitar with a plink and a plunk
I didn't like jazz I didn't like funk
I turned out a punk
I turned out a punk

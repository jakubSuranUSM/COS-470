Tomorrow is teasing me.
Time seems to run away from the future.
But this could be that lucky day.

A dream is make believe until
Blood, sweat, and tears turn pain to will.
Its gonna take some doing for me
To show them the way.

I'm gonna take the stone of Sisyphus
I'm gonna roll it back to you.
Building a wall of stone.

Sometimes you know whats right
Sometimes wrong is better than nothing.
They cast a stone so heavy to turn.

I believe in a love so true.
I believe you get whats coming to you.
We get so tired of living a dream
For some other day.

I'm gonna take the stone of Sisyphus
I'm gonna roll it back to you.
Wall of stone around the two of us.
That only angels can break through.

Looks like its another of those long nights.
Will we always be alone?
Lets not stop before its done.

I'm gonna take the stone of Sisyphus
I'm gonna roll it back to you.
I'll take the stone of Sisyphus.
Wall of stone round the two of us.
I'm gonna roll it back to you.

I'm gonna take the stone of Sisyphus
Wall of stone round the two of us.
I'm gonna take the stone of Sisyphus
Wall of stone round the two of us.

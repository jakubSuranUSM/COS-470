I've been up, I've been down
Take my word been around

I ain't asking for much
I said, "Lord take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush"

I've been bad, I've been good
Dallas Texas, Hollywood

I ain't asking for much
I said, "Lord take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush" hey

Take me back way back home
Not by myself not alone

I ain't asking for much
I said, "Lord take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush"

I said, "Lord take me downtown
I'm just looking for some tush"

I said, "Lord take me downtown
I'm just looking for some"

You hold on to love that's gone
Run a mile to see him smile
But you don't know he's door to door playin' you for the fool

[Chorus]
Let him go, walk out your door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

Now you look and there you go back to him, he's gonna do you in
Tear you down and run you around
Treat you wrong and then he's gone

[Chorus]

You hold on to love that's gone
Run a mile to see him smile
But you don't know he's door to door playin' you for the fool

[Chorus]

I'll set you free [Repeat: x5]

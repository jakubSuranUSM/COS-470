It's been a while,
since I saw you the last time
And it feels like I never will again
I told you that I am a mess,
but you didn't seem,
you didn't seem to care
No I can't hold you down,
but try to think about me as before

I am the greatest fool of all

When things were a lot better,
and we always looked at each other,
with equal love
Never burning, the other one's heart on a stick,
and just throwing to waste
No I can't hold you down
I never really wanted to

I am the greatest fool of all

So many things,
I wanted you to know
But couldn't tell you on the phone
Afraid that you would laugh,
and say that I'm a fool
Well maybe I am, but

I am the greatest fool of all

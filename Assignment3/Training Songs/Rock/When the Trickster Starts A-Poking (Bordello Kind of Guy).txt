As I walked into the bar
A man came up to me and said:
You know the older you will get
The more perverted you will get

Hey, I'd like to see you try it
Oh what you gonna do about it?
Optzay, be a bad priest?
Ili primernij ononist?!
Be bad transvestattn? (Da yuta nigh!)
Or be a good zoldatten?! (Ozay Optzay!)
Yeah, give it a try, (By by by by)
But me I'm jasto Bordello kind of guy!..

Mama, of course all hopes are so fragile...
Papa, I can't believe what it costs?..
Sily, Sily oni menja pokidajut
So I did what I did and its worth what its worth what it's worth

Ah ha hey!

When the Trickster starts a-walking
He sends the whole world asque
Just when you think that it's all through
Its just a birth of something new
And when the Trickster starts a-pokin
Who does he need to ask permission
Before he goes in third position
I guess he's justo Bordello kind of guy!...

Mama, of course all hopes are so fragile...
Papa, I can't believe what it costs?..
Sily oni menja pokidajut
So I did what I did and its worth what its worth what it's worth

Ah ha hey!

So I walked out out of a bar
And drove like crazy for half mile
I was thirteen beers drunk
On Houston I jumped in some trunk...
We ventured on New York Throughway
Where myself I heard I say:
Shall I be classic self crasher?
Or be a good flasher?!

Hey, I'd like to see you try it
Oh what you gonna do about it?
Heeeeeeey, be a bad priest?
Ili primernij ononist?!
Da yuta nigh!
Ozay Optzay!
By by by by!
I guess I'm justo Bordello kind of guy!

Bordello kind of guy!
Bordello kind of guy!
Bordello kind of guy!

"You know, the fun of watching fireworks 
Is built pretty much around the a capella vocal approval that YOU do, 
With or after each explosion. 
All right, we provide the fireworks, you do the oohs and aahs."

You left the house to see it shine
And when you came back it was gone
You leave a place like this in flames
You won't come back to its remains
If you shine, then I'll shine
If you fall, I'll fall behind

You left the house to see it shine
And when you came back it was gone
Sure, you've left worlds like these in flames
But then again you've made
Made some friends along the way
If you shine then I'll shine
If you're far, I'm far behind

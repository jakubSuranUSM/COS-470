Ohh I'm so spaced out today, 
Ohh I could of slept for days, 
It's like a radar and it calls to you, 
From the sea, from the sea, from the sea

Ohh she's just so under pain,
Ohh I'm so spaced out today
My head's the light way and I come to you,
From the sea, from the sea, from the sea

Hello, hello, ohh hello
The world repeats itself some how
She knows, she knows, ohh she knows, 
The world repeats itself some how

All I'm just beginning to know,
She's all I'm just beginning to know

Ohh, there's just no oxygen
Ohh, why can't we just fall in, 
In the sea

Hello, hello, ohh hello
The world repeats itself some how
She knows, she knows, ohh she knows, 
The world repeats itself some how

Ohh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhhh, ohhh, ohhh 

Hello, hello, ohh hello
The world repeats itself some how
She knows, she knows, ohh she knows, 
The world repeats itself some how

All I'm just beginning to know,
She's all I'm just beginning to know,
She's all I'm just beginning to know now.

Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you

Where is Santa and his sleigh?
And tell me why was it always this way?
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen baby?
Merry Christmas, merry merry merry Christmas

All the children are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snow is falling, swirling falling, merry Christmas

I love you and you love me
And that's the way its got to be
Why have we been torn apart
'Cause Christmas ain't the time for breaking each others hearts

All the children are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snow is falling falling falling baby

I love you and you love me
And that's the way that its got to be
Why have we been torn apart
Cause Christmas ain't the time for breaking each others hearts

Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with
Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you

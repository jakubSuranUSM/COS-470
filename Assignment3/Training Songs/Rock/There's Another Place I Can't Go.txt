Can't go down to the river where we meet
If I went there I'm sure my tears would flow
The crazy little drive-in where we used to eat, ah-ha
There's another place that I can't go

The town keeps gettin' smaller day by day
I can't escape the love we used to know
The honky tonk where we danced the night away, uh huh
There's another place that I can't go

I said, oh my, how do I ease this pain
You're gone, but the memories still remain

Well, I can't remember how we used to kiss
The way you said you'd always love me so
And how your lovin' arms would open wide to me, uh huh
There's another place I can't go

Oh my, how do I ease this pain
You're gone, but the memories still remain

Well, I still remember how we used to kiss
The way you said you'd always love me so
Yeah and how your lovin' arms would open wide to me, uh huh
There's another place that I can't go
There's another place that I can't go
There's another place that I can't go

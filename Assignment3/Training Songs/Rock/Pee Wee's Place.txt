There's a jumpin' little joint out in West Nashville
If the barbecue don't get you the music will
It's called Pee Wee's Place and they're open from nine till dawn.
If you drop by brother there's some shakin' goin on

We get all kinds of people as the night goes on
Rednecks and the hippies both are right at home
Politicians, truck drivers, factory workers too
You can be a Cop out here don't matter what you do.

We gotta four piece band and we play real loud country soul
While rockin and we be so proud
Let me play and sing do what we want to do
The crowd will love us when we're rockin boogie woogie too.
Let me rock it for you now!

Hey go hey hey in other words by the bar 
and drink corn liquor from an old fruit jar
That's what it's all about whip this little yo yo
He just got out of jail the boy's movin' kind of slow

Pee Wee's place raising hell he thinks the band is too loud
He's a bitchin' too much cause he's drawing a crowd
Pulling a lot of good music and a whole lot of shaking going on
Out at Pee Wee's Place where you can get it all night long

Oh! Let it roll 
Let it Roll all night long
Give it to me  
Could you do me?
Come on now give it to me all night long

Boogie Woogie going to get you and if that ain't good enough
Jerry Lee's going to show you how to get real tough
Out at Pee Wee's Place we're hangin' all night long
Hey give it to me baby there's some shaking going on

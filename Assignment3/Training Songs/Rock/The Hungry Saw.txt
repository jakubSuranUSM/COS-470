Mean smiles when the devil drives
He's been driving the old way
He's got a hungry saw
He wants to tear it all up now

A grind of speed and a one night stand
Left my baby in the devil's hands
He's got a hungry saw
He wants to tear it all up now
He's got a hungry saw

First carve is the skin
The second is the muscle
There's a crack of the bone
And he's at your heart
Yeah, there's a crack of the bone
(And he's at your heart)

Hello darkness, my old friend
It's time to jerk those tears again
He works that saw so painlessly
Those devil's hands
Those devil's hands I know
I feel them on my skin

First carve is the skin
The second is the muscle
There's a crack of the bone
And he's at your heart
Yeah, there's a crack of the bone
(And he's at your heart)

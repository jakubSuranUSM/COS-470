You're right, I'm left she's gone
You're right, I'm left all alone
You tried to tell me so
But a fool is blind to know

And Lord that woman was always foolin' me
You told me all along, you're right
Our love was so wrong

But now, I've changed my mind
That was your love all the time
That live deep inside my memory

I thought I knew just what she'd do
But I guess I was not so smart
You tried to tell me all along
That you'd only break my heart

You're right, I'm left, she's gone
You're right, killer's left all alone
She's gone for good this time
Thank God she's off my mind
And now, my baby's comin' back for more
(Hang it in, killer)

I thought I knew just what she'd do
But I guess I was not so smart
You tried to tell me all along
That you'd only break Jerry's heart

You're right, I'm left, she's gone
You're right I'm left all alone
She's gone for good this time
Thank God, she's off my mind

And now, baby, I'm comin' back to you
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' my baby back to you

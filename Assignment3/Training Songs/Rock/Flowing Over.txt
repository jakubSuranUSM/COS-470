I can tell that you're embarrassed
You've got a reason to be
You've got cash and what's been breaking me
And I know the words are sugar, but
Now's not the best time for me
I've got ? to me feet, and
Oh, oh, oh, oooh

Flowing over 'til I'm empty
Flowing over 'til I'm emptied out
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

I can see that you're impatient
You've got the right to go home
So I'm not steppin' in you're dead zone
And I know the touch is ?
Now's no the best time for me
I've got ? and through my dreams, and
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

Flowing over 'til I'm empty
Flowing over 'til I'm emptied out
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

They're tearing down another building in my hometown
It's like I don't know it anymore
Your house, two cars in the drive, blankets in the window
Even though you don't answer, we tried

You have gone missing from my life
You have gone missing from my life
You have gone missing from my life
My life

Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, Jacksonville

In my hometown, it's all slow motion
Driving to my house, it's empty now 
No one's inside
Looking through the windows in the back
Right into the kitchen where the tables and chairs were at

You have gone missing from my life
You have gone missing from my life
Buried my feelings I can't cry

Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, oh

They're tearing down another building in the neighborhood
It's like I don't remember, but I should
My life, a letter you could write
On how to keep your hands up in front of your face when you fight

Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, oh
Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, Jacksonville
Oh, oh

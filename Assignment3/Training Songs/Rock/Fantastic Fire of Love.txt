(Kim Carnes)
Honey let's take a photograph 
One of just me an you 
Cause no one ever makes me smile 
The way that you do
We could make it into an 8x10
And hang it up on my wall 
And it you wanted to sign it with all my love 
Honey I won't mind at all
Straight into the fire 
The fantastic fire of love 
I can feel the flame getting higher 
Oh sweet fantastic fire of love
Now honey let's buy and rocket 
And ride it to the moon 
Wouldn't take much 
We'd just live on love 
Life in a silver spoon
We could buy a yacht that don't cost a lot 
Sail it to the end of the sea 
Wouldn't need a crew 
Cause I'd have you 
Holding on tight to me
Straight into the fire 
The fantastic fire of love 
I can feel the flame getting higher 
Oh sweet fantastic fire of love
You just really crept up on me 
I never saw you coming 
Well I tried to yell I tried to scream 
But just stop short of running 
We can call it lust you can call it luck 
Call it anything you like 
Its fiery hot and honey I've been caught 
And I just want you tonight
Straight into the fire 
The fantastic fire of love 
I can feel the flame getting higher 
Oh sweet fantastic fire of love
Straight into the fire 
The fantastic fire of love 
I can feel the flame getting higher 
Oh sweet fantastic fire of love

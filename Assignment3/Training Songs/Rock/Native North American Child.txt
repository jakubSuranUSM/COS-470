Who's got a head o' hair to match up with the raven?
Who's got the prairie sun in every smile?
Who's got good credit yet with ol' Mother Nature?
Who-o-o? Native North American child

Who's got the rhythm of the universe inside her?
Who taught the pilgrims how to make it in the wild?
Who sing a 49-er autumnal changes?
Who? Native North American child

Sing about your ebony African Queen
Sing about your lily-white Lily Marleen
Beauty by the bushel but the girl of the hour
Is the native North American prairie flower

Seminole, Apache, Ute, Paiute and Shoshone
Navaho, Comanche, Hopi, Eskimo, Cree
Tuskarora, Yaqui, Pima, Porca, Oneida
O-o-h, native North American me

Sing about your ebony African Queen
Sing about your lily-white Lily Marleen
Beauty by the bushel but the girl of the hour
Is the native North American prairie flower

Cherokee, Muskogee, Fox and Passamaquoddy
Winnebago, Haida, Mohawk, Saulteaux and Souix
Chicksaw, Ojibwe, Cheyenne, Micmac and Mandan
O-o-h, native North American you

Yeah, yeah, baby, North American child

Oh, gracious love, you were so kind to me
You only broke my heart
Let my arms and legs stay strong
So I could swim upon the open sea
Searching for another love
Floating along aimlessly

Oh, where are you love?
Tell me where are you love
I will wait for you another night
Cause I know you won't leave me behind
Oh, where are you love?

I had someone, a love I thought was true
But sometimes you just get tired
And you must try not to die
And give your love, though no one may receive
You must build a giant fire
For the whole wide world to see

Oh, where are you love?
Tell me where have you gone
I shall wait for you another night
And you know I won't leave you behind
Oh, where are you love?

So thank you love, you were so good to me
You put hope into my heart
Shined a light so I could see
Those wicked things, the wicked things you do
Well, I pay them no mind
Cause I know you'll be back in time

Oh, where are you love?
Tell me where are you love
I shall wait for you just one more night
Cause I know you won't leave me behind
Oh, where are you love?

Tell me where are you love
(repeat)

You ride out into the strongest sun and you know
Gonna leave you for dead as the sun over head you don't shun
Thirst comes on and the water is all you want
But there's gold in your eyes and it keeps you alive to move on

Love's dart, no longer sharp
The end is in sight but your aim takes you out of the mark
Love's dart, broken apart
If you're walking in circles you'll find yourself back at the start

The wind kicks up and the day, it grows so old
If you keep on going you'll make it out of this dust bowl
You think of the one you knew that was so fair
You remember about the girl with the golden hair

Love's dart, no longer sharp
The end is in sight but your aim takes you out of the mark
Love's dart, broken apart
If you're walking in circles you'll find yourself back at the start

In the near distance you see a form
You recognize the face but you're feeling warm
Rub your eyes and see there's no one around
Lie down for a while and she'll stay with you till you move on

Love's dart, no longer sharp
The end is in sight but your aim takes you out of the mark
Love's dart, broken apart
If you're walking in circles you'll find yourself back at the start

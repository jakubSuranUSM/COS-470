Time will tell
Give some new meaning now
What it really takes to survive
Time will prove
That my fears, all were coming true
Now that you're leaving my life
Clouding up, think l see rain,and now
Oh no, l?m feeling the pain
So far the omens are saying
That a stormy time is coming again
Chorus:
The sky is falling
No early warning
There's no returning
lt's the end of the loving
The sky is falling
No early warning
There's no returning
The sky is falling
Coming down
Oh baby it?s all around
Waves are washing over me
Weathered through other storms
Yeah they seemed so long
But not as hard as this will be
Don't we know, haven't we learned by now
Hurt love and you're gonna cry
Oh baby nothing can save us now
My heart is as dark as the sky
Chorus:
The sky ja falling
No early warning
There's no returning
lt's the end of the loving
The sky is falling
No early warning
There's no returning
The sky is falling
Gotta turn my back on the feeling
So I can face the world
Don't you know my heart stopped believing
And I just can't keep reaching
for love
Chorus: (repeat)

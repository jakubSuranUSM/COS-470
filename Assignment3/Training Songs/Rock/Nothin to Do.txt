I like to hold my baby
She likes to hold on me too
Like something for nothing
That she can hold onto
Where we been lately
Second Ave.
To call on Brent Mackerel
Or we can find someone new

Really like it better
Like it better than you
And if you got a problem
We want nothing to do
Here we go, baby
With the cats from swoon
And if we got a quarter
We call sugarboom, boom.

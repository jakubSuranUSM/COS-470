I set sail for Treasure Island
Jolly Roger at the top of the mast
Looking for love, looking for adventure
And whatever might come to pass.

We weighed anchor at Treasure Island
Galleon breeze blowing through the trees
And my pirate girl, she stands there beside me
From the Spanish Main unto the seven seas.

We set sail 'cross the Caribbean
Oh me, me and my pirate girl
Looking for gold, gold and doubloons
All the treasures of this world.

Oh! Yea! Ah!

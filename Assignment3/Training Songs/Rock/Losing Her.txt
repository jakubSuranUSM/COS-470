A lot of days I sit at home and cry
A lot of days I’ve been staying in bed
Everywhere I go reminds me of her
Bill Callahan singing “it’s time to put God away”
I know it’s time to stop worshipping her
To stop wanting her
To stop missing her
To stop thinking about her
But I can’t change my dreams at night
So every morning I wake up with her on my mind
Then it all starts again

I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her
I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her

There are moments when I become paralyzed
Thoughts of her can keep me from speaking
Dream of her breath in my ear and I cry
But everybody reminds me that I’m better off without her
God she was cruel a lot of the time
But when she was kind
Oh when she’d smile
When she called me honey
My soul would surrender to her
My heart and body were hers to use as she wanted
I just wanted to be near her forever

I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her
I’m so sad
I’m despondent
I’m so sad about losing her

Honey, here I go again
Down that crooked road of sin
My momma locked me out again
And hung me high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

When I sing my stranger blues
I make it on the local news
Everybody likes to see you lose
And hang you high to rust under the rain

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

Little bluebird at my window
Sing a pretty song for me
Don't you know that you can fly, fly, fly away
Don't you know that you can leave

I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb
I am numb

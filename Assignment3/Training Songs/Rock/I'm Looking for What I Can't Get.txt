I don't know what state I'm in but
We're all Americans at heart.
When you going to turn your self
Down and turn your television on.
You're the most likely to succeed
And I'm the most likely to
Bleed all over you.
And I'm looking for what I can't get.
I don't think my souls on fire
I just need another drink,
Because it's easy to believe when
You don't have to think.
To die for you my friend well that's
A fantasy come true for you.
And I'm looking for what I can't get.

See I've fucked up and sucked up
And lucked out. I know that.
I was the apple of your eye.
I know that.
But if I asked you to stay
You'd just say no.
This is how I feel,
This is not how I feel.

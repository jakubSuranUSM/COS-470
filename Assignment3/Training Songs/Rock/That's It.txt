Well, that's it, don't wanna show you
That's it, don't really care
Can't you see, it's misery
And that's it, oh, yeah

Well, that's it
(That's it)
Don't play it cool now, that's it
(That's it)
Your trick is dead
Can't you see? It's lunacy
So, that's it
(That's it)
Oh, yeah

I'm lettin' it all go
I'm lettin' it all go
Back to one
(Back to one)
Just for fun
(Just for fun)

Well, that's it
(That's it)
Don't make it harder, that's it
(That's it)
Don't make it tough
Can't you see? No remedy
And that's it
(That's it)
Oh, yeah

I'm lettin' it all go
I'm lettin' it all go
Back to one
(Back to one)
Just for fun
(Just for fun)

That's it

I love your body
And the way you move your hips
Your lips are honey
You're a candy flavored kiss
Baby you're sweet 
Like a Sunday afternoon
I'm goin' crazy 'cause 
I'm crazy over you

Woo, woo, woo
Let's go to Vegas and 
We'll make love
In a heart shaped hot tub baby
So tell you're momma 
That the games up
This is real love
Let me tell ya now

[Chorus]
What you are to me is
Only everything
Everything baby
What you are to me is
Only everything
So listen honey
Let's sit under the apple tree
And don't say anything
Kiss until the morning
'Cause what you are to me is
Only everything
Everything baby

Don't wanna wake up in 
The morning without you
Go back to bed
So I can dream about you
Look at the clock
Like I can't wait till you get home
I love to hear your message 
Playin' on my telephone

[Chorus]

Oh you are
The only
One who can make me feel the
Way that I
Feel for you
No one can ever replace
The way you are

Oh, oh, oh,
Everything, everything
Oh, oh, oh,
Everything, everything

[Chorus]

Oh, you're everything
(Oh, oh, oh everything, everything)
Baby you're everything
(Oh, oh, oh, everything, everything)
You're only everything
Baby you're everything
(Oh, oh, oh, everything, everything)
Yes indeed, you're everything
(Oh, oh, oh, everything, everything)
What you are is everything
Baby you're everything

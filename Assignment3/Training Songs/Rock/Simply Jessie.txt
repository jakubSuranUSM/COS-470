And I dont know how I knew it
But I knew it somehow
Youre the answer to the question
No ones answered till now
And I dont know what you see
What you see in me
Girl its nothing to what I see in you

Stars that glisten
Lips for kissin'
Honey listen its true
No one ever loved you better
I love ya honey

And I've known a girl or two
But none of them was you
And they could never be what you are to me

Stars that glisten
Lips for kissin'
Honey listen its true
No one ever loved you better
I love ya honey I love you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

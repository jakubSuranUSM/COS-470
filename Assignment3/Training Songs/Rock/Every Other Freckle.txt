Aah
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I’m gonna bed into you like a cat prance into a beanbag
Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet

(Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey, hey)

You’re the first and last of your kind
Hold me like an animal utaffable
I wanna be every lever you’ve pulled
And all showers that shower you
Not a pop or a tune
Like a cat falls and I wanna dump her
Me, I’m in the bin
Ignore her worth, and some trivia

Hey

Ooh, devour me
Ooh, Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing
Hey (doo doo doo doo doo doo)

All hand claps
Human claps
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I want to be every button you press
And all mouths that surround you
Yes, I’m gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around the chrysanthemums
I’m gonna kiss you like the sun grounds you

Hey

Oh oh oh oh oh devour me (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh devour me (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh oh)
If you really think that you can stomach me (hey, hey)

Hey
Hey

I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle, freckle

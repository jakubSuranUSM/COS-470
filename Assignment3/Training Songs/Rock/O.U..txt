Oh, the night was ending
He needed her undressed
He said he loved her
She tried to look impressed

After the break up
It's just something you do
To stop the night time
From falling down on you

The world is ending
The sky is falling down
She's at the station
Because she's leaving town

Oh, you could stop her
If you get out of bed
She wants to see you
At least that's what she said

You've got a minute
At the very most
And she'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

Oh yeah, she's going away
Oh yeah, she's going away
Oh yeah, she's going away
Oh yeah, she's going away

And now it's over
'Cause I just saw the end
I saw the credits
I turned around and then

I saw her running
Coming back to me
The sky exploded
Oh, but I couldn't see

The world is ending
The sky is falling down
She's at the station
Because she's leaving town

Oh, you could stop her
If you get out of bed
She wants to see you
At least that's what she said

You've got a minute
At the very most
And she's gone
And she's gone and she's gone
Oh yeah, she's going away

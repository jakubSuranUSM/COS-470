It was a long hot summer day
We're in the living room watching the light drain away
Hey you're too tired to read what your cards foretold inside of a yawn
When she said, "The first time you show me your true heart I'll be gone"

I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

The numb ringing after the bell was rung
Playing red light, green light, such timeless fun
And there was no way to kick start any conversation
It was like the beginning of 2001, when she said

"I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone"

The air isn't moving and the women have nothing on their lips
But the kind of breath that you keep for the hospital bed
Pregnant with the timeless drop and the wind
The air leeches the gold out of everything elusive but stolen, but stolen

I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

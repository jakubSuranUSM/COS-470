Can't we be sweethearts? Why don't we fall in love? 
Right from the start, you're the girl I'm dreamin' of 
Oh can't you see you're the one & only girl for me, oh? 
Please by my sweetheart; don't you know the way I feel? 
Don't play the part; please make my dreams come real 
Oh don't you know, don't you know I really love you so? 
 
We'd walk hand in hand in our wonderland 
The world would be our own 
I'd make love to you, lovin' kisses too 
You'd be mine alone

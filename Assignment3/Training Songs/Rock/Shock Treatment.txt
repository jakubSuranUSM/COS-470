Truth is the ultimate reason
Lying is why this begins
Run from the words of deceivers
The danger is spread from within
Watching the hour glass empty
Scream as time's running out
There's no more room for excuses
There's no rhyme or reason to doubt.
Hold out your arms
Be ready to take all that's coming
Shock treatment
You won't feel the pain
Shock treatment
You'll cry out in pain
Give up your heart--
You won't feel the pain
Shock treatment
They'll do it to you again and again and again
Cover your fear with a blanket
Don't let them know that it's rage
Be on your guard what you say now
It may haunt you the rest of your days
Faces around you are gloating
The pain disappears in a haze
Hold onto what's left of your mind now...
The switches are set on erase

Do you believe, leave the things that I admire
My mistake, to make the stakes a little higher
No nothing's ever gonna be alright
And we invade because of your invite
Far out b. baby
Couldn't stay away baby
The clashes don't come one in a million
Did you believe, leaving me without no reason
Your mistakes, I'm taking you out of season
Nothing really maters anymore
Only the sound of glass across the floor
Far out b. baby
Couldn't stay away baby
The clashes don't come one in a million
Be a.s.a.p wouldn't bet a dime on me
The clashes don't come one in a million
I like things that you might copyright
No and I don't like
That you don't like
What we don't like
There's no one like us

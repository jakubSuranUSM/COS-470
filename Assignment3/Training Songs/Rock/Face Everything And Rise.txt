Face everything and rise

The streets crawl with a deadly omen
Outside I see a world that's broken
I can't breathe, my heart is choking
I need a cure for this life I've chosen
The pain, the rain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and its cutting like a knife
The pain, the rain is a blessing in disguise
I feel it cutting and its cutting like a knife
I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until the day I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
Take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise
The earth shakes and the city's burning
Blood fill's like the tide is turning
Life hurts and there's no warning
Lightning strikes, my heart is storming
The pain, the rain is a blessing in disguise

The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies
The pain, the rain is a blessing in disguise
The flood's coming and it's drowning all the lies
I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until the day I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
Take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise
Running in the fire, I'll never be the same
I come alive when I am burning in the flames
I'm under fire when I'm burning wide awake
My life feels empty when I am walking through the flames
When I am walking through the flames
When I am walking through the flames
I will face everything and rise
Never gonna quit until the day I die
Angels keep falling from the sky
Take the broken wings and learn to fly
I will face everything and rise

Face everything and rise

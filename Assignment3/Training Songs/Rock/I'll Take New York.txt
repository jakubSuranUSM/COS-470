I'll tip the newsboy
I'll get a shine
I'll ride that dream to the end of the line
I'm gonna be going places
I'll take a ride
Take me to the Riverside
I wanna take you to New York

I'll make it happen
I'm on the Garbos
I'm drinking Manhattans
I'll take a splash on the big town
That's how I will arrive
Have you got two tens for a five?
You've got to roll out the carpet
Strike up the band
Break out the best champagne when I land
You've got to beat the parade drum
Hit all the bars
I want the moon and stars
I'm gonna take you, New York

I'll make it happen
I'm on the Garbos
I'm drinking Mahattans
And I know someday they're going to name a street after me
Right next door to old Franklin D

I'm going to take you, big town
Come on, new york
Come on, move over, big town
I'll take New York
Come on, big town
Come on, get happy
New York
Come on

"Would you like another cup of tea, dear?"
"Er, no, no, no, I'll better go actually, I'll be late for the office",

I'll take you down to that bright city mile
There to powder your sweet face and paint on a smile,
That will show all of the pleasures and none of the pain,
When you join my explosion and play with my games.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.

No unconditional surrender; no armistice day 
Each night I'll die in my contentment and lie in your grave.
While you bring me water and I give you wine.
Let me dance in your tea-cup and you shall swim in mine.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.
Open your windows and I'll walk through your doors.
Let me live in your country let me sleep by your shores.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.
War Child dance the days, and dance the nights away.

It's people scattered on the floor
Cool war kids are running out of time
It's such a shame to see
It's such a shame to feel this way

The sun comes streaming through the clouds
Dust and dirt are settled all around
But I hear the same old words
And I see the same old warning sky

We're out of luck this time
We've fallen apart
We're out of luck this time

Tears are rolling down my face
Feeds the fear that's running through the stream
And, oh, I just wanna feel
But I don't wanna feel this way

We're out of luck this time
We've fallen apart
We're out of luck this time

No more running away
No more running away
No more running away
No more running away

No more running away
No more running away
No more running away

No more running away
No more running away
No more running away
No more running away
(We've fallen apart)

(No more running away, no more running away)
We're out of luck this time
We've fallen apart
(We've fallen apart)
'Cause we're out of luck this time
(No more running away, no more running away)

Now, I am a woman
And you are a man
I was born different from you
On this earth we both stand
Now, as a daughter
I have learned rules and laws
What to say and not to say
What's acceptable to be called
In the woman's boat
On the woman's sea
They are calling us
They are calling us to sea

And yes, I have my worries
About the human race
You see my breasts are aching
And I hope it's not too late
For the woman's boat
On the woman's sea
They are calling us and they're calling me

How the seasons change
They rock and they rage
Will I please allow the thunder
And the birth inside of me

Now do you believe in powers
Like the human and the seed
And how evolution happens
How the whirlpool spins in me
Oh grandmother tell us your secrets
Your stories passed down through the years
Could I really believe it?
Is there something happening here?
In the woman's boat
On the woman's sea
Is there something hidden
Something to see

Oh the seasons change
They're rocky and they rage
Will I please allow the thunder
And the birth inside of me

She doesn't know how to relax 
Doesn't know how to hold back 
And all I can do is laugh 

Maybe I'm too much in love 
Maybe I don't give a f*ck 
It's never enough 

And it's too late 
I'm never around when your heart breaks 
Never allowed to make mistakes 
Now we're no longer just friends 

I wanna believe in your heart 
And I wanted to see you off guard 
But we're always apart 

And now 
There's nowhere around left to run 
And there's nothing to do but play dumb 
So please sing along 

And it's too late 
I'm never around when your heart breaks 
Never allowed to make mistakes 
Now we're no longer just friends 

Yeah it's too late 
I'm never around when your heart breaks 
Never allowed to make mistakes 
Now we're no longer just friends 

Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah

Here, there's no music here
I'm lost in streams of sound
Here, am I nowhere now?
No plan

Wherever I may go
Just where
Just there
I am

All of the things that are my life
My desires, my beliefs, my moods
Here is my place without a plan

Here
Second Avenue
Just out of view
Here
Is no traffic here?
No plan

All the things that are my life
My my moods, my beliefs, my desires, me alone
Nothing to regret
This is no place, but here I am
This is not quite yet

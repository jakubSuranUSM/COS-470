I was standing in the jungle, I was feeling alright 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
I was wondering in the darkness, in the middle of the night 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
The moon began to shine, I saw a clearing ahead 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
But what`s that going on, I think I`m outta my head 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm.
 
Chooka chooka hoo la ley 
Looka looka koo la ley.

A hundred animals were gathered `round in the night 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
And they were singing out a lovely song under the pale moonlight 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
I stood and stared for quite a while 
Then a lion sang to me and smiled: 
"Come join us if you so desire."

Chooka chooka hoo la ley 
Looka looka koo la ley.

I said now please explain the meaning of this song you sing 
Mmmhmmm, Mmmhmmm 
"Wondrous is our great blue ship 
That sails around the might sun 
And joy to everyone that rides along!"

Chooka chooka hoo la ley 
Looka looka koo la ley.

And they danced!
Pretty soon I knew the tune and 
We sat and sang under the moon 
And the jungle rang in joyful harmony.

Chooka chooka hoo la ley 
Looka looka koo la ley.
Chooka chooka hoo la ley 
Looka looka koo la ley.

"Wondrous is our great blue ship 
That sails around the might sun 
And joy to everyone that rides along!"

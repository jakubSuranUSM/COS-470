Bye, bye love, bye, bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm a gonna cry
Bye, bye love, bye, bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could die, bye, bye my love, goodbye

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

Bye, bye love, bye, bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm a gonna cry
Bye, bye love, bye, bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could die, bye, bye my love, goodbye

I'm a through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye, bye love, bye, bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm a gonna cry
Bye, bye love, bye, bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could die, bye, bye my love, goodbye

Bye, bye love, bye, bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm a gonna cry
Bye, bye love, bye, bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could die, bye, bye my love, goodbye
Bye, bye my love, goodbye, bye, bye my love, goodbye

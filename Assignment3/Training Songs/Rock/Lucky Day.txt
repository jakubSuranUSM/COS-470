Night time, day time,
I've always been blue,
But my May time
Has started with you!
I will admit I've had some luck,
But it has always been bad!
All but down luck
I've just had.

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!
Now I'm in clover,
I'm glad all over,
I wanna shout, "Hooray!".

I found a horse shoe, couldn't go wrong,
And then, of course, you came along!

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!
And look at me now I'm in clover,
But I'm glad all over,
Yet I wanna yell, "Hooray!".

And I found a little horse shoe, that's why I couldn't go wrong,
And then you, you little devil, you came along!

Ah-ha, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!
And now I'm in clover,
I'm glad all over,
I wanna shout, "Hey-hey!".

I found a horse shoe, couldn't go wrong,
And then you, you, you happened along!

Oh boy, I'm lucky,
I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!

Well, put your arms around me like a circle in the sun
Stay with me baby like my easy rider done
If you don't think I love you look what a fool I've been
If you don't think I'm sinking look what a hole I'm in
I'm stealin' pretty mama don't you tell on me 
I'm stealin' back my good old used-to-be
Well, the woman I love she's about my size 
She's a married woman, comes to see me sometimes

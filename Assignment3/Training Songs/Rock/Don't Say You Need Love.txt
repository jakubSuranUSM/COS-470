I wanna bum up my life, he said
To be hurt is a need
I wanna drink that wine, she said
l'm gonna make you bleed
I wanna burn up my life, he said
Consider l'm trying
I wanna taste your blood, she said
l'm gonna drink it dry

I wanna burn up my life, he said
I wanna burn it down
Dissidence is a mood, she said
And love can make you high
I wanna kill that need, he said
Murder is not a crime
I wanna hear that beat, she said
Until the end of the night

The sun is going down and I am still alive
The sun is going down but I don't, I don't wanna die
If we belong to somewhere, tell me where
If we belong to somewhere, somewhere

I wanna burn up my life, he said
To be hurt is a need
I wanna drink that wine, she said
l'm gonna make you bleed
I wanna burn up my life, he said.
Consider I'm trying
I wanna taste your blood, she said
l'm gonna drink it dry

The Sun is going down and I am still alive
The sun is going down but I don't, I don't wanna die
If we belong to somewhere, tell me where
If we belong to somewhere, somewhere

Don't say, don't say, don't say you need love
Don't say, don't say, don't say you need love
Don't say, don't say, don't say you need love
Don't say, don't say, don't say you need love

I know you do
I know you do

Send 'em up and watch them fall
Is anybody talking at all?

Want it all reduced down to an equation
So many variables came up and to know
So I stayed up all night long writing out the code
But by morning light I lost all my concentration, yeah

Hey yo, hey yo, is our mind even open at all?
Hey yo, hey yo, communication is broken, hit a wall
By the time we get out of line it's all over for composure
Hey yo, hey yo, do you hear what I'm saying?
Is our mind even open at all?

Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?
Has your soul felt uncertain on a future outside your door?
Let the moments come, let go and let go and let go until it's all gone
Has the world ever granted you anything that you wish for?

Hey yo, hey yo, is our mind even open at all?
Hey yo, hey yo, communication is broken, hit a wall
By the time we get out of line it's all over for composure
Hey yo, hey yo, do you hear what I'm saying?
Is our mind even open at all?

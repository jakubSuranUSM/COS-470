Only three stops to make in Alabama
Every one a one night stand
Workin' for a man down south Louisiana
Cause Z.Z. ain't his only band
Business ain't been good or bad
But sittin' here will drive me mad

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man

Met a stray woman, I think it was in Texas
She was made for those who'd pay
Got a little drunk and raised a mild ruckus
The city said I could not stay

(I) Guess I'm gonna have to change
Until my life is rearranged

You know 

[Chorus]

(I) Guess I'm gonna have to change
Until my life is rearranged

[Chorus]

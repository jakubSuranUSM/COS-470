There was an old woman that lived in a shoe
She had so many children, she didn't know what to do
They were doin' all right, 'till she took 'em to town
The kids started pickin' 'em up and puttin' 'em down

Now all your children wanna rock, mama
All your children want to roll
They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop till they pop
All your children want to rock

Well, we're not tryin' to live too fast
And we might as well try to live in class
Better move out before the rent comes due
'Cause we wanna live in a blue suede shoe

All your children want to rock, mama
All your children wanna rock
Wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
All your children want to rock

Well, every night when it's quiet and still
You can hear it echoing through the hill
From a blue suede shoe on a mountain top
All of mama's children are doin' the bop

All your children wanna rock, mama
All your children want to roll
They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
All your children want to rock

Well, all your children wanna rock, mama
All your children wanna roll
They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
All your children want to rock

If I sent you home would you come again 
And if I said farewell is that where you begin 
And if I sent you home 
Would you come on in 
And if you say you won't 
Then I know you will 

I was all alone like a father with no son 
You were like a dream 
Woken up just as begun 
I was left alone 
With the promise that you made 

All I want to do is make it over you 
I want to 

And if I said farewell then we're on our own 
You know I never thought I'd say the words 
But you know you can't have all the hurt 

All I want to do 
Is step up for you 
Tell me is it true 
I will come back to you 
I said I would

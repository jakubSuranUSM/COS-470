Tryin´ not to lose myself
in the women and the wine
Tryin´ not to change my point of view
Hopin´ I can keep my feet
above the waterline
Even after all my dreams come true

In a sea of motion
Water edged with foam
Clingin´ to the things I used to know
Swallowed by an ocean
Sinking like a stone
But I´m drownin´ in the undertow

Tryin´ not to lose myself
in the glitter and the gold
Tryin´ not to change the way I see
Hopin´ I can keep my eyes
on things that stay the same
`Cause I cannot keep my hold
Even on the things I know are real

Caught upon the waters
of some dark and nameless sea
Whoa let the current carry me

Tryin´ not to lose myself
in the fortune and the fame
Tryin´ not to change the way I see
Hopin´ I can keep my eyes
on the things that stay the same
and disregard the things that seem to be

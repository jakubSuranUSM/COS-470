Yeah 
My shadow stretches far and free 
Yeah 
It's telling me what I could be 
Could be 

Cause I'm tired 
Of looking up 
All the time 

We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 
We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 

Yeah 
We'll set ourselves apart in time 
Yeah 
And then we'll leave it all behind 
I'll rise 

Cause I'm tired 
Of looking out 
For the line 

We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 
We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 

We'll stand on top of the world 

Yeah 
Is anybody here like me? 
Yeah 
Can you face the sound 
And decide? 

We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 
We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 
We'll stand on top of the world 
Looking down 
To rise above on our own 
Looking down

Know you can know you can
Know you can know you can

Wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract
Lots of things I had to sign at the time
Man told me not to worry 'bout the business
Just keep on poppin' those hits

Know you can, know you can
Know you can, know you can

Sat down in my pyramid mansion
Old Martin seems to know all the chords
Tired of beggin', I can make it without them
Played the blues so I wouldn'Â­t get bored

You made me your slave. Whatever God gave me
You took to the grave, now it'Â­s gone
I gave you my heart. Whatever God gave me
You took to the grave, now it'Â­s gone
Yeah, it'Â­s gone
Gone

Smokin', chokin', drinkin', sinkin', falling over
Cokin', flyin', speedin', dyin', roll me over
Roll me over (wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract)
Roll me over (wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract)

Know you can know you can
Know you can know you can

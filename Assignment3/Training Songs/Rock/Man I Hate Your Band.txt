Don't talk to me about money
Don't talk to be about fame
Don't tell be about your lyrics
Cause your songs are all the same
There's 11 on the guest list probably more by far
Photographers and magazines and stacks of A&R

Like I said about the guest list
Well forget about the birds
They don't need names and tickets for the ones in denim skirts
You highlight for the weekend
Unless your on the team

Brand new tops
And bottoms drop
No knickers underneath

But there's one thing that you'll never understand
Oh there's one thing that you gotta understand
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band

Well were going down to London
Were gonna sign a deal
We know a guy in camdom
Who says that were unreal
And while we are in London
Well stop and see the queen
You known we'll all have knighthoods by the time were 23

Well your coming home nobody
The same as when you went
You didn't get your deal on
Your moneys all been spent
I could of told you long ago
But you'd never understand
No bollocks to be hero'd

Man I can't stand your band

There's one thing that you'll never understand
Oh there's one thing that you gotta understand
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band
Man I hate your band

I've seen your band
I hate your band
I've seen your band
I hate your band
I've seen your band
I hate your band
I've seen your band
I hate your band
I've seen your band
I hate your band
I hate your band

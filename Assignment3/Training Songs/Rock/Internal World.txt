Say what you are to anyone
And you reveal you're weak, here
Where would you go to lose all your angles?
How would you make it complete?

You nullify and cut 'em off
Reveal the light supreme, hey
Who would you follow
Anywhere they wanted
If at the end you’d be free?

And it, it looks like mine anyone
Internal world, the one worth living

But then, it looks like mine anyone
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like mine, anyone
Internal world the one worth living
But if it looks like mine, anyone
Internal world the one worth living

But I’m not the one who’s always right
No, I’m not the one who’s always right
No, I’m not the one who’s always right
No, I’m not the one who’s always right

Nobody is an enemy
Nobody’s just one hair, here
Where would you go to lose all your angles?
How would you make it complete?

You have a face for everyone
You have a face for me
Who would you follow
Anywhere they wanted
If at the end you’d be free?

And if it looks like mine anyone
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like mine anyone
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like mine, anyone
Internal world the one worth living
But if it looks like mine, anyone
Internal world the one worth living

But I’m not the one who’s always right
No, I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right

I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right

I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right
I’m not the one who’s always right, no

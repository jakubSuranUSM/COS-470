Once I was traveling across the sky
This lovely planet caught my eye
And being curious I flew close by
And now I'm caught here till I die

Until we die, until we die
We are just learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together

I lost my memory of where I've been
We all forgot we could fly
We'll all change into peaceful man
And we'll return into the sky

Until we die, until we die
We are just learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Till we die

Until we die, until we die
We are just learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together

Learning to live together
It's getting better together
We've got to get together
It's getting better together

Oh, until we die, until we die
We are just learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together

Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning

Until we die, until we die
We are just learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together

Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together

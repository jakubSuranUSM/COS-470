I’m waiting here

Can’t we draw never fulfill these here
I move nowhere only to find you here
Your deepest hell, never the same as them
Keep me low where the horizon melts

I’m waiting here

We made love
Under a dark moon
I’ve burned a lot of bridges
Some castles were made of sand
Only then

Can I alone look at the sky my dear
I am not every falling star
Make a wish, it will turn away
So we can love on til infinity

Here
I’m waiting here

Here
I’m waiting here

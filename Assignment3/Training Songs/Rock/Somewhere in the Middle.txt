I cant'run from a heart I put my life into
And I can't hide because I wanna be found
But then I'm scared she won't like the man
I'm trying to become now
I feel small, when she speaks to me in tongues
If there's a message I'm too blind to hear it
I need a sign, unless time makes things better
Everyone hurts now and then
Some of us shine in the end
We all need some hope somewhere in the middle
My fence is down, the lines are blurred
I'll give up ground on just your word
We'll meet again somewhere in the middle
I'm not a saint I had my share of un forgiveness
I made mistakes that I'm not too proud to mention

We need a change cause I'm wasted from all the drama
Everyone falls now and then
Some of us turn in the end
We all need some hope somewhere in the middle
My fence is down, the lines are blurred
I'll give up ground on just your word
We'll meet again somewhere in the middle
I'll say goodbye to the old charade
Baby your smile is my saving grace
My fence is down, the lines are blurred
I'll give up ground on just your word
We'll meet again somewhere in the middle
I'll say goodbye to the old charade
Your smile is my saving grace
We'll meet again somewhere in the middle

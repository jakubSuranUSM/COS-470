The Devil You And Me - 

We know we're not the smartest in this place we don't have to be
Lights are out but anyhow this is what they see it's the devil it's you and me 

bring it on home and keep beds warm won't leave you anyhow
Bring it on home and keep beds warm won't leave you anyhow

now we know that snow will fill our window a year long winter is gone and all is white 
We pick our things and leave this place because this is what they see it's the devil it's you and me 

bring it on home and keep beds warm won't leave you anyhow
Bring it on home and keep beds warm won't leave you anyhow

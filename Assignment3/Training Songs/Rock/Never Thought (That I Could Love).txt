Can I touch you?
I can't believe that you are real
How did I ever find you?
You are the dream that saved my life
You are the reason I survived
Baby

I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need 
Someone as much as I need you
I love you

Can I hold you?
Girl your smile lights up the sky
You are too beautiful for the human eye
You are the dream that never dies
You are the fire that burns inside
Baby

I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I love you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you
I love you

You are the sunshine in the sky
You are the sparkle in my eyes

I never thought that I could love
Someone as much as I need you
I know it's crazy but it's true
I know it's true
I never thought that I could need
Someone as much as I need you
I love you

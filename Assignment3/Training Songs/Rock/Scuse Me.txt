'Scuse me - for the clothes I wear
'Scuse me - how long is my hair
'Scuse me - 'cause I'm bein'real
Ya may not like it but it's way I feel

[Chorus]
Hallucinations
Man they're outta sight
Mirror is right you know
But I still love you

'Scuse me - for livin' in the past
'Scuse me - when your fads don't last
'Scuse me - 'cause I choose to be blind
Ya may not like it though you really don't mind

[Chorus, 1st verse, chorus]

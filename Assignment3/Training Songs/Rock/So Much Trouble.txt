My baby left me, my mule got lame,
Lost all my money in a poker game.
Wind storm came one summer's day,
Carried the house and lift it away.

Having so much trouble
Having so much trouble.

I'm having so much trouble.
It's finally driving me insane.

Carry me to jail my pyjamas on,
I even hate that I was born.
Let me out of jail, come through town.
Couldn't find my wife, she had put me down.

Having so much trouble,
Having so much trouble.

I'm having so much trouble:
It's finally driving me insane.
I pawned my watch and I pawned my chain,
I would have pawned myself but i was ashamed.
Got me a job on the city pay
Early one morning laid me off that day.

I'm having so much trouble,
I'm having so much trouble,
I'm having so much trouble,
Bought to drive me insane.
I'm having so much trouble:
It's finally driving me insane.
Trouble!

I'm A Fool To Care

I'm a fool to care
When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do
I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry
When you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue
When you were untrue
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh
And call it a day
But I know I was right
If you went away
I'm a fool to care
When you don't care for me
So why should I pretend
I lose in the end
I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh
And call it a day
But I know I was right
If you went away
I'm a fool to care
When you treat me this way
I know I love you
But what can I do
I'm a fool to care

Leave your parcel at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blister, blister, blister

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)

Such a harsh town, yet so easily
It's never been much in front of me
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)

Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself (out)

Anything in this town
(Can't escape) anything in this town
(Can't escape) anything in this town
(Can't escape) anything in this town

Leave your parcel at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blister, blister, blister

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

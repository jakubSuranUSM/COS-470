Can't you see
This is gonna bruise
Friends, they be wrong
To peel both along
I laugh

Freedom to roam
To beat the fall

Couldn't ask for more
Children

Gotta live
Don't creep up

You got to give a little, give a little
And see it
Like future people

Some things could be
Seen from above
Afraid of the sound

Don't cheer me on

Children

Gotta live
Don't creep up

You got to give a little, give a little
And see it
Like future people

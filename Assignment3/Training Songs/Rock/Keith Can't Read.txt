Get outta the street right now
Your in the way
The red light has turned to green
I ain't got all day

There ain't no pictures in this book
Just dirty pages take a look 

If you think your woman is good to you
Think about when you're away from her
What you put her through

There ain't no pictures in this book
Just dirty pages take a look

Get off of your knees right now
Your looking up my nose
Girl that ain't gonna cut no ice
Heaven knows

An honourable man picks a slender orchid
And crushed it between his hands
The sacred knife of a Samurai
Serves up Sushi in a sandwich bar

A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
Tigerlily with eyes of jade
Takes you to a carnival of toy balloons

See a kite floating by with the face of a Chinese mandarin
Its such a different world its hard to remember
Which land you're in
I seem to recall a milk white hand
Painted with blood red fingernails

A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
A tiny girl with empty hands
Walks the streets of Tokyo

A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
A doll that's made in Japan
Is made for every man
As you fly through a city of empty souls
You feel that the wind is whispering

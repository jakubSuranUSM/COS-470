We're off you know to a distant land 
And the only ones allowed to come are those who feel they can 
Go right along with the master plan 
For we're all agreed that all we need is sitting there in your head 
(Is that all? That's all. That's all? That's all.) 

So raise the sails and trim all the sheets 
Set your course and jam all the cleats 
We'll follow the north star to know where we are so 
You sleepyheads get out of bed right now 
Let your fortunes be cast to the wind 

And so it's off we go to some uncharted shore 
'Cause the only kind we're out to find are those worth looking for 
You can tag along should you feel the urge to merge 
'Cause we're all agreed that all we need is Hope and a little courage 
(Is that all? That's all. Ooh hoo hoo) 

So raise the sails and trim all the sheets 
Set your course and jam all the cleats 
We'll follow the North Star to know where we are so 
You sleepyheads get out of bed right now 
Get out the lead full steam ahead smartly now 
For the journey begins 
The journey begins 
Our journey begins come the sun 

Well wouldn't you like to go too ...?

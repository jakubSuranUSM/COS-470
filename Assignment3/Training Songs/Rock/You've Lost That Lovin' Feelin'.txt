You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips

It makes me just
Feel like crying (oh, baby)
Cause, baby, something
Beautiful's dying

You've lost that loving feeling
Oh, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Oh, oh, oh

Now there's no welcome look
In your eyes when I reach by you
Now you've started to criticize
Every little thing I do

You're trying hard
Not to show it (oh, baby)
But, baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Oh, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, baby, I get right
Down on my knees for you
If you would only love me
Like you used to do, yeah

We had a love, a love
A love you don't find everyday
So darling, darling, darling
Don't throw our love away
No, no, no, no

Well, I said
Baby (baby) baby (baby)
Well, baby (baby) oh, baby

(Bring it on, baby)
I'll bring it on back, child
(Just bring it on back to me)
I'll bring it on back now
(Bring it on back to me)
I said I'll bring it on back
(Well, bring it on, bring it on)
I'll bring it on back now (yeah)

Bring back that loving feeling
Oh, that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bring back that loving feeling
Oh, that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
And I can't go on
And I can't go on

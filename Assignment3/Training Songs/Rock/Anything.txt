Anything for you
Turn my castles blue
Turn my bones to sand

Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything

Jackie O. with the top down, open
All the words to what is unspoken
I'll put together everything that's broken

Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything

Jackie O. with the top down, open
A king is horse for what's been broken
I'll bring back even what is unspoken

Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll be your anything

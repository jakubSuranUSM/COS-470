You try and make some sense of good days 
Now that they're all good
Every little thing that they say 
She lies to console 
For she cries for a lost soul

You, you know we're gone 
Waiting we're all so lost, lost 

Said I couldn't get out of bed 
Is that the law 
Every little thing that I've said 
You just can't ignore 
She lies to console 
For she cries for a lost soul

You, you know we're gone 
Cos waiting we're all so lost 
You, you know its cost

Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls
Lost souls

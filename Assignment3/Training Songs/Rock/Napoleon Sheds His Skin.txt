The streets are covered in chalk
The shops are boarded up
The bodies are carried back down from the square 
He begins to wonder
If it always was this hot
Or is it just the clothes
That he now wears

Napoleon sheds his skin
In the summer when the sun is high
He never knew when to quit
When to stop
Or when to say die

Pick the bones, get a tan
Or wander underground
She would not have left him anyway
Wait by the sea, wait in the sun
As if the time stood still
Did he get involved n whichever side that paid

Napoleon sheds his skin
In the summer when the sun is high
He never knew when to quit
When to stop
Or when to say die

Oh, when time stands still behind the distant gates
And time moves on outside in the sun
Then he wonders which side he's really on
Then he doesn't care, It's so grey in there
He just wants to get back to her

Napoleon sheds his skin
In the summer when the sun is high
He never knew when to quit
When to stop
Or when to say die

She waits for him by the wharf
By the sea where they used to go
And she sings a song that they'd sing
Then she waits for the echo

Napoleon sheds his skin
Napoleon sheds his skin
Napoleon sheds his skin

I've got to get out of here
Can she save me
I've got to get out of here
Can she save me
I've got to get out of here
Can you hear me

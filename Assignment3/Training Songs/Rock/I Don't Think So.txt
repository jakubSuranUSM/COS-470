In the morning
It's the last time that I saw her face
In that special way to me
Without a warnin'
She pulled every trick to name a few
What was I supposed to be ?

[Chorus:]
I'd like to think she cried for me
But I don't know
Her memories won't let me be
Just can't let go
In the morning is when I think about her
Could it be she cried for me ?
I don't think so

In the evening
I don't think it was a peacefull scene
Seemed to me a little rough
She was leavin'
But she forgot to leave a piece of me
I didn't know she was that tough

I don't know why she'd see me
I don't know what else to be

[Chorus]

Is there something
That I could do to make her feel a thing ?
I don't know what to expect
Guess there's one thing
I got left but then I could be wrong
Maybe that's the thing she wrecked

I don't know 
Why she'd see me
I don't know what else to be
Hope she's diggin' being free but

[Chorus]

I'd like to think she cried for me
I don't think so

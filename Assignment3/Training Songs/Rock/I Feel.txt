Feel the touch of my hand
See the light in my eye
You know why I feel

Like a foolish young boy
Like some discarded toy
Like a wounded animal
And you know why

I feel like it's need more than desire
I feel all my senses are on fire
I feel, I feel and you know why

Feel the dirt on my hands
Feel the beat of my heart
Feel and watch the fire start

Feel the pain that I know
Taste the blood that I shed
Come and lay on my bed

See the lies in my eyes
Feel the heat in my hands
Feel and I know that
You will understand why

I feel like nobody know or cares how
I feel like I'm gonna be kind of sick now
I feel

I feel and you know why
Feel the back of my hand
Feel the beat of my heart
Feel and watch the fire start

Feel the pain that I know
Taste the blood that I shed
Come and lay on my bed

Yeah perfect piece of trash
You know I saved you from the scumhole
There amongst the trash
With the broke and the old

Took you to my shack
And I cleaned it up like new
Brought her all her all the clothes
By the lengths of her shoes

Took you to a party
As my special guest
Showed it to my friends
And they were most impressed
But then they lost their heads
They started coming on like leeches
Took my piece of trash
Yeah they tore her to pieces

Yeah perfect piece of trash

You know you turned on me
Tried to take me down
When I couldn't see
I said you thankless piece of trash
Hey what the f*ck is wrong with you
I saved your sorry ass
Yeah I fucking made you

And I taught you how to dress
Taught you how to walk
I taught you how to impress
Taught you how to talk
And I won't let you go
Yeah I love her so
I can't let her go
Yeah I love her so
Yeah perfect piece of trash
Perfect piece of trash
Perfect piece of trash
Perfect piece of trash
Yeah trash

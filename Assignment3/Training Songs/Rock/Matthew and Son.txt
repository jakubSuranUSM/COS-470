Up at eight, you can't be late
For Matthew and son, he won't wait.
Watch them run down to platform one
And the eight-thirty train to matthew & son.

Matthew & son, the work's never done, there's always something new.
The files in your head, you take them to bed, you're never ever through.
And they've been working all day, all day, all day!

There's a five minute break and that's all you take,
For a cup of cold coffee and a piece of cake.

Matthew and son, the work's never done, there's always something new.
The files in your head, you take them to bed, you're never ever through.
And they've been working all day, all day, all day!

He's got people who've been working for fifty years
No one asks for more money 'cause nobody cares
Even though they're pretty low and their rent's in arrears

Matthew and son, Matthew and son, Matthew and son, Matthew and son,
And they've been working all day, all day, all day!

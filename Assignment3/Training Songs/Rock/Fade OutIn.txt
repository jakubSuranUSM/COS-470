Innocence gone
It's like they want the T.V. shows on
Feeling like a high school prom
And you wanna pretend
Useless and full of it
Why no one else can believe in this
You wanna feel something to call your own
That they can't cut out 
They can't cut it out

I've seen better days than this
Coming closer to my wits' end falling fever

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fade out
I don't wanna fade in
Like everybody should
I don't wanna fade out
I don't wanna fade in
Like everything before

Fall asleep soon
It's like they're gonna wake you up
It's pushing out this insecurity
Well you won't push me
You can't push me

I've caught nails, slashed and bruised
I'll get my way 
I'll see the day it'll come out clearer

[Chorus]

Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out
Fade in, fade out

[Chorus]

It's a killer underneath
I'm in my silence 
In between us

I don't wanna fade out
I wanna fade in
Like everything before

You must swear we're all lost
It's far to go
It's far to go
It's far to go and too late
So you can push you again

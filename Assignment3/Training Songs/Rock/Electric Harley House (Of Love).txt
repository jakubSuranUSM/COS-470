So you want to go on the road? 
Want to see my love to unfold? 
You must be young, and you must be bold
On your knees and do what you're told
You pull the trigger of my loaded gun
Then you'll see, we'll be having some fun
So meet me by the backstage door
If it's good, then let's go for the
Electric Harley house of love 

Gone all day, then I loathe with mine,
I'll give you time for your head to unwind
Can you sleep?
It's my head to the floor
Spin around and look out for some more
Can you see I'm allowed to say 'ill'
Want to taste the blood of your kill
So reach out and take my hand
We'll be off to never neverland in the
Electric Harley house of love 
Come on, boys. 

I know you think it's Metallica
Well, if it is, my name is Ja, 
Would you think we'd rip it off? 
I think we did. 
Bend over and cough
So they say it's the sound toms, 
When the band's called 'something rom'
It did not happen all the time, 
I think we got, we're never bound in the
Electric Harley house of love

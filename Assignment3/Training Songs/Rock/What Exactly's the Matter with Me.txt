Why do I deny all that's accepted true?
Why can't I live my life like I'm expected to?
Get a college degree, buy colour TV?
Oh what's exactly the mater with me?

I believe no one's conclusions, I think for myself.
I take nothing for granted, my brain aint on the shelf.
I've got my views though I'm missed and confused.
Oh what's exactly the matter with me?

Why can't I settle down in one little place?
Find me a girl and get out of this race?
But, my boots start itching, my eyes start looking.
Oh what's exactly the matter with me?

Why can't I march when the cause is just?
Stamp out oppression, greed and lust?
Oh, inferiority, insecurity.
Yeah, that's exactly the matter with me.

Why do I “yes” people that I despise?
Why can't I say “I hate you” right to your eyes?
Oh, Inferiority in hostility.
Yeah, that's exactly the matter with me.
That's exactly the matter with me.

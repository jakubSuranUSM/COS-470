The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
One day you'll cry, I won't come back to you
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
You've got such a great, big beautiful smile
I want to hug and kiss you for a while
The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see

You've got such a great, big beautiful smile
You're so doggone mean I wonder why?
One day you'll cry, I won't come back to you
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
The sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
Wait and see, wait and see
Wait and see, wait and see

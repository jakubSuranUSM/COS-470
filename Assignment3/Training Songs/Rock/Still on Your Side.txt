Emotions ran high,
And the words were strong
Heard the screen door slam,
And you were gone
You can't win a fight
You don't understand
And I wake up alone
Reachin' for your hand

Like a cold wind in December
When we don't see eye to eye
I want you to remember
I'm still on your side
When you need me girl
Still on your side

As sure as a river 
Runs to the sea
There'll have to be times,
We both disagree

Sometimes I feel like shoutin'
It's like a freight train in my heart
Make you see there'll be no doubtin'
I'm still on your side
When you need me girl
Still on your side

And I look up
To see you standin' there
But you just look right thru me
Somebody tell me I'm dreamin'
Pretend you don't care
As you turn round and walk out that door

Sometimes I feel like shoutin'
It's like a freight train in my heart
Make you see there'll be no doubtin'
I'm still on your side
Like a cold wind in December
When we don't see eye to eye
I want you to remember
I'm still on your side
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm still on your side

goodnight goodnight anesthetized goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight
well i passed the acid bath with a flying trash can crash 
'Cause when you're learning to burn out fast might as well do it with smashing panache 

so goodnight goodnight life inside the anesthetized 
goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

i take dead aim in a dead end town your lips seem to move but 
i can't hear a sound i take dead aim in a dead end town your lips seem to part 
but i can't hear a sound
hey little butterfly would you slip me some on the side to keep me warm for the time passed by passed by passed by passed by
i take dead aim in a dead end town your lips seem to move but i can't hear a sound i take dead aim in a dead end town your lips seem to part but i can't hear a sound
she doo be love love love she doo be love love love...

Well the king of the dollar says 
I'm not home when the phone rings 
He hangs a sign on the door that says 
Do not disturb 
And the king of the dollar 
Puts his money where his mouth is 
Cause he thinks it's the only way 
He can be heard 

The king's getting lonely 
In his thirteen bedroom mansion 
So he calls me up 
From his big black limousine 
And he don't understand 
When he gets no satisfaction 
He's in so deep 
But man he thinks he's clean 

And time after time you know I've seen him 
When He's crying in the night 
Or once in his life he's finding out 
That there are things he just can't buy 

From your greedy little hands 
To your cake hole mouth 
You can add up all the figures
But count me out 
You can count me out 

And time after time you know I've seen him 
When he's crying in the night 
For once in his life he's finding out 
That there are things he just can't buy

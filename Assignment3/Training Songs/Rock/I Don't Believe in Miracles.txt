I walk along the road
And past your door
Then I remember things you said
I know in time it could have been
So much more
But if you wanna come back home
Go right ahead

But I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in miracles
But I thought you might show your face
Or have the grace
To tell me where you are

I believe I was your game, your ball
If you threw me up, then I would fall
And so you've won again
You win them all
But I'd believe I'd run to you
If you should call

But I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in miracles
But I thought you might show your face
Or have the grace
To tell me where you are

And I believe that somewhere there's someone
Who's gonna light the way when things go wrong
The bullet that shot me down
Was from your gun
The words that turned me round
Were from your song

But I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in miracles
But I thought you might show your face
Or have the grace
To tell me where you are

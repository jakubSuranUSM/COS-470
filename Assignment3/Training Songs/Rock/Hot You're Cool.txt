In a far far cooler light
This could seem too deep a bite
But the days too bright
Tonight's the night

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Show me my favourite beauty spot
Tie me up in a love knot
Boiling over bubbling up

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot
So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot hot hot

Hot legs against my chest
Stomach tight and wet
The very best
Yes you've guessed
You've guessed it

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Show me my favourite beauty spot
Tie me up in a love knot
Boiling over bubbling up

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot
So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot hot hot

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Show me my favourite beauty spot
Tie me up in a love knot
Boiling over bubbling up

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot
So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot hot hot

Hot hot hot hot
Just tell them they should no bother business
Tell them that it's out affair
Tell them nothing else exists
When I run my fingers through your hair

So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot
So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot hot
Hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot
So hot you cool
So cool you hot
Hot you cool so cool
You hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

Name your price,
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a shortcut, I'd have found it
But there's no easy way around it.

[Chorus]
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer.

Who knows why,
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls

And we are never heard,
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world.
People turn their heads and walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try ?

[Chorus]

Tell me, are we alive or a just a dying planet ?
What are the chances ?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers.

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
And when you're all alone, love one another
And when you're far from home, love one another.
And when you're down and out, love one another
And when your hope runs out, love one another
And when you need a friend, love one another
And when you're near the end, love
We got to love
We got to love one another.

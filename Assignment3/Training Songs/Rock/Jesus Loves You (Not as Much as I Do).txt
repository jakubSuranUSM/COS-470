They say I'm damned to hell
Well I'll be damned
I know I'm not to be with you
But I have to

Life is good, life is good
And Jesus loves you, as well he should

They say I'm all through
I can't take no more
They're the types that make me sick
They're the types that make me ill
And you are not

Life is good and Jesus loves you
And so I do, oh
Jesus loves you, but not as much as I do
No, not as much as I do
No, not as much as I do

Hey, life is good and Jesus loves you
And so I do
Oh, Jesus loves you, but not as much as I do
No, not as much as I do
No, not as much as I do

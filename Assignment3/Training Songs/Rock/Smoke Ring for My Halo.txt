Smoke ring for my halo
Angel demon human
Over as the maiden
Over and over
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now
Think I can see it now

Smoke ring for my halo
Human angel demon
Under as the maiden
Right under the moon over your house
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then yeah

Sippin' from the sewer can
It's the size of my hand
Pacifies the land
Makes the most out of your jizztown man
I feel like laying down
I feel like laying down
Yeah and I wanna do it again
Over the miss I kiss again

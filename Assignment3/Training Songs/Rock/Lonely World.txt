Wo, wo, wo

I'm just a fool searchin'
For someone to care
I've searched the whole world over
But you don't hear my prayer

Wo, yeah
(Searching for my love)
Uh huh
(Girl I'm dreaming of)
Oh, in my lonely world
(Lonely world, lonely world)

Wo, I'm tired of bein' lonely
I want someone to love
No matter who's beside me
It's you I'm thinkin' of

Wo, yeah
(Searching for my love)
Uh huh
(Girl I'm dreaming of)
Oh, in my lonely world
(Lonely world, lonely world)

Wo, you know my world kind of falls apart
'Cause you love someone else
Yeah, my heart, my soul, my whole world was you
You mean more than life itself

No one will ever know, dear
The suffering I go through
I suffer most of all
'Cause I can't stop loving you

Wo, yeah
(Searching for my love)
Uh huh
(Girl I'm dreaming of)
Oh, in my lonely world
(Lonely world, lonely world)

Wo, wo, wo

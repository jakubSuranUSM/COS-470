Cry
Cry out your eyes forever
It won't go away
I
I'm just a dumb observer
It's so stupid what I said

Like everyone else will do
I'm gonna lie to you
Tell you that life is cruel
But someday you're gonna wake up
With sleep instead of teardrops in your eyes

An so
Nobody lives forever
The crassest of cliches
Like time
Time is the greatest healer
But it's a murderer to do

Like everyone else will do
I'm gonna lie to you
Tell you that life is cruel
But someday you're gonna wake up
With sleep instead of teardrops in your eyes

You know my holding you won't change, anything
I can't stop this whole charade, continuing
As each consoling kiss remains, on your face, like a stain

So cry
Cry out those tears an let them 
Succumb to gravity
An try
Try as I might I'll never
Fill that vacancy

Like everyone else will do
I'm gonna lie to you
Tell you that life is cruel
But someday you're gonna wake up
With sleep instead of teardrops in your eyes

Someday you're gonna wake up 
With sleep instead of teardrops in your eyes

Maybe I'll see you again, 
Maybe
And maybe I won't
Maybe you bought your ticket going back to Detroit 
Air-o-plains make strangers of us all
Give us distance 
Much to easily 
Jim says some destines should not be delivered
But you and I see now 
Baby
That still they are
Winning it makes losers of us all
Gives us distance
Much to easily

Well I wrap myself in cities I've traveled
I wrap myself in dreams
I wrap myself in solitude 
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee

Tonight it's hot 
Without you tomorrow be cold
Winter will come along 
Driven by snow
Love it makes strangers of us all
When we fall 
Oh so thoughtlessly 

Well I wrap myself in cities I've traveled
I wrap myself in dreams
I wrap myself in solitude 
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee
 
Once we breathe the breath 
Of sweet surrender
Pure, pure air of air
Filled our atmosphere
But night it makes stars of us all
until we fall
For everyone to see

Well I wrap myself in cities I've traveled
I wrap myself in dreams
I wrap myself in strangers arms 
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee

Well I wrap myself in cities I've traveled
I wrap myself in dreams
I wrap myself in solitude 
But I wish I could wrap myself in thee

I want to be your suitcase
I want to hang around inside your Greyhound terminal

I want to be your ray gun
I aim to be your ray pistol
I want to light the way across your starless lonely nights

I aim to be a suitcase
I want to hang around inside your Greyhound terminal
I want to ride the baggage car of your ole mystery train

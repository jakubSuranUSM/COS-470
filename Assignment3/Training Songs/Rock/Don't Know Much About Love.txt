Baby can you teach me - how to
Baby can you reach me, I'm calling out for you
Underneath your window tonight
I know I ain't no romeo, so help me make it right

If I can get this message through to your heart
It would be more than I could understand
No beginner ever skipped the start
And I want to learn all than I possibly can

Because I don't know much
I don't know much, much about love
Out of touch
I don't know much, much about love

Baby when you kiss me will I see
That little wish list you've been keeping for me
I'm rushing like a fool, babe, 'cause I know
If they taught you this in school
You must have made the honour roll

If I can get this message through to your heart
It would be more than I can understand
No beginner ever skipped the start
And I want to learn more than I possibly can

Because I don't know much
I don't know much, much about love
Out of touch
I don't know much, much about love

I graduated, baby, I can read
But the pages of the heart come difficult for me
I speak my mind girl, everyday
But the language of love
Well, I don't know how to say

Because I don't know much
I don't know much, much about love
Out of touch
I don't know much, much about love

Because I don't know much
I don't know much, much about love
Out of touch
I don't know much, much about love

Won't you wear my ring on your finger
Wear my love within your heart
And say you'll always be
As much in love with me as at the start

Won't you wear my ring on your finger?
And make this solemn vow
That you'll will always be
As much in love with me as you are now

And when we're old and we're gray
We will still have this day
To remember when December comes in May

Won't you wear my ring on your finger?
Provin' that love is ours to share
You're mine till evermore
Just like this ring of gold you now wear

And when we're old and we're gray
We will still have this day
To remember when December comes in May

Won't you wear my ring on your finger?
Provin' that love is ours to share
You're mine till evermore
Just like this ring of gold you now wear

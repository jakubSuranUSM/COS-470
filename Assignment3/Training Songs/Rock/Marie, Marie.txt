playing guitar on the back porch
I sit in my car

While she sings so sad

It''s so lonely in the farmlands

Please come with me
To the bright lights downtown

I said
hey
pretty girl

Don''t you understand

I just want to be your loving man.

The sun is down in the cornfield

The evening is dark
And you sing so sad

It''s so lonely in the farmlands

I got two weeks in back pay

There''s gas in my car
And your folks say I must go

Playing guitar on the back porch
I leave in my car
While she sings so sad

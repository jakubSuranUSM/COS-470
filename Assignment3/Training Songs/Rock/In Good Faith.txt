There's a place within my heart 
Tucked away from all the pain 
And deep within this secret side of me 
Just the simple truth remains 
Words don't come easy 
Feelings I hide even from myself 
I'm ready to share without hesitation 
I've been saving this moment 
For someone who's saving this moment too 
Tell me it's you 
I'll give you everything that I got 
Say you'll never turn and run 
Cause each and every beat of my heart 
Tells me you're the only one 
I've cast aside this foolish pride 
I know I can keep you satisfied 
I'll prove it tonight in so many ways 
That's a promise from the heart 
In good faith 
In the roles that we have chosen 
Behind the parts we sometimes play 
Lies the passage to the real me 
With no illusions in the way 
Words don't come easy 
But I'll get the feeling across somehow 
Let it be now 
I'll give you everything that I got 
Say you'll never turn and run 
Cause each and every beat of my heart 
Tells me you're the only one 
I've cast aside, this foolish pride 
I know I can keep you satisfied 
I'll prove it tonight in so many ways 
That's a promise from the heart 
In good faith 
Behind these eyes tonight 
The truth comes shining 
A fire that is rarely seen 
It burns for you 
I've never needed anyone this way 
Never found the right words to say 
Until today 
But I'll give you everything that I got 
Say you'll never turn and run 
Cause each and every beat of my heart 
Tells me you're the only one 
I've cast aside, this foolish pride 
I know I can keep you satisfied 
I'll prove it tonight in so many ways 
That's a promise from the heart 
In good faith

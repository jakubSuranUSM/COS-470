Floatin' down that old river, boy
All my worries far behind
Floatin' down that old river, boy
Leave old memories way behind

Yesterday is slowly fadin'
All my life I've been waitin'
For this time

Floatin' down that old river, boy
Leaves me feelin' good inside
Floatin' down that old river, boy
Tryin' to get to the other side

Yesterday is slowly fadin'
I've been waitin' now forever
For this ride

Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river

Floatin' down that old river, boy
All my worries far behind
Floatin' down that old river, boy
Leave old memories way behind

Yesterday is slowly fadin'
I've been waitin' now forever
For this ride

Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river

Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river
Ride the river in this boat, ride the river

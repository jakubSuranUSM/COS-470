You're strong, you're stubborn now
In an endless symbolic war
Brave or bored, either/or

Sometimes I ricochet from the past
And at times a future Iâ??ve already had before
Champion or chore, either/or.

Iâ??ll write the pages you rip out, back in their places again
One day youâ??ll know what youâ??re talking about
I can hardly imagine, but until then Iâ??ll be

Filling in these blanks that you create 
Every time you win some petty score
Posing as hardcore, oh yeah, either/or

Look at the spin chief, battered and broken
Clutching a plastic rose
Weâ??re all in the downpour you carry around for
Trashing a lifestyle youâ??ve never known

Itâ??s a useful dream that makes
Quite an entertaining show and not much more
Up against and for, either/or

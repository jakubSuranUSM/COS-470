Tired of bein' pushed, bumped and turned around
Listenin' to the people fightin' next floor down
Tryin' to find fresh air to breath, just can't be done, no
I gotta get away and get some country sun
Look to the sky, the stars are outta sight
Hidden by the cloud of the city's might
Hear the sirens blowin' all over town
Well now, I gotta get away and get some country sound

Take it slow and take it easy
Lots of time for livin'
Get out on the road and take a big load off your mind
Out in the country
Your time's your time
And you know that you'll be feelin' right

Layin' in grass that's over two feet tall
Well now, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' clean, I'm feelin' small
Breathin' this air can really stone the brain
Like bein' lost and findin' your way again
Look to the sky, the stars are shinin' bright
The smile on the moon just helps to light the night
Sittin' doin' nothin' is bad they say - ha!
But sittin' here doin' nothin' keeps me busy all day

Take it slow and take it easy
Lots of time for livin'
Get out on the road and take a big load off your mind
Out in the country
Your time's your time out on the road
Take a load off your mind
Out in the country
Your time's your time out on the road
Take a load off your mind
Out in the country
Your time's your time out on the road
Take a load off your mind
Out in the country

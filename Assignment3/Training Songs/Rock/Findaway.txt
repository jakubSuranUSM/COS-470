You've been locked up  and you need to escape  
You broke the law  it was a first offense  
Drug addiction  subtracting all your privileges  
Giving up just makes no sense  
We'll find a way  
We'll find a way  
Don't give in  don't give in  
Don't give in  don't give in  
Oh 

All you can  think about is breakin' free  
You can't make it on your own  
You're thinking negative  nothing can go right  
It's eating you down to the bone

We'll find a way, 
We'll find a way, 
Don't give in, don't give in, 
Don't give in, don't give in
Oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, 
We'll find a way, 
We'll find a way, 
Don't give in, don't give in, 
Don't give in, don't give in, 
Oh oh.

I just had to get nice last night
My mind is so free
You wouldn't believe
You wouldn't believe
I just had to catch a pig last night
My mind is so full
You wouldn't believe
Nature's got a way, brothers
Of scraping the bowl
Eye of the hurricane

I sold a hundred hits to a hundred heads
That will never come back
You know what I mean
Peace is what you get from the Chemical King
Yeah, yeah
You don't yank on the Spine of God
You get what you give, you know what I mean
Don't be surprised there's a bug in your eye

There ain't no pioneers
I just snort what I like
From what's already there
See Aggie, she's just a withered old hag now
Unreachable, unfuckable
So ride me, baby, in my bed of sweat and truth
And babble and groan words of praise and love
And fry like a pig
In the hart of the sun

I sold a hundred hits to a hundred heads
That will never come back
You know what I mean
Peace is what you get from the Chemical King
Yeah, yeah
You don't yank on the Spine of God
You get what you give, you know what I mean
Don't be surprised there's a bug in your eye

Why don't you see it for what it is, a fuckin' freak show
If you will take a lot it will kill you

The center of the universe
The center of the universe
I love everyone
I love everyone
Yeah everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone

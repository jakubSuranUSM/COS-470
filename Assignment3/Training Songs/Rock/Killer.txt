I got the recipe thumping on it
And as for rivalry well I own it
You can't speak for me
Doing all I can to survive

Don't ask for sympathy, beg to differ
(Don't ask for sympathy, beg to differ)
And as for symmetry I'm irregular
(And as for symmetry I'm irregular)
And maybe you (?) to me
(And maybe you (?)to me)
But I get it dead or alive
(But I get it dead or alive)

I'm your favorite enemy
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul got your back

(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer

Get out the way if you can't stand the flack
Me and mom we're on a maximum attack

If this was fantasy I'd condone it
But you move so foglessly I'd atone for it
From under bleachers to the windmills of my mind

Seems you protest to much as of lately
(Seems you protest to much as of lately)
We're (?)you (?)and so straightly
(We're (?)you (?)and so straightly)
I'm the beseecher and you are just a matter of time
(I'm the beseecher and you are just a matter of time)

I'm your favorite enemy
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul got your back 

I'm your favorite enemy
I'm the leader of the pack
Got your heart, got your soul got your back 

(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer

Get out the way if you can't stand the flack
Me and mom we're on a maximum attack

(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer

Get out the way if you can't stand the flack
Me and mom we're on a maximum attack
You have got to face up to the fact this is undeniable

(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)
Whoo
Killer, killer, killer
(Your soul)

Killer, killer, killer

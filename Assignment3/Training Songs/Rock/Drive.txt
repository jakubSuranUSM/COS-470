I've got a car
I've got a big black shiny car
Maybe tonight we can go for a ride

Out on the road, out on the wide wide open road
Baby lets see what we can find 
Aright

[Chorus]
Lets drive
Anywhere you want to go I will take you there babe, take you there baby
Let's drive

I've got a ride
I've got a smooth slick shiny ride
Let's open her up and let's get away

Back out by the shore
Top down, seats back, lights shinning low
Tonight's the night we go all the way
All the way

[Chorus]

Everything that you wanted to find
Is waiting for you here inside
Let's drive

I've got a car 
I've got a big black shiny car
Maybe we can go for a ride

[Chorus]

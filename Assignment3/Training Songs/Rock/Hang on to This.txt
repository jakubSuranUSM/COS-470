Keep me past the gate
I've worn the world without a word
And I don't care too much for what they say
Grip my smothering end
Another day will pass again
Keep My fire alive for I'm not afraid

Can I make them understand
Who in the world would have thought this
God I'll never know your plans
Doin what i got to
What I Got to hang on
Cause I'm doin what I got to
What I got to hang on
Hanging on by a thread this is what I got
So hang on to this

Keep me pacified
The light will never see my face
For this must be a better place
Keep them entertained
I've lost the feel, I've lost the pain
For this seems to be a better place

Can I make them understand
Who in the world would have thought this
God I'll never know your plans
Doin what i got to
What I Got to hang on
Cause I'm doin what I got to
What I got to hang on
Hanging on by a thread this is what I got
So hang on to this

Maybe you'll find what you seek
If you hold on to truth
Then your truth will set you free

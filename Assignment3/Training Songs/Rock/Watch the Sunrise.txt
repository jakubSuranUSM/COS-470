I can feel it, now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears begone, it won't be long
There's a light in the sky
It's okay to look outside
The day, it will abide
And watch the sunrise

Sun, it shines on all of us
We are one in its hand
Come inside and light my room
Like the heart of every man
It's okay to look outside
The day it will abide
And watch the sunrise

I can feel it, now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears begone, it won't be long
There's a light in the sky
It's okay to look outside
Your love it will abide
And watch the sunrise

At daydream junior highschool we used to harmonise
Me and Frankie and Jimmy and some Italian guy
We were singing oldies but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's I remember when
We practiced in a subway,in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway singing "do waps" to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom and nobody could get in
'Cause we were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found ooooh
And the girls would gather 'round us and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the moonglows, the harptones and the dells
And when we sang sincerely, we really sang it high
And even though it was falsetto we almost reached the sky
We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonise
Now they've turned into oldies but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's I remember when
we were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found
We were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found
Found..oooh....found...oooh..found

You don't like me for my future
You don't like me for my past
It seems the only thing you care for
Is to make these moments last
You make me feel so happy
Like a boy without a care
And if there's one thing I can hope for
It's that you always will be there
And I realize it's a new feeling
Never have I been so free
Cause I like you, the things you do
And I know that you like me
I like you, the things you do
And I know that you like me
You don't care to be the only
You don't care to be the Queen
It seems you only care for happiness
And how much that it means
You make me feel so secure
Like there's nothing I couldn't do
And if there's one thing I am thankful for
It's the time I spend with you
And I love the fact that I can exactly
Be whatever I want to be
Cause I like you, the things you do
And I know that you like me
I like you, the things you do
And I know that you like me

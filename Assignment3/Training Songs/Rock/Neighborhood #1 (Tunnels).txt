And if the snow buries my, my neighborhood.
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours,
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours.

You climb out the chimney,
And meet me in the middle, the middle of the town.
And since there's no one else around,
We let our hair grow long,
And forget all we used to know.
Then our skin gets thicker from
Living out in the snow.

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head,
As the day grows dim
I hear you sing a golden hymn

Then we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that
The names we used to know.
But sometimes, we remember our bedrooms,
And our parents' bedrooms,
And the bedrooms of our friends.
Then we think of our parents,
Well what ever happened to them?!

You change all the lead
Sleepin' in my head to gold,
As the day grows dim,
I hear you sing a golden hymn,
The song I've been trying to say.

Purify the colors, purify my mind.
Purify the colors, purify my mind,
And spread the ashes of the colors,
Over this heart of mine!

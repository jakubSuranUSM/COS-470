Hey, how ya keeping?
I guess it's been a while 

I heard,
You've been sleeping,
That always made you smile 

Why is it I'm so ashamed when we meet?
Why is it our conversation just repeats?

God knows,
This pain just flows and flows 
I'm so scared,
Where my mind will go 

So tell me,
Who's interested to know?
'Cause maybe,
This is how the story goes.

So, goodnight,
I hope to see you soon.
Leave by the morning,

I've got too much to do.

Why is it you beleaguer our lives with your lies?
Why is it you can't bleach these thoughts from my eyes?

God knows,
This pain just flows and flows 
So scared
Where my mind will go 

Splice them,
Voice of radios

Poppin' pills from indie shows
Follow 
Mother let me go!

This anger freely seeks to grow

God knows 
He's let me crash and burn.
I feel like
My mind's already turned.

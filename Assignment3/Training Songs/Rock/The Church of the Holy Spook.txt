My Daddy was a sinner, but my
Mother was a saintly person
But I ruined my life by drinking, bad
Wives, taking pills and cursing
Rock and roll you crucified me,
Left me all alone
I never should have turned my back on
The old folks back home

Give me that Church of the Holy Spook
Church of the Holy Spook
Church of the Holy Spook, 
It's good enough for me
It was good for me dear old Daddy
And my dear old Mammy too
Give me that Church of the Holy Spook
I don't need nothin' new

I believe in the Church of the Holy Spook
I believe that he's in me
The Tao is like a river, 
So float along with me
When the sacred blood of the Holy Ghost
Is boiling in my veins
I think of Jesus on the cross
And I scream out for his pain.

Give me that Church of the Holy Spook
Church of the Holy Spook
Church of the Holy Spook, 
It's good enough for me
It was good for me dear old Daddy
And my dear old Mammy too
Give me that Church of the Holy Spook
I don't need nothin' new

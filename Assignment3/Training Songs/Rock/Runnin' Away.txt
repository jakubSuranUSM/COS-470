Think of the summer when I held you here
Everything was right
All the years we spent in love
Just to end one night

A lot of things are closin' in on me
She's gone, and I'm in misery
There's no place that I can really be
Out into my own

[Chorus]
So I'm runnin' away
I have got to be alone
I'm runnin' away
It makes no sense at all

Think of the summers when I held you here
All the dreams we'd planned
Afternoons we spent alone
I can't understand

A lot of things are closin' in on me
She's gone, and I'm in misery
There's no place that I can really be
Out into my own

[Chorus]

All I really want to know
What it is that makes love grow
Still inside me it remains
I never spend a day
Without wondering how I'll make it alone

[Chorus x 3]

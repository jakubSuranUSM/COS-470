YOu're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've hit the ground
You no longer hear each happy sound
You no longer tell day from night
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've hit the ground
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
Who took the sun, has painted it black
Who took the skies and turned them grey
Who took your dreams, your dreams away
What happened to each happy day
You're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
A glass vacuum locked your mind inside
And now you've taken one long ride
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you touched the ground
Who took your dreams, your dreams away
who tookthe nights and changed the day
Who took your thoughts, your thoughts away
Who has come and changed the play
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
A glass vacuum with a bubble inside
Have you been lost, passed the day
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
What you, what you, what you gonna do
With this life you've been running through
What you, , what you, what you going to do
You just can't keep running away-

Your mind sings some lyrics like we're memory
Your sad our goodbyes sound nostalgy
Your chords swung me from idolatry
I'm living like a vagabond, I just can't decide
When to leave

But it's roots are in the river to my mood it swings
A vow even is impossible to keep
Every day is starting on the balance beam
Still you're standing with me, always carrying
The melody

Smiling all the while, the paint chips off
Of my Mardi Gras beads

It's the images contained not the lens or frames
Recalled to my mind before I fall asleep
A list of regrets is no place to be
I'm coming in late but I'll never modulate us
To a minor key

Smiling all the while, the paint chips off
Of my Mardi Gras beads

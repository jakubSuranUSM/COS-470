All you kids get on your feet now, 
Now move your bodies, 
Let's rock 'n' roll, Showaddywaddy! 
Standing on the corner in my new blue jeans, 
Dreaming 'bout the girl in my limousine

Everybody's talking 'bout the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. 
Newsman on the corner said 'hold on kid', 
What's the use of dreaming 'bout a rich guys grid, 
Get yourself a-boppin' to the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. 

[Chorus]
Hey rock 'n' roll, bring it to town let's stroll, 
Hey rock 'n' roll, let's go, let's go, let's go. 
Hey rock 'n' roll, bring it to town let's stroll, 
Hey rock 'n' roll, let's go, let's go, let's go. 

Rocking to the band and a record machine, 
Susie hand jives, she's a rock 'n' roll queen, 
Johnny sings a love song, he sings it right from the ha, ha, heart. 
Little Nicky's dancing with the girl in blue, 
Over to the band and a song for you, 
Everybody's shouting for the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. 

[Chorus: Repeats]

Lime and limpid green, a second scene 
A fight between the blue you once knew 
Floating down, the sound resounds 

Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten 

Blinding signs flap 
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam, pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan dare who's there? 

Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds 
The icy waters under 
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds 
The icy waters underground

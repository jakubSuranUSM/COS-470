Listen dear
I need you to hear.
I cannot disappear
I've tried again and again and again and again

I know we said
That we'd give up
You said we'd had enough
Again and again and again and again

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine, all mine

And if you will, I will
Try to let it go.
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love
'Till you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love.

Walk down the street
Stare at lots of things
The fast and steady streams
Again and again and again and again

Do what I should, try to stay busy
Your face is all I see
Again and again and again and again

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine, all mine

And if you will, I will, try to let it go.
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye, this is do or die
And I will stay in love
'Till you say enough, there is no giving in
There is no giving up in love.

Like a movie I once saw
In the darkness I recall
Feeling the beauty and the pain
And when you call my name
Say you feel the same.

Cause' if you will, I will, try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try, try to let it show.

And if you will, I will, try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love
'Til you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love
In love, in love, we're in love

I cannot disappear,
Again and again and again and again

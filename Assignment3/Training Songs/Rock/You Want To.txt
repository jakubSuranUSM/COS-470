You got me right where you want me
You got me out on the street
I'm cold and I'm lonely
I need your company

I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
Let me in
I know you want to

I see my dog in the window
The records on my lawn
You're out spending my dough
Just to get your hair done

I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
Let me in
I know you want to

Now I understand
One of us had to draw the line
I know you need a natural man
The world is crawling with women
None of them love like mine
Let me in
I know you hear me

I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
Let me in
I know you want to

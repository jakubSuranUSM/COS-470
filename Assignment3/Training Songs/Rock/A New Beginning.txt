Looking at a new day, seeing in a new way
Living in the here and now, forget tomorrow
Looking at a new girl, living in a new world
I'm changing every little thing cause I've found something new.

I'm gonna make a new start, I'm gonna play a new part
Going down a different road, a new direction
Now I've got a new feel, now I've got a new deal
I'm telling everyone I know that I've found something new.

Standing alone with the beat of my heart
I don't know if I'm losing or winning
Rescued by love and the angels above
I'm sensing a whole new beginning.

I'm looking at a new moon, listening to a new tune
I never thought I'd find such understanding
Now I've got a new love, that fits me like a new glove
I'm changing every little thing 'cause I've found something new.

Standing alone with the beat of my heart
I don't know if I'm losing or winning (I'm on the way)
Rescued by love and the angels above
I'm sensing a whole new beginning.

Something new,

Standing alone with the beat of my heart
I don't know if I'm losing or winning (I'm on the way)
Rescued by love and the angels above
I'm sensing a whole new beginning.

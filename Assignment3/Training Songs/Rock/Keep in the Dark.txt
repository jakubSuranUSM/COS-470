Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Keep in the dark to stay out of the light
Just hang the sunshine

Turn off your light, let's step into the dark
Slip away like 'into her
Save your face and get behind, it's firmly pressed into earth
I feel relief when I talk, eventually comes
Talk of our dreams, you surely have one
Mind your head and keep your hands firmly pressed into earth

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink a bottle, rest in wine
A shameful display, sung in some other place
To keep in the dark

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink a bottle, rest in wine
I come with a string to recover the world
She sings in the night and never grows on

Night falling, save the grace with wondering eyes
Drawn to a beauty left to lay in the light
'only precious white wine full of worth

Dressed in all, safe from the dark
But dressed in a body let stranger to pass
Flashing my attempt to calling an all showing girl
Your true words

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink a bottle, rest in wine
A shameful display, sung in some other place
To keep in the dark

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink a bottle, rest in wine
I come with a string to recover the world
She sings in the night and never grows on

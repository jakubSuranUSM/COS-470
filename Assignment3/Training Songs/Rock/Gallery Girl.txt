The boy likes the girl
The girl loves the boy
But is it to say?
Hey

Hello, Madame
The pleasure is all mine
Can I buy you the world?

She is my gallery girl
She is my gallery girl
She is my whole world

The pair on his chest
One can only guess
That time has gone elapsed 
For them

Smoke in the air
So what a scare
The girl got up and left

She is my gallery girl
She is my gallery girl
She is my whole world

To more men she goes
With this her coldness grows
The girl, she starts to cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry

She cries for years and years
The puddles left are clear
She sees herself in them

She is my gallery girl
She is my gallery girl
She is my whole world

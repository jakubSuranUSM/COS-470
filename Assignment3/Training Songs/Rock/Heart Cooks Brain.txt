Slow walk, it's land mine
It's coal mine, it's a bad thought

On the way to God don't know
My brain's the burger, and my heart's the coal

I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears

I'm on my way to God don't know or even care
My brain's the weak heart, and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs, my heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shore 
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward

In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff, and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo

We tore one down, and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
On the way to God don't know
My brain's the burger, and my heart's the coal

On this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go so slow
The days go so slow, the days go slow

On the way to God don't know
My brain's the burger, and my heart's the coal
I'm tried getting my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears, I get refilled through my ears

I'm on my way to God don't know or even care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs, my heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shore, 
the ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward

In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff, and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo

We tore one down, and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
Absence versus thin air

On this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go so slow
The days go so slow

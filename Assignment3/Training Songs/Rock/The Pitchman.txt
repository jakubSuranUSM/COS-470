What have you got for me this time
Can you make it sparkle
Can you make it shine
Have you got anything brighter
Something like that but a little bit tighter

[Chorus]
Pitchman, Pitchman
Sell me that Pitchman
Something I need has slipped my mind
I've come here to barter
I've come here to buy
I've got this town tucked in my back pocket
I can't seem to stop it
I just wish I had more time
I'm in a hurry can we wrap it up
Will you try to to scratch it

Don't mark it up
I've got a hunger for the things that sparkle
I've got a thirst for the things that shine

Everyone a winner
Everyone amazing
Everyone a shocker
Everyone to tantalize
Don't mark it up!

Everyone a sure thing
Everything's tempting
Everyone must tantalize
But don't mark it up!

[Chorus]

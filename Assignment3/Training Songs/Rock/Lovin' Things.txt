It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
You know I want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do

It's the lovin' things you say
That give me comfort every day
By your side I'm gonna sleep
These lovin' things that you see

Since the day our love began
I've become a new, big, happy man
I can hold my head up high
When you are near, I touch the sky

With your soft and sweet caress
You've brought me such tenderness
You'd think I was once forsaken
With your kiss I've been awakened

It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
You know I want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do
 
With your soft and sweet caress
You've brought me such tenderness
Your smile from your young face
You give me back my inspiration

It's the lovin' things we share
That assures me now you care
Offer is gone; it's so perfect there
For the lovin' things that we share

It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
You know I want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do

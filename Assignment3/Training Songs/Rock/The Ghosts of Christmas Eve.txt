In this room where shadows live
And ghosts that failed learn time forgives
Welcome, friends, please stay awhile
Our story starts with one small child 
Who spends this night in attics dark
Where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts
And so it's here that they must wait
'Till someone wishes them awake 
For somewhere on this night of nights
She's looking to believe
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve 

And there near an old looking glass
There was a trunk from Christmas past
That she had somehow missed before
But now decides she will explore 
'Twas filled with toys and one old wreath
And several letters underneath
So as the evening hours leave
The child sits down and starts to read 
For somewhere on this night of nights
She's looking to believe
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve 
On Christmas Eve 
On Christmas Eve

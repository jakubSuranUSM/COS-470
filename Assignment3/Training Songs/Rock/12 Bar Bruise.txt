I'd better be slave
I'd make some money
And so when it gets ruff
We can bruise some stuff
But look at my dick
I bet you it’s limp
Should I quit drink
It makes me think that

12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise, ooh

I've gotta be strong
Make me live long
I'd better not wait
For a bottle’s sake
All of my friends are
Looking up dresses
They have not seen
The bruise that I’ve seen

Bruise, wooh!

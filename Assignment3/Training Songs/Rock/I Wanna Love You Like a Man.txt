I want to take control 
And I want to take you 
Ah, aha
Defenceless! 
You don't understand that my life is so 
Strange
And I need to have hope 
And I need to have 
Friends
But I want you to know 
That you're making me 
So
Burning with desire
And you've set my soul on fire
We've got all the stars
We've got the universe To hold
And my heart is filled with passion 
We've got such a soul connection
And when the time is right, I'm gonna make you understand
I want to love you like a man!
I want to take you home 
I want to take you 
Ah - aha
Defenceless! 
Please try to understand that my life is so 
Strange
And I sometimes feel low 
Yeah I sometimes feel 
Pain
But I want you to know
That you're making me 
So
Burning with desire
And you've set my soul on fire
We've got all the stars; 
We've got the universe 
To hold
And my heart is filled with passion 
We've got such a soul connection
And when the time is right, I'm gonna make you understand
I want to love you like a man!

I'm seventeen, and I am cool
I'm seventeen, I break the rules
I'm seventeen, and I don't care
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
I'm seventeen, and I am slack
I'm seventeen, get off my back
I'm seventeen, nothing to do
I'm seventeen, I don't like you

I'm seventeen, can take care of myself, I don't need anyone
I'm seventeen, all I know is you don't know how I feel

I'm seventeen, been through it all
Sex and drugs and alcohol
I'm seventeen, and I don't know
I guess I'm just a UFO

I'm seventeen, can take care of myself, I don't need anyone
I'm seventeen, all I know is you don't know how I feel

Head thrown out by a happy child
My young blood ain't running wild
People in my place all the time
Trying to reorganize my mind
Maybe they're writing something wrong
'Cause I don't know where I belong
So I don't care what nobody said
I ain't gonna give my life away

I'm seventeen, and I am free
I'm seventeen, now look at me
I'm seventeen, I can't go wrong
'Cause I won't be here very long

I'm seventeen, can take care of myself, I don't need anyone
I'm seventeen, all I know is you don't know
How it feels to be me, I'm seventeen
I'm seventeen, I'm seventeen, I'm seventeen

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

People tell me love's for fools.
So, here I go, breaking all the rules.
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy)
Oh so doggone easy (Doggone easy, doggone easy)
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Where you're concerned, my heart has learned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

(It's so easy to fall in love)
(It's so easy to fall in love)

Look into your heart and see,
What your love book has set apart for me.
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy)
Oh so doggone easy (Doggone easy, doggone easy)
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Where you're concerned, my heart has learned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

Well it's so easy (It's so easy, it's so easy)
So doggone easy (Doggone easy, doggone easy)
It seems so easy (Seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Well where you're concerned, my heart has learned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

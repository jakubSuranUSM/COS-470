Powder in your hair
Staples in your jeans
Fireworks at the water
You were holding a styro-foam cup
Held between your teeth
Telling me how you're going to outlive your body

What you said I wrote it down,
It won't say, 
It won't speak the same
Maybe I know better than
To read more 
Than what's written

After everything 
After everything
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.

Gathering your storm
I talk to fill the space
You know where so and so was
When they were our age
And every night you seem
To talk me out of everything

Careful what you say next,
Don't waste a sin-gle drop
What you said I wrote it down,
Won't say, won't speak the same

After everything, 
After everything.
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.

What you said I wrote it down,
It won't say, 
It won't speak the same
Maybe I know better than
To read more 
Than what's there

After everything, 
After everything.
Left in the sun, shivering.
After everything.

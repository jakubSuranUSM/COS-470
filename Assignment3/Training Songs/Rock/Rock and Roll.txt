Jenny said when she was just five years old,
You know there's nothin' happenin' at all.
Every time she put on the radio,
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all.
One fine morning, she puts on a New York station,
And she couldn't believe what she heard at all.
She started dancing to that fine fine fine fine music, whew!
Her life was saved by rock & roll.
Hey baby, rock 'n' roll.
Despite all the amputations,
We could dance to a rock 'n' roll station.
Here it's alright. Here it's alright. Hey babe.

Two TV sets, two Cadillac cars ah,
It ain't helpin' us at all, not at all
One fine morning, she heard a New York station, 
And she couldn't believe what she heard at all, not at all.
Despite the amputation,
You could dance to a rock 'n' roll station.
Here it's alright. Here it's alright.
Aw, now here it's alright.

Yea, every time she put on the radio,
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all.

She started dancin' to that fine fine music.
Aw, her life was saved by rock and roll,
Rock 'n' roll.
Despite all the amputation, you could dance to a rock 'n' roll station.

It's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, 
Alright, alright, alright, baby, baby, baby, baby, alright.

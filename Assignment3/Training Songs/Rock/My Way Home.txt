Something 'bout last night
What'd you say
Feels so cold on a sunny day
Over loaded mind as I walk this path
Think about you in a daylight bath
I feel like this on my way home
No place I'm going to is known

You're the sun that's in my eye
I concede so I will survive
Consequence, will come what may
You let me run
You let me hide
I'm coming home

The sky's so dark, dark and blue
Picture shaped clouds of you know who
Looking for a sign in the midnight sun
Fighting myself isn't that much fun
I feel like this on my way home
No place I'm going to is known

You're the sun that's in my eye
I concede so I will survive
Consequence, will come what may
You let me run
You let me hide
I'm coming home

You're the sun that's in my eye
I concede so I will survive
Consequence, will come what may
You let me run
You let me hide
I'm coming home

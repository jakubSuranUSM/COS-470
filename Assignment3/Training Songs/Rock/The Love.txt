Every face I see reminds me of you. 
Nothing I can touch feels the way you do. 
Knowing you are mine is the best thing in my life; 
Baby, I'm alive completely. 
This is the love, this is the love; 
This is the love, the love you've always dreamed of. 
This is the love, the hand that fills your cup; 
The wings that lift you up, so high, so close. 
Two can be as one.  This is the love... 
This is the love. 
Everyone has something no one else can see; 
Every breath, every touch, every heartbeat's givin' me 
The feeling that I've known you in another place in time, 
A transcendental doorway opens up and hand in hand we shine. 
And if I'm down, she will stand there tall 
Hold on, hold on, 
And if you're down, I will build a wall 
Around you to hold you; I'm so glad I found you. 
This is the love, this is the love; 
This is the love, the love you've always dreamed of. 
This is the love, the hand that fills your cup; 
The wings that lift you up, so high, so close. 
Two can be as one.  This is the love... 
The love, this is the love. 
Every heartbeat, every shadow, every moutain in the morning... 
You can touch me while I'm dreaming; this is the love. 
Every evening in my bedroom, 
Every ocean past the moon 
And every sunset rise above... 
This is the love. 
The love, this is the love. 
Every heartbeat, every shadow, every mountain in the morning... 
You can touch me while I'm dreaming; this is the love. 
Every evening in my bedroom, 
Every ocean past the moon 
And every sunset rise above... 
This is the love.

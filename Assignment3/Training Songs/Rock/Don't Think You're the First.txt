Don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To follow your heart
Or gaze at the stars
To stare at the night
To the clear daylight 

Don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To feel sorrow or shame
As you walk in the rain
Do I love you?
Yes I love you or I wouldn't tell you 

So don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To be caught in the act
Numbered and wrecked
Put in your place
Made to feel like a fake 

Don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To be untouched by the time
Think you're one of the kind
Do I love you?
Yes I love you or i wouldn't tell you 

So don't think you're the first 

Don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To dance with the light
From the meak to the might
As the birds in the trees
Sing their sweet melodies 

Don't think you're the first
In the whole universe
To hear a thousand violins
As the trial begins
Do I love you?
Yes I love you or I wouldn't tell you 

So don't think you're the last
To be tied to the mast
While you watch from afar
As your world falls apart
You hang on for help
But the rest help themselves 

Don't think you're the last
To be tied to the past
While you future's controlled
While the present untold
Do I love you?
Yes I love you or I wouldn't tell you 

So don't think you're the first

Some wonder, some filter, some trip to pass the time
Just ask him and he'll tell you nothing better then a desperate mind

I'm in love with a widow soon to be,
I don't think I can fight it
Anthems broke and I'm spinning 'round again,
Stayin' dizzy 'cause I like it

You can have it if you want it,
just remember it's a lonely ride
Ain't that hard to fight

Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'

Home is your destination, do you think you can find it
Feelin' green once again, downtown you go, the arrows rising

You can have it if you want it,
just remember it's a lonely ride
Ain't that hard to fight

Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'
Some wonder, some filter, some trip to pass the time
Just asked him and he will tell you there is nothing better then a desperate mind

Diablo, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
That game boy, to the rivals, we don't need no war inside

Kickin' hard time, kickin' hard time, risin'
Once so magnetic but you do it so poetic
And you lay it on the line 
And singin' kickin' hard time, it ain't that hard to find
Kickin' hard time, they split you to the bone. Kickin' hard time, risin'

I'm standing on the top of the moon, looking down at you
You're tiny 
I'm standing on the top of the star, wondering where you are
You're driving in your car
I'm standing on the top of the world, looking at a girl
Who doesn't notice me

I'm halo friendly

I'm standing on the top of the world, looking at the girl
Who will someday notice me
I'm standing on the top of a star, you're standing in the yard
You're lonely just like me
I'm standing on the top of the moon, longing to be with you
If only you had wings

I'm halo friendly

Standing at the top of the world

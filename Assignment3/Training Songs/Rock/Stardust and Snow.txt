I speak can you speak?
I move can you move?
The day's a long time ago
Petticoat and high-buttoned shoes
You turn up on a Sunday
Beside old slogan pins
You must have hung in the subway
If there were any then
{Come into town on a ferry
For Saturday's Vaudeville show
Things must have really been good then
Seeing you in stardust and snow}
Were you ever unhappy?
On the trolley did you cry?
No, your face is lovely
Did you lead a lovely life?
{chorus}
No phones or TVs
Maybe you're a charm of luck
I think you're coming with me
For an even twenty bucks
Come into town on a ferry
For Saturday's Vaudeville show
Was everything really so good then?
Seeing you in stardust and snow . . .

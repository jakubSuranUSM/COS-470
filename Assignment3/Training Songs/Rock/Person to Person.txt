Don't send, don't write no letter
Stay away from your telephone 
I need you person to person
Send your little fine self on home 
Don't send me no message 
You know I'm all alone 
I need you person to person 
Bring your little fine self on home 

Ain't no use to telephonin' me 
I can't love no telephone 
All the time you're telephonin' me 
You could be coming home, oh baby 
Don't call me on the phone 
I need you person to person 
Bring your little fine self on home 

Oh yeah, babe, don't talk to me on the phone 
I need you person to person 
Bring your little fine self on home 
Ain't no use to telephonin' me
I can't love no telephone 
All the time you're telephonin' me 
You could be coming home, oh baby 
Don't call me on the phone 
I need you person to person 
Bring your little fine self on home 

Ain't no use to send no letter 
I can't hold no paper tight 
Ain't no use to send no message 
It can't talk to me all night 
Oh baby, don't call me on the telephone 
I need you person to person
Bring your little fine self on home

To stem the tide and point the blame
Came back for more
Came back to see what you had in store

So you want to spin the world around?
And anybody else, cut 'em down
So you want to make catastrophe?
Won't you send it right over to me
I got some time
Everybody running high

The same, the same, the same again
To steal the time and haunt the graves
Just because it's there
Don't mean you see it anywhere
Maybe it's a trick of the light
Maybe, yeah

So you want to spin the world around?
So you want to spin the world around?
And anybody else, cut 'em down
So you want to make catastrophe?
Don't you send it right over to me
I got some time
Everybody come alive
Yeah

So you want to spin the world around?
So you want to spin the world around?
And anybody else, bring 'em down
So you want to make catastrophe?
Don't you send it right over to me
I got some time
Everybody running high

So you want to spin the world around?

And anybody else, cut 'em down

Just everybody else is going wrong
Going wrong

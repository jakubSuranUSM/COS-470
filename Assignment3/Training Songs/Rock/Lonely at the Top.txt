This is a song for all of my close friends
Anonymous neighbors with stories to tell
I didn't realize I had so many close friends nameless and shameless with hear say to sell.

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much, but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely at the top.

Oh oh, oh oh.

This is a song for all the complainers
All the campaigners who will not give up
They're selling their souls just to wear their sunglasses
They say "stop the press, I want to get off"

What's the fuss? I've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know il never get it
Shame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it

If only it was lonely at the top I've got too much, but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it.

Oh oh, oh oh

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely

Oh oh, oh oh
If only

Sing, bird of prey
Beauty begins at the foot of you
Do you believe the manner?

Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit

Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up
Hold down the window
(Outbound, river)
Hold out the mornin' that comes into view
(Blue tail, tail fly)
River runnin' right on over my head

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring?
And ring and you will find me coming

Cold reigning king
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement

Even Siberia goes through the motions
Hold out and hold up
Hold down the window
(Outbound, river)
Hold out the mornin' that comes into view
(Blue tail, tail fly)
River runnin' right on over the outboard
River, blue tail, tail fly, Luther, in time

Hold down the window
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Warm side, the tower
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken khatru

Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit

Cold reigning king
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement

River running right on over then over my head
(Outboard, river)
Blue tail, tail fly, Luther, in time
Sun tower, asking, cover, lover

June cast, moon fast as one changes
Heart gold leaver, soul mark mover
Christian changer, called out savior
Moon gate climber, turn round glider

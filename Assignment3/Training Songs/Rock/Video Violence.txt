The currents rage deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence

Up in the morning drinking his coffee
Turns on the TV to some slasher movie
Cartoon-like women, tied up and sweaty
Painting and screaming, thank you, have a nice day

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

His heart is pounding he switches the channel
Looking for something, other than rape or murder
Or beatings or torture, but except for Walt Disney
It's a twisted alliance, this age of video violence

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence

Down at his job his boss sits there screaming
If he loses his job, life looses its meaning
His son is in high school, there's nothing he's learning
He sits by the T.V., watching Corvettes exploding, 'cause

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
No age of reason landing upon us
This is the age of video violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

Down at a bar some woman is topless
She's acned and scarred, her hair is a mess
While he shoves $5 down her exotic panties
The video jukebox is playing Madonna
While just down the block at some local theater
They're grabbing their crotches at the 13th beheading
As the dead rise to live, the live sink to die
The currents are deep and raging inside

The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na [Repeat]

Twenty miles from my house to your house
Twenty miles and I walk it all the way
Twenty miles when you're in love is nothin'
And I got to see my baby every day

[Chorus]
I walk along
I sing a song
Twenty miles is a long long way
But I got to see my baby every day

Lots of girls are ridin' near to my house
Pretty girls they keep passin' by all day
Lots of girls but I don't even see â€˜em
Cause the girl I love is twenty miles away

[Chorus]

Oh ho

[Chorus]

Twenty miles is a long long way
But I got to see my baby every day
Oh hey  Twenty miles

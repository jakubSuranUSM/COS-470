It seems I have a weakness I didn't know about, till the day it rained
And it seems my weakness has been bulging, has been forcing its way
It seems I have a weakness I didn't know about, till the day it rained
And it seems my weakness will become my final stage

And it's here that I’ll give, yeah I’ll give you all my love
And it's here that I’ll give, yeah I’ll give you all my love

It seems I had a secret I didn't know about, till the day it poured
And it seems my secret has been bulging, has been forcing its way
It seems I had a secret I didn't know about, till the day it poured
And it seems my secret will become my final stage

And it's here that I’ll give, yeah I’ll give you all my love
And it's here that I’ll give, yeah I’ll give you all my love

You ran away,
To the sun in California.
I'll stay the same,
Under gray skies I'll come undone,

And I know,
On holiday,
The grass so green,

Yes you ran away,
To find the bright white lights of Hollywood
Sometimes in the rain,
I think I'd like to burn, I never will

And I know,
On holiday,
The green green grass of holiday.

So look down, look down,
Everybody loves you
And my my my,
Can anybody fly this plane home?

And get down, hurry down,
There's people waiting for you,
And why why why,
Won't anybody fly this plane home?

Yes you, ran away,
To catch the sun in California
I'll stay the same,
Under gray skies I'll come undone,

And I know,
On holiday,
The green green grass of holiday.

So look down, look down,
Everybody loves you
And my my my,
Can anybody fly this plane home?

And get down, hurry down,
There's people waiting for you,
And why why why,
Won't anybody fly this plane home?

So look down, look down,
Everybody loves you
And my my my,
Can anybody fly this plane home?

And get down, hurry down,
There's people waiting for you,
And why why why,
Won't anybody fly this plane home?

So look down, look down,
Everybody loves you
And my my my,
Can anybody fly this plane home?

And get down, hurry down,
There's people waiting for you,
And why why why,
Won't anybody fly this plane home?

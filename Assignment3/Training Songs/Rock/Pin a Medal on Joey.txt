I just got a letter from a very dear pal
He wrote to say he's sorry for stealin' my gal

Pin a medal on Joey
He stole your love from me
Pin a medal on Joey
He set my poor heart free
No more cryin' about a love that was untrue
Oh-ho, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Hip hooray for that Joey
For bein' good to me
Hip hooray for that Joey
He took my misery
No more heartache will I be givin' you
Oh-ho, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

[Chorus:]
Told him all about you
Told him how you lied
But Joey won't believe me
He thinks I'm a jealous guy-eye

Pin a medal on Joey
For bein' such a fool
Pin a medal on Joey
He won a heart that's cruel
He'll be sorry when you break his heart in two
Oh-ho, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Told him all about you
Told him how you lied
But Joey won't believe me
He thinks I'm a jealous guy-eye

Pin a medal on Joey
For bein' such a fool
Pin a medal on Joey
He won a heart that's cruel
He'll be sorry when you break his heart in two
Oh-ho, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Pin a medal on Joey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
Hip hooray for that Joey oh, oh, oh, oh
Pin a medal on Joey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Hey whatever happened to you last night 
We thought we lost you there 
Those long days 
And long long nights 
They keep you up inside 

Stay awake all night talking about our friends 
It never ends 
Always do it when we're drunk 
I just need some kind of meditation 
Keep my feet from 
Falling off the ground 

Life is better with you 
See the people on the street 
Hear the sound of defeat 
It just seems to me we know too many people 
It makes the ones we love seem great 

Life is better with you 
It happens all the time 
The people pass you by 
Like everyone you knew 
They are changing through and through 
You really didn't think it would last 
But that's all in the past 

Life is better with you 
See the people on the street 
Hear the sound of defeat 
Like everybody that you know 
Say they all want you to go

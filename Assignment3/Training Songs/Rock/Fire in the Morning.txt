I know it's late to call, 
I don't blame you if you're angry
But these are things that only
Old lovers understand
I remember rainy nights like this when
We'd go to bed real early
(And) try to catch each other's dreams
And wake up holding hands

We'd light a fire in the morning and
Keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming, but we
Never felt so warm
We'd curl up on the couch and trade the
World for our love song
We'd light a fire in the morning and
Make love all day long

I hope you know it's not that I've
Got no one else to go to
'Cause I keep thinking of you even
When I'm not alone
Now I'd love to hear you say I'm still
The one you can't say "no" to
And that's you'll take me back tonight
And for all the love we've known

We'd light a fire in the morning and
Keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming, but we
Never felt so warm
We'd curl up on the couch and trade the
World for our love song
We'd light a fire in the morning and
Make love all day long

I'm alone, fever dog
Scratchin' at my back door
I hear you howl
But I don't listen no more

Got to spit it out
The taste of the hair
Of the fever dog

Come around again
Well, that would be the end
Of the fever dog

Fever dog
Came to this Black City
I'm not surprised
You're beggin' now for six days

Got to spit it out
The taste of the hair
Of the fever dog

Come around again
Well that would be the end
Of the fever dog

Got to spit it out
The taste of the hair
Of the fever dog

Come around again
Well that would be the end
Of the fever dog

Oh, oh, oh
Scratchin' at my back door

You can hide down in the alley
With your hat pulled over your eye
You can wear a wig or moustache
Or any old disguise
Well, you can change your name and your address
Even change your style of clothes
But the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

You thought you had me baffled
You thought I didn’t know
But I know where you goin’, baby
Long before you go
You can’t even snap your fingers
Or wiggle you toes
Without the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

(The Shadow knows, the Shadow knows, the Shadow knows, the Shadow knows)

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

I say, "Baby, stop your jiving
And your messing round"
'Cause I know what you’re putting, baby
Long before you put it down
You better mind your Ps and Qs
And your Ms and Ns and Os
Because the Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

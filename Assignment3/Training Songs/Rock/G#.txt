If you want to heal me
Then heaven only knows
If you wanna hold me tight
I know where to go
And if you need protection
From the enemy inside
To pull you from the ashes, oh
She'll be heavy when it dies

These are they days
Through teardrops and haze
Science erased
We'll see you all
We'll see you all again

Spiders on my window
Take away the time
And if you are the engine, oh
Make it mine
And when you need protection
From a bullet or a ghost
I'll kill the memories of shadows and we can hold it close

These are the days (and on and on)
Through teardrops and haze
From violence to grace
We'll see you all
We'll see you all again

So kiss this world goodnight
The pictures black and white (no, not again)
You're perfect in the light
Say good night

These are the days
Through teardrops and haze
From violence to grace
We'll see you all
We'll see you all again

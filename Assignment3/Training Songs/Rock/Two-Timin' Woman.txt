I'm gonna swing my guitar across my back
I head down the road and boy I'm never comin' back
'Cause you're a two timin' woman
Yes, 'cause you're a two timin' woman
Well, you had your fun, now I'm a-through my hon'
You're a two timin' woman, it's true

Well, you done me wrong, I treated you right
You run around baby, stay out every night
'Cause you're a two timin' woman
Yes, 'cause you're a two timin' woman
Well, you had your fun, now I'm a-through my hon'
You're a two timin' woman, it's true

Well, you done me wrong, I treated you right
You run around baby, stay out every night
'Cause you're a two timin' woman
Yes, 'cause you're a two timin' woman
Well, you had your fun, now I'm a-through my hon'
You're a two timin' woman, it's true

I'm gonna take my guitar, I'm gonna sing all night
A-singin' to some woman who's gonna treat me right
'Cause you're a two timin' woman
Yes, 'cause you're a two timin' woman
Well, you had your fun, now I'm a-through my hon'
You're a two timin' woman, it's true
You're a two timin' woman, it's true
You're a two timin' woman, it's true

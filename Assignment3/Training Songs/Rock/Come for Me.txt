Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

Well I could be watching a movie
I might as well be watching you
Well I could be ordering sushi
Well I might as well be ordering you

Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

Well I could be working on a farm
I might as well be where you are
Well I could be in a police car
But I might as well be in your arms
Yeah

Coming for me
I hope you really are
I’m waiting all the time I seem to be
Coming for me
I hope you really are
Awaiting all the time I seem to be

Well I wouldn’t mind the rain
If it was falling when you came

No I wouldn’t mind the rain
(La la la la) La la la la la
If it was falling, falling all day
(La la la la) La la la la la
If you were calling, calling on me
(La la la la) La la la la la
So just come along

I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
I gotta get myself up off the side of the road
Things are lookin' clear as they've ever been
Don't know how it'll end but I know where to begin

Gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told

Again, I woke up burned-out by the sun
Tired of layin' still so I'm movin' along
Quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told

Hey, hey, yes
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah

And I gotta hunt myself down a brand-new home
I gotta hunt myself down a brand-new home
Yeah, now I got the answer to my biggest question
Had to loose where I was to get my direction
Gotta hunt myself down a brand-new home, lord
Lord, the tears that I'm hiding
No they ain't for cryin'
Yeah, the tears that I'm hiding
No they ain't for cryin'

I'm never gonna let em start spilling out
'Cause they pour down my body and they flood the ground
The tears that I'm hiding
No, they ain't for cryin'

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah

Oh, let the truth be told
All day, let the truth be told
Oh, let the truth be told
Baby, let the truth be told
Oh lord, let the truth be told
Oh god, baby let the truth be told

I gotta get myself up
Off the side of the road
Oh, quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
Well, my head is heavy and my heart is empty
But my spirit is strong and my legs are ready

Gotta get myself up
Off the side of the road
Quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told, go!

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground, yeah
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Hey, hey, I've gotta pick myself up off the ground

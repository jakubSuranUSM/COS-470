Marjorine, where have you been.
Did you meet the Queen, Marjorine
Let me know, why did you go
Why won't you show, Marjorine?

Down by the sea, searching for me, Marjorine
We all want you back, but you will not get in the sack, no

Each time I go to town, I'll see your face in the crowd,
And when I come back home, I'll call your name out aloud

Marjorine, life is too short,
You'll just get caught, Marjorine
Tried to find what's on your mind
I won't be unkind, Marjorine
Clouds start to form, keeping you warm, Marjorine
Life can be clean where have you been, O Marjorine

Each time I go to town, I'll see your face in the crowd,
And when I come back home, I'll call your name out aloud

Each time I go to town, I'll see your face in the crowd,
And when I come back home, I'll call your name out aloud

Each time I go to town, I'll see your face in the crowd,
And when I come back home, I'll call your name out aloud

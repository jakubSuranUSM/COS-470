Is yours is mine
Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds
Is this day and this time
Is yours is mine
I walked along the walls and there I saw your name
I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game
The stormy weather passed and left me here to find
That the rain and the shine
Is yours is mine
Is yours is mine

Alicia Keys
Kandi
Collabo

Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
That's negative in every which way
Just dissin' my man and our relations
You say he's cheatin,' want me to leave him
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listenin' to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm tryin' to be

'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you Doe
Mess around end up in a choke
Hold
Girl, I think it's time for you to
Go
Away from my man and me
If that's how it's gonna be

'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

I love my man
He loves me more
He may not be the perfect man,
But I don't plan to let him go for
Jane Doe
Oh
(Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe Jane Doe Jane Doe)

'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

(Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe Jane Doe Jane Doe)
Jane Doe
Oh
(Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe uh oh Jane Doe
Jane Doe Jane Doe Jane Doe)

'Cause I'll be crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him, oh no, oh no

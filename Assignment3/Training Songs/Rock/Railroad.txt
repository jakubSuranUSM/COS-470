Railroad she left me standing on a line
Railroad she's really leaving me this time
Leaving on the midnight train
Leaving never gonna come back again

I'm living alone
A place of my own
A bed a chair and one back door
Something went wrong
With the words to my song
And now she ain't around no more
It was something she said
As she laid on my bed
Six or seven hours ago
I guess I was wrong
I really didn't think she would go

Railroad she left me standing on a line
Railroad she's really leaving me this time
Leaving on the midnight train
Leaving never gonna come back again

Her face was always smiling
Guess she was always laughing at me
I said her face was always smiling
Guess she was always laughing at me
If I'd realized
I'd be less surprised
To find that she was laughing at me

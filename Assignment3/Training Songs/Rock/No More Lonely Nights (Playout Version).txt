I can wait another day until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string and everything a flutter
But another lonely night
Might take forever (forever, forever)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
I don't want no more lonely nights

May I never miss the thrill of being near you
If it takes a couple of years
I turn your tears away
On another lonely night
Might take forever (forever, forever)
We only have each other to blame
It's all the same to me love

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
No more lonely nights

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
No more lonely nights

(I couldn't take it again)
(I've been lonely)
(I couldn't take it again)
(I couldn't take it again)
(No, no)

May I never miss the thrill of being near you
If it takes a number of years
I turn your tears away
I can wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
? I never though of it?
But another more lonely nights
Might take forever (forever, forever)
We only got each other to blame
It's all the same for me, for me, for me

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights

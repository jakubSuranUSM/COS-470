My baby talks in his sleep
I said wake him up

My baby talks in his sleep
I said.....

She's out on good behaviour
Even daddie's love won't save her
I said my prayers as I suck on the medicine jar

I'm bound in his reflection
We drink his mother's milk with conviction 
My baby cried on the cross as she bled him dry

My baby talks in his sleep, god damn,
I said wake him up
I said wake him up

Drink ocean deep there's plenty
Oh baby go to sleep it's empty
I said my prayers in the medicine jar

He's suddenly calm
He's sudd....

I dry my tears
I hide my fears
I drown in arrears
In the medicine jar

The medicine jar
Yeah
The medicine jar
The medicine jar

(My baby's cyring
My baby's crying)

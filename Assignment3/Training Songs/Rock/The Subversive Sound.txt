Tonight I'm going to testify that everybody,s going to be alive
(I said) I'm so sick of doing time, so please won't you fill my mind
Tonight I'm going to be alive down on the floor for another round
Like lips kissing in the moonlight
Tonight I'm bound to testify all of my love and all my life
So grab my hand and hold on tight
We're all superstars, yeah that's what we are
96 tears and everything,s in here for you
Tonight were going to feel the heat alive right now between the sheets
Lovers in here strike up the beat
Tonight I'm going to feel alive licking your neck and doing fine
Passion is the biggest crime come on down to the subversive sound

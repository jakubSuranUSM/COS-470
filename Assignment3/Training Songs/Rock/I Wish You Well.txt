The leaves fall from the trees like gold
And I tell you that I love you so
The river sings, it's time to go
What lies ahead we'll never know

And summer brings sweet memories
When we danced all night on the dusty streets
With an angel watching over me
Your love has brought me to my knees

[Chorus]
Well I've loved you and I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go

We kissed under the tired moon
And the stars shone down for me and you
We listen for the cock to crow
Come break of day you had to go

[Chorus]

I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go

I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go

Laa la la la ohh
La la la la

[Chorus]

Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I told you so
Wherever you decide to go

I've loved you well
Wherever you decide to go

I've loved you well

Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me

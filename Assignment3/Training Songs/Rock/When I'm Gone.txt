When I'm gone
Will you take good care of everything?
Will you keep wearing your wedding ring? 
When I'm gone

And when I'm gone
Will you take out all the photographs
Maybe spend a moment in the past? 
When I'm gone

Will you miss me in the night?
Will your arms reach out to hold me tight
And keep me in your dreams
In your heart, in your life?

Sometimes I'll wanna run to you like lovers do
When love is new and just for a moment be close to you
Pretending I'm still holding you.
And even when I'm far away the dreams will stay.

And someday after we've both chased our fantasies
Love will bring you back to me
When I'm gone
I'll be thinking about you constantly

'Cause you're locked inside my memory from now on
And I know that we said we needed time apart
But your love keeps pulling at my heart, pulling strong
Will you miss me in the night?

Will your arms reach out to hold me tight 
And keep me in your dreams
In your heart, in your life?
Sometimes I'll wanna run to you like lovers do 

Sometimes I'll wanna run to you like lovers do 
Sometimes I'll wanna run to you like lovers do

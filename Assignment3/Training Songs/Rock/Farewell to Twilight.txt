Cast your mind back a few years
Do you remember how it was?
How we used to be
Alive and carefree

You said I was silly for holding your hand
You made a joke about my stupid hair
Are you still laughing?
Are you still laughing?

Yesterday was such a drag
Day

But I don't think you'll ever come back again...

Good bye to moonlight
Farewell to twilight
'Cause everything is over now

No lipstick, no make-up, no kissing, no break up
'Cause everything is over now

Goodness me, you're so grown up
You seem to know what's best for both you and me
I don't care now
I'll just have a prayer

How we used to be
Alive and carefree

Yesterday was such a drag
Day

But I don't think you'll ever come back again...

Good bye to moonlight
Farewell to twilight
'Cause everything is over now

No lipstick, no make-up, no kissing, no break up
'Cause everything is over now

It's over now
It's over now
It's over now

Yesterday was such a drag
Day

But I don't think you'll ever come back again...

(do it do it do it)
Good bye to moonlight
Farewell to twilight
'Cause everything is over now

No lipstick, no make-up, no kissing, no break up
'Cause everything is over now

Good bye to moonlight
Farewell to twilight
'Cause everything is over now

No lipstick, no make-up, no kissing, no break up
'Cause everything is over now

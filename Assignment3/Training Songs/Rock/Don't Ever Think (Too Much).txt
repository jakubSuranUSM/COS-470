I'm standing on the edge of the cliff
And I'm thinking it through my mind
I'm afraid that I'm about to slip
'Cause my body is out time.

And I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'
I'm thinkin' 'till I'm nearly dead
Do you remember when you were young?
Do you remember what your mother said?

She said
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much

Obsession is a terrible thing
Does it happen to everyone?
This mother nature comes with a sting
And it prosecutes everyone.

And I'm lyin', I'm lyin', I'm lyin' awake,
I'm lying in my burnt out bed.
Do you remember when you were young?
Do you remember what your mother said?

She said
Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much

Ever think again
Ever think again
It's just the thinking I don't understand.
It's all a hoax built to wires
The persecution is on fire

Don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much
You don't ever think, ever think, ever think too much

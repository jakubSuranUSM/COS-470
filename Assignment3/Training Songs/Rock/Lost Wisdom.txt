I got close enough to the river that I couldn't hear the trucks
But not close enough to stop the roaring of my mind
Oh
Oh
These rocks don't care if I live or die
Everyone I know will finally turn away
I will confuse and disinterest all posterity
Lost wisdom
Is a quiet echo
Lost wisdom
By the edge of the stream at dusk
Is a quiet echo on loud wind

With one hand in the water running cold and clear
Fog obliterates the morning and I don't know where I am
The heart is pounding and you are always on my mind
Lost wisdom
Is a quiet echo
Lost wisdom
A boulder under the house
I used to know you
Now I don't

The screaming wind said my name
I think significant and dark
My lost face in the mirror at the gas station
Who are you but my face that I wake up with alone
Lost wisdom
Approaching shape in the low light

Oh
Oh
You thought you knew me
You thought our house was home
I thought I knew myself
I thought my heart was calm
Thunder lightning
Tidal wave
The wind blew down the door
Lost wisdom
The river goes through the room

Ooh
Ooh
I saw your picture out of nowhere
And forgot what I was doing
Everything vanished in your eclipse
A constellation of moments comes to life in the void
Lost wisdom
Face down under the moss
Enraptured by the beautiful face in the billowing flames
I open the front and back door and let the wind blow through
And I stood in the house and tried to hold the breeze
Lost wisdom
Waking up in a pile of ash
Secret knowledge
Comes to me in the dusk
Showed me the river
I saw me

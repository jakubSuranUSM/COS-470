Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
A one two, here we go
Back up, back up, back up, yeah
Oh mama, mama momma no

Ain't turning back it's my time to fly
To many decisions and not enough time
But I always did like the thrill living in the unknown
So back off a momma 'cause I

I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home, no no no

Don't hold me back it's my time to fly
And the Devil gave me nine full lives and I
I say this with down fold grin
'Cause nothing's better than living in sin

'Cause I ain't turning back it's my time to fly
And decisions and not enough time
But I always did like the thrill living in the unknown
So back off a momma 'cause I

I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home
I ain't comin' home, no no no

Can't you here me, baby
I've been fl-fl-flying so far
'Cause you can't leave her baby
You keep it pumpin' from the loveline
Oh oh, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah yeah
Back up, back up, back up, yeah ah

Turning back it's my
No no, you see I ain't turning back
I ain't turning back it's my
You see I gotta head on out and I, I
I ain't turning back 'cause I my, no no no no
You see I

Turning back it's my time to fly
Too many decisions and not enough time
But I always did like the thrill
Living in the unknown
So back off a momma 'cause I

I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home, no no no

I ain't coming home
Back up, back up, back up, back up, yeah
Aw aw aw aw aw no, oh yeah
Oh oh oh
Well, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Got a feeling inside (can't explain)
It's a certain kind (can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (can't explain)

I said (can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl (can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue

But I can't explain (can't explain)
Forgive me one more time, now (can't explain)

(Ooh) I said I can't explain, yeah
(Ooh) you drive me out of my mind
(Ooh) yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe
(Ooh) I said I can't explain

A cynical mind
Won’t help you through the night
And it can’t hold you up
When you’re too tired to fight

Where you didn’t have the strength
To look after yourself
You find all that you need
For somebody else

But love can move mountains
Love can move mountains
Love can move mountains, yes it can
Love can move mountains

That impossible task
You’re thinking of
Is one you can complete
When you’re driven by love

And the strength that you find
Won’t go slipping away
Once it enters your soul
It’s reborn every day

Love can move mountains

So if you’re lucky enough to live
To see love come your way
Be thankful every day
That it stays
Oh that it stays

A cynical mind
Won’t help you through the night
And it can’t hold you up
When you’re too tired to fight

But love can move mountains

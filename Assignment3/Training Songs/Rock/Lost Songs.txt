Lost songs are going nowhere
Lost for words, with nothing to share
Lost beats with no emotion
Swimming through the motive socials

Vague ships and bloody knives
Give their best to proper applies
This part has nowhere to go
Only void that swallow new pole

Show does in my wonder through these odds
Picking up the traces with our life
Tell me this is where I cross the line
Walking through these other assholes

Lost loves are all around you
Open despair, feel so quite good
Lost calls that can’t be broken
Budged in holes, the ones unspoken

Vague ships are lion sized
Taken nearly from their lost lives
This world has nowhere to go
Only void that swallow new pole

Sometimes every wonders through these lives
Picking up divisions with our wives
Tell me if there’s something to explore
Everything inside these lost songs

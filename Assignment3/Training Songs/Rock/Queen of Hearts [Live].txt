Midnight, I'm a-waiting on the 1205  
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line  
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise  
Won't you keep my heart from breaking  
If it's only for a very short 

Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart  
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you  
Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime  
That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you    

Baby, it makes me feel so bad  
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done  
And baby, I know it makes you sad  
But when they're handing out the heartaches  
You know you got to have you some    

Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart  
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you  
Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime  
That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you   
 
Lovers, I know you've had a few  
You hide your heart beneath the covers  
And you tell 'em they're the only one  
And others know what I'm going through  
It's so hard to be a lover  
When you say you only do it for fun    

Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart  
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you  
Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime  
That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you    
To keep me away from you  
To keep me away from you

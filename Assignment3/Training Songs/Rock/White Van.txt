There's a yellow arrow painted on the ground 
I give up and I decide to follow 
There's a thick white blanket covering the town
And right now it's more then I can swallow

There's a ship sailing gently on the waves
There's a tear drop rollin'
There's a small hand pressed against a glass
And there's and engine pullin' 

And you'll be far away
And you'll be deep inside
And you know that time is all we have 

There's a big black nothing in your heart
There's me in a white van
And there's a million holes dug in the pavement
There's a good chance to avoid them

So if you decide to leave
Or if you decide to stop breathing 
Don't leave me hanging
â€˜Cause time is all we have

And what about the love in your hands 
And the cold in your palm
And the sweat on your forehead 
I can never ever be calm 
I can never sit still
Because I'm like an alarm-clock
See me 
Hear me
Do this 
Do that 
Take my words, eat them and swallow
Don't measure my steps and actions 
Just hold me close and I will follow

And there's a big knife pressed against my throat 
There's a word carved into my back 
And there's a sea of questions everywhere you go
And there's really no way out

And if you decide to leave 
Then you'll leave without me 
And you know that time is all we have

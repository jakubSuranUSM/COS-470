Sleepy old sun, sleepy old day, 
Sleepy old tree gonna make me some shade.
Sleepy old time on my side of town, 
I'm feelin' fine, I'll explain to you now.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice just don't think twice. 
Some worry all day 'bout who they can trust, 
Some worry all night 'bout money and lust.
Worry they do and worried they die--
And after they're gone just the bankers cry.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice just don't think twice.
Life is a card, you take what you get.
You do what you can to feel no regret.
You do what you can, forget about words, 
Just go with the feelin' it usually works.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice you don't think twice.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.
It don't take plans to clap your hands,
When it feels nice you don't think twice.
Don't think, feel; ain't no big deal.
Just make it real and don't think, feel.

Poor little universe
Has stubbed its thing
What fell out was
A human being

I knew a little universe
That didn't mean a thing
'Til he stubbed himself
Another being

Welcome to the center of the universe
You could do way worse
Poor little tiny, little bit of universe
Has caught a cough

Spitting it out all over the place
Little dabs of the human race
Poor little dab
Right here at the center of you

Man I never needed to go
To Epcot center
Happy as a clam living in
The epicenter

Never owned a house or a car
I'm just a renter
Met my love at the prevention center
You welcome to the center of you

Swinging 'round in circles, looking for the way 
Fleeing from the time when she wanted me to stay 
My world is swirling 'round, this time I know it well 
Our love is coming down again 

Then I realize inside me, I've had myself all wrong 
This time I know for certain, I've never been that strong 
The moment you remember, those times you stop to think 
Our love will come undone again 

But with demons sitting at my side 
An angel's come to ask me why 
And slowly I give up inside to say 
To feel alive, I'd give it all away 

Destructive words to make it so, but none of this is you, you know 

Another year, another week, another set of summer sheets 
Another “we should hang out again soon” 
Another drink, another kiss 

And with demons sitting at my side 
Another angel asks me why 
And it doesn't take too much to say 
To feel alive, I'd give it all away 

Again, and again and again 

Then she's sitting at my side 
An angel's come to ask me why 
And it takes nothing to say 
To feel alive, I'll give it all away

I live it high cost of livin' tell me why give it all.
Inside you gotta head high one size fits all
Head ride, you decide

Sweet, sweet ride. Sweet sweet ride. 1969

I live it why ya gotta limit, crossed grin now I
Gotta bare it. 
Head high 9 inside hell to ride you beside
Sweet, sweet ride. Sweet sweet ride. 1965

I live it, it's not a gimmick my side anti-red.
What I said in your head naked what you hide
Will the planes ever collide, we align, collide.
My sweet sign: 1969

I like it hot cold livin' 
Have you seen the inside of my ceiling's gotta big wild grin inside miles wide you belie
Sweet, sweet ride. Sweet sweet ride. 1965

I've had it now I've gotta give it all blind mice resign you gotta hoodshine analyze.
Seats alive vinyl thighs
Sweet ride. Sweet, sweet ride. 1969.

Speak free sexually 
Why, why

Sweet, sweet ride

Sweet sweet sixty sexy I idolize your
Sixxy sexty oh my sixty sixxy nine.

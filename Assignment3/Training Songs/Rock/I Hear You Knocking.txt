You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door
 
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I begged you not to go, but you said goodbye
And now you tell me all your lies
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
 
You better get back to your use to be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
 
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I told you way back in Fifty Two 
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been

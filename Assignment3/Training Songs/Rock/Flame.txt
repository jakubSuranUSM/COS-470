Cold fire feeling, is the cold fire feeling in my bones
Skylines breathing as the sun lies beating down the door

I'm tired of watching the shadows on the wall
My eyes are foreseeing
The shackles open, we're finally free to bolt
If you're done with believing

Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out

Found true meaning, now my head starts spinning out the cave
You won't come with me 'cause you're just too comfortable in chains

I'm tired of watching the shadows on the wall
My eyes are foreseeing
The shackles open, we're finally free to bolt
If you're done with believing

Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out

Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out

Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out

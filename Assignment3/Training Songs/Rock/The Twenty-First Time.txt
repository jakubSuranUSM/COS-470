Nowhere to live, nowhere to fall
He used to have money, but he s wasted it all.
His face is a photograph burned in my mind,
But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

He sleeps under stars, that's all he can afford
His blanket's an old coat he s had since the war
He stands on the corner of Carter and Vine
But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

He may be a drifter, he's grown old and gray
But what if he s Jesus and I walk away?
I say I m the body and drink of the wine
But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

She's twenty-nine but she feels forty-eight
She can't raise three kids on minimum wage
She's cryin  in back of the welfare line
But I pretend not to see her for the twenty-first time

She may be a stranger tryin  to get through the day
But what if it s Jesus and I walk away?
I say I m the body and drink of the wine
But I pretend not to see her for the twenty-first time

This is a call for a change in my heart
I realize that I've not been doin  my part
When I needed a Savior, I found it in Him
He gave to me, now I'll give back to them

Drifter or stranger, father or son
I'll look for Jesus in every one
'Cause I am the body and drink of the wine
And I'm thankful there's  more than the twenty-first time

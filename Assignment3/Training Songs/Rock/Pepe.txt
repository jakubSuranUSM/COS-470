Johnny is a joker
(He’s a bird)
A very funny joker
(He’s a bird)
But when he jokes my honey
(He’s a dog)
His jokin’ ain’t so funny
(What a dog)
Johnny is a joker that’s a’tryin’ to steal my baby
(He’s a bird dog)

Johnny sings a love song
(Like a bird)
He sings the sweetest love song
(Ya ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal
(What a howl)
To me he’s just a wolf dog
(On the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy-love my baby
(He’s a bird dog)

Hey, bird dog get away from my quail
Hey, bird dog you’re on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovely-dove alone
Hey, bird dog get away from my chick
Hey, bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own

Johnny kissed the teacher
(He’s a bird)
He tiptoed up to reach her
(He’s a bird)
Well he’s the teacher’s pet now
(He’s a dog)
What he wants he can get now
(What a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby
(He’s a bird dog)

Hey, bird dog get away from my quail
Hey, bird dog you’re on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovely-dove alone
Hey, bird dog get away from my chick
Hey, bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own

He’s a bird
He’s a dog
He’s a bird

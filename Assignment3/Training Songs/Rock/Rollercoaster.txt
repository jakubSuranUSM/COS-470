Outrun the fight
I use to hide
In quiet places

I'll refrase my cry
For I would keep on wondering
The rest of my life

You're all moving too fast
My biggest fear is
That we'll never ever last

I know, it's not that easy
Let's hit the brakes

Don't take no time
Unless there's a crime
To be committed

I guess we lost our faith
While we stand and wait
until nothing ever happens

I know, it's not that easy
Let's hit the brakes

Two weeks in Spain makes the year disappear easy
Two weeks in Spain, you forget, bored and yet weary
We're back again, drink the wine, weather's fine, only
Two weeks in Spain's not enough

Never think where you're going
Paradise a while knowing
Everything that you're doing
It's a carnival

Let it go so remember
Counting sheep in September
Let 'em know you're the master
It's a roundabout

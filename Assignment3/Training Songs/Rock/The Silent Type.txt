The conversation started something like this
“You wanna cigarette”, I said “I’m trying to quit”
I kept it cool, but she was pretty serious
I should've walked away, I could’ve walked away
I shoulda walked away

When it was quiet on the line while I waited
It felt a little long, it felt a little long
The silent type, so what had I created?
It didn't feel that great, it shouldn't feel that way
Don't shoot the messenger if you want to read it
Given you know what's right, you're looking for a fight
Ain't hard to lie but it's harder to believe it
Don't matter if it's wrong, you know where you belong
You know where you belong

Everybody wants what they cannot have
Though some will never get it, never hurts to ask
Everybody starts with the same motivation
A little bit of love, a little less conversation
I couldn't tell if she bought my excuses
So my unlucky guess was she was not impressed
Although it seems she's the type that never loses
I knew I couldn't stay ‘cause it was getting late
My soul confession was one she didn't need it
She didn't listen well, she didn't listen well
Tilted her head right before she starts to lean in
She wouldn't be denied, I had to close my eyes
I had to close my eyes

Everybody wants what they cannot have
Though some will never get it, never hurts to ask
Everybody tries but it won't add up, you’ll be way better off
You'll be way better off there
Everybody acts like their hands are clean
And always go and lie about the same old things
Everybody starts with the same motivation
A little bit of love, a little less conversation

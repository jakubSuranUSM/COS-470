I'm supposed to love you
But I don't know why
'Cause you don't want
To have nothing to with me, no
You hurt my feeling
And you make me cry
And it's the kind of thing
That gets next to me
Yes, stand out
Let me tell whatever you are
Now you say your mother taught you
To tell right from wrong
But this will show you
The devine line between a weak and a strong
If you go around blaming people
By the colour of their size
All I can tell you people is
That you're in for a big surprise
Yes, stand out
I think you ought to stand out
So I can say whatever you are
Stand out stand out
Now you supposed to love me
And if you don't know why
Now I'm your ticket to heaven
And that ain't no lie
I see a mass line of jet set
All filled up with hate
You better put some love in his life
Come on, hours getting late
Stand out
I think you ought to stand out

Ten feet of shade
I'm all in white
I lean down
Through the cyclone wire
Even though I don't really know ya
I keep my head over my shoulder

Julie's place
After the corner
I grit my teeth
So they don't chatter
Calling for days
Can't find the door
Keeping it down
Foot through the floor

The light played up
The light played up
And I glazed up
The light played up

Moon on my neck
I feel it come
I'm standing here
Like a burning house
Calling for days
Can't find the door
Keeping it down
Foot through the floor

The light played up
The light played up
And I glazed up
The light played up

We need peace in L.A., what happened was wrong
We all feel betrayed, but we got to be strong
If the powers that be let evil go free
You must understand, don't play into their hand

We need peace in L.A., peace in L.A.

Don't need beating and shouting, don't need burning and looting
Tonight we all pray, that our children are safe
There's hurt and frustration, there's a hard realization
But how can we help if we steal from ourselves?

We need peace in L.A., peace in L.A.
We need peace in L.A., peace in L.A.

Stay cool, don't be a fool
Stay cool, don't be a fool

Mountain time, mountain date.  Hope to be there, before it's late
I need to see you, looking fine.  Gotta be there, mountain time

Last night I had to tell you, made up my mind I need to see you
Got on the road to ride
I thought all of it over, now I have to be at your side

Somewhere, be there

So hard seeing it your way.  I'm glad, what more can I say
This lane taking me back today

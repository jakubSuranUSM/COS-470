She was standing in the dark
Waiting in the wings
Just around the next dream
He was holdin' all the keys
To set my heart free
Behind the shadows of love

From the distance I could see
Her standing alone
Shine like a jewel in the night
Hidden from the eyes
A thief of the soul
Behind the shadows of love

Set me on fire with the stories you tell
Drown in the ocean of dreams
Close to the flame on wings of desire
Nothing's what it seems

She was waiting outside
With arms open wide
Ready to break my heart's fall
Oh the lightning in her eyes
I learned how to fly
Behind the shadow of love

Set me on fire with the stories you tell
Drown in the ocean of dreams
Close to the flame on wings of desire
Nothing's what it seems

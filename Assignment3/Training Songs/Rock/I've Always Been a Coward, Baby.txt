It's a lovely day, watch us fade away
Open our lies and say, "I love you"
If you see me around, look towards the ground
Never make the sound, "I love you"

I never wanted to, I had no choice I had to
Would I lie to you when I lie with you?
I thought I was strong, I guess I was wrong
It's been too long

It's time I was gone
It's easy looking in your eyes
To tell you nothing but lies
I've been faking this for hours

But then I've always been a coward, baby
I'm nothing but a coward, baby

It's a lovely day, watch us fade away
Open our lies and say, "I love you"
If you see me around, look towards the ground
Never make the sound, "I love you"

I always wanted to leave a choice for you
Why lie with you when I can lie to you?
Can't take it any longer, getting weaker not stronger
Switch to self destruct

'cause that don't take any guts
It's easy looking in your eyes
To tell you nothing but lies
I've been faking this for hours

But then I've always been a coward, baby
I'm nothing but a coward, baby

Slap the face of a coward, baby
Kiss the face of a coward, baby

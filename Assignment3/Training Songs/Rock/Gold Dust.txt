If your eyes are blue you know the rest
Champagne if it's very cool
It's never very formal how you dress
For oysters by the swimming pool
Then slip away into the mountainside
Like the man in the Lazy E'
It's great to have a place where you can hide
Why you must amazes me

[Chorus]
Golden,
Where are you?
Sold on gold dust

I shuttled all around America
From New York to Los Angeles
Nervous breakdown later, there we were
From Liberty to redwood trees
A friend of mine, she hitched from east to west
In time to hear my final song
It seems to me she tried her very best
She is a good companion

[Chorus]

He stores away the moments of her smiles
As if they were rare butterflies
Stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles
Then barters for the merchandise
When Life it drags the likes of me around
Just when we need some time alone
You have a simple mansion underground
Without address or telephone

[Chorus]

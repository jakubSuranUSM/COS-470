Sit here in Trees Lounge
Pour it in my mouth
I Need something to forget
What got me in this mess

I'm feeling less and less
My Judgment is not clear 
I do things that I fear,
I would never do

Sit here in Trees Lounge
Order one more round
You have a pretty name,
Pretty like your name

Lets play a drinking game
And If I win I get to,
Take you home and if you, 
Win, you go home with me

'Cause I need something to forget,
What got me in this mess
Feeling less and less
My judgment is not clear 
I do things that I fear,
I would never do

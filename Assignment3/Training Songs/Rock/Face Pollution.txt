An' I can count it on my fingers
I have all my reasons not to feel
I'm numb as rigor mortis
Scared by monkey faces drowned in shark fins

But I don't feel like feeling, I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling, feeling like you

Now I'm in the mirror, now it's getting clear
I fear that I'm in now, I'm into plastics
Now I've made a mask, it looks like fish heads

But I don't feel like feeling, I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling, feeling like you

I don't feel like feeling, I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling, feeling like you

Face pollution, face pollution
Face pollution, face pollution
(Feel) 
Face pollution, face pollution
Face pollution, face pollution

(Feel)

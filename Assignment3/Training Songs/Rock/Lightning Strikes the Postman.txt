I got yer letter; it had turned to sand
Lighting strikes the postman in his hand
I hope that you remember the things you had to say
It's just a supernatural delay

I got yer package; it was all a mess
Lightning strikes the postman in his chest
I hope that you remember the things you had to say
It's just a supernatural delay

I sent you a postcard, and I hope yer fine
But lightning strikes the postman all the time
I couldn't really think of anything to say
It's just a supernatural delay

And it's hard to read the writing through the flames

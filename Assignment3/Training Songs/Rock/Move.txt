Lying around
There's no need to lie
First it's in your heart
Then it's in your eyes

Lie down the line
You can't take the truth
The way I am
I can't feel you move

I can't feel you move
I can't feel you move

Layers of skin
I can't touch within
Heard it in your voice
Read it in your eyes

Lie down the line
You can't take the truth
My head is sore
I can't feel you move

I can't feel you move
I can't feel you move

Running around
There's no need to lie
First it's in your heart
Then it's in your eyes

I can't feel you move
I can't feel you move
I can't feel you move

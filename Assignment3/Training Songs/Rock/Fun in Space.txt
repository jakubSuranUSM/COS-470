Strangers in a strange land
In an alien heat
Journeys made by no man
In event of defeat
This ship sings to the skies
This ship sings to the skies
For all you, Gals and guys
Stranger than fiction
The smile on your face
Boy when we get there
We'll have fun in space
Our structure is battered
But the corridors ring
With little green stories
Of this and these things
This ship sings to the skies
This ship sings to the skies
For all you gals and guys
Stranger than fiction
The smile on your face
Boy when we get there
We'll have fun in space...

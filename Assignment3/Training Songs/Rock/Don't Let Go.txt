Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock.
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Come on, baby, it's time to rock,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'm so happy I got you here,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear.
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

Thunder, lightening, wind and rain,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Love is stormin' inside my brain,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'm so eager, I'm nearly dyin',
Don't let go, Don't let go.
You've been keepin' your lips from mine.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

Hound dog barkin' up side the hill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Love is draggin' him thru the mill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
If it wasn't for havin' you,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'd be barkin' and howlin' too.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

One day, baby, you'll quit me yet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'll be cryin' and soakin' wet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
One thing, baby, I'll never stand,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Your lips kissin' some other man.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!
Just hold me tight, Don't let go!

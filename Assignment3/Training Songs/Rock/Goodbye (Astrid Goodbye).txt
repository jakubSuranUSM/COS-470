Open up the door Astrid, cause I'm comin' down the stairs
And I ain't gonna listen to no more pissin' around
I've had seven long years of give a little, take a little
Stack a little money away
And you better believe I'm gonna take this love to town

Turn on the tears Astrid, and don't forget to let the neighbours see
What a low down deal you got when you married me
You can drown your days in Valium and brandy
Talkin' to the cat and the dog
And you can shove your cheap french vogue society

Goodbye, goodbye
I won't be comin' back for long

Open up the door Astrid, and don't try to stand in my way
I'm heading for a long long night to a better day
And don't bother offering to drive me to the station
You'd only drive me round the bend
We're comin' to the end, there's nothin' left to say

I never meant to hurt you
Sometimes these thoughts have a way making sense
Secrets that we keep turn into accidents
If you burn away the bonds with the fires of his wrists
The positive, the negative, have a way of blending in

End this now, we've gone too far
Let's take back words that turned to scars
If I could find a way to turn back time
Have to let you know I'm on your side

Took the easy way out, I showed my self doubt
The only way to ease the pain is to drink until I drown
I'll say it out loud my voice is the only sound
So listen up, I'll spell it out
I need your help, I need it now

End this now, we've gone too far
Let's take back words that turned to scars
If I could find a way to turn back time 
Have to let you know I'm on your side

Am I now everything that you wanted me to be?
Tried my best, took a shot in the dark and I lost

End this now, we've gone too far
Let's take back words that turned to scars
If I could find a way to turn back time
Have to let you know I'm on your side

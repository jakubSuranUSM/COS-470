All the people I know want to be left alone
Some people!
I don't know?
They want to leave you alone
You gotta be just, be just like them
Biggest gang I know they call the government
Gang is a weapon
That you trade your mind in for
You gotta be just, be just like them
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
The gang
And the government
No different
That makes me
1%
That makes me

Trouble comes down
Like a foot steppin heavy
Shake your fist
At the bitch
Or wave your money
You gotta be right
You gotta be right
Don't be no
Supper for a big fish
With the big lip
And the over -
Bite, bite

You gotta bite
Bite, bite, bite, da bita
Bite, bite, ba da da bita
Bite, bite, bite, bite
Bite, bite, bite, bite
All the people I know want to be left alone
Some people!
I don't know?
They want to leave you alone!
You gotta be just, be just like them
The gang
And the government
No different

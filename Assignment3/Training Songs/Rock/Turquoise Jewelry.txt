Come down from your treehouse condominium
Stop driving around in that station wagon with the wood on the side
Take off that jumpsuit. You look like Grace Slick
Stayin' up all night drinking that 7-11 coffee

Take off your turqouise jewelry
Shake your medicine rattle

Fill a sock with an herb
Put on your fringe skirt
Come sit down next to your old man, he's hankerin' for some company
Come sit down next to your old man, let him cough in your ear

'Cause you bring me the sticks and stones
And you bring me the everything

Take off your turquoise jewelry
Shake your medicine rattle
'Cause you bring me sticks and stones
And you bring me everything

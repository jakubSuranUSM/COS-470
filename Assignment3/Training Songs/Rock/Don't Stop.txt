The road I walk is paved in gold
To glorify my platinum soul
I'll buy my way to talk to god
So he can live with what I'm not

the selfish blood runs through my veins
I gave up everything for fame
I am the lie that you adore
I feed the rich and f*** the poor

I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop
I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop

this is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
Begging me for more

the road I walk is paved in gold
To glorify my platinum soul
I am the closest thing to god
So worship me and never stop

the rested blood runs through my veins
I gave up everything for fame
I am the lie that you adore
I feed the rich, f*** the poor

I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop
I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop

this is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
Begging me for more

Dear future,
I bought you
I own the rights

to let go
Destroy you
This is my life

Dear future,
I bought you
I own the rights

to let go
Destroy you
This is my life...inside

I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop
I got, what you want
It's just, don't stop

this is entertainment
Lies are entertainment
You are down on your knees
Begging me for more
Begging me for more
Begging me for more

(I got, you want
It's just, don't stop
I got, you want
It's just, don't stop)

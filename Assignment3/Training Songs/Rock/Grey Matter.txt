clear blue sky and not a moment too soon
A bit like what heaven must have looked like
before man fingered the moon
I drilled a hole in my head to let the sun shine through
and oo, oo baby oo.
Grey matter fade away. Grey matter fade away. Fade away.
It's a navigation to nowhere and there's not a stone left
unturned its buried so deep inside itself. It's sold
hollow and burned. oo.
I drilled a hole in my head to let the sun shine through
and oo, oo baby oo.
Grey matter fade away. Grey matter fade away. Fade away.
Love. Rockets and aeroplanes. Up up and away
if I'm going to pray I'll pray to to a god that always smiles
Hey ! It's just another day
I drilled a hole in my head to let the sun shine through
and oo, oo baby oo.
Grey matter fade away. Grey matter fade away. Fade away.

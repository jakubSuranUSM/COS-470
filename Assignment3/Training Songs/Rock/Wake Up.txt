Wake up man
Wake you up
Gotta show you
Show you
What's up

Gotta shake you man
Shake you up
Gotta shake you till you wake up

You always seem to lose your touch
I think you think
You think too much
There's only so much you can take
Before the pieces start to break

You said your color's always red
I see your eyes already dead

Gotta wake up man
Wake you up
Gotta show you
Show you
What's up

Gotta shake you man
Shake you up
Gotta shake you till you wake up

Don't stack the ride
When you're wackin' in your head

The things you sow upon your face
Will show up when you fall from grace
From all the shit that you put in
Your color pours out from your skin

Gotta wake up man
Wake you up
Gotta show you
Show you
What's up

Gotta shake you man
Shake you up
Gotta shake you till you wake up

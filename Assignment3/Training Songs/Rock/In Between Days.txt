Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die 
Yesterday I got so old it made me want to cry 
So go on go on just walk away 
Go on go on your choice is made 
Go on go on and disappear 
Go on go on away from here 
Yeah I know I was wrong when I said it was true 
Yeah it couldn't be me and be her in between without you 
Without you 
Yesterday I got so scared I shivered like a child 
Yesterday away from you it froze me deep inside 
Well come back come back don't walk away 
Come back come back come back today 
Come back come back oh can't you see 
Come back come back to me 
Yeah I know I was wrong when I said it was true 
Yeah it couldn't be me and be her in between without you 
Without you 
Go on go on go on go on 
Without you 
Go on 
Go on without you

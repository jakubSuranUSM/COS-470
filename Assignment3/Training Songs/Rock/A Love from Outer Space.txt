(originally performed by are Kane)

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
A love from outer space
It's true oh

I know where she's coming from
Space is where we both belong
Got to tell her in this song
This time nothing can go wrong (X2)

Take a ticket to ride the space express
Meet the girl in the starstruck dress
She trusts me more than I can never guess
I just couldn't wait for her caress
She comes from the milky way
She came to earth for my birthday
We worked out hard to communicate
She said I am not a fake

Shalalalalalala hoo (X4)

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space

I like you, but you love to slow for me
And I know that it's hard to set me free,
There's about a million things I need to do
And not with you,
If you could choose my life would be arranged,
I'm sorry but you just can't have this changed,
Claiming all my time and space for you,
Is no can do
Please don't sue me,you can't undo me,
Dead end in this lane, me crazy you sane

For every step I make you make one too
And everywhere I look I just see you,
If you keep on ignoring mental state,
I'll suffocate,
It's time for different road, yeah you agree,
Get off this stranded loveboat hit the sea,
Afraid of saying goodbye, end is near,
Well feed your fear
Please don't sue me, you can't undo me,
Dead end in this lane, me crazy, you sane

What has happened to me? The grip she's got over me
If you start wearing shoes on your hands, 
You know that something is wrong,
Who came before me, how come she entangled me,
If you measure the day by meter, you know that something ain't right

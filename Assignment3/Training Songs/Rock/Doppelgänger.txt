Oh, the devil is in me oh, 
The devil is in me oh, 
The spirit is in me oh, 
The spirit is in me.

I don't know what I should do now 
Show me what I should be doing
 
Am I wearing my right dress? 
Am I wearing the right  shoes? 
Am I wearing my right face? 

You just hate me for being born 
You just hate me for being me 
You just hate me for being me 
You just hate me for knowing you 
As I do 

All I ever wanted 
Was to be the light in your eyes 

Am I thinking the right thing?
Am I in my right mind?
Am I wearing my right head?

You just hate me for being born 
You just hate me for being me 
You just hate me for being me 
You just hate me for knowing you 
As I do 

Do I have a real heart?
Do I think with an open mind? 
Do I have real blood 
Moving through my veins, 
Moving through my veins,
Moving through my veins?
Pulsating through me,
Pushing through my veins?

You just hate me for being born 
You just hate me for being me 
You just hate me for being me

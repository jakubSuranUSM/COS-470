I can't hide the truth from you
In a closet of some kindness
Time will sharpen its blade
And it will cut you when you find it
I wish that I could lie to you baby

I've got what you don't want to hear
How do I tell you

I tried to hold my soul back
But its tide is so much stronger
Than the drifting feelings
We want to hold a little longer
I wish that I could lie to you baby

For far too long your lies protected you
Now I have to hurt you with the truth

We will find love someday
But the longer we hold on now
The longer it will be until we find it

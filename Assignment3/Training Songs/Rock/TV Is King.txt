I wish I was the man with the mechanical heart 
I'd conquer all my enemies alone 
I'd tear the guys apart 
Then scatter the pieces 

I wish I was the man in the soundproof booth 
I wish I had a chance to stump the band 
Or maybe tell truth 
And maybe I could win a color television 

I really love my--television 
I love to sit by--television 
Can't live without my--television 

TV is king 
You're my everything 

I wish I had the girl with the bouncy hair 
We'd ride off in a brand new car 
Or fly a plane somewhere 
Like probably Jamaica 

I brush my teeth, shampoo my hair, and shave my face 
Apply the necessary aerosol 
In the appropriate place 
And we'll spend the night together watching television 

I can't turn off my--television 
Don't really know why--television 
I understand my--television 

You got your works in a drawer and your color's on track 
You have to break away but you always come back 
You make a hundred changes but you're always the same 
You make me so excited and you make me so lame 
You're just a tube full of gas and a box full of tin 
But you show me your charms and I want to jump in 
Oh if only your chassis was covered with skin 
'Cause TV you're my everything 

I really love my--television 
I love to sit by--television 
Can't live without my--television 
I can't turn off my--television 
Don't really know why--television 
I understand my--television 
I really love my--television 

TV is king 
You're my everything 
TV is king

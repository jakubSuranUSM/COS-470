What do the men say 
To the women when they lay down at night 
All naked of arms from the old imagined fight? 
And how do the women hear? 
In kind and in likeness of light 
"In kindness you needn't and neither do I
We are both of us capable of flight" 
And as if to give proof 
She jumped through the hole in the roof 
What did the condemned say 
To the blessed when they met on the path? 
"O you take the low road and I'll take the high for a laugh
(but if I'm laughing now it's because I've a gentle heart)"
And because it was true 
He slipped through the hole in the roof 

La la la la, 
La la la la la la... 
From above your head a thing can be read that you're thinking... 

What the secretaries sing and the CEO's bark in the bars 

What do the dead say 
To the ones who still think they're alive? 
"With your heads all on backwards 
You can't see in front for what near behind you lies" 
"Well show us some help then
Above your head let it flicker the light
These ones that I'm with 
Have not learned to forgive your necessary alibis 
When they made you love money
And the poor prophet's stock
When they poisoned the watersheds 
And fashioned our arrowheads 
From the deep forbidden rock

O but did you see what people do? 
And when you saw it you did it too
Now all your children are twice the size of you 
And they come in at night through 
The hole in your roof 
The hole in your roof 
The hole in your roof 
The hole in your roof

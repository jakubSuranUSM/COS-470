THIS LITTLE GIRL
Gary U.S. Bonds

Here she comes walkin' down the street
You know she's walkin' just like
She's walkin' to come and see me
Oh she's so young and she's so fine

I know what's on your mind
Know what you want to do
But if you mess with her
I'm gonna mess with you
You better watch your step
You better stay in line

This little girl is mine
Oh this little girl is mine
Oh this little girl
This little girl
This little girl is mine

Well if the world was mine to do with 
What I want to do sir
Well I'd wrap it up in a bow
And give it all to her yeah
And all my love
All of the time

You know I'd hold her tight
I'd never let her go
And late at night
You know I'd love her so
Yeah I'd treat her right 
So she'd never mind

This little girl is mine
Oh this little girl is mine
Oh this little girl
This little girl
This little girl is mine
Mine, mine, mine

Hey you better watch out 
I'm telling you the score
Are you going to be sweeping your 
Broken heart up off the floor
Oh and that ain't all 
I'm telling you my friend

I know what's on your mind
I know what you want to do
But if you mess with her
I'm gonna mess with you

You like the way she moves
You like to watch her walk
You better listen up
'Cause man this just ain't talk
You better watch yourself
You better stay in line

Now mister I said 
This little girl is mine
Oh this little girl is mine

Oh this little girl is mine

Kerb Crawler
White side walls with grooves
Kerb Crawler
So fast he hardly moves
Kerb Crawler
He really approves of
Your high heels clicking
Like a pair of cloven hooves

Excuse Me Lady
Are you looking for a lift?
I ain't going nowhere special
I'm just out on the drift
I'll take you anywhere you want
Drop you outside your door
I might drive us down the Autobahn
With my foot right to the floor

Fandago insect in the skyscraper shade
He's a night-city mantis
In the neon parade

Come on, come on

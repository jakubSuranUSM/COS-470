Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay
They're not afraid now
A disco bar in Germany
Les boys are glad to be
Upon parade now

Les boys got leather straps
Les boys got SS caps
But they got no gun now
Get dressed up, get a little risky
Got to do a little S & M, these days
It's all in fun now

Les boys come on again
For the high class whores
And the businessmen
Who drive in their Mercedes Benz
To a disco bar in Old Munchen, yea

When I had get the jokes that the DJ makes
They get nervous and they make mistakes
They're bad for business
Some tourist take a photograph
(Photograph)
Les boys don't get one laugh
He says they're useless

Les boys come on again
For the high class whores
And the businessmen
Who drive in their Mercedes Benz
To a disco bar in Old Munchen

Late at night when they're gone away
Les boys dream of John Genet
High heel shoes and a black beret
And the posters on the wall that say

Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay
Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay

Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay
Hey, les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay

Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay
Hey, les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay

Les boys do cabaret
Les boys are glad to be gay
Les boys do cabaret
Les boys do cabaret

Open up this cupboard and you'll find a bone of everyone inside,
breathe life into articles and breathe in particles before our time,
an apple in our vision is the object on the supple tip of boughs,
but remember that the apple is the wood and the wood becomes the substance for the plough,
just as the polished shiny tooth is cradled in the softest fleshy gum,
remember that the product's not assembled like an architect that builds a house,
and the apple never got attached,
and therefore didn't get detached.

Never ever wanted to be with you,
The only thing you gave me was the boredom I suffocated in,
Adrift in cheap towns don't stop the rain,
Numbed out in piss towns,
Just want to dig their graves

Motown, Motown junk
I laughed when Lennon got shot,
Twenty one years of living and nothing means anything to me.

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery,
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal,
Stops your heart beating for one to ten seconds,
Stops your brain thinking for one to ten seconds,

Motown junk, Motown junk
Motown junk, Motown junk

I don't want cause I just get,
All your slut heroes offer is a fear of the future,
Past made useless cause I'm dying now,
Communal tyranny, a jail that bleeds our wrists.

Motown, Motown junk
I laughed when Lennon got shot,
Twenty one years of living and nothing means anything to me.

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery,
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal,
Stops your heart beating for one to ten seconds,
Stops your brain thinking for one to ten seconds,

Motown junk, Motown junk
Motown junk, Motown junk

Motown junk a lifetime of slavery,
Songs of love echo underclass betrayal,
Stops your heart beating for one to ten seconds,
Stops your brain thinking for one to ten seconds,

Motown junk, Motown junk
Motown junk, Motown junk

We live in urban hell,
We destroy rock and roll.

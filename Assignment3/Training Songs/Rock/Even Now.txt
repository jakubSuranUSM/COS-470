And in the morning
After years have passed
It seems
Oh even now to overwhelm me
And in the stillness
After life has passed
It seems
Even now to grow like cancer
And in the fallout
After war days have passed
It seems
Even now to keep from dying
And there you are, going deep into and through me
And there you are, keeping distant all who knew me
And filling me with a new kind of life
But it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you send me reeling
For you and I have been together much too long
And though I drink my mind will not grow numb
'cause it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you know I'm reeling
For you and I have been together much to long
Much too long, don't you know
Oh and here we are, and here it goes again
I know I've waited much too long
I have weighed it all, delayed the fall
But even so, even nowâ?¦
Evenâ?¦nowâ?¦ evenâ?¦nowâ?¦
Evenâ?¦nowâ?¦ evenâ?¦nowâ?¦
Evenâ?¦nowâ?¦ evenâ?¦nowâ?¦

Dan is drinking coffee, 
Mary's drinking tea, 
Betty's having breakfast 
In the plastic surgery.
Some say she's a beauty, 
Some may say she's mad, 
But she doesn't care what people say 
And dyes her red hair black.

Cause you don't know, 
What they will say, 
You probably've to do it your own way.
Oh you don't know, what they will see 
Absolutely nothing! Probably! 

Tom is vegetarian, 
A little fool they say. 
His father wants to change his mind, 
He's trying every day.

Anne is loving women, 
Fred is loving men 
And everybody shakes their head 
Cause no one understands. 

You don't know,
What they will say, 
You probably've to do it your own way.
Oh you don't know, what they will see 
Absolutely nothing! Probably! 

In the corner plays a gypsy girl 
With Indians and with Jews.
Penny sings along with them 
Though she wears different shoes. 

Oh you don't know, 
What they will say, 
You probably've to do it your own way (oh you have to do it).
Oh you don't know, what they see 
Absolutely nothing! Probably! 
You don't know, what they will do. 
No one ever knows, you don't know too (no one ever knows).
You don't know, what they will say,
You probably don't need 
Another way,
Another way,
Another way.

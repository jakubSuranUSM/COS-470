Good book but you got no proof
And I feel no joy
And I've been looking for my truth
Since god was a boy
Tried faith in humanity no no no no no
But it sure made a man of me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I was headed for an early grave 'til I washed up on her tide
Yes I believe
In Angela's eyes

Skipped on school and I ditched self-help
And I never knew a leader to lead
Eton mess you're a lie made flesh
In a house full of robbers and thieves
No sign from the zodiac no no no no no
And I want my fucking money back yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm a disciple of the woman's love
And her counsel kind and wise
Yes I believe
In Angela's eyes
Yes I believe
In Angela's eyes

Good book but you got no proof
And I feel no joy
And I've been looking for my truth
Since god was a boy
Tried faith in humanity no no no no no
But it sure made a man of me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm a believer in a perfect girl
In a world of brazen lies
Yes I believe
In Angela's eyes
Yes I believe
In Angela's eyes

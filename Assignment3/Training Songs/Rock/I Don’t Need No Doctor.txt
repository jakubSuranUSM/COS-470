I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor 'cause I know what's ailing me
Yes I do, all I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tell me that
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

All I need is my baby
You don't know [Incomprehensible]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Well, the doctor said I need rest
He put me on the critical list
Keeping me safe from harm
All I need is her sweet charm

He gave me a medicated lotion
That wouldn't do
My emotion

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
No doctor
No doctor

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
[Incomprehensible]

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Incomprehensible]
Had a good time
Had a good time
Had a good time

I don't feel good
I don't feel good
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't, I don't feel
I don't, I don't feel

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need

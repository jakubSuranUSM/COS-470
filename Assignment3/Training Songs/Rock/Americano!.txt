Scorpions sting
I hear the mission bells ring
Another night of runnin' is another day 
I don't dance the hangman's swing
All roads lead back to Tucson
Pray, Maria I don't find the noose on
La Policia's askin' questions 
Say you don't know nothin' 
And you ain't seen a thing 

Ave Maria!
I pray, 
Ave Maria!
I pray!

They say the blood is on my hands
‘Cause I put down the money 
And I made up the plan

Blue eyes
White lies
Straight teeth and a crooked soul
Let the red blood and the green dinero flow
¡Americano!

Maria these things I do
Every night they cut me in two
It's in my blood to live for the kill
But God only knows 
That I want to stay and love you
Full moon is on the rise
Patron saint of love and lies
The payoffs and the alibis
Shotgun shells and four-wheel drives

Ave Maria!
I pray, 
Ave Maria!
I pray! 

They gonna find me guilty as a trigger man
‘Cause I put down the money and I made up the plan 

Blue eyes
White lies
Straight teeth and a crooked soul
Let the red blood and the green dinero flow
¡Americano! 

I can burn like a wildfire
Disappear like a ghost
A dagger in my cloak
I'm a rich and gracious host
Don't fear my ill repute
The sweetest fruit is stolen fruit 
And if you're feelin' dirty, cruel or mean
Let a little more money make your conscience clean 

Ave Maria!
I pray, 
Ave Maria!
I pray!

They say the blood is on my hands
‘Cause I put down the money and I made up the plan 

Blue eyes…white lies…straight teeth and a ravenous soul
Let the red blood and the green dinero flow
¡Americano!

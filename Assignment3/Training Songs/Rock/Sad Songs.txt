And the light you gave
You took when you were gone
It's a war that can't be won
With fists or talk or money

And there's no escape
But there's nothin' I want more
But I'd better stop complainin' now
I guess because

Too many sad words
Make for sad, sad song
Too many sad words
Make for sad, sad song

And the night you came
You won me, all and all
And the better part of everythin'
Is born to run

And the price of fame
Is that they love you when you're gone
But I better stop complainin' now
It's useless because

Too many sad words
Make for sad, sad song
Too many sad words
Make for sad, sad song

Too many sad words
Make a sad, sad song
Too many sad words
Make a sad, sad song

I don't feel fear or panic
And nothing brings me down
I'm an aero-spaceage warrior
I can fly sideways through sound

My reflexes and reactions
Are as fast as a machine
I'm the right stuff baby
The right stuff

I'm the right stuff baby
The right stuff
Just watch my trail
When the dial needle flickers

Around mach one or two
And something happens suddenly
I know exactly what to do
My hands move without thinking

And my feet like lightning too
I'm the right stuff baby
The right stuff
The right stuff baby
The right stuff

I never fail
My nerves are made of steel
And my eyes are eagle sharp
And what would freak the average man

Does not affect my heart
Not even if this jinxy jet
Should shake itself apart
'Cause I'm the right stuff baby

The right stuff
The right stuff baby
The right stuff
As hard as nails

I never fail
Just watch my trail

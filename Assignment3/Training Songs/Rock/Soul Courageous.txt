I could not care less 
For oh, so many things tales
Of your distress 
And what tomorrow brings
Alluring you on sight 
I'd harbour my delight.
You could not care 
For what tune sorrow sings

In this battle of ages
A breath of fire would light your pilot.
Are you soul courageous?
A breath of life would make
You maybe see...you bring me to the ground
You bring me to the ground

Victory's in vain 
Unless one knows the score
Inner peace reclines, 
In a place the bitter scorn
Spirit maketh man 
Always at hand
But spirit fails to save 
The ones worth waiting for

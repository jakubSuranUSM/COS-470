You are something to me
But just what it is I don't know
But you do something to me
You're driving me straight through the floor
Even if it should snow
Still I want you to know love love
Come on, come on
They are something to me
I'm thinking about them today
That they took something from
You want it back from them today
And if you want to stay
We won't drive you away
Oh, Jay, com eon, come on, play
Even if we should go
Still we want you to know
Oh, oh
That you are something to me
But just what it is I don't know
But you do something to me
You're driving me straight through the floor
Even if it should snow
Still I want you to know 
Love love, come on, come on and love

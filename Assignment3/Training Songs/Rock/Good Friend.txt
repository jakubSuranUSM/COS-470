I used to think that you were someone else
Then I'd loose my mind each day
I used to think that I could help myself
But its true 
What they say
There is no reason without a way
This is

Good Bye to you and Me
What a good friend you've been to me
And I owe it all to you
Every good thing that I do is you

I used to wish that I was someone else
Then I'd dream away the day
Those dreams have made me into someone new
And its true what they say
There is no better time than today
If this is

Good Bye to you and Me
What a good friend you've been to me
And I owe it all to you
Every good thing that I do is you

I am here
I need to say
That I will miss you
Everyday
And its true what they say
There is no better time than today
If this is

Good Bye to you and Me
What a good friend you've been to me
If this is
Good Bye to you and Me
Well what good friends we will always be
And I owe it all to you
Every good thing that I do is you 
Every good thing that I do is you
Its you

Every good thing that I do is you
Its you

Every good thing that I do
Well I owe it all to you
Every good thing that I do is

One night I was late, came home from a date
Slipped out of my shoes at the door
Then from the front room, I heard a jump tune
I looked in and here's what I saw

There in the night was a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with dad to my record machine
And while they danced, only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song

A-one, two, and then rock
A-one, two, and then roll
They did the rock and roll waltz
A-rock, two, three, a-roll, two, three
It looked so cute to me
I love the rock and roll waltz

A-one, two, and then rock
A-one, two, and then roll
A-one, two, and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz

There in the night was a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with dad to my record machine
And while they danced, only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song!

A-one, two, and then rock
A-one, two, and then roll
A-one, two, and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
Let's do the rock and roll waltz

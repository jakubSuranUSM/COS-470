Black coffee is my name
Black coffee is not a thing
Black coffee, freshly ground and fully packed
Hot black coffee, boys, mmm that's where it's at, mean it

Way back you all know since I don't know when
See I got hungover before I was 10
You see my skin is white but my soul is black
So hot black coffee, that's where it's at

(Black coffee) That's what I'm talkin' about boys
(Black coffee) That's what I mean
(Black coffee) Ooh you've got to feel it in your hand
(Black coffee) Hmm yeah
(Black coffee)

Well you hear that
Some black tea, well it can't compare with me
Black tea (can't compare with me) that's right
Black tea, well it's as good as, it's as good as, it's as good as it can be
But it's a cup of black coffee that a working man needs to see, yeah

In America, well it's the land of the free
You can get what you want if you've got some do re me
Well travelling far and I work like a slave
Now I'm independent, and you know I get laid
I got me a job and I build me a place
I got a spit of black coffee, oh how good it tastes
I said a dime is all it costs in the States
For a cup of black coffee, how good it tastes

(Black coffee) Alright
(Black coffee) Oh
(Black coffee) It's what I want now, it's what I need
(Black coffee) To suit my soul, to suit my soul now
(Black coffee) It's what I want, it's what I need
(Black coffee) It's where it's at, it's where it's at
(Black coffee) Oh

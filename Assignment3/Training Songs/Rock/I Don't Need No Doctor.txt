I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no, no
'Cause I know what's ailing me

I've been too long
Away from my baby, ah
I'm coming down with a misery
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor
I tell you now
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

Only my baby's arms, ah
Could ever take away this chill
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

Now the doctor say I need rest
(Hey, hey)
But all I need
Is her tenderness

Put me on the critical list
(Hey, hey)
When all I need
Is her sweet kiss

He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe
(It didn't soothe)
My emotion

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

I don't need no doctor, no, no
Whoa, my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

All I need is my baby
Baby, please
Won't you please come on home

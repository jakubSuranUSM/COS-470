When I told you I was leaving, you didn't believe what I said.
You just went right on sleeping, and rolled over in your bed.
Now were you surprised to open up your eyes, 
And find that I had moved on.
Oh, Honey your loving man has packed all of things,
And taken that last train and gone.
You can't say I didn't warn you, I told you 'bout a hundred times.
You had fifty-seven ways of being mean to me, fifty-seven varieties like Heinz.
But now I've had enough of that same old stuff,
And so I'm moving on.

Oh, Honey your loving man has packed all of things,
And taken that last train and gone.
I really hope you're feeling sorry for all the times you made me cry,
Oh, you could've made life so much easier Babe, but you did not even try.
So see you around but not in this old town,
Your man is moving on,
Oh, Honey your loving man has packed all of things,
And taken that last train and gone.
He has, taken that last train and gone.

I'm gonna have my own private party 
Gonna invite everyone I know 
We'll all have our own personal celebration 
I'm gonna send out invitations 
To all my friends, your friends, and their friends too 
We'll all go on a permanent paid vacation 
Wouldn't that be fun? 

Fun 
And if anyone asks you I like having fun 
Fun 
I like having fun 
Here we go now 

Well if I was king I'd sign a proclamation 
And if I was president I'd pass a law 
And I'd call for a full-blown Senate investigation 
Of everyone who wasn't having fun 

Fun 
If something ain't fun why do it? 
I'd rather have fun 
That's all there is to it

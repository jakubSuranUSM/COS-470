It gives me Manray
It's what we like
It gives me Weston
Touch each other in black and white
Eia eia eieieia, eia eia eieieia, eia eia eieieia etc

Where did your hands go
When you thought I was your life
I could see his hands
They were touching you all night

And where did your hands go
When you thought I was your life
I could see his hands
They were touching you all night
Touching you all night night night

Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white

Give me Manray
It's what we like
Give me Weston
Touch each other in black and white

Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white

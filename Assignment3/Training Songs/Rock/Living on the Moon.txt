Hard to breath, the air's been stolen
Without my suit, bruised and swollen
It's hot as Hades
He ain't in a moon
'Cause hanging out with you is like living on the moon

It threw me out, guess we're even
Took me back when I was leaving
Something tells me it was all too soon
'Cause hanging out with you is like living on the moon
And there are times where you're the best thing on earth
When the sun comes up we stop throwing the dirt

Hard to keep feet on the ground
Love the ups, hate the downs
If I steer right I might make it to the dunes
'Cause hanging out with you is like living on the moon
(Oh, hit me now!)

There are times when you're the best thing on earth
When the sun comes up we stop throwing the dirt
Maybe we just need some space
I'll leave my bag here just in case
Sometimes I feel like I've been marooned
'Cause hanging out with you is like living on the moon
'Cause hanging out with you is like living on the moon

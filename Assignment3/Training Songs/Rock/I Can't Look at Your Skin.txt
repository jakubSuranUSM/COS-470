You got a bug in your body and an itch in your head
Shooting looks down every street
Hoping there's someone to meet, do you care?
You better start making some changes before they put you away
Shooting looks down every street
Hoping there's someone to meet
Stealing hearts just like a thief
Killing boys with your body

Can't you see in their faces that you
Make them so frikin' crazy?
I can't look at your skin, 'cause its doing me in

Though I've forgotten what your name is, you're on the tip of my tongue
And I just refuse to see you as an atrocity
You better start making changes before they out you away
Are you dressing like before?
Is there another boy to score?
Will you take him on the floor?
Will he drown in your sorrow?

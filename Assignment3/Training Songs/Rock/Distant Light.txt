The man appeared to me inside that yellow wood
I’d carved his name in the dirt, at the crossroads where we stood
He said, “Are you looking for directions?”
I said, “Gee, I wish you would. Which way to the infinite road that unwinds from within.”

He said, “Follow the distant light”
Oh’ you know I will! Follow the distant light, just a little bit over the hill
Follow the distant light and although you’ll never near it
You can travel on forever and you’ll never be back here
I said, “alright”

The stranger appeared to me, he hopped down from his tree
I said, “I can give you anything, but you know that nothing’s free.”
Well I could take it or leave it. I said, “well what do you want from me.”
He said, “nothing much really, just a small token of appreciation 
that would mean so little to man like you and so much to a man like me.”

Gimme the distant light
Oh no I cannot do it
Gimme the distant light, he said through his teeth
Gimme the distant light
I said, “I ain’t quite yet through with it”
As I saw it shining dimly through the branches of his tree, I walked on

Following the distant light
Like the way some people look for parking
Following the distant light, and tripping all over my feet
But following the distant light
And I know if I keep walking, I’ll never touch it, 
but as long as I move it’ll shine down on me

Well, I know my rider's gonna
Miss me when I'm gone
Well, I know my rider's gonna
Miss me when I'm gone
She's gonna miss her loving daddy
From rollin' in her arms

When you see me coming, better hoist
Your window high (your window high)
When you see me coming, better hoist
Your window high (your window high)
When you see, you see me leaving
Better hang down your head and cry

Well, I know my rider
She's bound to love me some (to love me some)
Well, I know my rider
She's bound to love me some (to love me some)
She used to throw her arms around me
Like a circle around the sun

Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
She's gonna miss her loving daddy
From rollin' in her arms

Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
Well, I know my rider's gonna miss me
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
She's gonna miss her loving daddy
From rollin' in her arms

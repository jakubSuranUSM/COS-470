In the night-time bars
The hours go slowly
The life-lines fade fast
As the music plays soft
And the band falls apart

And Jane needs some excitement
Her boyfriend stands tall
For nothing at all
As he pulls her to bed

In the morning light
I was fading fast
Those moonshine visions
Were gaining their grasp
And the Highway blues
Had pulled me down to my knees

And you were some kind of angel
You took me aside
Said hey nevermind
I'll make you feel better

And the morning came
You said I will never understand
Why the midnight lies
Are never planned
And which dreams is yours
And which is mine

I said hey don't you feel alive
When the night-time holds ya
There's nothing you want
No place that you can't go
Nothing that you need
No one you cannot touch

I said yeaah gimmie something new
Gimmie something new

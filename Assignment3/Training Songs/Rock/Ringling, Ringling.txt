Ringling, Ringling
Slippin' away
Only forty people, livin' there today
Streets are dusty and the bank has been torn down
It's a dyin' little town 

Church windows broken 
That place ain't been used in years
Jail don't have a sheriff or a cell
And electric trains they run by maybe once or twice a month
Easin' it on down to Mussel shell 

Ringling, Ringling
Slippin' away
Only forty people livin' there today
'Cause the streets are dusty and the bank had been torn down
It's a dyin' little town 

And across from the bar there's a pile of beer cans
Been there twenty-seven years
Imagine all the heart aches and tears
In twenty-seven years of beer 

So we hopped back in the rental car
and we hit the cruise control
Pretty soon the town was out of sight
Tho we left behind a fat barmaid, a cowboy and a dog
Racin' for a Ringling Friday night 

Ringling, Ringling
Your just slippin' away
I wonder how many people will be there a year from today
'Cause the streets are dusty and the bank has been torn down
It's a dyin' little town
It's a dyin' little town

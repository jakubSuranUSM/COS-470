Wherever I go there's always Pooh
There's always the Pooh and me
And whatever I do he wants to do
And the Pooh and you and me together make three

Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right now

Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right now, come on

Shall I go off and away to South America?
Shall I put out in my ships to the sea
Or be in my cage, and the lions and tigers
Or shall I be on the knee?
Wave goodbye to America
Say hello to the garden

So I see, I see the way you feel
And I know that your life is real
Pioneer searcher refugee
I follow you and you follow me

Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right now

Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right now

Let's go together
In an old starship
Let's go together
Right now

Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right now

Together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Let's go together
Right, right now

Wave goodbye to America
Say hello to the garden

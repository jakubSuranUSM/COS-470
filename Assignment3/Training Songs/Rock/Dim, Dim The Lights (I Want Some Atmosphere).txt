Correction Notes:

Oh, what a crazy party all the gang's here, too 
The beat is really jumping like a kangaroo 
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips 
But now I want to get a taste of your sweet lips 

So, dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere !! 
The furniture is bouncing round the room with glee 
And rocking like a boat upon a stormy sea 
But, dig the crazy pockets on the pile tonight 
But still I haven't had a chance to hold you tight 

Look at Annie's earrings bouncing off her backs 
Look at Suzie kissing and a-hugging Jack 
Looking Nancy dancing in her stocking feet
We're all going crazy with the mambo beat !!! 
But, everybody's really having lots of fun 
But, honey as for me the night has just begun 
Cause now I want to tell you things and hold you tight 
But, how can I do it with the room so bright ?

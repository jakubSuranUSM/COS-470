All the things you said to me today
Changed my perspective in every way
Then things come to mean
To much to me
Into my faith you
And your baby
It's out there
If you want me
I'll be here
It's out there
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place that I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you

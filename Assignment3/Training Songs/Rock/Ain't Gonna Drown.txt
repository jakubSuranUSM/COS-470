Train's coming but I'm stuck on this road
Moon's rising and my blood is growing cold
Preacher man can't save a soul like mine
Miracles are just too damn hard to find

Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
'Cause the good Lord ain't bringing me home

I'm bound for the broken promise land
To meet my demons and get back my upper hand
Long man can't catch a soul like mine
Miracles are just too damn hard to find

Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
'Cause the good Lord ain't bringing me home

Long man can't catch a soul like mine
Miracles are just too damn hard to find

Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
'Cause the good Lord ain't bringing me home

Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
Ain't gonna drown in the water
'Cause the good Lord ain't bringing me home

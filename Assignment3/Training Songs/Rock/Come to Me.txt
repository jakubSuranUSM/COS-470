I love the way that you touch me
Come to me, my love, come to me
I can feel the way that you love me
Oh, run to me, woman, come to me

And now as you lay beside me
Come to me, my love, come to me
My mind is burning inside me
You can see, my love, come to me

It’s so easy to love you
What a beautiful feeling
Can’t help it, I love you
You make it so easy

Tonight as we walk together
Oh, come to me, my love, come to me
We’ll touch the sky and hold it forever
Oh, come to me, my love, come to me

It’s so easy to love you
What a beautiful feeling
I can’t help it, I love you
You make it so easy

So easy to love you (Oh…oh…oh…)
What a beautiful feeling (Oh…oh…oh…)
I can’t help it, I love you (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You make it so easy (Oh, yeah)

So easy to love you
What a beautiful feeling

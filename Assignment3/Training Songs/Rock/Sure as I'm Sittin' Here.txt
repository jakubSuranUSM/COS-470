Get up; ya get down.
Get lost and then ya get found.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

Ya get a laugh; ya get a cry .
Get 'em all before you die.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

Come on sit down, get down.
Come-a-come-a sit down, get down.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

All the ladies hypnotize you,
And all your friends, well they just patronize you.
Don't God look forgot,
Cause he just sittin' here.
I think it's God's sick plan but it's not so clear. 

Lord you get the truth; you get lies.
Get 'em all before you die.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

You get the light; you get the dark.
Fall in love and I break your heart.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

Come on sit down, get down.
Come-a-come-a sit down, get down.
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here. 

Now it might seem confusing.
With all you get, well look what all your loosing.
But it's just life and it just goes on.
So quit with your complaining soon enough you will be gone. 

Lord, Lord, Lord 
Sure as I'm sittin' here,
Sure as I'm sittin' here.

You set the sun, I feel your waves
I look at the ocean, so big and brave
Am I only a ghost?
'Cause what I fear the most is me
I left you on the coast for something only I can see

What kind of world will there be
When I wake up from this dream?
I hear you call so far away
Just keep me close when I'm afraid

And don't you give up on me
As I dive into the dark
Slip into the endless sea
Don't you give up on me
Are you swimming in the stars?
Breathing in eternity
Don't you give up on me

You are the moon, I feel your weight
You tug at the ocean, you help it change
And you keep on reminding me of a darkness only I can see

Oh oh oh ah oh
What kind of world will there be
When I wake up from this dream?
I hear you call so far away
Just keep me close when I'm afraid

And don't you give up on me
As I dive into the dark
Slip into the endless sea
Don't you give up on me
Are you swimming in the stars?
Breathing in eternity
Don't you give up on me

Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up on me now
Don't you give up, up, up,
Don't you give up
Don't you give up 

And don't you give up on me
As I dive into the dark
Slip into the endless sea
Don't you give up on me
Are you swimming in the stars?
Breathing in eternity
Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me
Don't you give up on me

Sweet sixteen and never been cleaned
All that dirt can make you vain
But after everything they out you through
They don't believe you

Like a flower forced to bloom
Before the sun hits the ridge
And here you come walking up with a smile
They don't believe you

How could you explain? It couldn't seem right
But f you stare at the sun long enough through a hole
You can almost believe you've gone blind

But those parts ain't the same
And so you remain
On the wing, as the movements and shadows take out
Everything that you tried to explain

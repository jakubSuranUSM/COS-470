Say Mama can I go out tonight?
Say Mama would it be all right?
They got a record party down the street
Say Mama cant you hear that beat

Whoaaaaaa

Say Mama don't you look that way
Cause I know what you going to say
Well a Mama don't get mad
Your going to say go ask your Dad

Whoaaaaaa

Say Mama don't you look that way
Cause I know what you going to say
Well a Mama don't get mad
Your going to say go ask your Dad

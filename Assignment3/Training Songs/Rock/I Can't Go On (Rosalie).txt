Rosalie, come back to me 
Rosalie, come back to me 
I'm reeling and I'm rocking like a willow tree 

Rosalie, come back home 
Rosalie, come back home 
I might as well confess, I'm blue and all alone 

I can't sleep day or night 
Oh I know you're not doing me right 
Please come back and try to stay 
Can't go on this way 

Rosalie, come back to me 
I'm reeling and I'm rocking like a willow tree 

Rosalie, come back to me 
Rosalie, come back to me 
I'm reeling and I'm rocking like a willow tree 

Rosalie, come back home 
Rosalie, please come home 
I might as well confess, I'm blue and all alone

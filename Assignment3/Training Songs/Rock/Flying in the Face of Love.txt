You must reveal your infinite sorrow
Show what you’re made of and what you’re afraid of
You’ll have to leave the comfort of shadows
The places you came from, the troubles you played on
Out on the landing leaves are descending
Summer is ending and daylight is blue
Is that you rising up

Flying in the face of love
Now you set your mind to run
In circles around everyone
Flying in the face of love
Thinking enough is enough
Before you get too involved

Like this isn’t real, it’s just a feeling
That gets in the way sometimes
Every distraction you can imagine
Like a disclaimer it’s turning you off
Always turning you off

Flying in the face of love
Now you’ve set your mind to run
In circles around everyone
Flying in the face of love
And dreaming of the one you lost
Wake up to barking dogs

Were you thinking of her when you wrote that song
Sing it to me, your mysterious life I’m reminded of
Think about her, and it feels like a new sensation then it’s gone

Flying in the face of love
How much longer will you run
In circles around everyone
Flying in the face of love
Dreaming of the one you lost
Wake up to barking dogs

Flying in the face of love
Flying in the face of love
All the years are catching up
How does it feel to be wrong

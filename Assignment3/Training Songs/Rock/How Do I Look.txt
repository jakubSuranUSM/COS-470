My eyes will barely open
And I can't feel my arm
I hear the voice of the scarecrow calling me
I'm rolling in my bed

And still my eyes won't focus
I wonder which one of me I'll need to be today
Stir it up
Mix it up

I'll keep you guessing
I must admit, just like you
I have my ups and downs
Take a look, can you tell me

How do I look? Now!
A quick glance in the mirror
And then I'm on my way
I think I'll know who I'll have to

Be today
Sir it up
Mix it up
I'll keep you guessing

I must admit, just like you
I have my ups and downs
Take a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

I must admit, just like you
I have my ups and downs
Take a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

How are you at picking out
A face within a crowd
Have a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

I must admit, just like you
I have my ups and downs
Take a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

How are you at picking out
A face within a crowd
Have a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

I must admit, just like you
I have my ups and downs
Take a look, can you tell me
How do I look? Now!

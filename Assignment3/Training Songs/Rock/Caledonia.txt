Caledonia, Caledonia
Seeing you walk by
Make a river twist and shout
Shakes the birds right from the sky

[Chorus]
Caledonia, who could own ya
Spirit of romance
Caledonia, Caledonia, dance

Caledonia, Caledonia
Your simple little greed
Make an inch of a loser`s wings
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
Make a fool right out of me

[Chorus]

Caledonia, Caledonia
You make my senses fly
Give me reason to believe
And I don`t wonder why

[Chorus]

Caledonia, Caledonia
Inside of my soul
Caledonia, Caledonia
We`ll move it slow
Caledonia, Caledonia
Caledonia, Caledonia

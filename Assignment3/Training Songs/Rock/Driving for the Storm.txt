I mean you so much pain...
Forever again,
Why for I can't explain..
We'll drive for the storm again,
Holding onto the scent,

Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)
Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)

I'll drive you sing the refrain..
Forever again,
Our hi-beams cut the rain..
Let's drive for the storm again,
Sense distress through the vent,

Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)
Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)

Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)
Everything gets in the way, in the way now
(Everything gets in the way)
Everything gets in the way, in the way
(Everything, Everything)
Everything gets, in the way,
(Everything!)

Smokes like a man getting higher than I can
She knows how
Ahead of her time but she don't give a damn
Why should she
She looks good to handle from a personal angle
Second generation woman
Last thing you gotta do is force her into lovin' you
No need to
Knows then her time is right
Comes to you without a fight
She wants to
She looks good to handle from a personal angle

Second generation woman

She's a woman that won't let you down
Just as long as she's around
You don't have to worry
She feeds you, loves you, lets you know she digs you
She's in a hurry
She looks good to handle from a personal angle

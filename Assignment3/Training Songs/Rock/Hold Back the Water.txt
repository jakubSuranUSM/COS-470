Headed 'cross the border 
Looking for a place to play 
I left the sun behind 
I don't mind 

But I think that it looked like rain 
Hold back the water 
I gotta find time to burn 
Hold back the water 

I gotta find time to burn 
Headed west to Georgia 
Looking for the road to L.A. 
They say the weather's fine 

But the sun don't shine 
'Cause the smog's always in the way 
Hold back the water 
I gotta find time to burn 

Hold back the water (Yo!) 
I gotta find time to burn 
I've never played no smoker 
You know I've never played no hotdog 

The preacher say 
I was born this way 
With storm cloud in my heart 
Hold back the water 

I gotta find time to burn 
Hold back the water 

I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn (Whooo) 

Headed 'cross the border 
Looking for a place to play 
I left the sun behind 
I don't mind 

But I think that it looked like rain 
Hold back the water 
I gotta find time to burn 
Hold back the water (Yo!) 

I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn 
I gotta find time to burn 

Hold back the water (Hey!) 
I gotta find time to burn

From different levels
Just pieces together
Never had a fall
That didn't burn with laughter
Living it down
Just enough time to revel

All this talk about
The machine and what it means
On the street side walking
Faces wearing different dreams
Living it down
Just enough time to revel

When you're driving the view
The pace looks up when the burn goes down
Time and again when you're driving the view

Another non-issue
In around that commonplace
Free loose dirt
Free the minds of those who gainsay
Living it down
Just enough time to revel

All the hip young things trying to make a scene
Living out forbidden dreams
Star spangled banner flutters in the sky
Time hustles those who wait to die

Come on little honey
Come on now, please
Come on little honey and dance with me

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn, well
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on

Oh, she's a Dior girl, twisting round the world
Midnight crush boogie scene
Firm fixed expression, sensual, tender, smooth
Sexual panther, beautifully cool

Come on little honey
Come on now, please
Come on little honey and dance with me

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn, well, well, well
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on, yeah

Sweet soul sister
Keep on pushing till the dawn
Sweet soul sister
Forever dancing on and on, yeah

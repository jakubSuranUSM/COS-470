You're much too marvelous
Marvelous for words like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby, amorous

You're much too wonderful
I can't find the words
To say enough, tell enough
They're not really swell enough

You're much too much
And not so very very
To ever be, mmm in the dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're wonderful
Too marvelous for words
And you're much much much much too wonderful
Wonderful, glorious, marvelous
Wonderful, wonderful

You're much, too much
And not so very very
To ever be, in the Webster dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're wonderful
And I ain't gonna change

I really had to go downtown
Go downtown and hang around
Was not prepared for what I found
A baby bird was lyin' on the ground

Lying there in front of my feet
Dying there right next to the street
I picked it up and felt it's heat
I tried to wake her up but she wanted to sleep

I'm trying, and I'm trying, and I'm trying
But I can't get away from the thought
It's dying, it's dying, it's dying
And it's something that I couldn't stop
You're lying, you're lying, if you say
It's gonna make it 'cause I know that it's not

Hanging on a telephone line
Witnessing a million crimes
I've been alone all this time
I'd call someone but I don't have a dime

I don't care for boys or girls
I'd rather hang around with the birds
Humans only wreck the world
They'd kill your whole family for a string of pearls

I'm trying, and I'm trying, and I'm trying
But I can't get away from the thought
We're dying, we're dying, we're dying
Our insides are starting to rot
You're lying, you're lying, if you say
We're okay, 'cause maybe we're not

Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh...ooh ooh
Oooh...ooh ooh...ooh

If I had wings I'd try to fly
But they don't make it harder to die
You can take it up to the sky
But no one ever stays that high
High...high

I'm trying, and I'm trying, and I'm trying
But I can't get away from the thought
I'm dying, I'm dying
I already gave away all that I've got
I'm lying, I'm lying, if I say
That I'm cool 'cause really I'm not

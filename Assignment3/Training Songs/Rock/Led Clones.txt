The time has come to talk about tomorrow. 
You should be a careful one tomorrow. 
I heard them on the radio. 
I saw them on the video. 
I don't think I can take much more. 

Led clones, led clones. 

You've stolen from the houses of the holy. 
You've rolled into the kingdom of the sain. 
I heard you on the radio. 
I saw those crummy videos. 
I don't think I can take no more. 

Led clones, Led clones. 

Got to get it on, 
from the still of the night. 
But you're gettin' it wrong, 
you know it ain't right. 

Ooh, yeah. 
Ooh, yeah. 

I saw them on the radio. 
I heard them on the videos. 
I don't think I can take much more. 

Led clones. 
Led clones. 
Led clones, whoa. 
Led clones. 

Led clones.

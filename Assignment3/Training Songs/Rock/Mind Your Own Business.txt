Words and music by Hank Williams, Sr.
If the [D] wife and I are fussin`, brother that`s our right
`Cause me and that sweet woman`s got a license to fight [D7]
Why don`t you [G7] mind your own business
(Mind [D] your own business)
`Cause if mind [A7] your business, then you won`t be mindin` [D] mine.

Oh, the woman on our party line`s the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it`s my ring
Why don`t you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Well, if mind your business, then you won`t be mindin` mine.

If my woman stay out `til two or three
Now, brother that`s my headache, don`t you worry `bout me.
Just mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
If mind your business, then you won`t be mindin` mine.

If I get my head beat black and blue
Now that`s my wife and my stove wood too
Just mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
If mind your business, then you won`t be mindin` mine.

I got a little gal that wears her hair up high, 
The boys all whistel when she walks bye.
Mind your own business blah blah, you sure won`t be minding mine.
Mindin` other people`s business seems to be high-toned

I got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why don`t you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
If you mind your own business, you`ll stay busy all the time.

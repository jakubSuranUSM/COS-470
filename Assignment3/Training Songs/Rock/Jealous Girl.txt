We all saw your plans to win his desperate heart
Hands of slik pulled me and him far apart
The twin that tied each ‘n’ everyone has all been frayed, it’s all undone
In high-heels you run into a night that calls your name. Woah-oh-oh-oh

Jealous girl, jealous girl, what have you done?
I won’t live in a jealous would with anyone
Can’t ya letcha boyfriend be himself sweet jealous girl, oh jealous girl?
Only one yer hurtin’ baby is yourself, sweet jealous girl

I know now even more then before you gotta hold friends high
Some remember what they have when they wave bye-bye
I hope in time, much sooner then years
We can make that climb and dry those tears
And sit down face to face without the gaze of jealous eyes. Woah-oh-oh-oh

Jealous girl, jealous girl, what have you done?
I won’t live in a jealous would with anyone
Can’t ya letcha boyfriend be himself sweet jealous girl, oh jealous girl?
Only one yer hurtin’ baby is yourself, sweet jealous girl
J-j-j-jealous girl!

It’s been three years since ya took my friend he’s been gone for good
I’m just sad that I don’t even miss him like I thought I would
At least he’s got someone on his right
To walk him through the wheezy night
And when he starts to see the light just tell him
“It’s ok honey, it’s alright.” Awoah-oh-oh-oh

Jealous girl, jealous girl, what have you done?
I won’t live in a jealous would with anyone
Can’t ya letcha boyfriend be himself sweet jealous girl, oh jealous girl?
Only one yer hurtin’ baby is yourself, sweet jealous girl

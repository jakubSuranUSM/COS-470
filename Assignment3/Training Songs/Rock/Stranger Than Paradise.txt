My love, our love is stranger than paradise
I've had enough, I can't put up with this sacrifice
Cause I'm a street hero, a street star, oh, and I'm a rebel at heart
It's not you, it ain't me, it's our love baby, can't you see

Why did you take me to the top
Oh no, oh no, our love is stranger than paradise
Oh no, oh no, stranger than paradise

My love, I don't want to keep you hanging on
I'm gonna tell you right now, right now
I'm gonna tell you what it's all about
All my love for you, it made me do things I would never do

I can't go on, I gotta let go
Oh no, oh no, our love is stranger then paradise
Oh no, oh no, stranger than paradise
Oh, oh no

I can't go on, I gotta let it go
Oh no, oh no, our love is stranger than paradise
Oh, oh no, oh no, our love is stranger than paradise
My love, it ain't you, it's not me, it's
My love, it's not you, it ain't me, it's stranger than paradise

Oh, oh no, oh no

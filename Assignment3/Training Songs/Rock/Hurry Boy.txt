Hurry boy, you must save yourself
You gotta leave this town tonight 'cause there's
Something here it's gonna take
You down it's gonna run your life
Don't turn around when you leave this town
You've got only one chance
Or you'll get caught up like the others
In this web of circumstance 

In the town where I was born
There was a lady
Some called her crazy
But I think she's alright
She took me in one night
And was so gentle
Somehow I felt she'd been
Waiting for me 

She spoke of love and war and sons and daughters
I drank some water and I fell into a dream
And in the dream I saw what lay before me
A young girl crying in a lonely churchyard scene
And as I lay there half asleep recalling
I heard this voice come calling
To me, to me
To me, to me
And you know it said 

Hurry boy, you must save yourself
You gotta leave this town tonight 'cause there's
Someone here who's gonna take
You down she's gonna run your life
Don't turn around when you leave this town
You've got only one chance
Or you'll get caught up like the others
In her web of circumstance
Keep on running 

I was confused and felt my senses falling
She did not tell me why when she broke the spell
And in the back of my mind I heard that lonely warning
It said keep on running, don't stop running
Keep on running away
Stumbling out into the misty morning
I couldn't help myself from looking back
And it was then I saw her for the first time
Laughing and crying, living and dying
And then I thought I heard that voice again
And she said 

Hurry boy, you must save yourself
You gotta leave this town tonight 'cause there's
Someone here who's gonna take
You down she's gonna run your life
Don't turn around when you leave this town
You've got only one chance
Or you'll get caught up like the others
In her web of circumstance
Keep on running

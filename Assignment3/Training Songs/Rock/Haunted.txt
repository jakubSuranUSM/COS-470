I hear screams, echoes of the dead
In the silence - screaming haunted by the dead
Listen they're calling me to join them

Rotting away I'm decomposing
Rotting inside slow decay

I wake screaming in the middle of the night
Burning inside I'm turning cold

Rotting away I'm decomposing
Rotting inside slow decay

Skin sweating, my heart skipped a beat
Something behind me something I can't see

Rotting away... I'm decomposing
Rotting inside... slow decay

Haunted - haunted
Haunted by the dead

Rotting away... I'm decomposing
Rotting inside... slow decay

Silence the screaming has stopped
My body hangs dead, swinging from a rope
In the silence listen
They're calling you to join them

Rotting away... I'm decomposing
Rotting inside... slow decay
Rotting away... I'm decomposing
Rotting inside

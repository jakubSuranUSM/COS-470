Fe Fi Fo Fum, I can feel the presence of someone,
Somebody been sleepin' in my bed,
Somebody been sittin' in my chair.

Cigarettes in the ash tray, and I don't even smoke.
Someone's been drinking my best booze, I can tell 'cause the seal is broke.
I left my bedroom slippers last night at the foot of my bed,
And now they're in my living room, and my bed was left unmade.

Somebody been sleepin' in my bed,
Somebody been sittin' in my chair.

They ate up all my food, and I don't stand for such.
Don't tell me it was a woman, 'cause a woman don't eat that much.
My brand new silk pajamas, they were balled up in a chair,
My mind ain't playin' tricks on me - help me! Is he's still here?

Somebody been sleepin' in my bed,
Somebody been sittin' in my chair.
Somebody!

Fe Fi Fo Fum - I can feel the presence of some, someone.

Somebody been sleepin' in my bed,
Somebody been sittin' in my chair, yeah.
Somebody been sleepin' in my bed, oh,
Somebody been sittin' in my chair.
Somebody, somebody.

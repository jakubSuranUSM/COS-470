Ooh-um
I get it darling you are getting cold
You had it steady it was on the road
You're ridin' so dirty, dirty and fast but
You're goin' three sixty right off of the track

There you go again
Out of the cave into the freezing flame
There you go again
There you go in the media, insane

Now is there anyway left to go
The highest highs, the lowest lows
A friend with a doctor, a friend with a gun
You got big trouble, you better run run run run

There you go again
Walkin' straight into the freezing flame
There you go again
There you go in the media, insane

Tell me baby, how's it gonna go
Who's gonna show you the things you don't know
Who's gonna hush, who's gonna hush your sweet mellow

Just keep your eyes on the flyin' sky
You're blind-sided, you're hypnotized
Fast talkin' and riding so high
But the gobblin's gonna get you by and by and by and by

There you go again
Out of your cave into the freezing rain
There you go again
There you go in the media
There you go again
Out of your cave into the freezing rain
There you go again
In the flash of the media, insane
Oh-whoa
Un-oh

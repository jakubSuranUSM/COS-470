Come on

send this song to twenty-three people
Add your name, don't break the cycle
Pass this along by word of mouse
Save the world, don't leave the house
Cause a virtual office in a virtual home
Means you never have to drive through the wrong part of town
Pass this along by word of mouse
Save the world, don't leave the house

pass it along
Don't leave the house

where do you want to go today
Somewhere you can never take me

pass it along

so here's your final resting place
Your heaven is protected by security gates
Shut out the world, it's getting worse
Save yourself, don't leave the house
Cause a happy future is a thing of the past 
And there's always another repeat(repeat)
Shut out the world, it's getting worse
Save yourself, don't leave the house

pass it along
Don't leave the house

where do you want to go today
Somewhere you can never take me

brave new world, population one
Just pass it along

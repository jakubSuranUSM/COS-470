Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely, now that there's nowhere to go
Watching from both sides, these clock towers burning up
I lost my time here, I lost my patience with it all

We lost faith, in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately
Where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately
We've been fighting with the wolves
With the wolves
Red tongues and hands

Falling from high places, falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely, now that there's nowhere to go
Watching from both sides, these towers been tumbling down
I lost my mind here, I lost my patience with the Lord

We lost faith, oh in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately
Where you been hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately
We've been fighting with the wolves
With the wolves
Red tongues and hands

We lost faith, in the arms of love

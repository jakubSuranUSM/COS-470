A brain that never stops ticking 
Sometimes an on-off switch would sure come in handy 
A mind that's constantly cutting up 
And dissecting 
Looking for answers 
Committing murders along the way

Is it the red wire or the blue wire 
Just pick one and cut 
It just doesn't matter anymore 
Or did it ever 
Cause I could never control when the bomb would explode 
Oh god I love you 
I mean forever 
I left my body behind to break the news 
Looks like it's over 
Please remember all of the things I never got a chance to say 
Like you look smashing 
In your fourth grade picture 
The one that we hung by the door 
In our house that was so beautiful 
There in our little home

If this medication upsets your stomach 
Take it with crackers bread or a small meal 
We understand it won't do shit towards the cure
But if you buy this I promise 
You're gonna like the way it makes you feel

Is it the red wire or the blue wire 
Just pick one and cut it just doesn't matter anymore 
Or did it ever 
Cause I could never control when the bomb would explode 
Oh god I love you 
I mean forever 
I left my body behind to break the news 
Looks like it's over 
Please remember all of the things I never got a chance to say 
Like you look smashing 
In your fourth grade picture 
The one that we hung by the door 
In our house that was so beautiful 
There in our little home

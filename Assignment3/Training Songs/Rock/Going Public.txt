She's been dazed
And induced
Wants a part time God for her private use
But she won't take a stand
Cause she might get tagged as a closet Jesus fan

[Chorus:]

Sign on
The time is drawing near
This is surely a banner year
To be a public witness
Sign on
The lines are drawn and clear
There's no straddling fences here
We going public with this

He's displaced
And unglued
Scared that faith in God could be misconstrued
But the cross
Makes him wish
That his spine was more than a school of jellyfish

[Chorus: x2]

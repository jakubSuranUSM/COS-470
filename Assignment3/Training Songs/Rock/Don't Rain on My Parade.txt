Don't tell me not to live 
Just sit and putter 
Life's candy 
And the sun's a ball of butter 
Don't bring a cloud around 
To rain on my parade 

Don't tell me not to fly 
I've simply got to 
If someone takes a spill 
It's me and not you 
Who told you you're allowed 
To rain on my parade 

I'll march my band out 
And I'll beat my drum 
And if I'm fanned out 
Your turn at bat, Sir 
At least I didn't fake it 
Your hat, Sir 
I nearly didn't make it 

Maybe I'm just a rose of sheer perfection 
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion 
A cinder of a shiny apple of its eye 
I've gotta fly once 
I've gotta try once 
Only can die once 
Right, Sir 

Love is juicy 
Juicy and I'll say 
I've gotta have my bite, Sir 

Look out love 
Oh babe I'm coming 
Don't tell me not to march 
My heart's a drummer 
Who told you you're allowed 
To rain on my parade 

I'm gonna live and live now 
Get what I want I know how 
One throw for the whole shebang 
One throw that bell will go clang 
High on the target and wham! 
One shot one gun shot and bam! 

Don't tell me not to live 
Just sit and putter 
Life's candy 
And the sun's of ball of butter 
Don't bring a cloud 
Around to rain on my parade 

Don't tell me not to fly 
I've simply got to 
If someone takes a spill 
It's me and not you 
Who told you you're allowed 
To rain on my parade

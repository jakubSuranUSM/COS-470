This one's for me, this one's for me 
 Not for anyone else, I need it you see 
 I threw all I had into the sea 
 Now I want a little back, this one's for me 

 Lover I found the mistakes I've made 
 Will follow me down into my grave 
 So much has gone by, so many to please 
 Well this one I'll keep, this one's for me 

 And you don't even know what you got 
 'Til it's walking away 
 Yeah, you don't even know what you had 
 'Til it laughs in your face 

 Some other time, some other day 
 We'll sing this again some other way 
 So much has gone by, don't know where to start 
 Well this one I'll keep here in my heart 

 And you don't even know what you want 
 'Til it's walking away 
 Yeah, you don't even know what you had 
 'Til it laughs in your face 

 This one's for me, this one's for me 
 Not for anyone else, I need it you see 
 I threw all I had into the sea 
 Now I want a little back, this one's for me 

 And you don't even know what you've got 
 'Til it's walking away 
 Yeah, you don't even know what you had 
 'Til it laughs in your face

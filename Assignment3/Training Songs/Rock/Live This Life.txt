Haven't you wondered, haven't you guessed
Haven't you dreamed what's coming round next
Haven't you foreseen, master plan
All of this hold it in your hand
Deep inside you light a flame don't you stay
Down just get up again
Can't you hear it, it's a sign
To live (x4) this life

Now there's something (x2) that's changed me
Getting older a little bolder
I can see a new surrounding (ye)

Life's about perception hope that you can see the proof
If you're living in a palace or you got no roof
Stop complaining all the time, go now.

Come and go what to say
Make a move stop running away
Live this life, everyday,
Live on now

Time is of the essence, try to keep track
Once it's gone(x2) it's never ever coming back
Sometimes hard to handle (ye)

Please forgive me for the times when I just did not see you
I didn't realise what I had or what I put you through
Feel it coming, ticking, chiming

Come and go what to say
Make a move stop running away
Live this life, everyday
Live on now

I want to meet my new woman
Step right up and give you your hand
Oh you're gonna like my new woman
Her friends are all over the land
There's something that's different about her
You'll want to be part of her plan
I hated living without her
I'm happy God made me a man

And she knows what she likes
And she knows what she is
She knows she's got something to say
She's more than the her that comes after the his
And she wants to be more than a lay

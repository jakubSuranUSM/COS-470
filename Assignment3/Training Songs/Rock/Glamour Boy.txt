Glamour boy
Get your costume on, you got 'em lined up, waitin' for you
Glamour boy
You got 'em standin' in the aisles so don't hang 'em up

For twenty-five thousand dollars you can look like a woman tonight
For twenty-five thousand dollars I think it'll work out right
I think it'll work out, uh-huh
I think it'll work out
Oh, you never know how to write it
Think it'll work out

Glamour boy
You been tops for a while with a million-dollar smile
Glamour boy
You got rave reviews and you're front-page news

For thirty-seven thousand dollars you can look like your sister tonight
For thirty-seven thousand dollars I think it'll work out right
I think it'll work out, uh-huh
I think it'll work out
Oh, you never know how you'll write it
Think it'll work out

So spin with the archer now, and
Laugh in his face as he cocks his bow
Steal from his mistress
As she's makin' love to your family
And be aware, that there's not many there
Who want to take time to sing and play an honest song for the people no more
C'mon, take time to sing and play an honest song for the people tonight
Don't you want to take time to sing and play an honest song for the people tonight?

Ladies and gentlemen, a warm space-age welcome, if you will
For the most phenomenal group of the century
Ricky and The Balloons

For forty-nine thousand dollars I think it'll work out right

Oh, you never know how you'll write it

So spin with the archer now, and
Laugh in his face as he cocks his bow
Steal from his mistress
As she's makin' love to your family
And be aware, that there's not many there
Who want to take time to sing and play an honest song for the people no more
C'mon, c'mon, take time to sing and play an honest song for the people no more

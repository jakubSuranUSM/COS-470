My baby's got a secret agent 
To watch me like a hawk, 
Well, my baby's got a secret agent 
To watch me like a hawk 

He know each time I leave my house, 
He know each time I move around 
Secret agent, won't you please take my advice? 
Secret agent, secret agent 

Won't you please head my advice? 
You crossed me ounce, don't cross me twice 
I'm going to cut you down to size 

I'll make that man turn in his badge in the mornin' 
I slip around but I'm to quick to catch in the morning 
I'll make that man turns in his badge 
I'll slip around him, I'm too quick to catch 
No jealous woman is gonna keep tabs on me 

Well she's got a secret agent, 
And he's breathing down my spine, 
Yes, she's got a secret agent 
And he's breathing down my spine, 
He must like working overtime 
I think I'm always hard to find. 

Secret agent, secret agent, 
Gonna have a show down before long 
Won't you listen, secret agent 
We're gonna have a show down before long 

I know you pack a forty-four, 
I hope you know just what it's for 
I hope you know just what it's for 
Just keep my shadow from my door

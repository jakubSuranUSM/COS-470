Sally called, when she got the word,
She said "I suppose you've heard
About Alice."
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive. 
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

Grew up together, two kids in the park,
Carved our initials deep in the bark
Me and Alice.
Now she walks to the door, with her head held high,
Just for a moment, I caught her eye,
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive. 

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

Sally called back, and asked how I felt,
She said "I know how to help
You get over Alice."
She said "Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting 24 years."
And the big limousine disappeared. 

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice

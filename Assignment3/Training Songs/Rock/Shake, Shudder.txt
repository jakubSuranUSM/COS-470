I shake and I shudder and I shiver
In my bath while it's cold and my windows are broken
As my poor dog lays a-chokin' on the floor

The I cried to my father and my mother
There's no justice divine
I wonder when I get mine
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of waitin' for the Lord

I find just what it is I'm looking for
There's a man wants to show me the river
Hoofing at five I'll be more dead than alive
I find a reason to survive when I'm too old

Should I walk in the lightning and the thunder
On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky?
Will I find just what it is I'm looking for?

Will I find just what it is I'm looking for

Better find, better I find, better I find what it is that I'm looking for just what it is I'm looking for
I find just what it is I'm looking for
I find just what it is

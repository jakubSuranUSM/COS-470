I'm driving home with the sun in my eyes
I'm driving home with the sun in my eyes
That certain thing that you wanted hide
I figured out what you were trying to hide
You're out on your own

I'm throwing knives and you don't even know
I'm throwing knives and you don't even know

Don't you know you said you never should lie
Don't you know you said you never should lie
Don't you know you said you'd never survive
Don't you know you said you never should lie

You wished for what you thought would make you strong
But now that wish has left you all alone
You're on your own

I'm driving home with the sun in my eyes
I'm driving home at the break of sunrise

Don't you know you said you never should lie
Don't you know you said you never should lie
Don't you know you said you'd never survive
Don't you know you said you never should lie

You wished for what you thought would make you strong
But now that wish has left you all alone
You wished for what you said would make you strong
But now that wish has gone completely wrong

You're on your own, you're all alone

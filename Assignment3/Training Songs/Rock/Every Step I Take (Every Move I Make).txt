Everything I do
I'm thinking thoughts of only you, girl
Everywhere I go
Dreams of you will always follow

Every step I take, every move I make
I'm trying to scare my life without you
I turned our world a ride, but I know deep inside
A part of me was that girl, girl, girl

I closed my eyes and see
A picture of your face before me
Upon my lips I feel
It turned a kiss, you're almost real

Every step I take, every move I make
I'm trying to scare my life without you
I turned our world a ride, but I know deep inside
A part of me was that girl, girl, girl

Every step I take, every move I make
I'm trying to scare my life without you
I turned our world a ride, but I know deep inside
A part of me was that girl, girl, girl
Girl
Girl

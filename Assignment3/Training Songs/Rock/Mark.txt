Mark my words:
Don't forget where you are
Don't forget who's the star
Do you think that I'll go far

Mark my words:
Don't stop if it's wise
I can see through your eyes
And I've left my mark
Lover
I want to swap you for another and another
We could mate, we'll make great lovers

Mark my words:
Don't forget who I am
Don't forget I'm a man
Do you think you ever can

Mark my words:
I think it's probably true
Why you think like you do
And I've left my mark forever
Lover
I want to swap you for another and another
We could mate, we'll make great lovers

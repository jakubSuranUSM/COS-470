Here and now I'm in the fire in above my head
Being held under the pressure don't know what'll be left
But it's here in the ashes
I'm finding treasure

He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making diamonds out of dust
He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of us

I'll surrender to the power of being crushed by love
Till the beauty that was hidden isn't covered up
Oh it's not what I hoped for
It's something much better

He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making diamonds out of dust
He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of us

Oh the joy of the Lord
It will be my strength
When the pressure is on
He's making diamonds
Oh the joy of the Lord
It will be my strength
When the pressure is on
He's making diamonds
Oh the joy of the Lord
It will be my strength
When the pressure is on
He's making diamonds, he's making

He's making diamonds, diamonds
Making us rise up from the dust
He is refining and in His timing
He's making diamonds out of dust
Making diamonds out of us

I won't be afraid to shine
I won't be afraid to shine
I won't be afraid to shine
'Cause He's making diamonds out of dust
Making diamonds out of us

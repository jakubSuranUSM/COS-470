Modern music on my radio
Another station and another show
If only I could let my feelings flow (to you)
When you're lonely and you're far away,
When those steel guitars begin to play
Please don't let them steal your hear away
The moon is melting in the blazing sky
I hear the flames sing, but I don't know why
I hope that only shadows see me cry (for you)

I feel like I'm falling
The music is calling me away, leave today
You know that I'm needing all the love that I'm leaving
Here with you, a song for two

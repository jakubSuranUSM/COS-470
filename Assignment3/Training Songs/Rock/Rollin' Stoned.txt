All right, yeah
Sippin' down, shoutin' 'bout, yeah we used to shake it out
Those days, now I remember, when anything was all right
Someone had my video blastin' through the radio
Neighbors screamin' out "what the hell's going on here"
We were already gone, with a whole lot to go
When the police showed I told 'em "kiss my ass"
So young, livin' to die, and I was on my own
Two wrongs making a right, I was rollin' stoned
Rich is building houses, Gary's doing hard time
Jamie's in the desert and Brently's bought a gun
I saw an old photograph, all that I could do was laugh
And scratch my head in wonder
Where did all the days go?
We were already gone with nowhere to go, oh no
I was singing my songs with a heart of soul 
So young, livin' to die, and I was rollin' stoned
Two wrongs making a right, I was rollin' stoned
It's a wonder I'm alive, can't believe I ever made it through that ride
Rockin' all over the night, I was rollin' stoned, yeah yeah
So young, livin' to die, and I was rollin' stoned
Two wrongs making a right, I was rollin' stoned, yeah
Damn good to be alive, wonder how I managed to survive
Rockin' all over the night, I was rollin' stoned
Stoned, stoned, stoned, yeah
Sippin' down, shoutin' 'bout
Yeah we used to shake it out
Rich is building houses, Gary's doing hard time
Brently bought a gun
Where did all the days go
Rollin' stoned, I was rollin' stoned

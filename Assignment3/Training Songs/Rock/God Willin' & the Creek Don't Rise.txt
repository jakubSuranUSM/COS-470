In the mountains the sun sets up in ribbons so high
It's like I don't never wanna get old, don't never wanna die
We seein' steady rain, 'bout to drive us all insane
Nearly lost a few head up in the pines

At night, some of the boys get to talking up their girls back home
I tell 'em there ain't none's as fine as mine
I can hear old Chapman sayin', come morning we'll break the range
Be pushin' hard now for the plains

I close my eyes, I can see you
I close my eyes, I can feel you here
God willin' and the creek don't rise
I'll be home again before this time next year
Though I fear this fever won't break

All my love

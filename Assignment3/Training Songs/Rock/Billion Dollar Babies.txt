Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover

Billion dollar baby
I got you in the dime store, no other little girl
Could ever hold you any tighter, any tighter than me, baby

We go dancing nighty in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough, tell me
I'm so scared your little
Head might come off in my hands

Billion

Billion dollar baby
I got you in the dime store, million dollar maybe
Foaming like a dog that's been infected by the rabies

Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover

We go dancing nighty in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough, tell me
I'm so scared your little
Head might come off in my hands

Million dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby

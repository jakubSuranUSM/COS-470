Let me tell you bout a guy I know,
He's my baby and he lives next door
Every morning when the sun comes up,
He brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yeah I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
I know he'll be with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know,
I smile at them and say he told me so
That's why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from 1 to 4,
I hear (knock, knock, knock) on my door

Every evening when the sun goes down
And there is nobody else around
He looks at me and he holds me tight,
And tells me baby, everything's alright
That's why I know, yeah I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I call him on the telephone,
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time, I count from 1 to 4,
I hear him (knock, knock, knock) on my door

Every evening when the sun goes down,
And there ain't nobody else around
He looks at me and he holds me tight,
And he tells me everything is swinging
And I know, yeah I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so,
I love him so!
I love him so!

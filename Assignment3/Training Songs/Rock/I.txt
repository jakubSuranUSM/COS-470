There is a girl who wanted to go
Inside the head of everyone she don't know
Got lots of questions, lots on her mind
She likes to look for things she don't want to find

I get high, high
I get high, high
I get high, high
I get high, high

There is a girl who wanted to know
What do I mean when I say hello
She's always trippin' into the unknown
She asks me why we live together just to die all alone

I get high, high
I get high, high
I get high, high
I get high, high

And the sun shines in the evening
She's standing all alone
And the sun shines in the evening
She's nowhere left to go
And the sun shines in the evening, standing all alone

There is a girl who wanted to go
Inside the head of everyone she don't know
One day she shut her mouth, opened her eyes
Sometimes we hang around, check out the skies

I get high, high
I get high, high
I get high, high

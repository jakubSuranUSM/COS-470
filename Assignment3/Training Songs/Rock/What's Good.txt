Life's like a mayonnaise soda 
And life's like space without room 
And life's like bacon and ice cream 
That's what life's like without you 

Life's like forever becoming 
But life's forever dealing in hurt 
Now life's like death without living 
That's what life's like without you 

Life's like Sanskrit read to a pony 
I see you in my mind's eye strangling on your tongue 
What good is knowing such devotion 
I've been around, I know what makes things run 

What good is seeing eye chocolate 
What good's a computerized nose 
And what good was cancer in April 
Why no good, no good at all 

What good's a war without killing 
What good is rain that falls up 
What good's a disease that won't hurt you 
Why no good, I guess, no good at all 

What good are these thoughts that I'm thinking 
It must be better not to be thinking at all 
A Styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete 
No not much, not much at all 

What's good is life without living 
What good's this lion that barks 
You loved a life others throw away nightly 
It's not fair, not fair at all 

What's good? 
Not much at all 

What's good? 
Life's good 
But not fair at all

On the road, no way home,
Guess I gotta keep rollin' on til the lights come on.

I'll sing a song, it won't take long,
Shut my eyes and I'm back where I belong
In trouble's arms
Singing mama's songs when the lights come on.

She said, 'we've gotta keep walking, keep walking.'
She said, 'we've gotta keep walking on.'

I had a dream late last night,
Someone stole my boots in broad daylight.
I put up no fight.
They were out of sight, I still felt alright.

So I walked on, barefoot, strong,
All the other troops marched towards the bomb,
But I wandered off.
They said, 'man, what's wrong?'
I said, 'the light turned on.'

She said, 'we've gotta keep walking, keep walking.'
She said, 'we've gotta keep walking on.'

We lost the highway
With smoke in our eyes.
With these hands and this place,
We will spread our own design.
Spread our own design.

She said, 'we've gotta keep walking, keep walking.'
She said, 'we've gotta keep walking on.'

She said, 'we've gotta keep walking, keep walking.'
She said, 'we've gotta keep walking on.'

She said, 'we've gotta keep walking, keep walking.'
She said, 'we've gotta keep walking on.'

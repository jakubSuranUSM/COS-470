There will be days
We'll be in each others way
Down each others throats
Like you wouldn't believe

But then who was it said
Married life begins in bed
And ends up somewhat disparagingly
You say to me that you love me truly

I say to you likewise I feel just the same
But then who really knows
When two people get that close
That their feelings to each other

Won't change
I'll kiss you and then I'll kiss you once again
And pray to God once we get married there
(There)Just won't come a time

When we'll wish we'll have Changed our minds
A problem to end all our dreams
So there will be days
We'll be in each other ways

Down each others throats
Just you wait and see
But don't be upset
After all that's what you get

When you become part of The Marriage Machine
Part of The Marriage Machine.

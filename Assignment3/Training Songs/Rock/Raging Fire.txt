I can see, you and me
Livin together in harmony
And I say oh its alright
I can hear, you and me girl
Singing the sweetest songs
And I say it makes me feel alright

Our love is like a raging fire
You've got me burning with desire
Your love has lifted me higher
Then have I ever been before, before, before

And as each day passes us by
I fall in love with you again
And I know, our love will never end
And as I reach for you and the sun is gone
You know ill always be there
To warn you, and hold you through the night

Our love is like a raging fire
You've got me burning with desire
Your love has lifted me higher
Then have I ever been before, before, before

I can see, you and me
Livin' together in harmony
And I say it makes me feel alright
Ohhhh

Our love is like a raging fire
You've got me burning with desire
Your love has lifted me higher
Then have I ever been before, before, before

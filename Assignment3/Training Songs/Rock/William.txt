William-William-will you walk me home tonight 
William-William-will you will you hold me tight 
Will you love me William, love me long and true 
There's no one in the whole wide world who can love like you do 
Oh William-William, will you be mine 
If you want lovin', tonight's the time 
Just kiss me baby, you make me thrill 
Oh William-William, just say you will 

Will you William will you take me by the hand 
Keep me William won't you, under your command 
William-William-will you walk me through the park 
You're so brave and I'm so scared, it's so dark 
Oh William-William don't wait too long 
My heart's too weak, my love's too strong 
Oh William-William come on let's go 
'Cause you know baby, I love you so

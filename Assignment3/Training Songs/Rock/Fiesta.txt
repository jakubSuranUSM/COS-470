I am francisco vasquez garcia
I am welcome to almeria
We have sin gas and con leche
We have fiesta and feria
We have the song of the cochona
We have brandy and half corona
And leonardo and his accordione
And kalamari and macaroni

Come all you rambling boys of pleasure
And ladies of easy leisure
We must say adios! until we see
Almeria once again

There is a minstrel, there you see,
And he stoppeth one in three
He whispers in this one's ear
"will you kindly kill that doll for me"
Now he has won cochona in the bingo
All the town has watched this crazy gringo
As he pulls off the dolls head laughing
And miraldo! throws it's body in the sea

El veinticinco de agosto
Abrio sus ojos jaime fearnley
Para el bebe cinquante cincampari
Why se tendio para cerrarlos
Why costello el rey del america
Why suntuosa cait o'riordan
Nor vompere mis calliones
Los gritos fuera de las casas

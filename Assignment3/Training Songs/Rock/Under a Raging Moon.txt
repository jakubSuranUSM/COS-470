In the searchlights
You could see us as you circled round
Down below us you were screaming
I could hear the sound
I could see your arms reaching up to me
Like a demon, I could feel the madness
Running through the crowd
We were freedom
From the moment that we hit the ground
And the wild man, he laid the thunder down.

Do you remember me, like I remember you
In a sea of hands you came shining through
In the mist of time I can see it now
All my life I will remember this (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying there
Under a raging moon, we saw Zion there
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

We were out there
When they handed us the rebel's crown
All the headlines
All they tried to do was tear us down
But the wild man, he didn't fool around

Do you remember me, cause I remember you
Yeah you won my love, when the dream came true
When my blood ran high, I can hear it now
All my life I will remember it (under a raging moon)
For this moment I was born for it (under a raging moon)
Under a raging moon, we were flying boy
Under a raging moon, it's worth dying for
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

Taking me back to better times
We never read the danger signs
Why are the young, why are the young so blind?

(One more step away)
Headlines read like a warning, we're under attack
(One more step away)
I just waved to a stranger, he didn't wave back
(One more step away)
And if it weren't for my TV, I wouldn't know what is real
(One more step away)
My doctor can't do a thing for how I feel

Feels like I'm leaving Eden
Feels like I'm leaving Eden

People are losing their homes to hurricanes
(One more step away)
Old lady living next door forgot her own name
(One more step away)
Teacher is hiding her Bible, but at least she's got a job
(One more step away)
My local Salvation Army just got robbed

Feels like I'm leaving Eden
Feels like I'm leaving Eden
It's like I'm further away with every step I take
And I can't go back
'Cause I'm leaving Eden

I'm going, going home
I'm going, going home
There's no place, no place like home
There's no place, no place like home

When you're leaving Eden
When you're leaving Eden
It's like I'm further away with every step I take
And I can't go back
'Cause I'm leaving, leaving Eden

I'm going, going home
I'm going, going home
There's no place, no place like home
There's no place, no place like home

Tell me you love me again but this time slowly
'Cause you're talkin' too fast, baby, much fast
Come on and squeeze me again but this time slowly
'Cause I like your grasp but it's much fast

You said that our love will grow together
'Cause your mine all mine
But dynamite love won't grow an inch
If you don't take your time

Come on and kiss me again but this time slowly
Not so fast, make it last

You said that our love will grow together
'Cause your mine all mine
But dynamite love won't grow an inch
If you don't take your time

Come on and kiss me again but this time slowly
Not so fast, make it last, you're talking too fast
Honey make it last, oh, not so fast, yeah

Bring the light in through to me, when I’m feeling cold
You’re just hiding in between, climb in through the hole

Things that crawl within your mind, echo always deep inside
Lost somewhere you’ll never find
This was what we said, come back to the web

Fold your heart into the clay, bury all you were
All the things you’ve wished away, lie beneath the dirt

Things that drawl within your mind, echo always deep inside
Lost somewhere you’ll never find
This was what we said, come back to the web

Put your mind inside of me, let me feel your love
Now the sky is all you see, calling from above

I can walk all alone through a river of fire
'Cause my heart is true
Put my soul on the line
That's what I'd do, that's what I'd do

There's a power in passion
That I can't control
It's a natural reaction 
I can't let it go

[Chorus]
I'm a man on a mission to love you
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm a man on a mission 
I can't stop tryin' now
I'm gonna make you mine

Where angels fear to fly
That's where I go with my foolish pride
I got too close to the sun
I was the one looking for you

I feel the power in passion
When it's takin' control
It's a natural reaction
And I can't let it go

[Chorus]

Can't you see what you mean to me?
How much I need you
You know we owe each other honesty
So tell me what can I do
To get to you

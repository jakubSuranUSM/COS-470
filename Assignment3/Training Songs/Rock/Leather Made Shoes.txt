Mayflower was a girl
Who came from my room
With a box of faded feathers
And her leather made shoes

But you know when she goes
She'll be crying
Cause she died all alone
With her feathers and bows

I was just a lonely thing
When I met Mr. Bear
And he loved his sleeping next to me
And in his eyes I stared

But you know when he goes
He'll be crying
Cause he died all alone
With his feather and bows

Mary Mary Mayflower
And John Lee all came
On the day that I died
Upon the spring

The day his wedding came
But you know
When I go I'll be crying
Cause I died all alone with my feathers and bows

Don't you know when she goes she'll be crying
Cause a love that has died is a sad sad thing
Mayflower way a girl
Who came from my room

With a box of faded feathers and
Her leather made shoes
But you know when she goes
She'll by crying

Cause a love that has died
Is a sad sad thing

It took so long to get me back on my feet
It takes so long to find the words and the beat
And Charlie's waiting on the end of the phone
To hear you call on him to try to recapture
But them old records won't be saving your soul
And them feelings got the reasons you know
That you've forgotten somewhere
Riding a train to place
You are out in the cold cold
And it feels like all you'd have to do
Is step outside
Stop pacing around and waiting for some moment
That might never arrive

But you're never gonna find it
Like when you were young
And everybody used to call you lucky

Nothing feels right in the wintery cold
Steam, heat, clang, and the dark at your door
All the other rooms are a party tonight
And you never got an invitation
And you feel in your bones
Steady aching and more
Twenty five years gone just an hour ago
Momma never told me there'd be days like these
Until it was much too late to recover
And it feels like all you'd have to do
Is step outside
Stop pacing around and waiting for some moment
That might never arrive

But you're never gonna find it
When your knees got so weak
But it's right here in case you need it
Like when you were young
And everybody used to call you lucky
When you were young
And everybody used to call you lucky

But it feels like you just might explode inside
You've been pacing around and waiting
For some moment that might never arrive at all
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore
What you don't have, you don't need it anymore

But you're never gonna find it
When your knees got so weak
But it's right here in case you need it
Like when you were young
And everybody used to call you lucky
When you were young
And everybody used to call you lucky

If you're anywhere in Manhattan
In the next eight days or so
Let me know
Speak to stay lucky

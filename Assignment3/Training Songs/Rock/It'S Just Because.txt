Do you ever stop & think why I love you? 
Do you ever stop & think why I think of you? 
It's just because, it's just because 
It's just because our love is true 

Do you ever stop & think what makes me feel this way? 
Do you ever stop & think why I love you more each day? 
It's just because, it's just because 
It's just because our love is true 

Bridge: 
When I'm with you, the things we do 
Mean so very much to me 

Do you ever stop & think when our love will end 
Is it just a passing phase? No, it will never end 
It's just because, it's just because 
It's just because our love is true 

(instrumental) 

It's just because, it's just because 
It's just because our love is true 

(repeat bridge) 
(repeat verse 3) 

It's just because our love is true

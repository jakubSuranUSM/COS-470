Oh I,
How can I go on with it much further?
I didn’t think that it would go any further,
But now it has and it’s making me nervous,
A wonderful motion,
That is turning in your every motion,
Oh I,
I think I might be losing my mind,

[Chorus]
When I hear a melody calling,
Is your melody calling?
Isn’t anyone calling?
Melody calling.
Melody calling (x4)

Oh I,
How can I go on with it much further?
I didn’t think that it would go any further,
But now it has and it’s making me nervous,
A wonderful motion,
That is turning in your every motion,
Oh I,
I think I might be losing my mind,

Oh I,
I just did an undeniable order,
order,
I hear it moving under the border,
Cussing the ocean,
And calling in your every motion
I think I might be losing my mind,

[Chorus: x2]
When I hear a melody calling,
Is your melody calling?
Isn’t anyone calling?
Melody calling.
Melody calling (x4)

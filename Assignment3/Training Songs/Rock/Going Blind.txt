You sure gotta funny way 
 Of hanging on to the Babylon
 Of the always gone and getting it wrong 
 Because it makes no difference to anyone 
 That you had your fun in the burning sun
 When you thought you'd won
 And I like your weird way of drifting low
 In the underflow, try letting go 
 And then you'll know 
 'cause sometimes change is a dirty word 
 When you're in the herd, yeah that's what I heard
 Did your kitten purr?
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 Midnight and hauntings and nights on the fly
 Moonlight on moorings with you on my mind
 If you go a little crazy when the light is black 
 Get on a different track, find out what you lack 
 And you'll make it back
 And it sure seems strange here in Hollywood
 But I'm looking good, I'll put on my hood 
 And dream of Birnam Wood
 You sure gotta funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind
 You sure got a funny way of hanging on 
 'cause I'm going blind

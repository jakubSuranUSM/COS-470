Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sittin' here all alone
Did you have to treat me so bad
All I do girl, is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cry, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried baby
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If it's somethin' that I might have said
Just tell me girl, and I'll apologize
If you don't I really can't go on
Holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the tears from my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, baby
Just tell me why'd you cry, and why'd you lie to me

Well I beg you on my bended knees
Baby please please, listen to what I say
If there's anything that I could do
Just tell me girl, 'cause I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, baby
Just tell me why'd you cry, and why'd you lie to me

If you say don't work today
Just take a broom and sweep away
Those cobwebbs that enclose, enclose your mind
Your mind
If you say don't work today
Just take a mop and with it dry
Those pools of tears that you that you daily cry
Daily dry

You'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind

If you say don't work today
Just take a cloth and clean my shoes
For losers have
They have the most to lose
Most to lose
If you say don't work today
For what you lost was not in vain
And though it hurts it is not pain

You'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind

If you say don't work today
Just take a broom and sweep away
Those cobwebbs that that enclose your mind
Your mind
If you say don't work today
Just take a mop and with it dry
Those pools of tears that you daily cry
Daily dry

You'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind

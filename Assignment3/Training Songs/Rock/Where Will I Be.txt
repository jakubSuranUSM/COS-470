From the Album:
* Naked II

Where will I be
When the sun won't shine anymore
Where will I be
When the moon won't smile anymore
Where will I be (2x)
Maybe there's a place to hide from the frost
A place where life can get lost
Until then the end is near
And the skies will never be clear
Where will I be
When the sun ain't shining
Where will I be
When the moon ain't smiling
Where will I be
Where will I be
When the children stop crying
Where will I be
When the sun comes near flying
Faster than a bird
Is this again the birth of the earth
No place to hide from the warmth
Where the rays can do no harm
Where will I be
When the sun is burning
Where will I be
When man is yearning for deliverance
Where will I be

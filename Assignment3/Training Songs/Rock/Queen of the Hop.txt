Well, you can talk about your Julie and your Peggy Sue
You can keep your Miss Molly and your Mary Lou
When it comes to the chicken or doin' the bop?

I got a girl they call the queen of the hop

Oh well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean?
Sweet little sixteen
Yes, that's my queen

Well, she wears short shorts and a rock 'n roll shoes
You ought to see her dance to the yellow dog blues
She's my sugar time baby, I'm her lollipop,
An' everybody knows I love my queen of de hop

Oh well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean?
Sweet little sixteen
Yes, that's my queen

Oh well she tunes in to Bandstand every day
To watch the kids dancin' 'cross the USA
She don't care 'bout a thing 'ceptin rock 'n roll
My baby drives me crazy when she does the stroll yeah

Well she tunes in to Bandstand every day
To watch the kids dancin' 'cross the USA
She don't care 'bout a thing 'ceptin' rock and roll
My baby drives me crazy when she does the stroll

Oh well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean?
Sweet little sixteen
Yes, that's my queen

Well, that's my queen
Yes, that's my queen
Oh, well that's my queen

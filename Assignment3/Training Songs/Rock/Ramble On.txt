Leaves are falling all around
It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain
And with it pain
And it's headed my way

Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And thoough our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'T was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one 
crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do, no

I guess I keep on rambling
I'm gonna, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing my song (I gotta find my baby)
I'm going 'round the world (I gotta ramble on sing my song, gotta work my way around the world baby, baby)
Ramble on, yeah
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, my baby
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo

I gotta keep searching for my baby (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
I gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby (my, my, my, my, my, my, my baby)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (my, my, my, my, my, my baby)
Oh, I can't find my bluebird (my, my, my, my, my, my, yeah)
I'd listen to my bluebird sing but I, I can't find my bluebird (yeah, I keep rambling baby)
I keep rambling baby (I keep, I keep, I keep)
I keep rambling baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

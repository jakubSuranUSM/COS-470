I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in the fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was one empty night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

He will lift you
Higher and higher
He will pick you up when you fall
He'll be the shelter from the storm
I believe that he will come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds
Loosened the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believed it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have climbed (I have climbed)
The highest mountains (highest mountains)

Through the fields (through the fields)
Only to be with you (only to be with you)
Only to be with you (just to be with you)

I have scaled (I have scaled)
These city walls (city walls)

Only to be with you (just to be with you)
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

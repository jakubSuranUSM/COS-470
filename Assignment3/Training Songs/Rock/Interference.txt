I can't remember my lines
Can't come up with a rhyme or even a reason
I know the face, I just can't erase
But I still can't place the name or the season

You say it's fine, keep your place in line
Keep biding your time but you talk in a vacuum
And you've been bought, I don't know what I want
But I know I don't want to be anything like you

All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
You're a total blank and you're as funny as a bank

Not ready to drop, not ready to stop
Run away or compromise
I won't break down or go on the take now
You smell like a fake and there's nothing in your eyes

Keep your crutch, I don't need much
Just a little luck 'cause my charm is broken
Get out of my sight and I'll be alright
Exit stage right and leave your lies unspoken

All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
You're a total blank and you're as funny as a bank
All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
You're a total blank and you're as funny as a bank

You're out of your depth
Up to your neck in a sea of alibis
Swim or sink, deeper than you think
'Cause I'm on the brink of justifiable homicide

Two dollar spin and your three buck grin
Transparent skin gives away your intentions
You're like a machine that gobbles up all dreams
And spits out shit too dull to mention

All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
Specimens in a tank and you're as funny as a bank

I can't remember my lines
Can't come up with a rhyme or even a reason
I know the face, just can't erase
But I still can't place the name or the season

You say it's fine, keep your place in line
Keep biding your time but you talk in a vacuum
And you've been bought, I don't know what I want
But I know I don't want to be anything like you

Not ready to drop, not ready to stop
Not ready to cop, run away or compromise
I won't break down or go on the take now
You smell like a fake and there's nothing in your eyes

Keep your crutch, I don't need much
Just a little luck 'cause my charm is broken
Get out of my sight and I'll be alright
Exit stage right and leave your lies unspoken

All you bottom feeders and you smiling cheaters
You're a total blank and you're as funny as a bank

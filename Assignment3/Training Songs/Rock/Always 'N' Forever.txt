Staying up, looking at the stars
Making out on the hood of my car
I know this can’t last forever
At least we spend every night together
Gave you my heart, yeah, I gave you a ring
We’re going steady since last spring
Would you be mine, can I have this dance?
I ain’t her type, but she gave me a chance

Gone my way. Gone my way
Gone my way. Gone my way

Laying down with the girl of my dreams
Skin sticking to the leather seats
If it ends it’ll be so tragic
It’s getting cold, here, take my jacket

I’m going forward, I don’t wait up
Who would’ve though I’d run out of luck?
Came around, but then a little too fast
Chill off the love in a motorcycle crash

Gone my way. Gone my way
Gone my way. Gone my way

Gone my way
Gone my way
Gone my way

You say your mind is all messed up
But come on, baby, see me
That should be a reason to fight
I know, my love, you've had it tough
Do you wanna see the city
Cause I could take you there sometime

So get dressed up in your winter clothes
Tell your mother you ain't coming home

I can make you feel alive, darling
Say you wanna take a ride, honey
We could be a hurricane
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Don't you wanna start a fire, baby
You're the only light I need, darling
I can make you feel alright
Baby, tonight, tonight
Be my hurricane

Your weary heart makes me fight
I wanna see it burn
'Til I can see the angel inside
She's a summer bird who's lost her flight
But come, baby, turn
I'm not that far behind

We'll get dressed up and we'll go in style
We'll forget the world, maybe for a while

I can make you feel alive, darling
Say you wanna take a ride, honey
We could be a hurricane
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Don't you wanna start a fire, baby
You're the only light I need, darling
I can make you feel alright
Baby, tonight, tonight
Be my hurricane

You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders
And I know
You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders

But I could make you feel alive, darling
Say you wanna take a ride, honey
We could be a hurricane
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Don't you wanna start a fire, baby
You're the only light I need, darling
I can make you feel alright
Baby, tonight, tonight
Be my hurricane, oh oh
Be my hurricane, hmm
We could be a hurricane
Baby, come on, come on, come on
Don't you wanna start a fire, baby
You're the only light I need, darling
I can make you feel alright
Baby, tonight, tonight
Be my hurricane
Be my hurricane
My hurricane

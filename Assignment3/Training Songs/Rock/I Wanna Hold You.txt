Tell me that you want me, baby
Tell me that it's true
Say the magic words and
I'd destroy the world for you

An army for the broken hearted
Marching through the streets
And every city's burning
To the ground under your feet

I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad

I'd melt the polar icecaps, baby
And watch them flood the earth
And I'd do anything to show you
What your love is worth

So, won't you show me your devotion
To heal my aching heart?
It's like a neutron bomb explosion
Tearing me apart

I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad

Attention please
We interrupt this program
With some disturbing news
A worldwide evacuation

We're going to lose
And they've pulverized the nation
I guess it shows us just what love can do

I wanna hold you
My skies are turning black
(Feels like a heart attack)
And I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad, bad, bad

I'd do anything you ask
I wanna hold you bad

We play the game, we pay the price with luck that comes and goes,
No matter what the Gods decide, we always spoil their show,
Just like when you are finally near the lover of your dreams,
And as you stand there waiting, she turns and walks away;

And you discover that timing is everything,
You've got to get it right,
Timing is everything in life;

We break apart when world's collide as everybody knows,
(We know it),
You hear she'll be somebody's bride and just can't let her go,
So get down to the church and let her see you once again,
Before you know it she is kissing you and throws the ring away;

And then she whispers to you,
Timing is everything,
You finally got it right,
Timing is everything in life,
Timing is everything in life;

Sooner or later all good things come to your heart,
In life it's a waiting game;

When you remember that timing is everything,
You've gotta get it right,
Timing is everything in life,
Timing is everything,
Timing is everything,
Timing is everything,
Timing is everything;

We play the game, we pay the price,
Timing is everything,
No matter what the Gods decide,
Timing is everything,
We break apart when worlds collide,
Timing is everything,
We play the game, we pay the price,
Timing is everything,
No matter what the Gods decide,
Timing is everything,
We break apart when worlds collide

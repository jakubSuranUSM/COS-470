You get me out of trouble
As much as you can stay out of banging in
If you lay in your bed
Put lies in your head
If he interrupts the feeling
That he cannot comprehend
Is me me me

She put me out of trouble
But I could not speak out without judge you
If you just give up
If you just give in
Then you drink yourself to sleep
And wonder where he's been
Me me me me

I do my very own thing in this day
And I can't concentrate
But if you just ? in my ways
I got a desire
You wrote me on a Sunday
Don't you wanna ? if you don't need it
If he only hands around cracking jokes and feeling down
If you push your arms around me ? leave me out
Me me me me
I do my very own thing in this day
And I can't concentrate
But if you just ? in my ways
I got a desire
You keep me out of trouble
As much as you can stay out of banging in
If you lay in your bed
Put lies in your head
If he interrupts the feeling
That he cannot comprehend
Is me me me

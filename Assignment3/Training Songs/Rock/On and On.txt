Sometimes all your dreams go up in smoke 
All your hopes goes down the drain, it's all in vain 
Things go from bad to worse 
Sometimes there's a party but you're not invited 

Your ideals leave you out there in the cold 
They leave you high and dry and make your courage die 
And then you face yourself 
At least a part of you behind a dusty shelf 

Then you face the enemy 
Then you face the enemy inside 
But don't give in and don't give up 
Take care! Don't let them put you in a trap 

On and on, cause the road is never ending 
At least we know that we are on our way 
On and on, no more lies and no pretending 
We're gonna find a brighter day 

Stop it for a moment, hold the line 
It's easy to escape when you are feeling fine 
But don't give up the fight 
And try to be prepared when you don't feel alright 

Cause then you face the enemy 
Then you face the enemy inside 
But don't give in and don't give up 
Take care! Don't let them put you in a trap

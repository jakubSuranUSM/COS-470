Sometimes I'm saddened by the choices I've made
So many tears I have cried
Got what I wanted but the dream seemed to fade
Still feeling unsatisfied

But You saved me
Forgave me
How You've shown
You'd never leave me all alone
Oh, Lord

Every time I lose my place
The beauty of Your grace
Shines a light so I can see
Every time I lose my way
You make it all O.K.
I feel You're love surrounding me
You are here calming my fears
You lead me back with Your sweet song
You're where I belong

You're always there to guide me through my mistakes
You've never once left my side
The way You pick me up each time my heart breaks
The way You always stood by

I'd feel You
You'd move right through my heart
We never really were apart
Oh, Lord

Every time I lose my place
The beauty of Your grace
Shines a light so I can see
Every time I lose my way
You make it all O.K.
I feel You're love surrounding me
You are here calming my fears
You lead me back with Your sweet song
You're where I belong

I will always put my faith in You
'Cause I know You understand
I will try my best to follow You
'Cause I know You've got a plan

Just to have You in my life
Is far more than enough
You are everywhere around me now
I can feel Your precious love

All the wonders of Your ways
I'm constantly amazed
How You make me safe and sound

It's the way You lift me up
You've given me so much
Only You would never let me down

You are here calming my fears
You lead me back with Your sweet song
You're where I belong

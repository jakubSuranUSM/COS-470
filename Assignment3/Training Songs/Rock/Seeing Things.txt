Find it hard to shed a tear 
Brought it on yourself, my dear 
And wrong, yes, I may be, 
Don't leave a light on for me 
'cause I ain't comin' home 
It hurts me baby, to be alone 
Yes, it hurts me baby. 

One hundred years will never ease 
There are days I won't believe 
I saw it with my own two eyes 
All the pain, I can't hide 
And this pain, starts in my heart 
And this love, tears us apart now! 

Won't find me bent down, on my knees
Oh, yeah,
Ain't bending over backwards, not to please
Oh, no

'Cause I'm seeing things, for the first time 
I'm seeing things, for the first time 
I'm seeing things, for the first time 
In my life 
In my life, yeah

And oh how I used to dream 
Of better days that never came 
And sorry ain't nothing to me 
I'm gone, and that's the way it must be 

So please, I've done my time 
Loving you is such a crime 
You won't find me down, on my knees
Oh no no no 
Won't find me over backwards, just to please 
Oh, yeah 

'Cause I'm seeing things, for the first time 
I'm seeing things, for the first time 
I'm seeing things, for the first time 
In my life 
In my life, yeah

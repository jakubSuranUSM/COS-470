Could have been the kiss of my life
Could have been the death of me
Could have been that I was just too scared
To wait around and see 

You could have been a guardian angle
I could have been the wicked one
Besides the buttons on our shirts, girl,
What else did we leave undone?
When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
When we ran
Was it just the time slippin' through our hands?
Right through our hands 

Maybe I was tryin' to tell ya
I'd never known a love so strong
Maybe in the shadows of the night
We just couldn't tell right from wrong
Maybe its a real-life story
Livin' with the sad regrets
Maybe it was just a sweet dream baby
Somethin' that I can't forget
When we ran
when we ran
when we ran
Was it just the time slippin' through our hands? 

You only had to say the word
I would have turned around and heard
But as it is we can't turn back
The mind's just a trash can, baby
And the memories, rolling dice
We had something one time, girl,
But we thought about it twice
When we ran
when we ran
When we ran
When we ran
We ran
we ran
we ran
When we ran
When we ran

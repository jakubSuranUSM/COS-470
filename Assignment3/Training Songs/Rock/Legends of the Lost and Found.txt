We are the lovers
We are bound to one another
By a bond that is invisible
Yet stronger still than time

And we're locked into the motion
That moves beneath the ocean
Rolling toward the future
That makes pain the only crime

Now I know you are the answer
You're the damsel and the dancer
The angel with the devil eyes
That knows about the beat

You remove the masks and faces
And you see the shadowed places
That only witches look for
In the cradle of the heat

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So I become the reacher
More the pilgrim than the preacher
The savage's been ravaged
By the visions of the smoke

As I'm peeling back the layers
To the passions of my prayers
I have seen the ramparts
Where the molten waters broke

Your heart's a sacred kingdom
That has colonized my soul
My past's the shattered fragment
That somehow you made whole

Today's your gift to fondle
Your offering to feel
Tomorrow is the promise
That somehow you've made real

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So l'll sing you every silly, sad
And happy song I know
And you'll open every part of you
That you've got left to show

And I'll pour myself around you
Like the sunshine drowns the field
And in the golden softness we will yield
And in the golden softness we will yield

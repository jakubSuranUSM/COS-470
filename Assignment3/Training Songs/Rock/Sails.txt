Sails are just like wings 
You can fly from things
Run before the wind
Lord let it blow

Let it rock me slow
While I sleep below
Dreaming dreams
That only sailors know

It will soothe your mind
Smooth away your lines
Set your clock back 
On your own time 
If you sail with me
We will find the sea
We will find our love 
Over again

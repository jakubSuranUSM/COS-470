Come on kiddies gather round
There's a new sensation hittin' town
It's moving slow, low to the ground
It'll pick you up when you're feelin' down

He's an inspiration to us all

When all else has been done and said
Along comes Mr. Oysterhead

I remember back in the day
When music folk had a lot to say
Now I sit, hope and pray
Someone will come along and show the way

He's an inspiration to us all

When all else has been done and said
Along comes Mr. Oysterhead
When all else has been done and said
You best look out for Mr. Oysterhead
He's an inspiration to us all

When all else has been done and said
Along comes Mr. Oysterhead

Through the long frustrating years
Of wretched din and choked back tears
Comes a man to squelch our fears
He's slippery between the ears

He's an inspiration to us all

When all else...

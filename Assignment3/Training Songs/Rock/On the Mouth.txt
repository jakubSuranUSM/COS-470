Five minutes on the phone 
And I completely sick 
And I'm puking up stories 
I want a stupid ?? boredom 
Know that I'd do anything for you 
You won't let me do anything for you 
And I've never even been to your new house 
And I bet I know exactly what it's like 
And when we're both asleep
I kiss you on the mouth 
Later on the couch I spend the night 
Yeah 
We're only six more hours 
I feel I want a gun 
I'm extra 
Really extra sorry, too 
Tell me now 
Tell me 
When its time to join the world 
And time to leave you alone 
And I've never even been to your new house 
And I bet I know exactly what it's like 
And when we're both asleep 
I kiss you on the mouth 
Later on the couch I spend the night 
Yeah 
When we're both asleep 
I'll crawl into your room 
Or maybe I'll just stare up at your light
Well I bet I know exactly what that's like 
Yeah I bet I know exactly what that's like

Free let the sun shine
Lucky me, love so sweet and kind
And I'm all wrapped up in you

Love makes the whole world bright
Love changes wrong to right
Kiss me, darlin', hold me tight
'Cause I'm all wrapped up in you

You are the reason that my life's so pleasin'
And gone are the ,lonely days
Hello to you always. You, you are my sunshine
And my only one kind

So darlin', please put your hand in mine
'Cause I'm all wrapped up in you
Yes, I'm all wrapped up in you

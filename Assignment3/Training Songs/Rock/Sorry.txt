Do you want to know, what I think of you 
Do you want to know 
Do you want to know, if I'm doing OK 
Just ask and I'll say 
I'll say the words that I've longed to speak 
Have kept quiet for some time 

I'm sorry, it's just too late 
To get it all back, get back what we had 
I'm sorry, it's just not right 
We both know it wasn't meant to be like 
This at all 

Do you want to know, how I feel about you 
Do you want to know, 
Do you want to know, if I'm able to forget 
There are times, I wish we'd never met 

I'm sorry, it's just too late 
To get it all back, get back what we had 
I'm sorry, it's just not right 
We both know it wasn't meant to be like 
This at all

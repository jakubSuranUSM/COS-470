Color future-vision
Red... For the angry young skinhead
With a gun stuck down his pants
And his hands wrapped around a gasoline can
Blue... For the cruel nude tattoo
With a dagger slashing a heart in two
And the words "I'm cool, so screw you", yeah

I hope we can see there's more than one side
I know there's no such thing as race, just a human race
I hope we can see the world is not black and white

Color future-vision
Green... For the hatred of the mean people
And the victims they mistreat who could just as easily
Be you or me
Violet... For the violence of a riot
And the gunfire police siren
Cars burning and people dying

I hope we can see there's more than one side
I know there's no such thing as race, just a human race
I hope we can see the world is not black and white

Color future-vision
Black... For a black man on a black rock
On a black night when America forgot
To say "it's alright to be who you are"
White... For the white robe of Jesus Christ
Whose message was each one of us
Is equal in the eyes of god

While the rain comes down
I'll make some noise
And when you're watching me
I'll make some noise
Far across the distance
In the furthest of your mind
I'll do a raindance
And I'll send it to your mind
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain

Join happy boy
And settle down
We'll watch the rain come down
And soak the ground
Paddle seas for this is mine
And this is never yours
You will never understand
My mind and how it works
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain

You live
You learn
What is going through your mind
Always
Get out
Come and see the world outside
You live
You learn
What is going through your mind
Always
Get out

While the rain comes down
I'll make some noise
And when you're watching me
I'll make some noise
Far across the distance
In the furthest of your mind
I'll do a raindance
And I'll send it to your mind
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain
Rain

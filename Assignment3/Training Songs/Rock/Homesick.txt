Hey hey, just one more and I'll walk away 
All the everything you win turns to nothing today 
And I forget when to move when my mouth is this 
Dry and my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky 
Oh it was sweet, it was wild and oh how we

I trembled, stuck in honey 
Honey cling to me, so just one more
Just one more go 
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home 
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo)
Oh just one more and I'll walk away 
All the everything you win turns to nothing today 
So just one more, just one more go inspire in me 
The desire in me to never go home
To never go home
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

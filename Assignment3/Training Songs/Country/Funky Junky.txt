You can dance around if you want to
But there's some thing a man don't wanna do
And if you see him comin' walkin' down the street
You better jump right Outta his way
Everyone knows it's a street skit
Every time he comes to town
Coz he's got somethin' in his left hip
The blues down walk around

Funky-junky
Funky-junky

He's on Missouri Boulevard
About a half o' mile south of the graveyard
Better run an leap through funky old dirt
Go one don't find no shame
This old muskrat barbecue
And a sweetness on the railroad track
He's gotta tiger in his living room
He gotta monkey on his back

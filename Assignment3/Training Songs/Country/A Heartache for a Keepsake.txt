A heartache for a keepsake 
What a tragic souvenir
Now I know how it feels 
When peoples dreams all disappear
I'm looking out my window
Watching her just walk away
A heartache for a keepsake
It became mine just today
A picture fades with time
But will a heartache do the same
Years from now will I still
Wake up nights and call her name
Oh it hurts to love somebody
And to see her walk away
A heartache for a keepsake
It became mine just today
A picture fades with time
But will a heartache do the same
Years from now will I still
Wake up nights and call her name
Oh it hurts to love somebody
And to see her walk away
A heartache for a keepsake
It became mine just today

A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me
A big hearted me had to go, give 'em my love away
I give it to a girl that broke it in two like it was plain
I should have known better, should I never let her
But I couldn't break free

I give her all my love so gently
A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me
Bought her everything, mink and a ring, oh, so fine
I thought she loved me so there never was a doubt
That she was mine

Till one day, opened my eyes, plain as could be
My love was all gone, she left me all alone, a big hearted me
A big hearted me, big hearted me
A big hearted me, big hearted me, big hearted me

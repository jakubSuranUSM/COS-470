Call your dog offa me
Its Reverend Luther that I've come to see
25 miles down an old dirt road to see a crazy man
Croaks like a toad
He got sugar, he smoke tea,
He preaches ancient history 

A crowd gathers to hear the man, 
Some people love him, others can't stand 'im
He got a wife with a scar on her face
She pours ketchup on his plate, yeah
He got a dish got satellite TV
He's the guru of the craps town scene 

You all know who I'm talking about
He's Reverend Luther from the Deep Down South 

Well cripple beggars and amputees,
They come to Luther for his expertise 
He like a beatnik from outer-space
He from another time y'all another place
He got sugar, he smoke tea,
He lives essentially ... 

They're hired killers, their mother's a judge 
They come together like a slammer of fudge
They seek salvation and business too
They wanna see what this here reverend can do
Well he heals the sick and he feeds the poor
His congregation stretches from shore to shore 

You all know who I'm talking about
He's Reverend Luther from the Deep Down South 

The Reverend rises and he spits on the floor
He appears behind an old screen door
The crowd goes quiet as he begins to speak
Get out my yard, yard give me some peace
Don't bother knocking, nobody's home
He's drawn the curtains and he's unplugged the phone 

Don't ask who I'm talking about 
He's Reverend Luther from the Deep Down South
He's Reverend Luther from the Deep Down South

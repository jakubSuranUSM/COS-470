Standin' by my window, listenin' for your call
Seems I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know, I wish I'd never let you go and

I'll always love you, deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

I'll always need you and if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I-I will, love you
Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and the nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see 
How much your love has meant to me

I'll always love you, deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

I'll always need you and if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I-I will, love you
Time, like a river keeps on rollin' right on by
Seems like nothin's left for me
So I'll just watch the river rise

I'll always love you, and deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you

I'll always need you and if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I-I will, I-I'll still, I-I will, love you

I used to want to be a cowboy
Spent my childhood dreamin' that
Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
And a big ten-gallon hat
Chasin' outlaws savin' ladies
Bustin' broncs at rodeos
Riding off into the sunset
Like they do in picture shows

I used to want to be a cowboy
I dreamed about it until the day
That a green-eyed Texas lady
Smiled and stole my heart away
Now I'm trackin' down a livin'
And as far as I can see
Right now I'm just as much a cowboy
As I'm ever gonna be

'Cause my round-ups at a truck stop
The trails a super slab
I wear boots up in the saddle
Of my eighteen wheelers cab
Riding hell bent for the bunkhouse
Just across the Georgia line
Where tonight I'll see my lady
And that little boy of mine

And he wants to be a cowboy
And you know somehow I kind of expected that
Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
I used to want to be a cowboy
And all my cowboy dreams are livin'
In that little buckaroo
Cowboys often end up daddies
You know I'm really glad they do

And he wants to be a cowboy
Just the way his daddy did
When he's on his broomstick pony
He's Hoppy, Roy and Sisco Kid
And he wants to be a cowboy
Just the way his daddy did

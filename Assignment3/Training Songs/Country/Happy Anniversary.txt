I've watched the gold in your hair turn silver
And the sparkle in your eyes dim more each day
And the clutch of your hands getting weaker
All these things say it wasn't yesterday

So darlin', Happy Anniversary
You've made my life for me
Once again, thanks for the memory
My darlin', Happy Anniversary

The paper we signed has turned yellow
Its crumbling edges tend to tell its age
Its meaning we will cherish forever
But in the book of our lives, it's just a page

So darlin', Happy Anniversary
You've made my life for me
Once again, thanks for the memory
My darlin', Happy Anniversary
My darlin', Happy Anniversary

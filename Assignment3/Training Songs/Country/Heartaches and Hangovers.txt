Well, tonight I hit every doggone joint in town
And while my bottle keeps a-talkin' to me it don't need you around
But tomorrow ain't gonna hold me no big surprise
I'll have a hunk in mind and a pair of bloodshot eyes.

'Cause I've got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone
Heartaches and hangovers now I'm all alone
Lock the door and disconnect the phone
'Cause I've got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone.

As the days go by I'm a-drinkin' more and more
Well, I like it like that
My only friend is down at the liquor store
I buy the jug it takes away the pain
And I'm a-knowin' tomorrow that things will be the same.

'Cause I have heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone
Heartaches and hangovers now I'm all alone
I lock the door and disconnect the phone
'Cause I got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone.

Yes, I got heartaches and hangovers since you've been gone...

This life is filled with wonder
This life is full of days not spent
Oh I cannot help but ponder
What relevance that lends

[Chorus:]
Oh but everything is comin' up roses
And when I'm pushin' up daisies,
They'll want roses anyway
Oh and everything's comin' up roses
It's comin' up roses every day

I've got a heart bent on confusion
I'm punch drunk straight half the time
I'm feeling watered down and diluted
Still the weather's holdin' fine

[Chorus]

There's a piece of land in Kentucky
My grandfather worked one long hot day
Now it's a flatland blacktop strip mall
Still, I remember what he'd say

[Chorus: x2]

Everyday 
Everyday 
Buy the dozen 
Everyday

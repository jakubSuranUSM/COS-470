It wasn't the books that I didn't read, it wasn't the teachers
Who tried to teach me
It wasn't that varsity baseball coach,
Kept on telling them locker room jokes

[Chorus]
It was Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school she was way too cute
She was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason

Well Bobbie knew her history, Bobbie knew her French
Bobbie knew how to keep the boys in suspense
She teased with a touch, she teased with a kiss
I was three long years being teased by pretty miss

[Chorus]
Well Bobbie graduated first in the class, me I graduated
Closer to last
Bobbie went to college, she got a degree
I got a guitar so I could sing about me and

[Chorus]

Well the years have taught me, the basics of math
Divorce divides, time subtracts
Takes away your hair, takes away your jump shot
But it ain't gonna take all the memories I've got of

[Chorus]

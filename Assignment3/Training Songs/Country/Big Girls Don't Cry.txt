[Chorus]
Oh, mama, oh, mama
Who told you that lie?
Whoever told you
That big girls don't cry

When I was a baby on my mama's knee
She would kiss all my teardrops away so tenderly
I'd get hurt and the tear would well up in my eye
Then she hold me and tell me that big girls don't cry

[Chorus]

Then out of nowhere like an angel he came
I fell for his kisses and he promised me a ring
He held me, caressed me, then told me goodbye
Mama, don't let them tell you that big girls don't cry

[Chorus: x2]

Oh, whoever told you
That big girls don't cry

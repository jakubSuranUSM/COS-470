I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music

A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
I love those bright lights and country music

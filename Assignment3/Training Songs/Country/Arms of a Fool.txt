So many times you told me that you loved me
And just as many times I found that it's not true
So if you had your fun and you still need someone
Come on home to the arms of a fool

My foolish eyes still cry when my ears believe a lies
And my foolish heart keeps saying I love you
So if your new flame dies and you're still burning with desire
Come on home to the arms of a fool

And now even if I'm standing in for someone
It's all right 'cause I'm standing next to you
You'll find an open door and I'll take you back once more
Come on home to the arms of a fool

My foolish eyes still cry when my ears believe a lies
And my foolish heart keeps saying I love you
So if your new flame dies and you're still burning with desire
Come on home to the arms of a fool
Come on home to the arms of a fool

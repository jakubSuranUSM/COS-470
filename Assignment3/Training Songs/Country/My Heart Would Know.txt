I could say it's over now
That I was glad to see you go
I could hate you for the way I'm feeling
My lips could tell a lie
But my heart would know
It's a sin to make me cry
When you know I love you so
I could tell my heart I don't miss you
My lips could tell a lie
But my heart would know
I could give you all the blame
But I'm sure the truth would show
I could tell this world I found a new love
My lips could tell a lie
But my heart would know
I can't fool my cryin' heart
Because it knows I love you so
I could tell my heart I'm glad we parted
My lips could tell a lie
But my heart would know

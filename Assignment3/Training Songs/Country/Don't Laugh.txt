Don't laugh don't laugh
If I say I'll always love you and I will 'til I die
Don't laugh don't laugh.
I could never find another there's no need for me to try
So I beg of you my darlin' please don't laugh if I cry
If I say I'll always love you and I will until I die
Don't laugh don't laugh.

Honest darlin' I'm not teasing when I say you are the best
Don't laugh don't laugh
And if you will take the chance I'm sure my love will stand the test
Don't laugh don't laugh.

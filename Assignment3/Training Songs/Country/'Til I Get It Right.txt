I'll just keep on fallin' in love til I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough
I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on fallin' in love til I get it right

My door to love has opened out more times than in 
And I'm either fool or wise enough to open it again 
Cause I'll never know what's beyond the mountain til I reach
The other side
So I'll just keep on fallin' in love til I get it right 

If practice makes perfect then I'm near bout as perfect as I'll ever 
Be in my life
So I'll just keep on fallin' in love til I get it right

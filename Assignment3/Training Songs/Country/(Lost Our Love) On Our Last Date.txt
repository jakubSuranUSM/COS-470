It's over, our love affair, 
Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
She's gone, I'm alone, 
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date

I searched for a simple way 
To tell her what I had to say
I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date

Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know 
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize

So blind I couldn't see 
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be
On my mind, in my heart, 
I was blind from the start
Lost her love on our last date

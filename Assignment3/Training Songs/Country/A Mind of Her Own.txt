She's wild and she's free
That's what I like most about her
She's all that I need
And I know I can't live without her
To be by her side I'd walk any line
I'm bound and determined
She's gonna be mine but

She's got a mind of her own
And I've got to make her see
She needs a man to be strong
Who's not afraid to hold her tenderly
I know where her heart belongs
But she's got a mind of her own

I don't want to change her
I'd die before I'd break her spirit
But she is the flame
And my soul longs to be near it
I'm making a vow,I'm staking my claim
I'd pay any price,I'd give anything but

She's got a mind of her own
And I've got to make her see
She needs a man to be strong
Who's not afraid to hold her tenderly
I know where her heart belongs
But she's got a mind of her own

She's got a mind of her own
And I've got to make her see
She needs a man to be strong
Who's not afraid to hold her tenderly
I know where her heart belongs
But she's got a mind of her own

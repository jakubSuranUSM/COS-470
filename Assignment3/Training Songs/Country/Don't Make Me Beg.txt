Well I've been sittin' on this couch for an hour
Waitin' for something to transpire
I've tried almost every trick I know
Hell, I've got Sinatra on the stereo

Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
How can I make you understand
Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
Ah, girl don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg

Well, I've tried to let you know with subtle charm
That girl, I've got to hold you in my arms
If it ain't too obvious by now
Honey, I'm just gonna spell it out

Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
How can I make you understand
Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
Ah, girl don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg

Now I don't want to come off like a fool
But girl I think that I'm in love with you

Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
How can I make you understand
Give me some lovin'
That's what I'm needin'
Ah, girl don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg

Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg
Please, please, please, please, please
Don't make me beg

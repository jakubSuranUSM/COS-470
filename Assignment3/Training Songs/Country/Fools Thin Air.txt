There's a sweet dream on your pillow
There's a sad song in your eyes
There's a sunshine behind a dark cloud
Up above you in fools thin air

She's an old friend she's a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
She's a won't be long friend till she's gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin air

Like a lion rules the jungle
You're just flyin' through fools thin air
That don't mean nothin' when you've got something
You believe in to get you there

She's an old friend she's a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
She's a won't be long friend till she's gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin air

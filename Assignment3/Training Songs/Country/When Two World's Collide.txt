Your world was so different from mine don't you see
We just couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide

Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in, wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide

Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in, wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide

Drive in the slow right lane
Cause we've got some time to kill
You know I love this time of year
And you're a strange
Strange find
I want to take all I can from you
Just give me a sign
And I'll be right at your side

Cause lately I've been feelin' no pain
My heart is wide open and somehow everything
Falls into place and it's love

Words words that don't come out
If I'm confusing you
I'm just here to clean your doubts
And I'm inclined
To tell you I don't need any room to breathe
I want to see you laid out
See you laid out
Sleeping on the couch

Cause lately I've been feelin' no pain
My heart is wide open and somehow everything
Falls into place and it's love

And lately I've been feelin' no pain
My heart is wide open and somehow everything
Falls into place and it's love

And it's love

And I will find a way
To bring the light back to your day
And I will show you
I will show you that I, I can change

Cause lately I've been feelin' no pain
My heart is wide open and somehow everything
Falls into place and it's love

And lately I've been feelin' no pain
My heart is wide open and somehow everything
Falls into place and it's love

And it's
Love

Little heart you've been broken many times before
But the wound always heals no matter how sore
But this time is different and I can't tell you why
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry
They say that time will erase all my sorrow
Well I guess since I've lost you I'll find out tomorrow
Be gay while she's with you don't break down and cry
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry
[ ac.guitar ]
A heart that is stricken with hate and with lies
Will soon be forsaken and left there to die
Well I guess that's what happened she said her goodbye
Eat drink and be merry tomorrow you'll cry

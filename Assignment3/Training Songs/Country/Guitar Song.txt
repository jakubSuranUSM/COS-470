I feel bad
And beautiful
In all the strangest places
You feel good
You're sweetest
The weather's changing as I look at your face

Falling
Fall to the floor
Falling
You know we can

Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day

So many songs
In my mind
Maybe less cause I've drunk so much wine
There's light
In your eyes
But out the window it's gone dark outside

Falling
Fall to the floor
Falling
You know we can

Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day

Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day

It'll be alright
If you stay tonight

Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day

Haven't had a dream in such a long time now
(It'll be alright)
It's raining here and all the leaves are on the ground
(It'll be alright)
But I'm safe and warm, outside it's cold and grey
(It'll be alright)
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
(It'll be alright)

That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
(It'll be alright)
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
(It'll be alright)
That's my guitar and I will play for you all day
(It'll be alright)

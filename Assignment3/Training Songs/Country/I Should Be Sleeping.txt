I never knew there were such great movies
On TV at three a.m.
I'd have never guessed that at midnight Tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days I'm all turned around
There's only one thing I'm sure of right now

I should be sleeping
Instead of keeping these late hours
I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
And even though I'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still I know
I should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

I never knew that I was funny
Till I went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl calling me honey
But you did and I liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
And trying to read between the lines
Looks like I'll be up for awhile

I should be sleeping
Instead of keeping these late hours
I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
And even though I'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still I know
I should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon to be thinking like this

I should be sleeping
Instead of keeping these late hours
I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
And even though I'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still I know
I should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

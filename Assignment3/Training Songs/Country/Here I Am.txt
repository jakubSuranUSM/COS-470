If you're looking for a new love here I am
If you're searching for a true love here I am
I'll hold you day and night no I'll never let you out of my sight
If you're looking for a true love here I am
Have you ever been lonely have you ever have you ever felt real blue
Does your heart need that someone who is kind faithful and true
If you're looking for that someone here I am
If you're searching for an only one well here I am
Oh I've never shared a true love and I've never ever had a real love
If you're looking for a good love here I am oh Lord here I am

Oh Mama, I'm excited, I'm almost out of breath
What I saw like tâ€™made me run myself to death
I was on the mountain side when I looked down below
And glory be I thought I'd better come and let you know
That we got company comin', company comin', we got company comin' up the road
They're down the road about a mile they'll be here in a little while
There's company comin' up the road

Well Granny change your apron and Willie shine your shoes
Sally put your new dress on we got no time to lose
I'll go find a welcome mat and spread it out with cheer
I don't know yet just who they are can't pick 'em out from here
But we got company comin' company comin' we got company comin' up the road
They're comin' up the mountain side Susie don't you run and hide
There's company comin' up the road

We'll run out to the henhouse and wring a neck or two
We'll have chicken and dumplings and some yellow gravy too
Grandpa get your fiddle down they might want a tune
Everybody hurry cause them folks will be here soon
We got company comin' company comin' we got company comin' up the road
Let them all shout out aloud they'll be here in a minute now
There's company comin' down the road

Oh we got company comin', company comin', we got company comin' up the road
Land a-goshen, shout now, they'll be here in a minute now
There's company comin' down the road

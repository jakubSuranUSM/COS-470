I never felt as helpless, as I do today
My world just fell around me as I watched you drive away
There's nothing left between us, somehow we've grown apart
Cause I've got through my head, I just can't break it to my heart

[Chorus:]
I can't believe this is me on the hurting side of pain
Sifting through the ashes still trying to find a flame
But the flame has turned to embers left glowing in the dark
I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart

If I could, Lord knows I would spin back the hands of time
And piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my head
Pick up where we left off and make a brand new start
I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart

[Chorus]

Oh I've got it through my head, I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
Just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart

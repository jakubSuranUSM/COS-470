Side by side we'll roll along sweetheart you and I
And to you I'll sing this song as the years go passing by
I'm maybe good or I'm maybe bad but you never frown
I couldn't find a sweeter pal if I'd search the whole world around

Blue eyed Elaine you're the sweetest thing and I love you so
And you'll always be the same no matter where we go
We'll travel here we'll travel there and we'll never part
You'll always be my blue eyed Elaine and I'll be your sweetheart

When skies are grey and things go wrong we'll never fret nor sigh
But we'll just keep traveling on without head held up high
And when I gaze into your eyes your heart and soul are plain
And you know the reason why I love you blue eyed Elaine
Blue eyed Elaine

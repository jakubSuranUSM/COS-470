I remember that new pair of blue jeans
And man, your boots sure did shine
You had on my favorite cologne
I knew what was on your mind

You picked me up in that Mustang
You were right on time
Had the radio on, it was playing our song
We were leaving the world behind

I wanna remember that loving feeling
When we were young and our hopes were high
A heart was something you could believe in
Love was more than just a word
Before we ever heard goodbye

That summer night down at the levee
You gave me your ring on a chain
There would never be another for me
Tell me why does everything always have to change

I wanna remember that loving feeling
When we were young and our hopes were high
A heart was something you could believe in
Love was more than just a word
Before we ever heard goodbye

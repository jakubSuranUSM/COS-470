A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And everything's all right
Time after time, these old friends of mine
Help me make it through the night

And when I'm falling to pieces, goin' Crazy
With a heart that just won't mend
A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And I get by again.

Toss and turn on my pillow
Till my eyes fill with tears
I still feel you so close
Just like you were here

Night time gets to me
When that old movie ends
Then I reach for some comfort
In a couple old friends

A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And everything's all right
Time after time these old friends of mine
Help me make it through the night

And when I'm fallin' to pieces, goin' Crazy
With a heart that just won't mend
A bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And I get by again

Ohh a bottle of wine and Patsy Cline
And I get by again.

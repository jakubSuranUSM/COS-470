There was a little girl I'd planned to marry
This was my love and I didn't want to share it
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn't love me cause I didn't have no money

Everyday I have to cry some everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some everyday I have to cry

I had me a girl I guess I really loved her
Every night I was thinking of her
But you can't mix love with money
Cause if you do you're gonna hurt somebody

Everyday I have to cry some...
[ trumpet ]
Lord I know that I'm just a poor man
But is it wrong to love cause I'm not a rich man
Everytime you mix love with money
Everytime it's gonna hurt somebody

Everyday I have to cry some...

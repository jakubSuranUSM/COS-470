It comes from Mississippi, and down in Alabam'
Creepin' like a fever all across the land
From deep in the Delta on the Louisiana shore
The people got to have it, they want to hear some more 
It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Some say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee
Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953
Just as long as it's greasy, as long as it's fast
As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna last

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Way back in old Kentucky where the bluegrass grows
Through the Carolinas on them dirt red roads
Burnin like a fire runnin' wild in the woods
From Arkansas to Texas, it sounds so good

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

So when the heat starts to risin' and you gotta blow some steam
Take a ride down the river, you'll see just what I mean
The juke joint's jumpin', when that cat goes on
The whole place is shakin', there's a something goin' on

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Time is always new, for dreams to come true
Destiny is yours, to do what you do 
Change is different, but only for awhile
Free will it always, brings in a whole new style
Competition makes, the fight all worth your while
That’s even after, running an extra mile

You grow up, you grow old
Life it can seems so cold 
You shine bright, in the night 
Like a star, lit so bright
It’s your story right now
Say it loud, say it proud
It’s your glory right now
So stand up, take a bow

Raining emotions, may start flooding your heart
Your ego your soul, may feel so far apart
It’s never the end, but just a brand new start
Taking the short road, isn’t always so smart
Dream up destiny, and it will come alive
Happiness will come, soon after the long strife

You grow up, you grow old
Life it can seems so cold 
You shine bright, in the night 
Like a star, lit so bright
It’s your story right now
Say it loud, say it proud
It’s your glory right now
So stand up, take a bow

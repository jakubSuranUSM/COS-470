Don't take all your loving
Sweet sweet ever loving
Away from me
Don't make me start to begging
'Cause I ain't got no pride at all, you see

Don't make me start to thinking
You're gonna start to telling me bad news
I might as well move over
Get ready 'cause here comes another fool

'Cause I'm gonna live live live with the misery
If you do
And I'll have to cry cry cry day and night
Over you

So don't take all your loving
Sweet sweet ever loving
Away from me
Don't make me start to begging
'Cause I ain't got no pride at all, you see

'Cause I'll have to live live live with the misery
If you do
And I'll have to cry cry cry day and night
Over you

Don't take all your loving
Sweet sweet ever loving
Away from me
Don't make me start to begging
'Cause I ain't got no pride at all, you see

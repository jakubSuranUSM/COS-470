Don't look inside
No, don't look there
'Cause you might find
Yourself somewhere

Walkin' 'round
Lost and alone
Without one clue
That it's a long way home

Years and years
Is a lot of time
To drag your heart across
Every rock you find
Hate is deep
And its pull is strong
But the passion's short
Then it's a long way home

I can't take 
One single step for you
But I might just help
To find some
small pathway through

Don't look back
'Cause you might see
Just how far
All that used to be

Just let your mind
Think on what's gone
And then you'll know
That it's a long way home

Yeah, you'll know
That it's a long way home

You'll find out
That it's a long way home

There ain't no doubt 
That it's a long way home

After so many years tryin' to set it free 
The pain seems to fade but it never leaves 
The memories haunt me and I wish they'd let me be 
I gambled on love and it tore me apart 
Be still, be still, be still, my broken heart 
Be still my heart! 

I wasn't born wise but I learned this much 
Though you took all I gave it was never enough 
There was a time I'd have died for your soul, your strength, your touch 
But I'll leave it behind, try to make a new start 
Be still, be still, be still, my broken heart 
Let the pain fade away 

It was the heat of the moment in the heart of a dream 
You lit fire to my soul and you said you'd never leave 
It's tearin' me up, baby, where have you been? 
Oh, please, oh please, oh please! Please just understand me 
And what this nonsense means. Oh, yeah! 

I gave up my dreams to let you inside 
Boy, you sure took my momma's little boy for a ride 
I'll never know how I coulda ben so blind 

Well, I gambled on love and it tore me apart 
Oh! Be still, be still, be still, my broken heart 
Be still, be still, be still, my broken heart 
Be still my heart! My broken heart 
Let the pain fade away! 
Just a small town floozy a 'name' a Backwater Lucy, 
Drivin' me down and down and down and down (be still my heart) Oh Yeah!! 
That's what I get for bein' lazy, woman's drivin' me crazy 

Drivin' me down and down and down and down and down (be still my heart)

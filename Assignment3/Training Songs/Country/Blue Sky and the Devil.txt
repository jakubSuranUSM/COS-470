I'm leaving Virginia
Back to where I belong
I can't remember
The last time I gone

There's blue skies and women
And liquor so strong
Angels and Devils
To carry me on

Come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

Old worn out feelings
And yesterday's news
Just give me something
That I can use

My boots are forgiven
The valley's a lie
And all these words talking
Mean nothing tonight

Come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

I left my pillar
Out on the road
It's a desolate place
But you've been there before

There's a town by the river
It's where I was born
And I died on a hillside
All tattered and torn

Come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

Come closer Angeline
We'll go in the mornin'
We'll be home tonight

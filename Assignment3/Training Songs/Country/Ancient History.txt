Just walk on out the door, it's all over
Forgivin' you is just a waste of time
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

So many times I've heard the same old stories
Why, any fool can learn to read between the lines
But this time, honey, you've burned all your bridges
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

Well I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you leave behind
'Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

Well I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you leave behind
'Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

You're ancient history to this heart of mine

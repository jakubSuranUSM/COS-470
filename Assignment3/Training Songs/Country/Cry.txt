If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotion that you feel
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues oh they keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky
So let your head down and go on and cry
If your heartaches seem oh they seem to hang around bout too long
Yeah and your blues your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Oh baby just remember sunshine can be found
Yes it can be found behind each cloudy sky
So let your head down baby and go on and cry

We got a bucket of Corona,
Enough stories to last all night,
About the trials and tribulations,
Of findin' Mr. Right:
Of findin' a good man.

Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.

Blind dates an' horror stories;
Pushy gals and fast movers.
Let's dedicate this girl's night out,
To big-talkers; bad losers,
It's so hard findin' a good man.

Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.

Julie, I know you want perfection;
Angie, you want a listener.
Lisa, your list is gettin' long,
And girls, you know me:I just want a good kisser.

Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The "I love ya" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast;
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.

Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.

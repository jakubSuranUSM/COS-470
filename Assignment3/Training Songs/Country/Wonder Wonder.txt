I don't know what to do about you
I don't know what to do about you
I learned a lot of rules from the Bible baby
But I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

I don't know why I'm stayin' with you
If everything they're sayin' is true
I heard about you lyin' to your mama, baby
And I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Words don't hardly even matter
When nothin' seems to satisfy your mind
Trust is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you
As always my wanderin' mind
Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you
Whenever you decide what you're wantin' baby
Then I wonder wonder what I should do
I wonder wonder what I should do

Plans don't hardly even matter
When everybody's messin' with your mind
Love is ready to find
Do you think you can make it to tomorrow

When everything you're sayin' is true
Then I'll know what to do about you
As always my wanderin' mind
Takes me right down
To the bottom of the basement
I'm wanderin', I'm a wanderin' child
Goin' right down
To the bottom of the basement

Well today I started loving you again
And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
Well I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again

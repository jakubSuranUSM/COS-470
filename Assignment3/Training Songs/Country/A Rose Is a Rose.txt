You might say she started out 
Without what folks round here 
Call a fair shake 
A little girl with no shoes on her feet 
Tangled hair 
Not a nickel to her name 
And not a care 

But no matter what 
Her smile came shining through 

[Chorus]
Cause a rose is a rose is a rose 
And everybody knows a little 
Sunlight and room to grow was all she needed 
And seeing her face in town was like 
Spring time coming around well 
I guess it just goes to show 
A rose is a rose is a rose 

Tommy lee always knew 
What he would do 
Cause she moved him deep down in his heart 
And everybody smiled at such a pair 
Could they last 
With two different worlds 
And sides of the tracks 

But no matter what 
Their love came shining through 

[Chorus]

A rose is a rose 
It always finds a way to shine 
Beauty is a state of mind 
And seeing her face in town was like 
Spring time coming around well 
I guess it just goes to show 
A rose is a rose is a rose

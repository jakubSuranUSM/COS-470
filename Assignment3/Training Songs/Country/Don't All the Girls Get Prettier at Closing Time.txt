A-one, a-two, a-one-two-three-go

All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
They all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
When the change starts taking place
It puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars

If I could rate 'em on a scale from one to ten
I'm lookin' for a nine, but eight could work right in
A few more drinks and I might slip to a five or even four
But when tomorrow mornin' comes
And I wake up with a number one
I swear I'll never do it anymore

All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
They all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
When the change starts taking place
It puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars

I don't mean to criticize the girls at all
'Cause I know Robert Redford even overhauls
An' we all picture in our minds a girl that looks just right
Now ain't it funny, ain't it strange
How a man's opinion change
When he starts to face that lonely night

All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
They all begin to look like movie stars
All the girls all get prettier at closin' time
When the change starts taking place
It puts a glow on every face
Of the fallen angels of the back street bars

The fallen angels of those backstreet bars

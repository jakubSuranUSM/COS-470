Born to lose I've lived my life in vain every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear how I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose my every hope is gone it's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness all I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you

I go light, every night, 
And just because I do: 
I'm writin' off a letter, 
To keep from losin' you. 
I saw it in a letter. 
Every night you talk in disguise, 
And girl that ain't like you. 
I'm wishin' you'd get better, 
To save yourself some glue. 
I go blind, every night 
And just because I do: 
I'm hopin' you'll get better, 
And I'll get rid of you. 
Then I'll get rid of you.

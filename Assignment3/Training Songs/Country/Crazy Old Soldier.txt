I've had fame and fortune
Women come knock on my door
I've lived to the limit
Maybe a little bit more
There are so many stories
About how I got out of control
Some say its a woman
Some say its my troubled soul

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war on my own
Just me and the wiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong
You'd think I'd give up as many times I've been hit
But like a crazy old soldier
I just don't know when to quit

Barrooms and bedrooms
Are just faces and places and names
Once for the pleasure
And Lord knows once for the pain
I've tried to forget her
And all the things that we've done
But as long as there are memories
I'll never hang up my gun

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war on my own
Just me and the wiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong
You'd think I'd give up as many times as I've been hit
But like a crazy old soilder
I just don't know when to quit

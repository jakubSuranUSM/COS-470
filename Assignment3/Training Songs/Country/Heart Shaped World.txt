This ain't the planet I've been living on 
It don't circle round the sun 
Ever since the day you came along 
Everything I do revolves around you 
You're my only one 

Cause I'm waking up to love; I'm crossing new frontiers 
Living in a heart shaped world 
And I'm starting to see that we could stay forever here 
Living in a heart shaped world 

Now everybody knows the earth is round 
Chris Columbus showed us that 
Call me crazy but I think I've found 
A reason to believe, maybe history 
Should review the facts 

Now I'm waking up to love; I'm crossing new frontiers 
Living in a heart shaped world 
And I'm starting to see that we could stay forever here 
Living in a heart shaped world 

I've heard that love can turn your world around 
But you have changed the shape of my world somehow 
Everything I do revolves around you 
Now I'm waking up to love; I'm crossing new frontiers 
Living in a heart shaped world 
And I'm starting to see that we could stay forever here 
Living in a heart shaped world

Words are sometimes funny
They can change the way you feel
I've seen ?em break a heart, save a soul
And make a grown man kneel
(Now) I don't want to sound like I'm the fumblin' fool
But I can't find the right ones
To tell you the truth

I could tell you that I know you
I could tell you that I care
Or that my heart broke down and told me
Where we go from here
No way to tell you what I'm feelin'
In a way you've never heard
So I'll just say I love you 
For a lack of better words

Let me try another way to explain it more or less
To say my heart is only yours
Is only close at best
There's feelings deep inside me
No words could ever touch
So no matter what I try to say
It's just not enough

I could say we'll stay together
And you'll always hold my heart
Make a promise on forever
But that's just a start
There's no way to tell you what I'm feelin'
In a way you've never heard
So I'll just say I love you
For a lack of better words

The song's a thing and this one's thin
From traveling light, the stars at night
Have seen old time to new erosion
Old time gone with old religions
Prickled interest seizing pride
The night the music upped and died, died
Been listening all the night long
Been listening all the day
Will I listen for the one you know?
Will I listen, will I pray?
It's a-coming all the night long
It's a-coming in the day
It's blowing through my stone ears
Whistling its way
Left the song behind old chums
The faintest trace of what's to come
What's behind and what is near
Banished by a suckling ear
Coffee luster, lend me mine
Nothing came with beer and wine, wine
Been listening all the night long
Been listening all the day
Will I listen for the one you know?
Will I listen, will I pray?
It's a-coming all the night long
It's a-coming in the day
It's blowing through my stone ears
Whistling its way
The music's gone, the music's dead
The music went and in its stead
A single song, a chorus strong
A symphony, sans right or wrong
The band's rehearsing, the radio's off
The silence is everything, hold that cough
Been listening all the night long
Been listening all the day
Will I listen to the one you know?
Will I listen, will I pray?
It's a-coming all the night long
It's a-coming in the day
It's blowing through my stone ears
Whistling its way

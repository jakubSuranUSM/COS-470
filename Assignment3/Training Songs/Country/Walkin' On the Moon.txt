The lights of the town were just shutting down
The sun was fresh on the rise
I met momma at the door, she'd been walking the floor
She said boy, you've got stars in your eyes
And momma I was walking on the moon last night
And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright
I was walking on the moon last night

Now momma she did weep, boy you've been walking in your sleep
You can't keep your feet on the ground
It's not always what it seems, young love may be a dream
And some angels fly high just to fall down

But momma I was walking on the moon last night
And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright
I was walking on the moon last night

Now the lights of the town are glowing yellow brown
The moon is beginning to rise
And I left momma at the door, I said don't worry any more
I've seen daddy put those same stars in your eyes

And momma I'll be walking on the moon tonight
And two loving arms will hold me tight
As the stars dance around so bright
I'll be walking on the moon tonight

And I'll be walking on the moon tonight
And two loving arms will hold me tight
As the stars dance around so bright
I'll be walking on the moon tonight

This fire is nice
But so are your eyes
They twinkle when you smile
Ain't felt this warm in a while
That northern star
Shines straight from your heart
Your looks are evergreen 
Sweet as the angels as they sing

You look good in the light of my Christmas tree 
So good you and the mistletoe and me
So nice you are my sunshine over a field of snow 
And I love to watch you glow

You're at the top of my list
Followed up with your caramel kiss
Nothin' could ever compare to this feelin' in the air 

You look good in the light of my Christmas tree
So good you and the mistletoe and me
So nice you are my sunshine over a field of snow
And I love to watch you glow (bring on the light, let's go)

Pour on the bourbon it's gettin' late
Let's melt all the frost on the window pane
Let's never let this moment slip away
Just stay, just stay

You look good in the light of my Christmas tree
You and the mistletoe and me 
You are my sunshine over a field of snow
And I love to watch you glow
Come on, just glow
Come on and glow, just glow

You look good in the light of my Christmas tree 
You and the mistletoe and me
So nice you are my sunshine over a field of snow
And I love to watch you glow 
I love to watch you glow 
I love to watch you glow
Come on and glow (do this for me right here, come on)
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

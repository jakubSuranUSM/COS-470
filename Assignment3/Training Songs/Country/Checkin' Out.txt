How many butts can you fit in the backseat?
How many cans can you throw in a floorboard
Mama's credit card and your brother's I.D.
6 Bodies, one big good lord

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, soft green light
White can mirror light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole train
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gives you a headache
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

Alabama baby pulling up in a black Jeep
Two Georgia boys holler hey what's up
Parking lot, piggy back burn the bare feet
They're coming in, have somebody
Let's get the door

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, soft green light
White can mirror light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole train
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gives you a headache
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

All the bars and cars up and down the beach
Checkin' in with your mama now and then knowing she can't sleep, hey
Yeah, hold it down
Hey mama, yeah, I'm being good
No, we ain't partying, it's the TV

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, soft green light
White can mirror light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, my little shot girl
Gimme the whole train
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gives you a headache
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out
Checkin' out

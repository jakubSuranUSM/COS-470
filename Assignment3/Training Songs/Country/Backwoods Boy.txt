Woke up at 5am, an put on my camouflage
Wiped off my .243 and fired up my Dodge
Headed out to my ol' deer stand back in the pines
Gonna get me a ten point buck with 11 inch tines, yeah

Settled in hidin' from the wind, 
Waitin' on the sun
You might end up being my supper 
If you get in the way of my gun
It's so still I can hear the train
From 10 miles away
If I'm here 8 hours from now 
It'll be OK, yeah

Cause I'm a backwoods boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a backwoods boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
Cause I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy

Sittin' on the bank of Lynches
River with a little campfire
Sleepin' on the ground, diggin' the
Sound of a backwoods choir
Talkin' to the man in the moon
Way up in the sky
He told me to let my worries
Roll on by, yeah

Cause I'm a backwoods boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a backwoods boy
With no better place to go
Waitin' on a deer, wishin' on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
Cause I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy

I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy
Backwoods boy
Mm
I'm a backwoods boy

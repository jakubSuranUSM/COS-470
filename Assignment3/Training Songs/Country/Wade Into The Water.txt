I want to go deep down yeh
I want to go deep down yeh
â??Cause I remember

Met down by the river, the blue moon on the rise
I broke down like Brando moved by your Marilyn Monroe eyes
We were swimmin' in silver, we were searchin' for gold
And we promised that night that we would never grow old

And you sang to me
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you to the bottom of my heart

We got brighter than heaven, Lord yeah, we shone like the stars
I got as drunk as Bogart, you were just smokin' like Bacall
We were diggin' for diamonds, we were divin' for pearls
Higher up than the satellites and out of this world

And you sang to me
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, 'cause I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, gotta let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you to the bottom of my heart

Now the river is frozen, the blue moon is down
My drink has run dry, Lord ya cigarettes gone out
All the diamonds and the pearls, yeah all the silver and the gold
They were all turned to dust, yeah it's so cold

Singin' it
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, 'cause I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, gotta let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you, I will take you there

So
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, 'cause I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, gotta let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you to the bottom of my heart

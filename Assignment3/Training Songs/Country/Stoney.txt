I've noticed since we both were kids
I recall the silly things we did
She would want to ride upon my back
To keep from stepping on a crack

I didn't think of it back then
But even when she did not win
She was happy just to play
Stoney liked to live out every day

[Chorus]
Stoney, happy all the time
Stoney, liked the summertime
The joy you find in living every day
Stoney, how I love your simple ways

The times when no one understood life
Seems that Stoney always would
We'd walk for hours in the sand
She would always try and hold my hand

[Chorus]

No, I don't recollect the time
I fell in love with this old friend of mine
Or when I first saw in her eyes
What she tried so not to hide

[Chorus: x3]

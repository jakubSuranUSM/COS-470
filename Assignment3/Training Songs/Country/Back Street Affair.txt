You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me
And with all your young heart you learned to care
It brought you shame and disgrace, the world has tumbled in your place
Because they call our love a back street affair

They say you wrecked my home, I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear
For the one that I'm tied to was the first to be untrue
And yet they call our love a back street affair

We have each other now, that's all that matters anyhow
Why the judgment of gossip's never fair
We'll just be brave and strong, then someday they'll see they're wrong
So let them call our love a back street affair

We'll be free to love someday when all the talk has died away
And the happiness we've hoped for then we'll share
I'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cry
That our love is not a back street affair

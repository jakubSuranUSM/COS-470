And his love will be his vision,
And he'll take you where you stand.
And will you stand your life by his,
And help the boy become a man? 

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Teachin' love and honesty,
An' bein' his own manhandler.
Or the son of,
The son of a run of the mill,
Run rotten gambler?

Will the devil be getting to you,
As you look back over what you've done?
And what you've done: was it for reason or for rhyme?
Was it just for fun?

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Teachin' love and honesty,
An' bein' his own manhandler.
Or the son of,
The son of a run of the mill,
Run rotten gambler?

Back on the road now, you can lose your head.
There ain't no kingdom for the gamblin' man.
You know the road now and you've made your stand.
When his eyes shine upon you, shine upon you.

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Teachin' love and honesty,
An' bein' his own manhandler.
Or the son of,
The son of a run of the mill,
Run rotten gambler?

Will he be the son of his father?
His father, the teacher?
Or the son of a rotten gambler?
Son of a rotten gambler?
Son of a rotten gambler?
Son of a rotten gambler?
Son of a rotten gambler?
The son of a rotten gambler?
The son of a rotten gambler?.

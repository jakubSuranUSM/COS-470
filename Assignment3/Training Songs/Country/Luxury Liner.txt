Well a luxury liner, forty tons of steel
If I don't find my baby now then I guess I never will

I've been a long lost soul for a long long time
I've been around, everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome?
So do I, so do I

Well I'm the kind of guy that likes to make a livin' runnin' 'round
And I don't need a stranger to tell me that my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome?
So do I, so do I

Well a luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world can change the way I feel

I've been a long lost soul for a long long time
I've been around, everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome?
So do I, so do I

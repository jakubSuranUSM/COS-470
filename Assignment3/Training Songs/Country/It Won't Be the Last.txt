The first time I laid eyes on you I knew it must be love
From the moment you first spoke to me you were all I could think of
The first time we were together oh the time just went so fast
I recall when you first kissed me I said it won't be the last

[Chorus]
Now it's the first time that I call our house to find out it's unplugged
It's the first time I reach out for you but you're not there to find
And it's the first time that I call your name to realize it was the past
It's the first time that you broke my heart but it won't be the last

When I think back on yesterday being in your loving arms
Like the dreams that we let slip away the memories live on
And I pray to God for answers to all the questions that I have
Another night of missing you but it won't be the last

[Chorus]

It's the first time that you broke my heart but it won't be the last

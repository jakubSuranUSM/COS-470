We met in a honkey tonk with sawdust on the floor
But I'm not supposed to hang out there anymore
You fell in love with a side of me that you called wild and free
Now that's not the way you want me to be

It must be nice to walk the straight and narrow
See in black and white true as an arrow
Out here on the edge is where I belong
Walkin' that fine line between ragged and wrong

I know you think that you can manke somebody out of me
But the good Lord did that job already, can't you see
I'm sorry if my rebel ways don't fit into your plan
But I kinda like me fine the way I am

It must be nice to walk the straight and narrow
See in black and white true as an arrow
Out here on the edge is where I belong
Walkin' that fine line between ragged and wrong

I've got my own way of bein' true
I've got my own way of lovin' you
If that ain't enough it'll have to do

It must be nice to walk the straight and narrow
See in black and white true as an arrow
Out here on the edge is where I belong
Walkin' that fine line between ragged and wrong
Walkin' that fine line between ragged and wrong

Between ragged and wrong
Between ragged and wrong
Between ragged and wrong
Between ragged and wrong

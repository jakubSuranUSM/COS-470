He's got thirteen channels of wrestling comin' in strong from a satellite send
A two hundred function remote control big screen TV with stereo
Football baseball nascar too with picture in a picture it's all in view

And if it comes on just a little too late with his VCR's he'll get it on tape
He's a high-tech redneck Mayberry meets Startrek
He's a bumpkin' but he's plugged in he's a high-tech redneck

He's got twenty sub-woofers in the back of his truck
A thousand watts of power and he keeps it cranked up
He ain't into hip hop he ain't into rap
He likes to rattle them speakers with Ronnie Milsap

CD cassette digital tape CB radar and scannin' short wave
And if he needs to talk to his honey at home

He just dials up her number on his cellular phone
He's a high-tech redneck...
He's a high-tech redneck...

Sometimes we fight
'Bout who's wrong and right
And stay up all night
Sometimes we drink
And say hurtful things
We don't mean

Yeah, we're both screamin'
But nobody's listenin'
Let's take this madness
Out of the kitchen

Come to bed
Let's just lay down
There's just one way
We're gonna work this out
Forget what I did
Forget what you said
Oh, darlin'
Come to bed

Well, I love you
You know I do
You love me too
So let's just stop
Remember what we've got
Before it all gets lost

Just take my hand
It's been way too long
Turn out the lights
And turn each other on

Come to bed
Let's just lay down
There's just one way
We're gonna work this out
Forget what I did
Forget what you said
Oh, darlin' (darlin')
Come to bed

[Bridge]
(And let's put aside our pride
For feelings for tonight)
In the mornin' we'll see things
In a different light

Just come to bed
Let's just lay down
There's just one way
We're gonna work it out
Forget what I did
Forget what you said
Oh, darlin' (darlin')
Come to bed

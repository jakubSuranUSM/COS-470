Well, here we are again
The same old shape we're in
Are we in love again?
Or have we always been?

Did we learn nothing new
From all that we went through?
Or was is worth the same
To do again?

Did you find someone who
Made you forget the past?
Or anything you thought
Might have a chance to last?

So here we are again
Ain't we a sight again
Is this a dream we're in?
Or is it love?

Did you find someone who
Made you forget the past?
Or anything you thought
Might have a chance to last?

So here we are again
Ain't we a sight again?
Is this a dream we're in?
Or is it love?
Well, here we are again

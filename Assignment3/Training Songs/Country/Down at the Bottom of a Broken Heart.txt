I was sitting on top of the world
Deep in love with a blue-eyed girl
But the blue-eyed girl told me goodbye
I fell like rain drops out of the sky

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

I took my love for Sally Ann
And I buried if deeper than a chinaman
Where no one goes and no one can see
There ain't nobody here but me

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

One day true love's gonna set me free
But till then i'll be here deep in misery

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

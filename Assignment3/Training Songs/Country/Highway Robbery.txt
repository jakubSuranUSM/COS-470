Ok officer, I admit it, 
I was speedin'
But before you write me up 
Let me tell you the reason.
I wasn't tryin' to out run you,
I was chasin' a guy who outta the blue,
He committed a crime back about a mile or two.
I was crusin' along, 
When he pulled up outta no where.
He was hotter than the truck he drove, 
And just one lane over.
He aimed those angel eyes at me, 
Smiled like we were meant to be.
'For he stole my heart from a moving car.

[Chorus:]
It was highway robbery, 
He grabbed my heart and took off on the run. 
It was highway robbery, he oughta do time in my arms 
For what he's done.

So, hey officer, how 'bout you understandin', 
Won't you turn your blue light on 
And help me catch that bandit.
He's got somethin' that belongs to T. 
I can't let him get away scott free, 
For it's only right that he's mine tonight.

[Chorus x2]

He ought to do time in my arms for what he' done.
(Spoken)
Hey officer
Lets talk 'bout this,now 
By the time you let me go 
That boy'll be all the way in Texas
Sure is good lookin'
By the way,
What color are your eyes?

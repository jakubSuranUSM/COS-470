I can be high as a bluebird flies if you'd love me
A mountain of love and the clear sky above me are all I'd see
Oceans and valleys and canyons and streams
So far below a river of dreams keeps haunting me
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
When I look in your eyes you're all that I see

I could be high, so high
High, so high
I could be string as a river is long if you love me
Sweet harmony pouring all over me like a waterfall
I could be everything money can't buy
A rainbow at sunset a tear in your eye when you are blue
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
When I look in your eyes you're all that I see

I could be high, so high
High, so high

You're an angel from heaven sent down from above
To answer my dreams and feel them with love
You're everything
I could be high as a bluebird flies and never tell lies
When I look in your eyes you're all that I see

I could be high, so high
High, so high

I could be high as a bluebird flies and never
Tell lies when I look in your eyes you're all that I see

I could be high, high, high, as the bluebird flies

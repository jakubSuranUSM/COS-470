Every night I stand there in the crowd and watch him playing 
So turned on by his love song that I wish he only knew 
If he played me like he played his old guitar he's always strumming 
Ran his fingers through my hair I'd play a love song too. 

If he looked up for a moment then I know he'd realise 
See me there and read the message written in my eyes 
If he played me like he played that old guitar he's always strumming 
And ran his fingers through my hair I'd play a love song too.

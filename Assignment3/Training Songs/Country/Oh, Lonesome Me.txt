Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free, oh lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging 'round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see, oh lonesome me

Oh, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and honey don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me

Oh, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
Well, I still love her so and honey don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z, oh lonesome me
Oh lonesome me, oh lonesome me, oh lonesome me

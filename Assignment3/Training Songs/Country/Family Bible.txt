There's a family Bible on the table its pages torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
At the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done

And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
This old world of ours is full of trouble but this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
I can see us sitting

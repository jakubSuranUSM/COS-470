Oh no, here we go, and there you go again
When we disagree, you leave when you don't win
Honey, your sidewalk baby-talk don't get it with me no more
The next time around the block when you go by my door

Baby, walk on till you're gone away
Walk on till you find someday
Goodbye goes a long, long way
So, so long, walk on

Goodbye, baby cry till you're singing the poor boy blues
This time I don't mind shining your walking shoes
Fresh ink, in the pink, your papers are ready to sign
They'll both be waiting for you when you walk by

Baby, walk on till you're gone away
Walk on till you find someday
Goodbye goes a long, long way
So, so long, walk on

Baby, walk on till you're gone away
Walk on till you find someday
Goodbye goes a long, long way
So, so long, walk on baby
Walk on

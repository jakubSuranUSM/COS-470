Don't you think you should have called? 
To tell me you were coming down 
Oh you look so out of place on this troubled side of town 
Its a place where losers go when they know there's nothing left 
And after losing you I just lost the will to live 

Do you believe me now? 
I told you time and time again 
My heart and soul is your hands do you believe me now? 
Do you believe me now? 
Look at the living I endure 
I ain't nothing without you do you believe me now? 

I don't know what changed your mind, come-on ask if this is real 
I don't know what if you're a dream I only know how good it feels 
If you could find it in your heart to say the fire for me still burns 
I'll find a place to turn around down this road of no return 

Do you believe me now? 
I told you time and time again 
My heart and soul is your hands do you believe me now? 
Do you believe me now? 
Look at the living I endure 
I ain't nothing without you do you believe me now?

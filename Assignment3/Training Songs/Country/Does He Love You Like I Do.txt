Every day he sends you flowers and calls you on the hour
Does all the things I never thought to do
When you're going out he's never late if I came at all I made you wait
But tell me does he love you like I do

Oh to have you in arms again I'd give all I've got
But don't you see I just can't be something that I'm not
He knows the proper things to say sends cards on every holiday
But does that really mean so much to you

All those things are nice I know but danger when the lights are low
Tell me does he love you like I do

Yes all those things are nice I know

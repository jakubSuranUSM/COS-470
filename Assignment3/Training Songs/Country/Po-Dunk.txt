Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
(Oh Lord)

And that's po (po) dunk (dunk)
Don't give a flying hillbilly f*ck
I said po (po) dunk (dunk)
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-oh-oh-oh-whoaoh, po-dunk!

Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An old mutt in the yard licking on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the ditch
(Can I get a witness?)

Whoa whoa
And that's po (po) dunk (dunk)
Don't give a flying hillbilly f*ck
I said po (po) dunk (dunk)
A yard full of chickens and a barn full of drunks
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-oh-oh-oh-whoaoh, po-dunk!

Po-dunk!

Put your adult beverage over your head
If you're bat shit crazy and your neck is red
As the dirt on the road where we all grew up
Sing something with me if you ain't nothing but
(You ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but)

Po (po) dunk (dunk)
Don't give a flying hillbilly f*ck
I said po (po) dunk (dunk)
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you is, shut up if you ain't
Po-oh-oh-oh-whoaoh
Po-oh-oh-oh-whoaoh, po-dunk!
Po-dunk!
Po-dunk!
Po-dunk!

(Po-dunk!)
Yeah po-dunk
Po-dunk

I took some time
To clear my mind
To give my mind a change of atmosphere
I had some fun
Lying in the sun
Daytone is nice this time of year
I saw lovers hand in hand
Building castles in the sand
And doing all the things we did back then
But just when I think
I'm through lovin you
You're back on my mind again

[Chorus]
Back on my mind
Time after time
I wonder if this heart will ever mend
'Cause just when I think
I'm through lovin you
You're back on my mind again

I came out of my shell
Really doing well
I met someone who thinks the world of me
She talks of things
And whispers loving things
She's everything you'd want a girl to be
But when she holds me tight
The feeling isn't right
It seems as though I'm never gonna win
'Cause just when I think
I'm through lovin you
You're back on my mind again

[Chorus x2]

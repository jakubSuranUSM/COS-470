Coyote, oh coyote
Can you tell me why
Every time the big moon shines
You sit right down and cry
He says it's not because I'm sad
That I sing all night long
I'm looking for someone to love
And this is my love song'

Oooo oh I go crazy when that
Moon shines above
Oooo won't someone save me
From that full moon full of love

Baby, oh sweet baby
Can you explain this
Every time the big moon shines
I finally get a kiss
You said it's just the moonbeams
That make you do these things
I think that I'll just sit right here
And let that coyote sing

Oooo oh I go crazy when that
Moon shines above
Oooo won't someone save me
From that full moon full of love

Oooo oh I go crazy when that
Moon shines above
Oooo won't someone save me
From that full moon full of love

Oooo oh I go crazy when that
Moon shines above
Oooo won't someone save me
From that full moon full of love
From that full moon full of love

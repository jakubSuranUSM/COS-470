Please understand me, everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

I was high flyin' down Riverside Drive
Rockin' to the radio man alive
Stopped into a joint, bought a round of booze
Hot dog, I got a buzz in my shoe

Please understand me, everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Writin' you a letter, it's late in the night
Sittin' in a cafe eatin' a bite
Telln' you about where all I've been
Hot dog, I'm gone again

Please understand me, everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Now there's two kind of people in this big 'ol town
There's the early to rise and the late to go down
I guess I oughta find a better way to stop the clock
Hot dog, I like it a lot

Please understand me, everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Hot dog, I like it a lot

Please understand me, everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

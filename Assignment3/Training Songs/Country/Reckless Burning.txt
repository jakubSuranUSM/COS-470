[Chorus]
Pretty thing, I've got you
Right where I used to be
We ride across this city
Starting fires recklessly

And everything is closing
But tonight, we'll stay awhile
And if this darkness lingers
I'll fall to you just like a child

Pretty thing, I've got you
Right where this trouble lands
With reckless burning
I have been charged again

[Chorus]

Goodnight, Irene

I'm gonna head down to the coast
Where nothin' ever seems to matter
You know I love it there the most
When every piece of my world gets scattered

Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowin' in my hair

And I wrote you this little note
And I never even sent the letter

Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowin' in my hair

Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowin' in my hair

I'm gonna leave my old winter coat
And I won't even need a sweater
I'm gonna sit out on a boat
'Cause it's time for some sunny weather andÃ¢?Â¦

Blue skies, green water
White birds in the air
Brown skin, blue collar
And the wind blowin' in my hair
In my hair

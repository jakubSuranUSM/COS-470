The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

Could I be dreamin'
Is this really real
'Cause there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms here tonight

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

Keep fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, keep fallin', mm, fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fallin'

Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')
Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')
Yes, we're fallin' (Yes, we're fallin' Yes, we're fallin')

The closer you get, oh baby the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

(Black sheep black sheep)
This world holds many mysteries that I don't understand
One is why the wanderlust is born in the heart of a man
I kissed young lips that thrilled me so and set my soul on fire
I'm a black sheep boy and I just can't find the lips my heart desire

Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)
Why do I have to roam why can't I have a happy heart like other guys I've known
This wanderlust in my hungry heart keeps me on the road
I'm a black sheep boy there's a lot more oats that we've gotta sow
Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)
I've known life I've tasted love from a girl that's true and sweet
She haunts me in my dreams at night and I can hardly sleep
I won her self fancy then but my wondering heart says no
Black sheep boy with lot more places we've gotta go

Black sheep (black sheep)
I can hear my mama say as she sits there all alone
My black sheep boy is a coming back never more to roam
Black sheep (black sheep)
Black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep) black sheep (black sheep)

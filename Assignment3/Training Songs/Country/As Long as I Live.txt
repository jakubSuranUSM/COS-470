[Chorus]
As long as I live, if it  be one hour
Or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep rememberin', for-ever and e-ver
I'll love you dear, as  long as I  live.

It was easy said, that night we part ed
That we'd forget, we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten, I  wonder if you have
Or if your heart, is full of re- gret.

[Chorus]

I never thought, that night we parted
That life without you, would be this bad
It may sound funny, but I can't forget you
The only happiness, I've ever had.

Better build your house on a rock
Or watch it crumble and fail
Better build your love, hammer and nail

I see it in the darkness as if it was broad daylight
I feel it down inside my soul when I hold you tight
It takes much more than passion for love to prevail
Gotta raise it up with hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay that firm foundation down to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

You build one room for laughter, you build one room for tears
This ain't no game, no house of cards, it's gonna take us years
A vow that's only spoken comes to no avail
Put 'em in your hands, hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay it out so straight and true to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
We've both seen it strong enough, we've both seen it fail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

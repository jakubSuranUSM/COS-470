You see her there at the bar across the room
She looks like an angel with her pain and perfume
You'd like to meet her, your conscience says no
Obey your conscience, turn around, boy, and go

She's no angel, no angel, her wings are not real
She'll ruin your life, if your heart she can steal
She'll tell you tales to bring tears to your eyes
But don't you believe them, for they're only lies

You think if only she could be your own
You'd be more content than a king on his throne
You better not trust her, it's wrong if you do
She's broken many hearts and she'll break yours too

She's no angel, no angel, her wings are not real
She'll ruin your life, if your heart she can steal
She'll tell you tales to bring tears to your eyes
But don't you believe them, for they're only lies

She's no angel, no angel, her wings are not real
She'll ruin your life, if your heart she can steal
She'll tell you tales to bring tears to your eyes
But don't you believe them, for they're only lies

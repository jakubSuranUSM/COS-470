You've heard a multitude of prayers on my behalf
I pray one more is not too much to ask
I've tried to fight this battle by myself
But it's a war that I can't win without Your help

Tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

So many times I've hurt the ones I love
I pushed them to the edge of giving up
They've stood by me but how much can they stand
If I don't put this bottle in Your hands?

Tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

I shook my fist at heaven for all the hell that I've been through
Now I'm begging for forgiveness and a miracle from You

Cause tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

Could You help me turn this wine back into water?
Yeah, yeah

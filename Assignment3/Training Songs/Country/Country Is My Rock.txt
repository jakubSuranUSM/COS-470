One, two, three, four 

Can't you see that ol' weepin' willow tree 
Just enough shade for my ice-cold Bud an' me 
I just sit here where the breeze is soft 
An' I play the tapes with the letters horn off 
There ain't no better way to end a long hard week 

Than some Hank wailin' from my pick-up truck 
Pumpin' like my blue-collar redneck blood 
Give me some Hagg, give me the possible 
With screamin' guitars on top 
'Cause country, I said, country is my rock 

Everybody needs somethin' to keep them strong 
Yeah, something they can feel down in their bones 
For me there ain't no substitute 
For three simple chords an' the God's honest truth 
An' a steel guitar from the heart to take me home 

Like some Hank wailin' from my pick-up truck 
Pumpin' like my blue-collar redneck blood 
Give me some Hagg, give me the possible 
With screamin; guitars on top 
'Cause country, I said, country is my rock 
Yes, it is 

Give me some Hagg, give me the possible 
With screamin; guitars on top 
'Cause country, I said, country is my rock 
Yeah, country, I said, country is my rock 
Yes, it is

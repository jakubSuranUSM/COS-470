Tonight while the snowflakes are falling
Here in my dreams I can see
The wild cherry blossoms of Shamon
Where I walked with Anna Marie

Anna Marie, Anna Marie. my heart remembers and sighs
See'est vous, see'est vous. Mon ami beaucoup. 
I miss you Anna Marie

My love was pledged to another
But I knew as I crossed the sea
That I'd never love any other
As I love my Anna Marie

Anna Marie, Anna Marie. my heart remembers and sighs
See'est vous, see'est vous. Mon ami beaucoup. 
I miss you Anna Marie

I miss you Anna Marie

That lonely night we got carried away with each other
Remains with me though they'll never be another
Warm drinks soft lights and slow dances
When two blue people were the victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong arms the right time
Circumstances was her charms or just a wine
Would it happen again if we had enough chances
Or would we even want each other under different circumstances

What is done is over and just a memory the night they set a sign for you and me
Oh but the dreams this foolish heart romances
Of the night when we were victim of circumstances
Circumstances the wrong arms

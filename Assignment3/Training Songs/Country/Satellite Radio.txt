Top of my shift-frog in my throat-sleep in my eyes
Startin' to drift, cuppa hot joe, checkin' the sky
Never can tell, makin' my list, checkin' it twice
Fasten my belt, flippin' my switch, checkin' my mic

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?

Listen to the radio
Listen to the radio

Turn it on
Turn it up

What if they're right? What if I'm wrong? What if we're kings?
One of these nights-play the right song-telephone rings
Stone in the sea, shot in the dark, splittin' the air
Listen to me, kindle the spark, answer my prayer

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Does anybody care, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to us tonight on the satellite radio?

Listen to the radio
Listen to the radio

Turn it on

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?

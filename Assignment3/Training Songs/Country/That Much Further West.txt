I tried, and I can't run no more
So tell Katie it's her that I adore
And as long as I love her best
I'm that much further west

And since, since she's been gone
I've done less right than I've done wrong
I ain't that much worse than the rest
Just that much further west

And the boys, they don't need my help
They can play these songs by themselves
Well I ain't that much worse than the rest
Just that much further west

Out west the only sky is blue
So tell Katie that I'll see her soon
Til then, the thoughts that I have left
Are that much further west

Your hair is soft your eyes are bright your nose is small your mouth is right
Your skin is smooth your waist is small
Your legs are curved you've got dainty feet I love it all
Head to toe can't you see I love you head to toe I can't get enough of you
I told you now you know I love you head to toe

Your sparkling eyes they shine with love your hungry lips can't get enough
Your loving arms they're clinging vines
Your body's warm and when we're close I know it's mine
Head to toe...
Head to toe...

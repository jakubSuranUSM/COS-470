Spend the night in Charlotte's bed
You might get caught in Charlotte's web
A satin rose, that's growing wild
Charlotte holds more secrets, than the night

She spins and weaves her magic spell
Her body speaks, what words can't tell
I'm a moth, she's a flame
In a town that's all too quick, to smear her name

But I'll take the likes of Charlotte and her kind
Small-town talk, don't matter now that Charlotte's mine
It may be true, that other men have found her bed
But I'm the one who's caught in Charlotte's Web

Charlotte took me late one night
To a secret room, by candlelight
She dealt the cards and read my hand
Said she hoped that I would understand

She turned two cards up, face to face
She said, "Two hearts have found their place"
Now all the rest is history
The future's full of Charlotte loving me

And I'll take the likes of Charlotte and her kind
Small-town talk don't matter now that Charlotte's mine
It may be true that other men have found her bed
But I'm the one, who's caught in Charlotte's Web

It may be true that other men have found her bed
But I'm the one who's caught in Charlotte's Web
(Charlotte's web)

Charlotte's web, Charlotte's web
Charlotte's web, Charlotte's web
Charlotte's web

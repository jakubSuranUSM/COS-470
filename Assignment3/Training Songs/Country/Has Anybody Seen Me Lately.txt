Has anybody seen me lately I'm sorry if I passed you by
But ever since I lost my baby all I seem to do is cry
Built little world around me don't even know this life long friends
Has anybody seen me lately I wish you tell me where I've been
Was I looking bad was I looking sad as I feel Lord I hope not
Were my eyes full of dreams that fell apart it seems well that's all all what I've got
If anybody seen me lately pretended I was someone else
Now my mind just ain't been working lately I wouldn't even know myself

Was I looking bad

As much as the stars need the heaven
As much as the roses need dew
As much as the plea in a baby's cry
Well, that's how much I need you

As much as the flowers need sunshine
As much as the sky needs the blue
As much, as much as my love is true
Well, that's how much I need you

I need you, I need you to guide me
This much I know it's true
You alone are my inspiration
In everything I do

As much as the stars need the heaven
Well, that's how much I need you

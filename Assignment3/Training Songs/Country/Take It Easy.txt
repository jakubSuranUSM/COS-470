Take it easy lovin' me
Don't start thinkin' I'm something that I'll never be
Just need me, oh, yeah, as much as need be
Take it easy, easy, lovin' me

Many's the woman who's cried herself crazy at night
Over some kind of a man who she says ain't treatin' her right
Expectin' of someone is quick to be takin' its toll
And if you're not careful, you'll wake up lonely and old

Take it easy, easy, lovin' me
Don't start thinking I'm somethin' that I'll never be
Just need me as much as need be
Take it easy, easy, lovin' me

Now dreamin' and plannin' are things I guess all of us do
And sooner or later, we all play the part of a fool
But those in a hurry to unpack their bag full of dreams
Are quick to be victims of the lies and lusts and the schemes

Take it easy lovin' me
Don't start thinkin' I'm something that I'll never be
Just need me, oh yeah baby,
As much as need be
Take it easy lovin' me
Take it easy lovin' me

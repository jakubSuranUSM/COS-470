Hitch hiker! hitch hiker!
Like a restless tiger you can't stand still
And you never will

[Spoken:]
Here i stand and the cars go by
Some of them honk - and some just wave hi
It seems like life and the cars both just pass me by

Hitch hiker
No special place to be going
I just go whichever way the winds blowin'
You know it's hot today
I'd kinda like to go where it's snowin'
Ahh i dunno maybe i'll just stay here
Where the green grass is growin'

Here comes another car.. i wonder
Is he slowing down
Hitch hiker

Hitch hiker! hitch hiker!
Like a restless tiger you can't stand still
And you never will

I guess boys all dream and so did i
My hands once reached to touch the sky
Is this the sky that i reached for
Just the dust of the road and nothin' more

Here comes another car
Hitch hiker

Hitch hiker! hitch hiker!
Like a restless tiger you can't stand still
And you never will

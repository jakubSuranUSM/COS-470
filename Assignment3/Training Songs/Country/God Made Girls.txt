Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls

Somebody's gotta make 'em get dressed up,
Somebody's gotta give 'em a reason to wash that truck,
Somebody gotta teach 'em how to dance so God made girls

He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful, unbreakable that lights up in the dark

So God made girls God made girls he stood back and told the boys
I'm bout to rock your world

And God made girls (For singing in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls.

Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive, give him a reason
To hold that door so God made girls

Somebody's gotta put a fight,
Make him wait on a Saturday night,
To walk downstairs and blow his mind,
So God made girls

Someone that can wake him up and call his bluff
And drag his butt to church, someone that is hard to handle
Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts

So God made girls God made girls
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls (For singin' in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls

Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls

God made girls

He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls. (For singin' in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls

Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls

When the snake of love
Starts pulling you under
And it won't let go
'til it starts to thunder
And there's not a cloud in the sky
Gonna make him shake
I guess old habits are hard to break

Cause even the good ones
Just seem to go bad
Might be the sweetest love
That you ever had
You just can't let em go
For goodness sake
I guess old habits are hard to break

The trouble with sainthood, darlin'
You know it's tough comin down
But you've been doin it, doin it, doin it, doin it, doin it
Since you left your hometown
A regular joan of arc
Burnin at the stake
I guess old habits are hard to break

Maybe the first time he kissed you
The fireworks flew in the back of your mind
And you been lookin just to
Feel this good ever since
But now every time he makes love to ya
He's just a little bit more unkind
Until it feels like every move you make is in self defense

That ain't the facts of life
Its just bad fiction
Honey that sure ain't love
You know it's just an addiction
Now how much more abuse are you gonna take
I guess old habits are hard to break

Could be your father
Could be your mother
Might be your sister
Or maybe even your brother
Or is it your own self baby
You've been tryin to shake

Well I guess old habits are hard to break
I guess old habits are hard to break
I guess old habits are hard to break
I guess old habits are hard to break

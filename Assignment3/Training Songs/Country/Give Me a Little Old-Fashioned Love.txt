Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love 
The kind that lingers through the years
The kind that's made by God up above 
Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love

Now you can have the girls with rosy cheeks 
The ones that coo like turtle dove
I just want a simple girl that's sweet 
So, Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love

Ah Leon
Ah do it pretty son

Now you can have the girls that's dressed so nice
From their head down to their little feet
But if you want some real good advice 
The old fashioned girls just can't be beat
 
So, Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love 
The kind that lingers through the years
The kind that's made by God up above 
Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love

Ah Buddy now

Now you can have the girls with worldly ways 
That's had a dozen so called love affair
But, they'll never make me their slave 
I want a simple girl that's on the square

So, Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love 
The kind that lingers through the years
The kind that's made by God up above 
Just Give Me A Little Old Fashioned Love

Everybody's had the blues sometimes and
Everybody knows the tune
And everybody knows the way I'm feelin' cause 
Everybody's had the blues

A lonely, song someone is gone
A story old as time
Love, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mind
But everybody knows the way I'm feelin' 'cause
Everybody's had the blues

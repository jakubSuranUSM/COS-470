Don't be fooled by big blue eyes
By a smile or a golden curl
For she'll love you now
And then break every vow
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Don't be fooled by kisses
Or arms that hold you tight
There will be another
In her arms tomorrow night

Hearts to her are toy tops
She likes to watch 'em whirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

You can never change her ways
Though you give her all the world
She's got more than one or two
And each day there's someone new
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her
Is just a way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool
And you're another one

She knows all the arts of love
She'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

Don't be fooled by kisses
Or arms that hold you tight
There will be another
In her arms tomorrow night

Hearts to her are toy tops
She likes to watch 'em whirl
'Cause she's just a honky-tonk girl

ESKIMO PIE
(George Jones)
Â« Â© '57 Glad Music Â»

You can talk about your Frauleins and your pretty Geisha girls
And about the one you got in the USA
But I found myself a sweetheart in Alaska way up high
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She lives south of the North pole and I know the reason why
She's my Eskimo baby and I'll love her till I die
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Crossing o'er the frozen river to a valley filled with snow
I lost all my directions and I knew not where to go
When a warm hand fell upon me and a voice said with a sigh
I would take you to my igloo Mister I won't let you die
Well she's my Eskimo baby...
And there came the day of parting and we had to say goodbye
As I crossed back o'er the river I could think I hear her cry
I know that someday I'll return I must before I die
Cause she's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Well she's my Eskimo baby...

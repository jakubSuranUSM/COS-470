Woke up on Monday and wrote you a love song, wrote you a love song
Well the pen stopped and the paper flew out the window
And the notes rang down the road
I don’t know where they’ll go get caught in the trees I suppose
Ripped apart by the birds and the winter winds whisper good bye to your love

Went out walking into the storm, into the storm
Followed what I thought was your voice but it was just the riverside
I don’t know where they’ll go but I cast the letters you wrote
Taken out by the current or sink to the bottom to say a little goodbye to your love

Skies dark and the wind blew the trees down
I watched as the world slipped away
Carved into the bark a final love song
Then I carried the words to the fire

Staring into the glow where the branches are burning low
Sparks shooting out like stars and in the morning say a little goodbye to your love

I’ll carry this song with me everyday ‘til I lie down by your side

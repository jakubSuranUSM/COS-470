We're a band of brothers and sisters and whatever
On a mission to break all the rules
And I know you love me cause I love you too
But you can't tell me what to do
And I sure don't know where we're going
I'm really not sure where we've been
But if I can take you all with me
I'd sure like to go there again cause

We're a band of brothers and sisters and whatever
On a mission to break all the rules
And I know you love me cause I love you too
But you can't tell me what to do
Or you can't tell me what to do

When all the songs have been written
When all of the music is played
When the curtain comes down we'll still be around
To make sure the musicians are paid cause

We're a band of brothers and sisters and whatever
On a mission to break all the rules
And I know you love me cause I love you too
But you can't tell me what to do
We're a band of brothers and sisters and whatever
On a mission to break all the rules
And I know you love me cause I love you too
But you can't tell me what to do
I know you love me cause I love you too
But you can't tell me what to do

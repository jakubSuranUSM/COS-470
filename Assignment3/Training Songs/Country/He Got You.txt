He got the sunshine, I got the rain
He got your loving, I got the pain
He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the memories, he got you.

He got your good times, I got the bad
He got your sweet side, I got the sad
He got forever to make your dreams come true
I got your letter goodbye, he got you.

Sometimes the wine taste bitter
Sometimes the wine taste sweet
Sometimes the only road I can see
Leads me right back to your feet.

He got the sunshine, I got the rain
He got your loving, I got the pain
He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the memories, he got you.

He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the memories, he got you.

He got you baby, he got you
He got you baby, baby, baby
He got you, he got you baby, oh

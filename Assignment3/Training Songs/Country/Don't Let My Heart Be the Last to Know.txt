I see the future slipping by
I see it fading from my life
I see a distant look growing in your eyes
Are you telling me goodbye?

And are you coming back again
Is it over now, is this the end?
There's a feeling of lonesome in the wind
Tell me is it so
Don't let my heart be the last to know

I have a right to know the truth
After all that we've been through
Is there somebody else?
Have you found someone new
Is there just no more me and you?

And are you coming back again
Is it over now, is this the end?
There's a feeling of lonesome in the wind
Tell me is it so
Don't let my heart be the last to know

There's a feeling of lonesome in the wind
Tell me is it so
Don't let my heart be the last to know

Now I've been all around this whole wide world
Down to Memphis, Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat
Looks like home to me

Now I left my little girl crying
Standing in the door
Throwed her arms around my neck
Saying 'Honey, don't you go'

Now I've been all around this whole wide world
Done most everything
I've played cards with the King and the Queen
Discard the ace and the ten
                                  
    Oh it's don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Before my last gold dollar is gone

Now where did you get them high top shoes?
Dress you wear so fine?
Got my shoes from a railroad man
And my dress from a driver in the mine

Who's gonna shoe your pretty white feet?
Who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your lily white cheeks?
Who's gonna be your man?

Now Papa may shoe my pretty white feet
Mama can glove my hand
She can kiss my lily white cheeks
'Till you come back again

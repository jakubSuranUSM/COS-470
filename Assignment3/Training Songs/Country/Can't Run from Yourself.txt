You can run for cover
You can run for help
You can run to your lover
But you
Can't ever run from yourself
No no no
Because there you are
No matter how far you go 
You can run to Alaska
Run to L.A
Run home to mama
But you
Can't ever run from yourself

No no no
Because there you are
No matter how far you go 

No matter how far you go
No matter how long you stay
You can run forever
But darling you will never
Never find true happiness that way 
You can run for election
You can run for your life
Run for protection
But you
Can't ever run from yourself
No no no
Because there you are
No matter how far you go 
Oh no

No matter how far you go
No matter how long you stay
You can run forever
But darling you will never
Never find true happiness that way 

You can run for cover
You can run for help
You can run to your lover
But you
Can't ever run from yourself
No no no
Because there you are
No matter how far you go
There you are
No matter how far you go

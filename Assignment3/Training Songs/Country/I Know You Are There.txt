When the rope of death strangles
And dark waters roar and foam
When fear and trembling hold me
And the slimy grip pulls down

I know you are there

When the pale starlight is fading
And sorrow fills my heart
When dewdrops fall so sweetly
On the green, green grass at dawn

I know you are there
I know you are there
I know you are there

When black fish swim ponds of silver
Where jade water lilies grow
When devils dance around me
And the flames of madness glow

I know you are there

When the softly calling bluebirds
Drift through the lazy clouds
When white owls circle screaming
And gravel fills my mouth

I know you are there
I know you are there
I know you are there

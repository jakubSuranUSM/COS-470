They married back in forty-two
They were young and love was new
And every day that feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad
The hope would chase away the sad
And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

The fifties came and the sixties went
A mortgage note replaced the rent
And they made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them
The children all turned out just fine
He retired in sixty-nine
Left with oh so little time
Between the two of them

Today I braved the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names
Now that's the most that ever came
Between the two of them
Oh I miss them both so much
His crooked smile her gentle touch
And the pleasure of just growing up
Between the two of them

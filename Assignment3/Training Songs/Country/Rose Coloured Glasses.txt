She sees the world through rose-coloured glasses
Painted skies and graceful romances
I see a world that's tired and scared
Of living on the edge too long
Where does she get off telling me
That love could save us all, save us all.

She takes my hand and leads me to nowhere town.
No matter where I stand it's always neutral ground,
And in the cool of the evening blue
I feel so tired and alone
Where does she get off telling me
That love could save us all, save us all.

And it's day after day
I keep hanging around can you tell me why
Night after night, yeah I know I should leave
But there's something in those eyes
That keeps me hanging on, I'm hypnotized
It breaks my heart and I don't know why

Tell me why, tell me why

She sees the world through rose-coloured glasses
Painted skies and graceful romances
I see a world that's tired and scared
Of living on the edge too long
Where does she get off telling me
That love could save us all, save us all

And it's day after day
I keep hanging around, can you tell me why
Night after night, yeah I know I should leave
But there's something, yeah, yeah

Day after day after day after day
And I don't know
Day after day after day after day
And I don't know why.

Could tell it when I woke up this mornin' 
'Cause I can smell it when a heartache's comin' 
Not that I'm in such a hurry to lose you 
I'd call you up but there's nothin' that I can do 
Talkin' won't do any good anyway 
'Cause goodbye's all we've got left to say 
I don't think that it'll get any better 
So maybe you could just write me a letter 
And I could open it up when I'm stronger 
Another ten or twelve years, maybe longer 
Guess I just don't feel much like bad news today 
Goodbye's all we've got left to say 

Don't try to call me 'cause I'm takin' my phone out 
'Cause if it rings, I'll know what it's about 
And don't you worry 'bout me 'cause I'm alright 
Maybe you'll run into me somewhere, some night 
And if you do just keep goin' your way 
Goodbye's all we've got left to say

I went to see the preacher, to teach me how to pray
He looked at me and smiled, then that preacher turned away
Said, "If you want to tell him something, you ain't gotta fold your hands.
Say it with your heart, your soul, and believe it, and I'll say, Amen."

Bang a drum for the sinners, bang a drum for your sins
Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for yourself son, and a drum for me

Well I called upon my brother, just the other day
He said, "Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again.
I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet.
Well I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet."

Bang a drum for the dying, bang a drum for the truth
Bang a drum for the innocence, lost in our youth
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for your brother, and a drum for me

I don't know where all the rivers run
I don't know how far, I don't know how come
But I'm gonna die believin, with each step that I take
Ain't worth the ground that I walk if we don't walk it our own way

I don't claim to be a wise man, a poet, or a Saint
Just another man who's searchin' for a better way
But my heart beats loud as thunder, for the things that I believe
Sometimes I want to run for cover, sometimes I want to scream

Bang a drum for the tomorrow, bang a drum for the past
Bang a drum for heroes, who won't come back
Bang a drum for the promise, bang a drum for the lies
Bang a drum for the lovers, and the tears they cry
Bang a drum bang it loudly, or as soft as you need

But as long as my heart keeps on banging, I've got a reason to believe

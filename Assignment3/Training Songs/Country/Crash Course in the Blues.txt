To a boy from Indiana fresh off the farm
L.A. looks like heaven with its ever open arms
My mama said to watch yourself like mamas always do
Daddy said those city girls will walk all over you
So I hit the pavement running down on Hollywood and Vine
I got to town by seven and I fell in love by nine
She was a California angel wearing alligator shoes
She had that something that a poor boy can't refuse

She was incredible, she was 
A crash course in the blues
Now we're screaming down the freeway 
In this fancy foreign car
Headed for another party 
Never seen so many stars
Just when I thought I'd make my move 
And ask her to be mine
She takes off with somebody else 

And kisses me goodbye
She was incredible, she was 
A crash course in the blues
Well she was way too hard to handle 
For a country boy like me
She's still a Roman candle 
Burning in my memory
She was unbelievable, she was 
A crash course in the blues
She was incredible, she was 
A crash course in the blues
That's right

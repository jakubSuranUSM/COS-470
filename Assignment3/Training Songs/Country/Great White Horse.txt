(When I was a young girl I used to dream of a lover
To be my shining knight of strength one day
He'd cary me to a castle in the heavens and battle all my dragons on the way
And he'd ride down on a great white horse he'd bring me love I was longing for
He'd bring me joy and lasting peace on a great white horse he'd ride away with me
Singing dumb-di-de-dumb-dumb-dumb-di-de-dum)

When I was a young man I used to dream of a maiden
With long soft hair flowing in the wind
Her laughing eyes and loving arms would follow
When I'd sail around the world and back again
And I'd ride down on a great white horse I'd bring the love she was longing for
I'd bring her laughter and sunny days
And on a great white horse I'd carry her away
Singing dumb-di-de-dumb-dumb-dumb-di-de-dumb

(The time has flown I find there are no dragons) and I don't wanna sail the seven seas
(Anywhere we are becomes our castle) and the only world I want is here with me
And we both ride on a great white horse we found the love we were longing for
(You're my sunshine on a rainy day) you're my April you're my May
Singing dumb-di-de-dumb-dumb-dumb-di-de-dumb
Singing dumb-di-de-dumb-dumb-dumb-di-de-dumb
Singing dumb-di-de-dumb-dumb-dumb-di-de-dumb

If your paycheck depends on
The weather and the clock
If your conversation calls for
A little more than a coffee pot
If you need to pour your heart out
And try to rectify some situation
That you're facing
Contact your American Honky Tonk Bar Association

When Uncle Sam dips in your pocket
Now for most things you don't mind
But when your dollar goes to all of those
Standing in a welfare line
Rejoice you have a voice
If you're concerned about the destination
Of this great nation
Contact your American Honky-Tonk Bar Association

We're talkin' about your
Hard hat, gunrack, achin'-back
Over taxed, flag-wavin', fun-lovin' crowd
They're heart is in the music
And they love to play it loud
There's no forms or applications
There's no red tape administrations
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association

We're all one big family
Throughout the cities and the towns
We don't reach for handouts
we reach for those who are down
And every local chapter has a seven day a week
Available consultation
For your frustration
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association

We're talkin' about your
Mud flaps, six pack, beer crack
Over-taxed, flag-wavin', fun-lovin' crowd
They're heart is in the music
And they love to play it loud
There's no forms or no applications
There's no red tape administrations
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association

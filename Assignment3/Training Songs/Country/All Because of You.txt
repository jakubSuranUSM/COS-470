Well, things are gonna change for me these nights
Don't want out my head and feel all right
Dark side of my mind ain't made one sound
Feel like someone else, but I don't feel down

And it's all because of you
The things you say and do
It's all because of you
I'm feeling something new

Hey I want you by my side so I can see
The way you look at life it's good for me
There's something going on that I ain't had
Don't feel so afraid and don't feel sad

And it's all because of you
The things you say and do
It's all because of you
I'm feeling something new

Now you're my baby
Yeah, you're my baby
Hey, you're my baby
Yeah, you're my baby

And so I want to think, from my heart
Give you something back, do my part
To love you like I should and start right now
If I know what to do, if I know how

And it's all because of you
The things you say and do
It's all because of you
I'm feeling something new

And it's all because of you
The things you say and do
It's all because of you
I'm feeling something new

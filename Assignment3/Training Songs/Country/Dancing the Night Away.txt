Standin' beside the ocean
Lookin' across the water
Everything is beautiful here
But I still don't feel like I ought

Things we wanted
Not so long ago
Well, I've got 'em all now
But I ain't got you no more

But I remember, the way you held me
And all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers
Dancing the night away

I remember everything
The way you wore your hair
The things your body told me
Will seem to float right through the air

I look so funny dancing
But you loved me any how
I wish, I could find somebody
To love me like that now

But I remember, the way you held me
And all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers
Dancing the night away

Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Oh baby, let me see you dance

Standin' beside the ocean
Throwing rocks out in the bay
I should look for companionship
But it just gets in my way

Lights are a glittering
All along the shore
People dancin' there
I don't dance there no more

'Cause I remember, the way you held me
And all the sweet thing you used to say
When we were two young lovers
Dancin' the night away

Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Oh baby, let me see you dance

Let me see you dance
Let me see you dance
Oh baby, let me see you dance

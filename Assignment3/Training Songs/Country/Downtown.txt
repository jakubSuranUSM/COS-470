When you're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go Downtown
When you've got worries all the noise and the hurry seems to help I know Downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty how can you lose
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go Downtown things'll be great when you're Downtown no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Now don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows Downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close Downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bosa nova
You'll be dancing with them too before the night gets over happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go Downtown where all the lights are bright Downtown waiting for you tonight
Downtown you've gotta be all right now

And you'll may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and need a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there we can forget all our troubles forget all our cares
So go Downtown things will be great when you're Downtown no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

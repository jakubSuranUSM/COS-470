HOMECOMING IN HEAVEN
(Willie Nelson - Paul Buskirk - Walt Breeland-Claude Gray)
Â« Â© '62 Tree Publishing Â»

My years have been many my loved ones are gone
And I miss them more every day
I'm ready to move to that heavenly home
And I yearn for the day I can say
Take this ring from my finger these shoes from my feet
Take all of my worldly possessions away
Just leave me my Bible a date I must keep
It's homecoming in heaven for me
I'll kiss my old mother shake hands with my dad
I know they'll remember their boy
We'll all be so happy and I'll be so glad
As our cup runneth over with joy
Take this ring from my finger

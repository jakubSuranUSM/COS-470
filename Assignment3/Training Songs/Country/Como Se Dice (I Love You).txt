There's a full moon tonight casting its light on this old bordertown
Making my tears shine like diamonds turning these streets into shadows of
Doubt
I left my lover to toss and to turn in his dreams
Help me amigo please what does this mean
Come se dice I love you en Espanol
Tonight when he's sleeping he's whispering Maria te amo
Does a sweet senorita with sleepy brown eyes
Dance in his dreams while he lays by my side

Come se dice I love you en Espanol

Please I am desperate to know does his face ever show on your side of town
And is he ever seen with a girl named Maria where can she be found
I have a picture of him right here in my hand help me amigo I don't
Understand
Come se dice I love you en Espanol...
Come se dice I love you en Espanol
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay...

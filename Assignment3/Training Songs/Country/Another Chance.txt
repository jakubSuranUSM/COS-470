When you left you said you's doin' me a favour
I cried and I begged you not to go
Now it's just been two short weeks
And you want to come back
Well I think there's somethin' that you oughtta know-ow

Well I've rearranged the livin' room to suit me
I gave your favourite chair to charity
That closet you insisted on, it's mine now
So don't bring your old hangups back to me-ee

And I'm wearin' my jeans a little bit tighter
Changed my hair style and I'm learnin' how to da-ance
So maybe you best wait a little bit longer
'Fore you come back and give me another chance

I thank you for your call but someone's knockin' at my door
And he's drivin' a big gold cadillac
I prob'ly won't be home when you come to get your clothes
There on the back porch in a paper sa-ack

And I'm wearin' my jeans a little bit tighter
Changed my hair style and I'm learnin' how to da-ance
So maybe you best wait a little bit longer
'Fore you come back and give me another chance

I'm wearin' my jeans a little bit tighter
Changed my hair style and learnin' how to da-ance
So maybe you best wait a little bit longer
'Fore you come back and give me another chance

Thanks anyway
Don't need another chance
I think I'll pass

Love for you has been so strong like a fool I've gone alone
With my feet both planted firmly in the air
I've been so in love with you I've just thought you've loved me too
But at last I'd figured out that you don't care
I've been counting all the time that you told me you are mine
The time you've said how much you care
And I counted all of them on the fingers of one hand
And I still have five fingers to spare (yes I still have five fingers to spare)

Since I counted one by one and the answer came to none
I don't think you love me any maybe less
And if what I think is true nothing's good enough for you
And so I'll just give you nothing after this
I've been counting all the time

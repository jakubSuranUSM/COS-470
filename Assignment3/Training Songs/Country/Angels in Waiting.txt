We camped out on the living room floor,
in our old sleeping bags, by a make-believe fire.
In a tent made of covers, we talked for hours
My two brother and me.
Keeping the faith; racing with destiny.

They were angels in waiting.
Waiting for wings to fly from this world,
Away from their pain
Treasuring time, til time came to leave,
Leaving behind sweet memories.
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings.

They always knew they? never grow old.
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul.
In their darkest hour, I made a promise
I will always keep:
I?l give them life; I?l let them live through me.

They were angels in waiting.
Waiting for wings to fly from this world,
Away from their pain
Treasuring time, til time came to leave,
Leaving behind sweet memories.
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings.
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for me.

They were angels in waiting.
Waiting for wings to fly from this world,
Away from their pain
Treasuring time, til time came to leave,
Leaving behind sweet memories.
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for wings.
Angels in waiting; angels in waiting for me.

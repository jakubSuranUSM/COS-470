The thought had never crossed my mind
That a friend would rob me blind
Of the only thing that I've been living for
You knew just what she meant to me
Still, you gave in to lust and greed
And now my life has changed, forever more

So, tonight I'll be reaching for the bottle
Instead of reaching for the one I love
It just ain't right to steal her heart, what were you thinkin'
'Cause, friends don't drive friends to drinkin'

The thought had never crossed my mind
That a friend would rob me blind
Of the only thing that I've been living for
You knew just what she meant to me
Still, you gave in to lust and greed
And now my life has changed, forever more

How will I face another day?
So broken hearted and betrayed
Everything I've counted on, has let me down
But, I pray the day will come
That you'll pay hell for what you've done
While I'm lost here with a new friend I have found

So, tonight I'll be reaching for the bottle
Instead of reaching for the one I love
It just ain't right to steal her heart, what were you thinkin'
'Cause, friends don't drive friends to drinkin'
Friends don't drive friends to drinkin'

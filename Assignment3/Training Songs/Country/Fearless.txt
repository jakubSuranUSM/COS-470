So scared
Reaching out for a helping hand
And it's not there, I'm alone
Shaking
Just need to keep my nerve 
From breaking
It's almost gone
The darkness surrounds me
I'm my heart I fell the light
One small step, one deep breath
And everything gonna be all right

Every time that I survive
I feel little more alive 
And I know who I am
It just makes me stronger
It's a faith within myself
Don't depend on no one else
If I believe and I believe
Someday I'll be fearless

Learning
That if I fail, If I fall
Well world keeps turning
Round and round
Knowing
If I let go and trust my intuition
It won't let me down
I'm takin' my chances
I'm finding more of me each day
I'll face fear without fear
I'll conquer whatever comes my way

Every time that I survive
I feel little more alive
And I know who I am
It just makes me stronger
It's a faith within myself
Don't depend on no one else
If I believe and I believe
Someday I'll be fearless

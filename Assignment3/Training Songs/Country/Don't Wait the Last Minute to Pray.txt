A great day is coming, it's not far away
Don't wait the last minute my brother to pray
If your soul's in danger, if you've lost your way
Don`t wait the last minute my brother to pray

[Chorus]
Don't wait, my brother, don't wait
Don't wait until it's too late
If your soul's in danger, if you've lost your way
Don't wait the last minute to pray

A sad day is coming for those who go wrong
Please listen, my brother, and don't tarry long
The Good Lord is willing to open the way
Don't wait the last minute my brother to pray

[Chorus]

There's no charge in heaven for treasures so rare
The crown that you win when you meet Him up there
There's no temptation to cause you to stray
Don't wait the last minute my brother to pray

[Chorus]

It can be a cold winter sunday
The kind where you can't get out of bed
You were my El Paso south wind
The sun that paints my desert red
You're an amen on a Carolina sand dune
A prayer that washes up on my shore
The blue sky that cuts through the black night
When I can't feel anymore

You wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its November and my soul ain't dark
You are my June
June in my Johnny Cash heart

Everybody's got an addiction
A real good feel good they need
Some trains, they don't hear you coming
'Til they are baring down on you
And your demons got you on your knees

You wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its November and my soul ain't dark
You are my June
June in my Johnny Cash heart
Yeah yeah

We can take that cold winter Sunday
Set fire to that Carolina sand dune
Girl, you love the hurt and the hell outta me, yeah

When you wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its November and my soul ain't dark
You are my June
June in my Johnny Cash heart

You are my June
You are my June

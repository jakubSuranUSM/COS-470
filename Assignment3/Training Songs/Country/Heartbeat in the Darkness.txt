Cadillac smiles in the ladies' styles in this world
They ain't no part of me
A hundred dollar bill can cure your ills in this world
But it ain't no good to me

You see money and clothes are easily burned
People and cars are easily turned around
I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be

You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground
I'd give every material thing I own in this life
If I could just hear the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat

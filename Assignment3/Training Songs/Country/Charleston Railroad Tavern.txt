Charleston Railroad Tavern sittin' up till I'm blind
She left on that 5-0-9 Eastern standard blue time

My baby left this evening I'd changed all this if I could
But her train just pulled out of sight I know she's gone for good

So Charleston Railroad Tavern...

I stayed out so many nights the crowd downtown was fun
But her love had turned to hate before I knew the harm I'd done

Now the laughing tavern crowd is gone I'm so lonesome I could die
The man just said it's closing time guess I'll go home and cry

So Charleston Railroad Tavern...

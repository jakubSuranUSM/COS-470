No one dreams in this ol' town no more
They don't look down that winding road
Wonderin' where it goes
But when I hold you, I can see

All the places it could lead
They we're crazy, I don't care
We could make it anywhere

Let's ride the wind
Down this old road tonight
Let's pack our dreams
And leave the rest behind

They say love this hot
Can be a dangerous thing
Come on darlin'â?¦
Let's go down in flames

I don't know or care where this road leads
Just as long as at the end
It's you and me
We can feel our hearts, beggin' us to go

If we don't leave now, we'll never know
And if our love should crash and burn
We'll take that chance for all it's worth

Let's ride the wind
Down this old road tonight
Let's pack our dreams
And leave the rest behind

They say love this hot
Can be a dangerous thing
Come on darlin'â?¦
Let's go down in flames

So take my hand, you know we're right
Don't look back, just hold on tight

Let's ride the wind
Down this old road tonight
Let's pack our dreams
And leave the rest behind

They say love this hot
Can be a dangerous thing
Come on darlin'â?¦
Let's go down in flames

Come on darlin'... Let's go down in flames

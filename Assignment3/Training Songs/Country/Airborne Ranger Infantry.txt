My daddy was a soldier in a foreign war 
But he doesn't like to talk about it any more 
He kept a picture of my mama right by his heart 
He'd give it one last look before the fighting would start 
He said all I ask is that you don't forget 
Cause the wars not over when the fighting ends 

There's a part of me that will always be 
Just a boy in a hole with an M-16 
Airborne ranger infantry 

I left my best friend lying in a pool of blood 
While I crawled away through the brush and mud 
If I could choose to go back again 
I'd die lying there next to him 
I still see his face when I close my eyes 
As I won't forget his sacrifice 

There's a part of me that will always be 
Just a boy in a hole with an M-16 
Airborne ranger infantry 

I didn't do it for the money didn't do it for fame 
I didn't do it so the world would remember my name 
I did it for my family and my country, 
And my brothers who died right next to me. 

And all we ask is that you don't forget 
Cause the wars not over when the fighting ends 
There's a part of us that will always be 
Just boys in a hole with our M-16s 

Honoring souls and memories 
Airborne ranger infantry

Once I had a heart cold as ice
Love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun

Once I had a trick up my sleeve
And a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
And I shot down every young girl I found

[Chorus]
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I know there I was
Oh shot full of love

Well who'd have thought that someone like you
Could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet

[Chorus: x2]

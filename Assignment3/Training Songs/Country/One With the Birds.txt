Leave me alone 
Is all that I say
When I have nothing 
In me to give away
A purple martin in her house
She hollers at me
She says why be inhuman? 
Why be like me?

Like so many robins
Like so many doves
Like so many lovebirds 
With so many loves
Like the songs of the bobwhite 
Without any words
When we are inhuman 
We're one with the birds

And at six in the morning 
You rise from the pillow
Stand steaming above me
While I slumber below
See I'm one with the blanket 
Laying fragrant and loose
You're one with a whip-poor-will
You're one with a goose

Like so many robins
Like so many doves
Like so many lovebirds
With so many loves
Like the songs of the bobwhite
Without any words
When we are inhuman 
We're one with the birds

So sing with me 
And widely spread
Your olive wings
Embrace my head
Fly with me 
Until we are dead
And one with the birds

Like so many seagulls
Like so many hawks
Like so many thrushes
And so many cocks
Well a swallow will tell you 
without using misleading heartrending words
When we are inhuman 
We're one with the birds
Yes when we hide our feelings 
We may as well fly away

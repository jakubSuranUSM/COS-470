God bless America again
You see all the troubles that she's in
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes and then
God bless America again

God I sure to wish you bless America again
You know like you did way back when it all began
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda take it for granted
And never did ask again
So God just hold her hand that's all
And if she should stumble please don't let her fall

God bless America again...

You know I don't understand to everythin' I'm readin' here
About what's wrong with America
And if you don't have a lotta good learnin'
I guess there's a lotta things you don't understand
But let me say this God she's like a mother to me
And though all I am or ever hope to be I owe to you and to her

Wash her pretty face...

JUST A CLOSER WALK WITH THEE
(Traditional)
« © '49 Bridge Building Music, BMI »

I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be

When my feeble life is o'er time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shores to Thy shores

Just a closer walk with Thee...

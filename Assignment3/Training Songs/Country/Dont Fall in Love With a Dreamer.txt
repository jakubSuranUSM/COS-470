Just look at you sitting there 
You never looked better than tonight 
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay 
Like I've done so many times 
I was so sure this would be the night 
You'd close the door 
And want to stay with me 
And it'd be so easy 
To tell you I'd wait 
Like I've done so many times 

Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Because he'll always take you in 
Just when you think 
You've really changed him 
He'll leave you again 
Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Because he'll break you every time 

So put out the light and just hold on 
Before we say goodbye 
Now it's morning 
and the phone rings and ya say 
You gotta get your things together 
You just gotta leave 
Before you change your mind 
And you know 
What I was thinking I'd turn around 
If you'd just ask me one more time 
Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Because he'll always take you in 
Just when you think 
You've really changed him 
He'll leave you again 
Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Because he'll break you every time 
so put out the light and just hold on 
Before we say goodbye

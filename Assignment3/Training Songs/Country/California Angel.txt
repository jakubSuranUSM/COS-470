California Angel, well I dream of you each night
Well I'm back here in Texas, but you're still on my mind
We were in the Golden State, when we held each other tight
California Angel, well I dream of you each night

Well, since we met I can't forget the sweet taste of your lips
Wel,l every time I think of you my heart just goes a-flip
The wine they make up north there, never make me feel this way
I only hope to hold you in my arms again someday

California Angel, well I dream of you each night
Well I'm back here in Texas, but you're still on my mind
We were in the Golden State, when we held each other tight
California Angel, well I dream of you each night

Oh well you shook me like an earthquake, when I looked into your eyes
I kissed again on a thousand times, then said our goodbyes
The words I whispered in your ears on the night we met were true
The memory of our sweet love just breaks my heart in two

California Angel, well I dream of you each night
Well I'm back here in Texas, but you're still on my mind
We were in the Golden State, when we held each other tight
California Angel, well I dream of you each night
California Angel, well I dream of you each night

These very moments as they pass
It's like you're just dreaming of busting someone else
Hands they hold a candle to the pages
These days they go so fast
These days are ours

[Chorus]
Follow the lights that line the streets
Connecting telephones
Follow the lights from house to house
And they will lead you home
They will lead you home
'Cause there was never anywhere to go
There was never anywhere to go
But home

If every second year is true
Our love is strong enough to guide the way we walk through
Hands inside of hands
Hearts inside of hearts
Like eyes closed
Side by side and through

[Chorus]

If everything we are is true
Our memories are attics in those houses on the hill
Our love is there above us holding everything so still
And we are always here
Yes we are always here

So follow the lights that line the streets
Connecting telephones
Follow the lights from house to house
And they will lead you home
They will lead you home
'Cause there was never anywhere to go
There was never anywhere to go
There was never anywhere to go
But home, home

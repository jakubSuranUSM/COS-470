I cut my teeth on gumbo rock
Benny Spellman and Doctor John
Sweet Irma Thomas and Frog man Henry
Use to boogie woogie all night long
Tho I love rock and roll the acoustic guitar
Was the only way I had of becoming a star
I knew it recognized and traveling around
But they won't play my record in my ol' hometown 

If I had saxophones
Big baritone, cleanin' up the muddy breaks
If I had Saxophones
I could get some recognition from 
That Mobile Alabama DJ 

Livin' by the ocean sometimes I get the notion
To take my Jane to Alabama
We hang out in a funky little bar 
They call it the Shipwreck lounge
Well, we get kinda drunk and we play rock and roll
Grabbin' everybody right down in their soul
When we get to cookin' something's still wrong
There's still something missing from them good old songs 

If we had saxophones
Big baritone, cleaning up the muddy breaks
If we had saxophones
I could make that joint shimmy like a big
California earthquake 

If we had saxophone
Big baritone, cleaning up the muddy breaks
If we had saxophone
I could get some recognition from 
That Mobile Alabama DJ

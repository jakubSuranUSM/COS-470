I ain't never been with a woman long enough, for my boots to get old
We've been together so long now they both need to be sewed
If I ever settle down you'd be my kind 
And it's a good time for me to head on down the line

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm the kinda man likes to get away 
Like to start dreamin' about tomorrow today
Never said that I love you, even thought it's so
Where's that duffle bag of mine it's time to go

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gona be leavin' at the break of dawn 
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
So I'll sneak out that door couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a tear drop in your eye

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I never had a damn thing but what I had 
I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rambler and I guess I always will

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

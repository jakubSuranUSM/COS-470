Save A Corner Of Your Heart for me
Keep it for a rainy day
Just a little touch
You won't miss it much
Won't you save, save it for me

Well I'm not the kind who keeps track of time
Still I've seen the seasons change
It's such a subtle move, such a gentle groove
You don't feel it slip away

[REPEAT CHORUS]
Oh it can't be long we must carry on
There's so much we have to do
But every time I hear lovers whisper near 
I will always think of you, won't you...

[REPEAT CHORUS]
[BRIDGE:]
Just toe the line for now
I'll get back there somehow
Give it a chance you'll see

REPEAT CHORUS

Out on Highway 64
Sat a Mustang and a GTO
They were revvin' engines and talkin' trash
They'd run for titles, they'd run for cash

All the way, all the way to that Hardin County line

There'd be no backin' out of this
They were ?bout to see who was the best
They were on the mark and set to go
Ready to rock and a-ready to roll

All the way, all the way to that Hardin County line

Well, the engines screamed and the rubber burned
As the Mustang hit its fourth turn
And the GTO was a-closin' fast
You could see the smoke, you could smell the gas

All the way, all the way to that Hardin County line

I never knew who won the race
They disappeared without a trace
Every time I drive that stretch of road
I feel a chill runnin' through my bones

All the way, all the way to that Hardin County line
All the way, all the way to that Hardin County line

The summer days are gone
Along with you they disappeared
And left me here
Just like the falling leaves
I watched you turn and drift away
Nothing stays
Don't want to face the fall alone
But it's your nature to move on

Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee

Spent the holidays with a man made out of snow
Ho ho ho
Kept on building fires
But they didn't ease the chill
Nothing will
This has been the hardest time
Winter has the longest nights

Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee

I'll count the days until the spring
And hope it brings you back to me
Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Be there for you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee

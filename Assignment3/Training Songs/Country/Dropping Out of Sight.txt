I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile I'll be crying and crying's not my style
If they ask you how I took it say I smiled but I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile

This town can do without me for a laughing stock
Since she's gone I'm in a funny state of shock
And I'm so troubled I could walk a thousand miles
So I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile

If you don't see me living like I did you'll know the coward in me went and hid
Before this same old circle drives me wild I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
Yes I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile

Dear John, oh, how I hate to write
Dear John, I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me
And he handed me a letter I was just as happy as I could be
For the fighting was all over and the battle have been won
Then I opened up the letter and that started, dear John

Dear John, oh, how I hate to write
Dear John, I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

Will you please send back my picture, my husband wants it now
And when I tell you who I'm wedding I know you won't care, dear anyhow
Now the ceremony has just started and tonight I'll wed your brother Don
Will you please wish us happiness forever, dear John?

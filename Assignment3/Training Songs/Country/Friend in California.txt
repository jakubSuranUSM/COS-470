L.A. traffic is bad this time of year
But there's a friend of yours in California
Sure wishes you were here
And as you lay your head on your pillow tonight just remember

There's a friend of yours in California sure misses you
You've got a friend in California that misses you
You've got a friend in California that sure misses you
Fort Worth can get cold this time of year

But this southern Californian sun is warm
You should be here
And as you lay your head on your pillow tonight just remember
There's a friend of yours in California sure misses you

You've got a friend in California that misses you
You've got a friend in California that sure misses you
You've got a friend in California that misses you
You've got a friend in California that sure misses you

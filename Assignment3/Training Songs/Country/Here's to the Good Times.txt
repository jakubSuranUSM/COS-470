Let’s turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut ’em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight

Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don’t look back ’cause

Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes
Here’s to the good times, while there’s still time

Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
And park it way back, fog it on up
Singin’ ohh, ohh
Radio spillin’ from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin’ on a branch by the river
That’s a memory that’ll get you when you look back

Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes
Here’s to the good times, while there’s still time

Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don’t look back ’cause

Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes
Here’s to the good times

Here’s to the good times and the moonshine
And the blue eyes under the moonlight
Here’s to the good times

Well here's to the good times, livin' on moonwine
Loving you all night, under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
While there's still time

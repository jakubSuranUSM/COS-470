I've tried to make the most out of a hopeless situation
But turning something wrong into something right
But everything I do brings out the worst in you
Seems we always wind up gettin' in a fight
I tell our friends again it's just a phase we're going through
It's the kind of trouble you know that won't ever last
But the farther down I go and the more I think I know
We've headed down a rough and rocky path
So if you love me like you say you really love me why you wanna put me to the test
Yeah if you don't want me it won't disappoint me I just wanna give my heart a rest
I try to rise above the petty gossip of this town
I try to keep my nose clean and my eyes open wide
But people talk so much it's hard to stay in touch
With the way you really feel down deep inside
Oh the sound of rolling thunder keeps on calling out to me
Way out on the highway is the place I wanna be
It's hard to make it work when I feel just like a jerk
And the past's the only future that I see
So if you love me like you say
Yeah I just wanna give my heart a rest
Yeah I just wanna give my heart a rest

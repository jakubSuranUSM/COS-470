In this proud land we grew up strong we were wanted all along
I was taught to fight taught to win I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face I've changed my name but no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up cause you have friends don't give up you're not beaten yet
Don't give up I know you can make it good

Though I saw it all around I never thought that I could be affected
I thought that we would be the last to go it is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home the place that I was born on the lakeside
And as daylight broke I saw the earth the trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up you still have us
Don't give up we don't need much of anything
Don't give up cause somewhere there's a place there's a place where we belong

Got to walk out of here I can't take anymore
I'm gonna stand on that bridge keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come and whatever may go
That river's flowing that river's flowing

Moved on to another town tried hard to settle down
For every job so many men so many men no one needs
Don't give up cause you have friends don't give up you're not the only one
Don't give up no reason to be ashamed don't give up you still have us
Don't give up now we're proud of who you are
Don't give up you know it's never been easy
Don't give up cause I believe there's a place there's a place where we belong

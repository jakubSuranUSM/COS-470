Well I guess you must have had a change of heart
You don't treat me like you used at the start
You're campaign of love once was a work of art
But I guess you must have had a change of heart
Guess I took too much for granted anyway
But it's just cause I'd believe those things you'd say
Not so long ago you'd swore we're never part
Well I guess you must have had a change of heart

Well goodbye to all those castles in the air
And goodbye to all the plans we used to share
They were fragrance of a dream that fell apart
Now they're gone because you had a change of heart
They're all gone because you had a change of heart

This here a true story about ghetto love 
This shit that happened to a young nigga like Mac ya heard me 
Check it 

I met you at a fast food spot with your sista 
Lookin' at my lips like you wanted me to kiss ya 
Told me your name And I told you Mac 
We exchanged phone number...Like that 
Off top you told me that you had a man 
But we can talk but that's as far as it go and I said I understand 
Even though I wanted you and you knew 
I was waiting for this nigga to slip up so you can be my boo 
I had a wet dream I fucked you and you screamed my name 
But when I woke up, all I had was some nut stains 
Your baby daddy was useless and abusive 
But me I treat you like you was exclusive 
And even though he gave you drama 
Long as y'all was together you didn't holla
And you knew I was clockin' dollas 
I was mad but it kinda turned me on in fact 
If I was your nigga I guess the next nigga would feel that 

[Chorus: ] 
The pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin' g 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin, g Callin me callin me 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket, Callin me callin me 

[Phone rings] 

[Mac] Hello? 
[Peaches] Hey baby how you doin'? 
[Mac] Who dis is? 
[Peaches] This me 
[Mac] Oooohhh baby what's up? 
[Peaches] Hey I was jus... 
[Mac] what's happenin'? 
[Peaches} I was just wondering if you were coming over tonight? 
[Mac] Well I don't know ya dig. I got studio time all night a shit and I 
got a flight in the morning 
[Peaches] Plleeeasssee? Mac I miss you 
[Mac] All right I'm on my way 
[Mac]The first time I hit the cat I ain't know how to act 
It was callin' me back 
[Peaches]mmmm Mac 

Momma told you was no good but you fucked me so good 
I rushin' home from studio session to meet you where ever, no questions 
Tellin' my niggas "I'm a holla at ya" 
This camouflage love every other night got me missin' flights 
You started stressin' me 
And you start depressing me 
But before I could leave you alone you start undressing 
And I remember seeing Hickies on your neck 
They wasn't mine I was in Cali on the movie set, baby girl 
what about respect you said you love me when I'm up in them guts 
We tend to say strange thangs when we caught up in them ???
My nigga Fiend was tellin' me you don't deserve me 
But a niggas gone do what he want to do ya heard me 
I'm a let this go by saying you'll always be apart of me 
I just can't answer you when that pussy call me 

[Chorus: ] 

[Mac talking] 
And it was like the pussy was just callin' me nigga 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Real niggas feel me

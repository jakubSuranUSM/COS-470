It?s Friday night, you must be alone
That's the only time you'd ever phone
But if you drop by don't be surprised
'Cause darling, I won't be there tonight

I'm dancing your memory away in the arms of a stranger
For now I'm okay, my heart's out of danger
Tonight while I'm waltzing as the band softly plays
I'm getting by, one song at a time, dancing your memory away

Once, twice, tell me how many times
Was I a fool for your lying eyes
But I won't be your fool anymore
At least not while I'm out on the floor

I'm dancing your memory away in the arms of a stranger
For now I'm okay, my heart's out of danger
Tonight while I'm waltzing as the band softly plays
I'm getting by, one song at a time, dancing your memory away

I'm dancing your memory away in the arms of a stranger
For now I'm okay, my heart's out of danger
Tonight while I'm waltzing as the band softly plays
I'm getting by, one song at a time, dancing your memory away

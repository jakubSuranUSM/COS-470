I've heard it said before
If you don't care no more
Got to pick up tracks
Don't look back
Walk on out that door

I tell my friends it's easy
She's never on my mind
My life is so much better
From the day I said goodbye

When I tell myself I'm free
You know I'm only fooling me
'Cause no matter what I do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you

I tried to hide my pain
With a taste of the fast lane
But no abuse will shake you loose
'Cause I still feel the same

I thought I could forget you
But that was just a lie
I'm just not the same without you
Don't even want to try

When I tell myself I'm free
You know I'm only fooling me
'Cause no matter what I do
I can't get over you
I can't get over you

I don't know how it started
I don't know where I stand
I just want to be back
In your arms again

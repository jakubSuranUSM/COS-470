Oh ley-he-he-he, ah-le-oh-lay-he-he-he
D'yo-del-ay-he-he, d'yo-del-ay-hee

I just received your letter
You're down and out, you say
At first I thought I would tell you
To travel on the other way

But in my memory lingers
All you once were to me
I'm going to give you another chance
To prove what you can be

Any old time you want to come back home
Drop me a line and say, no more you'll roam
You had your chance to play the game fair
And when you left me, sweetheart you only left a load of care

Now that you're down I'm going to stick by you
If you will only say your roaming days are through

You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you wanna come back home

You'll find me right here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you wanna come back home, home, home

Though it happened long ago 
The hurt just won't let go
And it's burning a hole in my mind
I see her and I see you 
And the things we used to do
And it's burning a hole in my mind
I said I'd forget and I tried 
But my heart tells my tongue that it lied
Though I tried to forgive every moment
 I live is a torture the devil designed
In my mind's eye I see how you made a fool of me 
And it's burning a hole in my mind
(Though it happened long ago the hurt just wouldn't let go
is a torture the devil designed)
In my mind's eye I see how you made a fool of me
And it's burning a hole in my mind
 It's burning a hole in my mind

I was just a stranger passin' through your town
Somethin' bout you baby made me want
It made me want made me want to settle down
I gotta keep rollin' rollin' rollin' gotta keep rollin'
Gotta keep rollin' night and day day and night

My daddy was a trucker my son's trucker's son
Love that rig I'm drivin' and the high
I said the high Lord the highway that I'm on

I gotta keep rollin'

I like your kind of lovin' I'd like to hang around
Sun came up this morning and led me from your town

I gotta keep rollin'

I like that quiet country can't stand the city strife
Guess that I'll keep rolling rolling all my life

I gotta keep rollin'
My daddy was a trucker

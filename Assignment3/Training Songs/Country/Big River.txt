Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry cry cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

Well I met her accidental in St Paul Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl that southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you Big River when you called

Then you took me to St Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone said boy she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now won't you batter down by Boton Rouge River Queen roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans
Go on I've had enough dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you Big River more than me

Yeah I pulled into Nachez yesterday down the river
You know there's not much there to make you stay very long
When I left it was raining so nobody saw me crying
Big river why's she treatin' me this way

Well I taught the weeping willow how to cry cry cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die
Yeah I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I made you a list you can choose from
So I can  know what you want from me
All you have to do is to choose one
It's as simple as ABC
I could be

[Chorus]
A, lover
Or b, true
C, no one else but you
And if those choices aren't enough
I could be 
D, evoted
E, ternally to your love
Or how about
All of the above

I'm just trying to make things easy
There's no answer that you'd regret
But if the decision was left up to me
I kinda like the last one best
I could be

[Chorus]

Bridge
This is the one time
No matter how you choose
You can't lose

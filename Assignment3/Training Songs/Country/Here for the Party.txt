Well I'm an eight ball shooting double-fisted drinking son of a gun
I wear my jeans a little tight
Just to watch the little boys come undone
I'm here for the beer and the ball busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here, I'm here for the party

I may not be a ten but the boys say I clean up good
And if I give 'em half a chance
For some rowdy romance you know they would
I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys and their pick-up lines

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here, I'm here for the party

Don't want no purple hooter shooter just some jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here, I'm here for the party

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here, I'm here for the party

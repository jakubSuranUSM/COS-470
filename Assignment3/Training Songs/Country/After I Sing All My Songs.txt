When the show is over and everyone is gone
That's when this lonely feelin' comes along
Everybody loves me while the show is goin' on
But I need someone to love me after I sing all my songs

I smile and play the music while they just cheer me on
But this empty feelin' keeps on hangin' on
Lord, I wish I had somebody just to be my only one
I need someone to hold me after I sing all my songs

After I sing my songs and after the crowd is gone
I need someone to hold me after I sing all my songs

After I sing my songs after the crowd is gone
I need someone to hold me after I sing all my songs

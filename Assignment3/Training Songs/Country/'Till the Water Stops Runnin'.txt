Girl you know he don't like me very much as it is
And if your daddy knew I was here now this could be my very last kiss
But he'll be in the shower at least a half an hour oh baby
I won't miss your hair I promise I swear now baby
All I wanna do is love you till the water stops running
Darling won't you let me hold you till we hear your daddy coming
Can't you see we're safe now as long as he keeps humming
Oh but we gotta stop girl when the water stops running
[ fiddle ]
He's just singing and splashing I care he almost done
But making love when there's danger it's making love much more fun
Yes girl I know but don't let go now baby just kiss my lips as water drips now baby
All I wanna do is love you...
When the water stops running when the water stops

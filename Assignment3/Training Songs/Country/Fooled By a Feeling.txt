Fooled by a feeling, I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to

Fooled by a feeling, lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me, I knew

I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool

You whispered, I love you
All through the night
You made love so easy to believe

Your touch was so gentle
The feeling was right
But I was wrong for believing you loved me

I was fooled by a feeling, I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to

Fooled by a feeling, lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me, I knew

I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool

Fooled by a feeling, I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to

Fooled by a feeling, lying with you
I thought it was love but it was only a touch
And when you left me, I knew

I was fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool
Fooled by a feeling
Now I'm feeling like a fool

By a feeling, I was fooled
I followed my heart right into your arms
Like you wanted me to

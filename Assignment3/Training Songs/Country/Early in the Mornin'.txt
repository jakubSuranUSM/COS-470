Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you
Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you

I can't help it, baby, it happens every time we kiss
My hands start tremblin' and my knees start knockin' and I feel like this
A-something's burnin' deep inside, you know it's settin' my heart on fire
It's gettin' stronger, lasts longer, every time I think of you
And that's

Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you
Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you

Adam said to Eve, "Hey, baby, where you been all my life?"
I've been looking for a lover waiting to discover what I found tonight
A-something's burnin' deep inside, you know it's settin' my heart on fire
It's gettin' stronger, lasts longer, every time I think of you
And that's

Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you
Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you

Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you
A-one more
Early in the morning
Middle of the afternoon
Late in the evening, baby, that's when I think about you

Early in the morning

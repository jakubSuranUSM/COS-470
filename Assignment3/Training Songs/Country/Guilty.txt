I've been accused convicted and condemned the trial's over and now I face the end
Is this your way of telling me we're through when all I'm guilty of is loving you
You were the judge the jury all in one you found me guilty and now my terms begun
I must confess I've never been untrue and all I'm guilty of is loving you
Loving you and now I'm losing you losing you for things I didn't do
Please let your heart consider and appeal for now you know exactly how I feel
Don't punish me for things I didn't do when all I'm guilty of is loving you
Yes all I'm guilty of is loving you

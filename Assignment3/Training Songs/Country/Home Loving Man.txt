I'm a fool fool woman that's all alone
Just didn't know where I had a home
I left the good man to play with life
Bought myself some heartaches double price
I want my baby I need my baby
I gotta get back to my baby don't you understand
Cause I miss my loving from my home loving man
You'll never know the feeling or understand
Till you've been loved by a home loving man
I want my baby my home loving baby

Just a silly quarrel and I was gone
My leavin' made a shamble of our happy home
My little parakeet keeps a callin' his name
And the woman inside me is doin' the same
I want my baby I need my baby
The lights have failed and the thrill is gone
I gotta get back to my man at home
You'll never know the feeling or understand
Till you've been loved by a home loving man
I want my baby my home loving baby
I want my baby my home loving baby
I want my baby my home loving baby

I am dreaming, tonight, of an old southern town
And the best friend that I ever had
For I've grown so weary of roaming around
And I'm going home to my dad

Your hair has turned to silver and I know you're failing too
Daddy, dear, oh, daddy, I'm coming back to you
You made my childhood happy but still I longed to roam
I've had my way, but now I'll say, I long for you and for home

Dear daddy, you shared all my sorrows and joys
You tried hard to bring me up right
I know you'll still be one of the boys
I'm starting back home tonight

Your hair has turned to silver and I know you're failing too
Daddy, dear, oh, daddy, I'm coming back to you
You made my childhood happy but still I longed to roam
I've had my way, but now I'll say, I long for you and for home

I've had my way, but now I'll say
I long for you and for home

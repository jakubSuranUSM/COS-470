Danna this is the day he's takin' you away from me
And Danna seems only yesterday all your love belonged to me
And now you're walkin' down the aisle you look at me and I try to smile
It's the hardest thing I ever had to do I'm losing you
You're a picture of beauty in your gown of satin white
I know you're happy I see it in your eyes
Oh I've seen this day a comin' till now I never knew
Just how much I'm gonna miss you how much I love you

Danna I watch your misty eyes I'll try not to embrace you
But Danna I never realized that this would be so hard day
And now I hear the preacher say who will get his bride away
And I'll put your hand in his goodbye my world goodbye my little girl
You're a picture of beauty in your gown of satin white
I know you're happy I see it in your eyes mhm mhm

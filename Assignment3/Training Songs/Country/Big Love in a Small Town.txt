Never moved to the big ol city
Like a lot friends I know
Had my eye on something closer
Not far down the road
Bucking hay on a flatbed chevy
Green eyes and a working tan
Just a few short years together
And we ain't doing bad

We got a diesel dually
20 acres out in the boonies
Smack dab in middle is a little house
Raising beans and babies
What more could you want for what you've found
Big love
In a small town

Sittin out on the porch in the evening?
Sippin on sweet ice tea
Downtown glowin in the distance
How good could it be
If all they got is a high rise penthouse
Livin 40 stories up
Champagne in the back of a limo
We ain't missing much

We got a diesel dually
20 acres out in the boonies
Smack dab in middle is a little house
Raising beans and babies
What more could you want for what you've found
Big love

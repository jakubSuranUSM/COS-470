I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A - Eleven

I just came in here from force of habit
I don't intend to spend too much time in here
But I heard you *matchin' for the music
And if you play A- Eleven - there'll be tears

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A - Eleven

This used to be our favorite spot
And when she was here it was heaven
It was here she told me that she loved me
And she always played A - Eleven

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A - Eleven...

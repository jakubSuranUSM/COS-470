I said I'd never do it again I swore my way that I would mend
But you cheated dear and that's a sin here I am I'm drunk again

I'm drunk because that you are gone at the bar I'm standing all alone
Drowning my sorrows deep within here I am I'm drunk again

I don't like this life of mine drinking whiskey beer and wine
Dear I know this is the end here I am I'm drunk again

I'm drunk because that you are gone
Here I am I'm drunk again

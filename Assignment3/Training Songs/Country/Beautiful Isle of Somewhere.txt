Somewhere the sun is shining somewhere the songbirds dwell
Hush then your sad repining God lives and all is well
Somewhere, somewhere beautiful isle of somewhere

Land of the truth where we live anew beautiful isle of somewhere
Somewhere the load is lifted close by an open gate
Somewhere the clouds are rifted somewhere the angels wait
Somewhere, somewhere beautiful isle of somewhere

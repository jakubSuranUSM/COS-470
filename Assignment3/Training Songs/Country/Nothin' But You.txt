Daddy used to tell me "Don't you drag your feet" 
"Never seen a good intention that a man could eat" 
Well, I got about a million things I need to do 
I don't want to think about nothin' but you 

[Chorus]
Everybody talk about Maybellene 
Yellow rose of Texas and the sweet sixteen 
Well, I don't want to hear about no Peggy Sue 
I don't want to think about nothin' but you
 
I don't need no money, no fancy car 
House up on the hill where all the rich folks are 
Well, they can have the whiskey, keep the cocaine, too 
I don't want to think about nothin' but you 

[Chorus: x2]

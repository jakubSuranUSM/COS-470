She's got a sticker on her pickup says made by Smith & Wesson
She's a little Texas twister in a big old black Stetson
She's an angel in red ropers and a devil in blue jeans
She's every cowgirl's nightmare and she's every cowboy's dream

She can rope and ride 'em bareback and tango with the best
Brand a longhorn, down a longneck, Lord tame the whole wild west
She's the cutest, toughest, sweetest, roughtest gal I've ever seen
She's every cowgirl's nightmare and she's every cowboy's dream

She's got all them desperados just desperate for a dance
While she's burning up the sawdust Lord they're bucking for a chance
With a tiny little two-step she canstart a stampede
'Cause she's every cowgirl's nightmare and every cowboy's dream

She can rope and ride 'em bareback and tango with the best
Brand a longhorn, down a longneck, Lord tame the whole wild west
She's the cutest, toughest, sweetest, roughtest gal I've ever seen
She's every cowgirl's nightmare and she's every cowboy's dream

Ain't she the cutest, thoughtes, sweetest, roughest gal that you ever seen
She's every cowgirl's nightmare and she's every cowboy's dream

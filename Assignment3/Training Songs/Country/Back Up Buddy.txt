[Chorus]
Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
I know you want her but the answer is 'No sir'
Back up buddy don't you come any closer, she's mine all mine

Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you

[Chorus]

Oh buddy I've seen you making your play for the baby doll on my arm
You'd better back up and get out of my way, I'd hate to do you harm
I'll give you a hint that'll help you a lot, get a doll that's all your own
I'll give you most any thing I got but leave my baby alone

[Chorus]

I'm crazy in love and maybe that's why I'm a little bit jealous too
So back away boy, don't give her the eye, don't make me mad at you
I never have been the troublesome kind but it never too late to start
And trouble is what the joker will find that flirts with my sweetheart

[Chorus]

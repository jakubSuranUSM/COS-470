Drop Kick Me, Jesus 
(Chorus)
Drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life
End over end, neither left nor to right
Straight through the heart of them righteous uprights
Drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life
Make me, oh make me, Lord more than I am
Make me a piece in your master game plan
Free from the earthly temptations below
Iâ€™ve got the will, Lord if youâ€™ve got the toe
(Chorus)
Bring on the brothers whoâ€™ve gone on before
And all of the sisters whoâ€™ve knocked on your door
All the departed dear loved ones of mine
Stick them up front in the offensive line
(Chorus 2x)
Oh, drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life

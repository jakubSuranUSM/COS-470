Never saw you look quite so pretty before.
Never saw you dressed quite so lovely, what's more.
I could hardly wait to keep our date this lovely 
Easter morning,
And my heart beat fast as I came through the door for:

In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it,
You'll be the grandest lady in the Easter Parade. 
I'll be all in clover, and when they look you over
I'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter Parade.

On the Avenue, Fifth Avenue,
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.
 
In my Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it,
I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter Parade.
You'll be all in clover, and when they look me over
You'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter Parade.

On the Avenue, Fifth Avenue,
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.
Oh, you may write a sonnet about my Easter bonnet
And of the girl you're taking to the Easter Parade.

I've been living a new way
Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gathering
And the storm will wreck our home

For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching
From the window up above

You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But it's best to know you
And the way your heart can sin

I thought we belong together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching
From the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
Heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong

But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never loose his love
I was wrong I was watching
From the window up above

How I wish I could be dreaming
And wake up to an honest love 
I was wrong for I was watching
From the window up above

Big silver buckles and pre-faded jeans
White knuckle rides on the bucking machine
He rode into my life looking just like a sunset
Turned out to be a bad dream I'd like to forget

Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
They'll look you in the eye and lie with their white hats on
Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
It's just wham bam, thank you ma'm and they're gone

I traded my boots and saddle for a ticket to Seattle
Get me off from underneath these western skies
I'm tired of old blue jeans and if I hear one more
'Howdy, little lady', well I think I'm gonna scream

Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
They'll look you in the eye and lie with their white hats on
Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
It's just wham bam, thank you ma'm and they're gone

Don't shoot straight like they used to

Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
They'll look you in the eye and lie with their white hats on
Cowboys don't shoot straight like they used to
It's just wham bam, thank you ma'm and they're gone

I left for work in a hurry
Rushed out the door without saying goodbye
I didn't tell her I loved her this morning
But I'll tell her tonight
I thought to myself

And as I hurried off toward the highway
This truck out of nowhere caught me by surprise
He missed me by inches of my life
that's in front of my life

I guess that's the reason
That they say
Dance every dance
And live each day
As though it's your last
And tell those who you love
How you feel
Before it's too late

Life is around
Here and now
We only go around
Just one time
So embrace them
don't waste them
For these are the days of our lives

As soon as my legs stopped shaking
I took a deep breath 
And turned my car around
Oh I'm gonna take that vacation
That we talked about

Starting right now
Although I know tomorrow we'll be here
Tomorrow may not always be here for me
Cause nothing in life is for certain
But death's guaranteed

And that's the reason that I say
Dance every dance
And live each day
As though it's your last
And tell those who you love
How you feel
Before it's too late

Life is around
Here and now
We only go around
Just one time
So embrace them 
don't waste them for 
These are the days of our lives

Time
You should set aside some time for yourself
Time for just you and no one else
Time to justify how it's for the best
For both of us

Home
Home is where I always want to be
Home is there for you and is for me
Home is where I never want to leave

And don't you know
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
Nothing has the strength to pull me through
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
I've always been the one to follow you

In town to see this man
He asks me how I've been
He can see I'm out of frame
A wish that never came

This vehicle has stalled
The engine's not that strong
I wait to be picked up
You grace me with your touch

And don't you know
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
Nothing has the strength to pull me through
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
I've always been the one to follow you

Cause you're so sure
And I
I want to be sure

And don't you know
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
Nothing has the strength to pull me through
Nothing gives me pleasure like you do
I've always been the one to follow you
I've always been the one to follow you
I've always been the one to follow you
I've always been the one to follow you
I've always been the one to follow you

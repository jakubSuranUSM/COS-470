Two country kids in love and living day to day
Tryin' to make ends meet in a little house with a baby on the way
His music dreams were callin' but he did not hear
Sometimes failure can be a young man's greatest fear
She said I'm right here with you till the end
And if everything falls over we'll just start over again

In a world that's going crazy
No one cares any more
I don't have the answers but one thing I know for sure
As long as we're together, no matter what we face
Life will have a way of falling into place

It seems so long ago since we left that town
And we both agreed we've had some hard times on our way around
The fear of falling gets me now and always will
But like that little house, the love we have is standing still
We've been married now for ten great years
And she's still here to say the things that I need to hear

In a world that's going crazy
No one cares any more
I don't have the answers but one thing I know for sure
As long as we're together, no matter what we face
Life will have a way of falling into place

As long as we're together, no matter what we face
Life will have a way of falling into place
Life will have a way of falling into place, into place

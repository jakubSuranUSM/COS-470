When the young girls start to dance at the rock 'n' roll shows
Heaven knows they're making love to you
And it's a young man's chance, go on and dance
You've got your reasons too, the girls been looking at you

Dance, dance
So much romance gets lost from staying alone
Dance, dance
You've got all night go on, you can take this song
And dance, dance, dance

So my girl came to dance at the rock 'n' roll show
And you know she's making love to me
I knew from her first glance, I'd take a chance
And now I'm feeling free that girl will only dance with me

Dance, dance
So much romance gets lost from staying alone
Dance, dance
You've got all night go on, you can take this song
And dance, dance, dance

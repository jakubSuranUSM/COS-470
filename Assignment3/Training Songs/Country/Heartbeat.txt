We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We gotta keep on running til' we see the sun

Oh you gotta fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause love someone, love them all the same
If you LOVE someone, love them all the same

Oh I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
If you can love somebody, love them all the same
You gotta love somebody, love them all the same
I'm singing, oh, I'm feeling your heartbeat

I'm tryin' to put it all back together
I've got a story and I'm tryin' to tell it right
I've got the kerosene and the desire
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night
Oh you gotta fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

Oh I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
If you can love somebody, love them all the same
You gotta love somebody, love them all the same
I'm singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat

I know the memories rushing into mind 
I want to kiss your scars tonight 
I'm laying here, 
'Cause you've gotta try, you've gotta let me in, let me in

Oh I feel your heartbeat
And oh, you're comin' around, comin' around, comin' around
Gotta love somebody, you gotta, you gotta love somebody
You gotta, I'm singing, oh, I feel your heartbeat, 
All your heartbeat, yeah, I said, 
All your heartbeat, yeah, 
All your heartbeat

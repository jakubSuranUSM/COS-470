He was a friend of mine he was a friend of mine
He died without a penny he didn't have a dime he was a friend of mine
He died neath the midnight sun he died neath the midnight sun
His wanderin' days are over his loneliness is done
Yes he died neath the midnight sun

I have a lot of buddies in my time but he was the best buddy I ever had
The kind of friend you can lean on and turn to when times 're goin' bad
He could have been a rich man or maybe he could be the President
But he was just a friend of mine the one who had died without a cent
I soughed away and cried I soughed away and cried
Tears fell like raindrops the night my best friend died
He was a friend of mine he was a friend of mine

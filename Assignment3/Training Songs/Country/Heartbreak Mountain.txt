Well I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain yeah I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Hill
I'm goin' up on Heartbreak Mountain cause I've lost my will to live
It was six o'clock yesterday mornin' when my sweet baby packed up to leave
It was six o'clock yesterday mornin' and I ain't done nothin' but grieve
Well I'm goin' up on...
[ banjo ]
Well I cried and I begged and I pleaded for my sweet baby not to go
Like the leaf that's caught in a whirl wind where she's gone now I'll never know
Well I'm goin' up on...
[ organ ]
Now why does a man let a woman turn him into a hollow shelf
And walk up and leave him behind her like a ship at sea with no sail
Well I'm goin' up on...

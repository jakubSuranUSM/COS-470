You take my hand
Song starts to play
Softly you hold me
Slowly we sway
You whisper sweet words of love
And I drift away

I feel like I'm falling, under a spell
Whatever you do, you sure do it well
I want to let go, but I need to know where I stand

After the dance is done
And the moment is gone
And the music is faded away
Will I still be the one
After the dance
After the dance is done

We walk together, into the night
A sliver of moon, is just enough light
You look at me, I could get lost in your eyes
You say it's love, maybe it's true
And it would be easy, to give into you
But as much as I want you,
That's how much I want to be sure

After the dance is done
And the moment is gone
And the music is faded away
Will I still be the one
After the dance
After the dance is done

As much as I want you,
That's how much I want to be sure

After the dance is done
And the moment is gone
And the music is faded away
Will I still be the one
After the dance
After the dance is done

After the dance is done
After the dance is done

Everybody's reaching out for someone 
Everybody's knocking at some door
And long before I ever found you 
You're the one that I was reaching for

Just like the trees along the river bend 
Lift up the branches to the sun above
We spent our lifetimes reaching for a friend 
Cause everybody reach someone to love
And everybody's reaching out

I wanted you since the day my life began
I've heard your footsteps running just beyond my mind
Ever since that moment I've been reaching for your hand
Hoping you'd be reaching out for mine
Everybody's reaching out
Everybody's reaching out

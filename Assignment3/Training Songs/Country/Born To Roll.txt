Highway man
That's what they call me
Ridin' on the wind, wild and free
Rollin' stone
Down a desert highway
Chasin' one more dream

Been that way ever since I was young
Don't know what it is that makes me run

There ain't no friends, there ain't no town
There ain't nobody ever slowed me down
There ain't no peace in this gypsy's soul
And like a tumbleweed, guess I was born to roll
Yeah, born to roll

Dashboard lights
In the eyes of a dreamer
I'm addicted, they make me high
No where's home
Yeah I'm still lookin'
Gotta keep movin' if I wanna survive

I've nearly settled down a couple times
And here I go again, sayin' goodbye

There ain't no friends, there ain't no town
There ain't nobody ever slowed me down
There ain't no peace in this gypsy's soul
And like a tumbleweed, guess I was born to roll
Yeah, born to roll

There ain't no peace in this gypsy's soul
And like a tumbleweed, guess I was born to roll
Whoa yeah, born to roll
Born to roll

Highway man, that's what they call me
Ridin' on the wind, wild and free

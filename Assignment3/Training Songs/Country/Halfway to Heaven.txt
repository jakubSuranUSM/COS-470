There's a live oak tree you can still see off ol' 129
You can see the scars its missin' bark
Where it stopped my truck that night
They say I took a swing at my best friend
For tryin' to take my keys
Next thing I knew I was upside down
Thinkin' this is it for me

When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white line
Shinin' down on you
Your hangin' on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
Live your life a better man
When you've been, halfway to heaven

First thing I did was hug my momma
I even hugged my dad
I told them both how much I love them
Never saw daddy cry like that
Started hangin' out with my little brother
Man I never miss a game
I'm in church every Sunday mornin'
I pray everyday

When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white line
Shinin' down on you
Your hangin' on by a thread
Wonderin' which ones your last breath
Knowin' there's so much you have left to do
Live your life a better man
When you've been, halfway to heaven

I won't waste, one minute
Yeah my life's changed
And I'm gonna live it

Like I'm hangin' on by a thread
Wondering which ones my last breath
Knowin' there's so much I have left to do
I live my life a better man
I live my life a better man
Cause I've been, halfway to heaven
Halfway to heaven

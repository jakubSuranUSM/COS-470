You wonder when the Lord will renew the strength within you;
You wonder how, how can He use you as you are.
Seems like you're wasting precious time,
But then a voice comes to remind you (to wait).

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait on the Lord;
You will understand in time.
Why you must wait,
Wait, wait, wait on the Lord;
Yes He hears you,
But for now you must wait on the Lord.

Answers come slowly to your cries of desperation,
But time is His tool, teaching the greatest lessons learned;
So let Him do His work in you,
And watch the miracles come true as you (wait).

[Chorus]

And He wants you to know that
They that wait on the Lord
Shall renew their strength;
They will rise up with wings as eagles,

They will run, not get weary.
They will walk and not faint;
That's a promise to us when we (wait).

[Chorus]

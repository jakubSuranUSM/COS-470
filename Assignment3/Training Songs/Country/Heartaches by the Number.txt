Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay

[Chorus]
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

[Chorus]

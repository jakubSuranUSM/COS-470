Well living in the city puts a lock on your door
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
And you can't appreciate little Things no more
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
I can be Jack and you can be Jill
We can build a house up on top of the hill
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush.

Say goodbye to the smog
Say goodbye to the queues
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
It's been two long years and I've paid my dues
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush

Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush

Gonna get a big farm with a real nice view
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
Get a horse get a dog and some chickens too
Oh yeah Uh huh huh
When I get to thinking that I'm out of touch
I also get to thinking I ain't missing much
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush.

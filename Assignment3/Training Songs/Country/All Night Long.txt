Well the party started early, 
About a quarter-to-three
Just a few close friends, 
Charlie, Troy, and me
We just got started when somebody asked
How long you think this party's gonna last?

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

Well the next door neighbors 
Started raising a fuss
Said you had a party 
And you didn't call us
I said put on your dancing shoes and come along
We'll be here till the cows come home

And that's all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

(Guitar)

We'll be jumping through the windows 
And sneaking down the halls
Dancing on the ceiling, 
Dancing on the wall
The last thing I remember 
'fore the lights went out
I jumped up on the table and I started to shout

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long
(I mean all night long)

I said all night long (all night long)
I said all night long (all night long)
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin'
Gonna boogie-woogie all night long

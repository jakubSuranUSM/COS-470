Oh Lordy me
I feel so bad this mornin'
A but I won't be feelin' bad too long
I'm headed for Hangover Tavern

My head is heavy
My spirit's kinda of low
And every time I feel this way
To Hangover Tavern I go

Well, this bar I'm talkin' about
The shades are pulled down
To keep the sunshine out
The beer is poured in a frosty cup
The good bartender cheers you up

Sayin', hey Lordy me
If you feel bad this mornin'
Then watch your blues just fade away
At Hangover Tavern today

Oh Lordy me
When I woke up this mornin'
I just had to make my way
On down to Hangover Tavern

My throat is dry
There's a [Incomprehensible] around my eye
But I'll have lots of company
At Hangover Tavern for me

On Saturday night we stay out late
The very next day we congregate
I just can't wait for the very first round
Tell the man to turn the jukebox down

'Cause hey, Lordy me
I feel so bad this mornin'
But I'll drink my blues away
At Hangover Tavern today

Hangover Tavern, here I come

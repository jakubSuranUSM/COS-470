You said you love me and me alone and that you'd always be mine my own
But someone new came and you did not kept to remember so you forgot
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly you broke the vow that you made to me
With all my heart I believed in you but careless darlin' you were untrue
[ steel ]
Your last goodbye will forever ring within my ear and full heartaches bring
I kept my promise I kept my vow but you kept nothing it's so plain now
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly...
[ guitar ]
Now if tomorrow those bygone years those older mem'ries should bring you tears
Think of our parting that luckless day you carelessly threw my love away
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly...

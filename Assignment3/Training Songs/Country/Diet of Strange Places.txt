Starving, I've got this hunger
Growling from deep within
Carving internal thunder
Oh a craving that wears me thin

Well, it's hard to ingest
So many faces
I get my fill but still
Those passersby
Leave me empty on a diet of strange places
It all should enhance my senses
Tell me why
Does the spice of loneliness
Seem all but tasteless
And lingers there
To haunt me from inside
And leaves me

Starving, I've got this hunger
Growling from deep within
Carving internal thunder
Oh a craving that wears me thin

Many a trap
Are set and baited
From tension of temptation of the game
But ones who are fed
Are those who waited
Takes feminine wile
Leaves it curbed and tame
Only time'll find me home
And safely set
But until that time I remain

Starving, I've got this hunger
Growling from deep within
Carving internal thunder
Oh a craving that wears me thin
Oh a craving that wears me thin

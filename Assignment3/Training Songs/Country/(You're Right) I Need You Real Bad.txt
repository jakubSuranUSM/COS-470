If you think I want to please you if you're in my arms and squeeze you
Do anything but leave you you're right I need you real bad
If you think my heart is yearning for you to be returning
If you think the flame's still burning well you're right I need you real bad
I've never thought I'd love someone the way that I love you
But I'll admit this is if I'm really wantin' you
So baby let's on tarry I'm really in a hurry
For me and you to marry you're right I need you so bad
[ guitar - steel ]
If you think I want to please you...

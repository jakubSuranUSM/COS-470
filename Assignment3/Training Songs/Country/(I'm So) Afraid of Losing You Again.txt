Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it costs to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again

[Chorus]
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confessions
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

[Chorus]

I'm so afraid of losing you again

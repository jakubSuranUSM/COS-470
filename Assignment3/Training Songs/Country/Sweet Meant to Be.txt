On a night not unlike this 
With a chill in the wind 
And a moonlit mist 
Daddy took Mama down by the bay 
Kissed her and showed he 
What words cannot say 

They were meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
They were meant to be 
Sweet meant to be, sweet meant to be 

I know in my heart 
I feel it right here 
With you and me darlin' I have no fear 
When our hearts meet on common ground 
Our purpose is clear and our faith is sound 

We are meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
We are meant to be 
Sweet meant to be, sweet meant to be 

You can dream, you can wish, but some things you know 
You got the vision and I got the hope 
Set a course for our mission 
Together we'll carry it home 

They were meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
Sweet meant to be 
They were meant to be 
Sweet meant to be, sweet meant to be

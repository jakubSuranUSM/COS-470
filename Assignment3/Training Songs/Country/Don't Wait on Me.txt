When the sun wakes up in the west, and lays it's head down in the east
When they ordain Madlyn O'hare and she becomes a priest
When a San Diego sailor, comes home with no tatto
When the lights go on at Wrigley Field , I'll be comin' home to you 

But don't wait on me (little darlin'), Lord can't you see (little darlin')
I only go (no farther), No guarantee
Don't wait on me (And when you), That's somethin' I (Just can't do)
Never have and don't (Intend to), Don't wait on me

When the wind don't blow in Chicago, and L.A. is cold and clear
When they unfurl Old Glory, and no one stands to cheer
When my brother in law phones me, and the charges aren't reversed
When the cabbie don't want a bigger tip, I'll be slidin' home from first

So don't wait on me (little darlin'), Lord can't you see (little darlin')
I only go (no farther), No guarantee
Don't wait on me (And when you), That's somethin' I (Just can't do)
Never have and don't (Intend to), Don't wait on me

When you load up on a long shot, and you win by half a nose
When the Fourth of July parade, is called because it snows
When the waiting room is empty, and the Doc says,"come right in" 
When Christmas comes before New Years, I'll be commin' home again

But don't wait on me (little darlin'), Lord can't you see (little darlin')
I only go (no farther), No guarantee
Don't wait on me (And when you), That's somethin' I (Just can't do)
Never have and don't (Intend to), Don't wait on me

Don't wait on me, Don't wait on me, Don't wait on me, Don't wait on me

I am master and slave 
I am sunlight and shadow 
I am all roads to the river 
I am lost, I am saved 
I am beloved and betrayed 
I am all roads to the river 

[Chorus]
And the river runs wide 
And the river runs deep 
And I spit in the eye of safe company 
Gonna dive right down to the undertow 
Cause the deeper I drown, the higher I go 

I am whispering dreams 
I am howling revolution 
I am all roads to the river 
I am valentine sweet 
I am every mother's nightmare 
I am all roads to the river 

[Chorus]

I dream of still waters 
Silent and deep 
I run for the thunder 
That'll drown my fear 

[Chorus]

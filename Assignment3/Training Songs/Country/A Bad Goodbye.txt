I've been bound to leave you,
We've known that for a while.
I'm sure it's something I can't do,
If I can't leave you with a smile.
I don't know how far I'll have to go
Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry.
And in my mind, I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.

Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.

I'm still bound to leave you,
I surely don't know how.
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind says should happen now.

I don't know where we'll go from here,
There may be no way to fly.
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all to clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.

Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.

How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try?
And any way I look, I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad
Goodbye

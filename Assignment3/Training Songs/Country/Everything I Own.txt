I can't shower you with pearls and diamond rings
All I can give are dances in the rain
I can't cover you in satin sheets
But you'll be just as warm
Wrapped up each night
Inside my loving arms

[CHORUS]
I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars
Will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
I can't promise you the life that money buys
But I can promise you a richer life
There's places you may never see
But one thing you can know
I'll be there with you
Wherever we don't go

[REPEAT CHORUS]

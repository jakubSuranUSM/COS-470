Should I know your place 
And my place or undiscovered 
Through a curtain or refinery 
Not certain or temporary 
I should be more considerate 
Of the others on call 
Is the day to day opportunity 
That is my life 
A beautiful case 
Of the unspoiled race 
Which can enter your race 
Quite unknowing 
For certain there are no 
Real changes in the original 
Outtakes of your life 
As a sequel 
Unsuccessful too 
Dumb again 
Walleyed and wounded 
In the capital city 
Under tense evaluation 
Does that have anything to do with dissolving 
My star has put my life 
Under the greatest of scrutiny 
A balancing place 
Between your nose and your face 
A consolidated center 
Of learning 
Making up offers 
Of considerable cost 
Which can enter your life 
As a sequel

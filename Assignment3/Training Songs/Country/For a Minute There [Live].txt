You brushed by me, oh, you came so near 
That I could smell the perfume in your hair 
An old memory, it took me back in time 
And my heart stood still for just one minute there 

For a minute there I forgot where I was 
Remembering only when you used to care 
And as you walked by me I almost touched your arm 
I nearly called your name for a minute there 

The man beside you, he looked so satisfied 
Knowing that's his wedding ring you wear 
It cost him nothing for a lifetime in your arms 
But I'd give all I own for just one minute there 
Yes, I'd give all I own for just one minute there

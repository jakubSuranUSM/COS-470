Sittin' here with you, don't know why I'm blue
Just a feelin' that I've had right from the start
Somethin' 'bout your smile that lingers for awhile
Stirs an old time mem'ry in my heart

Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
Don't mind me I'm not about to cry
It's just a thought that I remember
Left over from a time in days gone by

Don't mind me if I'm a little melancholy
Thinkin' of someone that I love so
Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
You remind me of a girl I used to know

Don't mind me if I'm a little melancholy
Thinkin' of someone that I love so
Don't mind me if I'm a little sentimental
You remind me of a girl I used to know

Just as I am without one plea but that
Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee
Oh lamb of God I come I come

Just as I am and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot
Oh lamb of God I come I come

Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about
With many a conflict and many a doubt
Fightings fears within and without
Oh lamb of God I come I come

Just as I am Thou wilt receive
Will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
Oh lamb of God I come I come

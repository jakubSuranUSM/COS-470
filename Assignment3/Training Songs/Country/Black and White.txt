Aren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
With paper and pen

[Chorus]
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
It's all there, wrong or right
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
In black and white

Can we forget all the good times
And never look back, it is as easy as that
Can we be sure that it's finished
With tears in our eyes, can we say that we tried
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed

[Chorus]

I've told my friends, you've told yours
But opening and closing doors swing both ways
Is it too late

[Chorus]

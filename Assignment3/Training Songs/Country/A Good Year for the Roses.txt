I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say for me

It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go runnin' through my mind, I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

Since I laid my burden down
I feel so much better
So much better
Since I laid my burden down

Since I laid my burden down
Glory, Glory Hallelujah
Since I laid my burden down
Thank you Jesus, Thank you Jesus
Help me lay my burden down
I wanna thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus
Help me lay my burden down
Since I laid my burden down

Since I laid my burden down
Glory, Glory Hallelujah

Took her pills and her magazines
Left her lying in her misery
He was locked up in his room
Colored pinwheels as the sirens wine down the avenue

[Chorus]
Think about it once
Take your time don't fuss
What you got to lose
Everybody choose

Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
All the dog-eared pages on your shell
You never talk except about yourself

All the red eyes in the room
Tried to rearrange your world for you

[Chorus]

Think about it once
What you got to lose
As he pulled his pad and scribbled "suicide"
the county coroner, he shook his head from side to side

He was a little less than pleased
Very pale and very tired
The toil of love had brought them to their knees

[Chorus: x2]

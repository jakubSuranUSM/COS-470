I noticed how you smiled just now surprised that having seen
How I ate up your flattery then lick the platy clean
I've been so starved for pretty words are ever insincere
Till as for me flattery will get you everywhere
So brag me up and make me smile and I'll do things your way
Say pretty words to me and I'll do anything you say
Don't worry if they're true or not the truth is I don't care
And as for me flattery will get you everywhere

Another loves said hurtin' words outil our love was gone
He'd always get the shoe to fit that I'll have to put it on
Say words unkind and soon my mind would close from ear to ear
And as for me flattery will get you everywhere
So brag me up
And as for me flattery will get you everywhere

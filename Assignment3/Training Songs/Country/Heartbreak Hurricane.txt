I'm mighty quiet for thunder,
Shut the shutters on my car.
She had me eatin from her hand,
The first night in the dark.
I did not see the danger, 
Not 'til she blew in,
'Til she left me shakin' like a dry leaf,
In a high lonesome wind.

Heartbreak hurricane.
She's gone but not forgotten,
Lord, I still call her name.
Despite the devastation,
Sweet memories remain,
In the wake of a heartbreak hurricane.

I know it may sound crazy,
But every now and then,
I have a yearning that someday,
She'll blow my way again
I know her name spells trouble,
And I know my heart's at stake,
For a chance to win her love,
It's a chance I'm glad to take.

Heartbreak hurricane,
She's gone but not forgotten,
Lord, I still call her name.
Despite the devastation,
Sweet memories remain,
In the wake of a heartbreak hurricane.

Despite the devastation,
Sweet memories remain,
In the wake of a heartbreak hurricane.

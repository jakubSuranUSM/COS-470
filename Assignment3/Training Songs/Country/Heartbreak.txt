(One heartbreak closer)
Hm

Another, "Almost perfect"
Didn't work, but totally worth it
Better to have loved and lost my mind
Than lose the nerve to even try
Another conversation
Awkward, but the ice is breaking
I've been in some shit relationships
But I've remained an optimist

It's not a game I'm playing
It's not a thrill I'm chasing
More like a space I'm saving
And I don't even know your name

But if it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time
With every, "So close," I'm closer to the rest of my life
Another bad first date (check)
Another, "Nothing left to say" (check)
What I mean is, the way I see it
I'm one heartbreak closer to you
You

Hey baby, can I call you baby? Is that okay?
I don't even know you, but I can't wait to know you someday
Imagine someday when we look back
I'll thank my past for giving me my future better half
I'm sorry for the the time it's taking
But I'ma make it worth the waiting
And all this wrong love that I learned from
Was just practice for the right one

If it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time
With every "So close," I'm closer to the rest of my life
Another, "Just got played" (check)
A shot of bourbon for the pain (check)
What I mean is, the way I see it
I'm one heartbreak closer to you
You

It's kinda strange to miss
Someone I haven't met yet
Someone I haven't kissed yet
But I'll go through it all

If it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time
With every, "So close," I'm closer to the rest of my life
Another sad goodbye (check)
Another sleepless night (check)
What I mean is, the way I see it
I'm one heartbreak closer to you
You
(I'm one heartbreak closer to) you
You
You
One heartbreak closer to you

Call me irresponsible
Call me unreliable
Throw in, undependable too

Do my foolish alibi for you
Well, I'm not too clever
I just adore you

Call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows, I'm inclined to pursue.

Call me irresponsible
Yes, I'm unreliable
But, it's undeniably true
That I'm irresponsibly mad for you.

Call me irresponsible
Yes, I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true
That I'm irresponsibly mad for you.

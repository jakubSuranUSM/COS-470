Lying in my bed I hear the clock tickin', think of you
Turning in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback to moon nights, almost left behind
A suitcase of memories, time after sometime 

You picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you have said
And you say, "go slow, I've fallen behind"
The second hand unwinds
 
If you're lost you can look and you will find me,
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting,
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting,
Time after time....time after time

After your picture fades and darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows, I'm wondering if you're ok
And you say, "go slow, I've fallen behind"
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting, time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting, time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

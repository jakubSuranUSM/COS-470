Who was once a bull-hooking son of a gun
Now who keeps a pint hid out behind chute number one
Who was riding high till a pretty girl rode him to the ground
Any kid knows where to find me, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

In the riding and the roping I was closing in on number one
Now in dreams at night I ride on that silver saddle I never won
Since she left me the whiskey takes me to the rodeo grounds
Where the cowboys think I'm handy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

I could ride em all the bulls and the broncs knew I was boss
But the ride that woman took me on broke a whole lot more than this old cowboy's bones
While the tears on my makeup melts my painted smile into a frown
The crowd thinks I'm a dandy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

I could ride em all the bulls and the broncs knew I was boss
But the ride that woman took me on broke a whole lot more than this old cowboy's bones
While the tears on my makeup melts my painted smile into a frown
The crowd thinks I'm a dandy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

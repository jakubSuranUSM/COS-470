Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Empty arms that long for you
And they wait, they wait just for you
And these arms will stay this way
Till you return to them some day

Each lonely night I'll go to bed
Mm-My heart the pillow where you used to lay your head

Empty arms, but not for long
'Cause my man, he is comin' home
And when he, when he walks through that door
These empty arms I'll have no more

Yeah, these empty arms I'll have no more

She lives her life in honky tonks and crowded backstreet bars
A world of make believe that knows no sun or moon or stars
Just a glitter of the great white way and the glare of city lights
Where music's loud she's in the crowd, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past
Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn't right
Now shadows hide her empty pride, a girl in the night

She's sitting there so lonely as she lights a cigarette
The smoke rings rise and in her eyes there seems to be regret
Is she there to tempt the lover in a dress that hugs her tight?
A glass of wine to pass the time, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past
Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn't right
Now shadows hide her empty pride, a girl in the night
Now shadows hide her empty pride, a girl in the night

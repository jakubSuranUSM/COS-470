Indian summer
Abilene
You were new in town
I was nineteen
And sparks flew

They called us crazy
Behind our backs
"Romantic fools"
We just let them laugh
Because we knew

It may be a long shot
We may be lonely down the line
But love knows no reason
And I won't let them make up my mind

My love is riding on this dark horse baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run

Stars are brighter
In the desert sky
No need to wonder or justify
Where this will lead

I wear your locket
Our picture's inside
Inscription says "The joy's in the ride"
And I believe

Something so sacred
Is something worth this kind of fight
'Cause love knows no patience
You can't please everyone all the time

My love is riding on this dark horse baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run

My love is riding on this dark horse baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse

My love is riding on this dark horse baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run

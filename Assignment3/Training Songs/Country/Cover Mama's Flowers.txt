It's been many years now since mom passed away
But there's lots of sweet mem'ries that I have today
And when I see autumn and leaves turning brown
I feel like mama is somewhere around
Don't forget to cover my flowers I still hear my sweet mother say
Be sure to cover my flowers or my flowers will wither away

Yes I remember though it's been so long
My heart feels so heavy and life seems so wrong
I'd give all my treasures and things I might own
To go back to mama's old country home
Don't forget to cover

As I wait in this jungle in this foreign land of people so indifferent to God and to men
It's kill or be killed and I wonder today
If the ones that I'm fighting thinks of mama this way
Don't forget to cover
Be sure to cover my flowers or my flowers will wither away

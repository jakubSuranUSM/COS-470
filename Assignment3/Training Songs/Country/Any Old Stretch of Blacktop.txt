I got money in my pocket 
And a guitar in my hand
These lonely nights without you 
Are more than I can stand
I work like a puppet but it's time 
To cut the strings
Well I hit the ground running 
And I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive 
Headed down a one way track
It won't take too long 
Just you wait and see
As long as it will lead me back to you 
Any old stretch of blacktop will do

North, south, east, or west 
Been everywhere it seems
Hotels rooms and honky tonks 
Don't feel like home to me
I'll be stepping out the rhythm 
While I'm singing a brand new song
And it's knowing where I'm going 
That will keep me moving on

Turn my collar to the wind 
And put my thumb up in the air
Flag a diesel down 
Or catch a bus from anywhere
Colorado, California or even Kalamazoo
As long as it will lead me back to you 
Any old stretch of blacktop will do

I hit the ground running
Alright

North south east or west

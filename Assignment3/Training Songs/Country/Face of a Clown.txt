It's hard for me to smile I feel like crying yet I always manage to grin
Friends won't know the pain that I feel or know the misery I'm in
Everyone thinks I'm happy for I smile and never frown
But looks are deceiving and nobody knows the hurt behind the face of a clown
I've got a little pride my tears I'll hide whenever you're around
You'll never know you hurt me so for I have a face of a clown
I'll try to conceal the pain I feel I won't let it get me down
You won't have a pleasure of knowin' the hurt behind the face of a clown
The hurt behind the face of a clown

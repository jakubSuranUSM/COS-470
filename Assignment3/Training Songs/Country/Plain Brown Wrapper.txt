Lose the jewels, there's diamonds in your eyes
Lose the look, you're painted on disguise
Lose the dress, that hides the fairest prize

Lose the time, this time belongs to me
Lose your mind and let the moments be
Lose your all, you're all I'll ever need

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

Soon the years will surely fade away
Soon the time with lines and shades of gray
Soon the dreams will all be yesterdays

If all that's left is what we're feeling now
All that's changed won't matter anyhow
Rearranged, it's still the same somehow

When the outside's a plain brown wrapper
Still the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside was just for show

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

So lose the jewels
(Plain brown wrapper)
There's diamonds in your eyes
(Plain brown wrapper)

It hides the fairest prize
(Plain brown wrapper)
Rearranged, it's still the same
(Plain brown wrapper)

All the years
(Plain brown wrapper)
On the inside's solid gold
On the outside's just for show
(Plain brown wrapper)

I got a timebomb, in my mind Mom. 
I hear it ticking but I don't know why. 
I call the police, but they don't like me. 
I hear 'em whispering when I walk by. 
I got a landmine in my bloodline. 
I'm not immune to getting blown apart. 
She's like a claymore, that's what she's there for. 
She's waiting 'round here to get blown apart. 
Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train, 
She's gonna kill me. Oh Celeste, oh Celeste. 
I got a timebemb, in my mind Mom, 
It's gonna go off, but I don't know when. 
I need a doctor to extract her. 
I got a feeling she'd get right back in again 
I got a timebemb, in my mind Mom, 
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl 
She's gonna kill me, and I don't mean softly. 
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl 
Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train, 
She's gonna kill me. Oh Celeste, oh Celeste, oh Celeste.

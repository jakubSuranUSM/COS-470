There's a tenderness that i feel, it's very real you see
I can feel your body stir so deep within
Let it be an out of love tonight completely
And let me ask of you one thing

Don't close your eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times i cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight

Well you can lie so close to someone and still feel alone
And though i heard you say you loved me so many times
While you give me love so beautiful and tender
Someone else is in your mind

Don't close your eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times i cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight

Sorry if i cry, feelings run so deep
Many is a time when i'll wake up and find
That i'm crying in my sleep
Look me in the eye, tell me what you see
I'm the one who loves you, i'm the one who needs you
Make this one for me

Don't close your eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times i cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight

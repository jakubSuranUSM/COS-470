D							 A		       G     A
I'm happy to roam I can find my way to the mountains and the ocean foam.

(Riff 1)

    A					                D              G         A
But if I had a map to show me the way to your heart dear I'd follow it home.

(Riff 2)

D                                                A            G        A
Making my way through the dim lit streets of the old town - nowhere to go.

(Riff 1)

A                                              D             G	        A
Wanderin' with the sea wind in my hair I never slow down - I miss you so.

    D                                 A              G    A
The rain outside is beating down, I'm here at home - all alone.

(Riff 1)

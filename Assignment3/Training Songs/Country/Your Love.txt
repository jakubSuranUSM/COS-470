Well, I been washed in the rain an dried in the sun
Had to fight a few rounds with the devil an' I'm still not done
When I finally hit bottom I thought my luck was through
There was one ray a-hope shinin' down and it was you
 
(Your love brought me back again, I'm gonna make it)
(Your love is another chance, I'm gonna take it)
(You gave me an open heart, I'll never break it)
No, I know I never would-a made it without your love (love)
 
I was lost and alone an' out in the cold
And the part-a my life was left, was gettin' hard to hold
I was down so deep in the darkness I could not see
But your hands held a lot of love when they reached for me
 
(Your love brought me back again, I'm gonna make it)
(Your love is another chance, I'm gonna take it)
(You gave me an open heart, I'll never break it)
No, I know I never would-a made it without your love (love)
 
(Your love brought me back again, I'm gonna make it)
(Your love is another chance, I'm gonna take it)
(You gave me an open heart, I'll never break it)
No, I know I never would-a made it without your love (love)
 
Brought me back again, I'm gonna make it
(Your love is another chance, I'm gonna take it)

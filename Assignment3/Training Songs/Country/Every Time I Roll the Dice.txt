She got a roof that don't leak
When the rain's pourin' down
She got a place I can sleep
Where I'll be safe and sound

She got a lock on her door
Oh, but I got the key
She don't walk the floor
But she worries about me

Her love has no strings
Shackles or chains
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
It's like rollin' a seven every time I roll the dice

She got a big ol' smoke wheel
She got a dog that won't bite
She got a heart I can steal
Just like a thief in the night

She got a slow burning fire
She keeps the radio low
But when she gets all inspired
We let the good times roll

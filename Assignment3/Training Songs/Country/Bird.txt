Well my throat was dry and it was getting late
I was at this bar on the interstate
When this guy with this bird on his shoulder walked through the door
He proceeded to tell me the wildest thing
Sir this bird of mine can sing
Like no other bird you ever heard before
Well I kinda looked at the guy and said oh really
He turned to the bird and said do ole Willie
When the bird started singing I almost fell in the floor

Whisky River take my mind
Don't let her memory torture to me
Whisky River don't run dry
You're all I've got take care of me

Well if that ain't the durndest thing
I thought son what a heck of a thing
A man could get rich making that bird sing
And I could feel this wild idea coming on strong
And besides I'm sitting here with two weeks pay
And I'd probably blow it on beer anyway
Hey wait Ã¢??til you hear him sing like George Jones

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
Soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

I said well that does it sir
Yep I'd like to buy that bird
Five hundred dollars to take him off your hands
Well he thought for a while and he said alright
And he handed me the bird and he said good night
He counted my money and out the door he ran

Well I was thinking I'd found the rainbow's end
That the money would soon be pouring in
When suddenly the bird flew out the door and was gone
Well then it hit me and I got boiling made
Cause I knew right then I'd been had
And as he flew off into the night he was singing this song

On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
Somebody stop that bird
Well love is making money with my friends
I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
My bird
I Just can't wait to get on the road again
I find love is making money with my friends
I can't wait to get on the road again
Somebody give me a B B gun
On the road again
I want that bird
Just can't wait to get on the road again
This is for the birds
Love is making money with my friends

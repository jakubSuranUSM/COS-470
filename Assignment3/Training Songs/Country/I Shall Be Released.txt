They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
But I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he's been framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

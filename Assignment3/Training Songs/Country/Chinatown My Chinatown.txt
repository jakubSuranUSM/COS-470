Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes so brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

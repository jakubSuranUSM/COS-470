Do you take this man to be your husband?

I'll take this man, and by him I'll stand
I promise that we'll never part.
To him I'll be true, there'll be no one new
From now, till death do us part.

Do you take this woman to be your wife?

Yes, I'll take this woman.  She'll be mine forever.
And I'll love her with all of my heart.
To have and to hold, our love won't grow cold.
I promise.  Till death do us part.

We'll take each other, from this day forward, 
Together in sickness or health.
United with love, we'll face life together,
If we're poor or if we have wealth.

For better or worse, you'll always come first 
And no one can keep us apart.
Yes, we'll take each other, forsaking all others.
Together, till death do us part.

Together, till death do us part.

I now pronounce you man and wife.

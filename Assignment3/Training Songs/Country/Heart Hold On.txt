I could see it in her eyes before she said a word
Her baby blue tears told the story, her love has taken a turn
She said she'd found someone who's stolen her heart
She doesn't even realize she's tearin' mine apart

Heart hold on
Be steady until she's gone
Pull yourself together till we're all alone
Just keep on laying low
Pretend for a minute we'll be fine on our own
While she's lettin' go, heart hold on

I tried to act like nothing was wrong as she said goodbye
But I swear it was all that I could do, not to break down and cry
I wished her all the best with her new found love
She's the one who's leaving, I'm the one who's breaking up

Heart hold on
Be steady until she's gone
Pull yourself together till we're all alone
Just keep on laying low
Pretend for a minute we'll be fine on our own
While she's lettin' go, heart hold on

You've got to stay strong, we don't want her to know
We'll fall to pieces just as soon as she goes

Heart hold on
Be steady until she's gone
Pull yourself together till we're all alone
Just keep on laying low
Pretend for a minute we'll be fine on our own
While she's lettin' go, heart hold on

(I'm done rovin' I'm gonna settle down.)
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
Found my treasure at the end of love's rainbow.
I found a love for which I'm pinin',
Pretty as a ring, her love was shinin'.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road,
'Cause I've found the key to this lovesick code.
I found a love, an' that's no lyin'
A gal I can trust without denyin'.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
Now I've found the gal to share this heavy load.
I vowed to her that I would take her,
I'd take her to the preacher an' never forsake her.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road,
For to her apron strings, now I am sewed.
I love that gal an' I want her only:
Gotta have a gal or you'll get lonely.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
(I'm done rovin' I'm gonna settle down.)

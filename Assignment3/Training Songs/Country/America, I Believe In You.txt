We got some trouble in our own back yard
Things are kinda tough, times are kinda hard
Got a lot of people livin' out in the street
People goin' hungry without nothin' to eat
And in this land of plenty
This souldn't be goin' on
We got enough for everybody we just gonna have to pass it along

Well, I'm glad about the fall of Communism
I'm glad about the Berlin wall
And I like seein' old Saddam bite the dust
In fact I'm glad about it all
And I believe in helping everybody
But when it comes to all them foreign loans
I think we oughta remember that charity begins at home

Yes it starts right now in
(America, America)
I know the sun is risin' on a better day
(America, America)
We got the power and we know the way
(America, America)
Well, let me say a few words about the red, white, and blue
(America, America)
I know you're gonna do it I believe in you

Now I been tryin' to figure this out
But there's somethin' that I just don't know
How can you make things better when you
Take our jobs, and send 'um down to Mexico?
And then there was this big shot
From the land of the risin' sun
He said the workin' people in America were lazy and dumb
Well let me tell you somethin' Jack

The next time I go on a shopping trip
And take somethin' off of the rack
If it don't say, "Made in the U.S.A."
I'm just gonna put it back
We can't leave it to the politicians
'Cause they don't do nothin' but talk
And it's we the people that are gonna have to walk the walk

And we can do it right now in
(America, America)
Hey, I know the sun is risin' on a better day
(America, America)
Yeah, we got the power and we know the way
(America, America)
Now let me say a few words about the red, white, and blue
(America, America)
I know you're gonna do it I believe in you

Well, we got the best dang farmers in the whole wide world
The fastest horses and the prettiest girls
We got the army, the navy, air force, and marines
The mightiest fightin' force the world's ever seen

We the kinda people that can get things done
We're servin' notice that we're still number one
We got the nerve
(We got the nerve)
We got the will
(We got the will)
We are all together 'cause you know that we are still

(America, America)
Well, I know the sun is risin', it's a risin' on a better day
(America, America)
Hey hey, we got the power and we know the way
(America, America)
Now let me say a few words about the red, white, and blue
(America, America)
'Cause I believe in you

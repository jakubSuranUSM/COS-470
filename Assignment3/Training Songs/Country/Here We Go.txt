Well up and at 'em, here we go
I'm off again to the rodeo
Sure got a lot of the little things on my mind
Well, one's a song I just started writin'
And the other's a girl I just finished fightin'
She said it was me, but, oh God, I just don't believe her

If you want to know where I'm a coming from
Just sit right there, and I'll tell you, son
This life I lead ain't as wonderful as it appears

[Chorus]
Yeah, but here I go again
Singin' it in this dive
Lonestar beer in my cereal
And it's keepin' me alive
I gave up on Nashville a long time ago
Yeah, but here I go, Lord, once again, here I go

Now, I don't need to be too rich
I'm just an old, hard-headed, son of a bitch
My eyes are still set way back on my glory days
Back in the time of the Dukes of Hazzard
I was listenin' to Willie and old Merle Haggard
Smilin' just a little, as I poked along in my truck

There's a lot of poor folks in my situation
With the years of heartache and frustration
Kinda watching as the dreams turn into years

[Chorus]

Let me tell you, folks, it don't really matter
That beer you're drinkin' never really makes you any fatter
It's all those nights on the couch with a TV dinner
After twelve years with the Copenhagen
Well, I finally found out that I was mistaken
It's not gonna be something to add the years to my life

Yeah, and that's why I'm still dippin' it today
And each and every morning I hear Mama say:
That shit is gonna kill you if the women don't get you first

[Chorus]

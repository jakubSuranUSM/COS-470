Drifter, since you left me
I've been cryin' every day
You knew that I loved you
But you drifted anyway

Drifter, I thought my kiss
Stopped all your restlessness
But you proved again
No one ropes the wind
Drifter, please remember
No one loves you like I do

Drifter, I thought my kiss
Stopped all your restlessness
But you proved again
No one ropes the wind

Drifter, I'll be waitin'
Should you ever drift back in

Drifter, oh drifter

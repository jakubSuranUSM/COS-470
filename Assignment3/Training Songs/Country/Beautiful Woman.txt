You are my dream come true
And I believe in you, beautiful woman
And you are like a breath of spring
Warm like the summer rain, beautiful woman

Every breath I take
Every move that I make
I'm reaching out
(Reaching out, reaching out)

Just to get a little closer
Just a little bit closer
Move a little closer, baby
Closer, closer

You, you are my dream come true
And I believe in you, beautiful woman

Every breath I take
Every move I make
I'm reaching out
(Reaching out, reaching out)

Just to get a little closer
Just a little bit closer
Move a little closer, baby
Closer, closer to you

You are my dream come true
And I believe in you, beautiful woman
And you are like a breath of spring
Warm like summer rain, beautiful woman

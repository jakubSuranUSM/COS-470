Oh it's late I know I should be leaving
We've both got someone waiting we'll have to go
And it's so strange to think that I just met you
I almost wish I'd met you long ago
In your eyes I see a certain look and that same look must be in mine
And who knows just what we might have been another place another time

I'll admit in time that I'll forget you
Cause the truth is I still love her after all
But even though we knew it couldn't happen
For a moment we felt something oh so strong
And in your eyes
And who knows just what we might have been another place another time

Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone

Take care when you do what you do if you do it
If you don't you won't have your baby long
Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone

Now everybody envies you, you lucky so and so
You should thank your lucky stars above
Good buddy what she sees in you I guess I'll never know
But it's a wonder that you still have her love

Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone

You'd better treat her better and you'd better start right now
She deserves the best that you can do
She does everything for you the best that she knows how
And that's the least she can expect from you

Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone

Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone

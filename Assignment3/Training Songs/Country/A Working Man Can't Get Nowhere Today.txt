For years I've been busting my rear to make a living
But it ain't made
For years I've been trying to pay off my bills 
But they ain't paid
Oh every dime I make, every soul I know
Hire by reach, the farther down I go
This old broken back of mine is all I've got to show
And anyway

A working man can't get nowhere today
Lord, a working man get nowhere today
A working man ain't got no time to play
Today I work my fanny off and leave it lay
A working man can't get nowhere today

I paid my income tax
And the government gives back
But I got coming but it ain't much
I paid my child support
'Cause I'm a law abiding sort and an easy touch
And I starve my self to death
Trying to keep my family fed
I keep my budget tight, trying to get myself ahead
But I'll still be deep in debt the day that I fall dead
That's why I say

Lord, a working man can't get nowhere today
A working man can't get nowhere today
A working man ain't got no time to play
Tonight I work my fanny off and leave it lay
A working man can't get nowhere today
A working man can't get nowhere today

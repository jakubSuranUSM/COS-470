Here comes trouble in a pair of tight jeans
Fit to be tied bustin' at the seams
Got a bead on me she's a shootin' this way
I'm under the gun should I run or stay

[Chorus]
On one hand I'm thinkin' that I better lay low
But then on the other what a way to go
What kind of fix have I got me into
Darned if I don't and danged if I do

She's got me wide eyed tongue tied beside myself
I'm tore up talk me down I might need help
Hold me back boys I ain't thinkin' straight
My head's cryin' run but my heart's sayin' wait

[Chorus]

[Guitar]

[Chorus: x2]

I'm darned if I don't danged if I do
Yeah, I'm darned if I don't d-d-danged if I do

I told all the stars up above that I'd never lose your precious love
And I told them how true you would be now they laugh back at me
At my old fairy tales fairy tales and make believe
And I wonder who I deceive with my fairy tales

You're gone but I say I don't care I pretend that you never would dare
I keep telling our friends I'm all right I don't miss you each night
But it's just fairy tales...
Tomorrow the hurt will have cease and I won't think of you and the least

I'll be too busy thinking of when I will find love again
But it's just fairy tales...

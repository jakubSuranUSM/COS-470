Riding in the sunset
Both hands on the wheel
Lost in a memory
Of the way that you feel, oh am I crazy?

Pulled in the parking lot
Her car's parked on the street
I forget about those bitter tears
When I hear her talking so sweet

Oh, isn't that my heart wondering?
Am I crazy for wondering?
Tell me why I keep running
Back to the heartbreak kid

Step through the doorway
A hush falls on the room
Everybody here wants to see

Who'll make the first move

Oh, isn't that my heart wondering?
Am I crazy for wondering?
Tell me why I keep running
Back to the heartbreak kid

First the fire, then the rain
I let the pleasure ease the pain
Across the room her eyes meet mine
I play the fool one more time

Isn't that my heart wondering?
Am I crazy for wondering?
Tell me why I keep running
Back to the heartbreak, back to the heartbreak kid

The sun is going down now sinking like my heart
Nights are getting longer now that we're apart
Darkness is a prison that holds me with your memory
This time I'm getting out before it comes and turns the key

I'm going to cheat the night
So I can make it until the morning's light
Cheat the night

So I'm dusting off my courage painting on a smile
Gonna try to find somebody to hold me for awhile
I don't need the moon reminding me that you're gone
Even if I'm lonely alone

Maybe if the evening provides me with somebody new
I can make them think I'm finally getting over you
I can cheat the night
So I can make them think I'm doing alright

Faithfully ray as the day may be
Somehow we always seek hope in tomorrow
Faithfully dark as the night may seem
We close our eyes and dream of a new day

Why do we have such strong belief
Oh such a long belief in tomorrow
Because we know as long as it may be showed
Our prayers will be answered so faithfully

Why do we have such strong belief

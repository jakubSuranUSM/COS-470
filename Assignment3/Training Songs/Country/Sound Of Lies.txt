It's a matter of time
Till I fall
In the middle of the town
There stands a tall brick wall
In the middle of a dream
Where time plays in between
The sound of lies rings funny against the truth

When I was young, outspoken
(Mama said it'll work out right)
Then sixteen brought a moody star
(Mama said it'll work out right)
Mama said it'll work out right
Boulevards and green leaves billowing

It's a matter of time
Till I fall
In the middle of a town
There stands a tall brick wall
In the middle of a dream
Where time stands in between
The sound of lies rings funny
Against the truth

At five oclock she knows Ill soon be home.
She don't worry bout me runnin' 'round,
'Cause all of my good times are wating right there for me
and she knows where I'll be when the sun goes down.

I'm a stand by my woman man.
Our world turns around a little gold band,
and love leads us through life, hand in hand.
I'm a stand by my woman man.
We fall asleep at night thinking , ain't love grand.
That's why I'm a stand by my woman man.

When she's down, she knows I'll be beside her.
'Cause I'm not just her lover, I'm her friend.
Our love keeps getting better and I'll gladly spend forever
standing by the woman who stands by her man.

I'm a stand by my woman man.
Our world turns around a little gold band,
and love leads us through life, hand in hand.
I'm a stand by my woman man.
We fall asleep at night thinking , ain't love grand.
That's why I'm a stand by my woman man.

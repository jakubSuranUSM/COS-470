You could hear the wind howling across the ocean
And the taste of the wine and the buzz feel in my head
And the only wildfire was burning right beside me
And we had us a night I'll never forget

She was a 1960's Beach Boys song
And we're living that dream all night long, yeah

In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise

Ohh, yeah

Pretty soon it was raining up in Seattle
And it sure was cold out in Colorado
Yeah, I was missing her kiss in the heat of Arizona
Been everywhere and nothing could compare
Yeah, to that one of a kind trip I was on
Everything about her felt like home, yeah

In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise
Take me on back

Found her number in a pocket of my blue jeans
Picked up the phone and let it ring
Said "I'm counting down the miles back to you, babe"
Yeah, I'm heading west on a big old jet plane

Back to that California sunrise
That California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise
Take me on back

That California sunrise
That California sunrise
That California sunrise, yeah
That California sunrise
Yeah
Take me on back

With handmade silver sparkles
Like a well-dressed sequined whore
Your lady-like deceptions
Keep reaching out for more

And you ask me for nothing
And nothing's not enough
And the fisherman, he puts a claim on you
But it's nothing but a bluff

So with jealous hands tied 'round my back
I stumble 'cross the floor
Not knowing how to speak
I keep reaching for the door

"I know, you know me, well" I say
"'Cause I'm the palace guard
Remember me, we made love today
At the King's bazaar"

And you look at me
With eyes that never see
I can feel something start
To die inside of me

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen
Now I realize
To you it's all a dream

So before you show me everything
There's something I must know
I've worked with your friend John, the geek
And his sidewalk trav'lin' show

I know your childhood tailored dreams
Are very well disguised
So you don't have to fake it anymore
It's all been memorized

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen
Now I realize
To you it's all a dream

And you speak to me with feelings
As real as sealing wax
As the nearness dawns, the moth is gone
Leaving trailless tracks

"All you village people
Sing your songs of the morning sunlit sky
Don't you think it's time we moved along"
Said the raven to the fly

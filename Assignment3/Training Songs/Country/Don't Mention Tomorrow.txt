I know I'll be blue for a while yet till your memory finally goes I'll wait
And these tears that keep falling around me mean a rainbow is on its way
So don't mention tomorrow till I have time to forget yesterday

I'm still in a state of confusion cause I'd planned a future with you
And it's such a big change for my world to turn from happy to blue

So don't mention tomorrow till I have time to forget yesterday
(Don't mention tomorrow) till I have time to forget yesterday

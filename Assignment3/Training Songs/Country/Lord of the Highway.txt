With your fan belt slippin' and your bare tires squealin'
Every time you hit the road you think you're rich
You're lord of the highway but the way you been drivin'
Sends them hitch-hikers divin' for the ditch

Well the law's on your trail and there's another law to lead you
And yet another law to let you down
And the laws of the game they're the very same that freed you
The lord of the highway gets around

You weren't the only one who saw the dark days a-comin'
And you weren't the only one who shut 'em out
It was nothin' like your pride, it was somethin' deep inside
That saw the shimmer, felt the shake and heard the Shout

So lay it on thick if you lay it on at all
If you're gonna do the job, do it right
If you gotta hit the road, leave your burdens behind you
The lord of the highway travels light

With your air cleaner hissin' and your radiator steamin'
And the sun burnin' bugs to the glass
You're lord of the highway ,you're livin', you're not dreamin'
And if time really wants to, let it pass

You'll be miles down the road when the toll bridge is burnin'
And your mirrors face forward at last
You got what it takes to be lord of the highway
The lord of the highway travels fast

The crowd is getting restless
It's smoky loud and hot
The band is heatin' up and giving everything they've got
Somebody check the exts
In case a fire breaks out
We're packed in tight
It's Saturday night
And we're burnin' the roadhouse down

[Chorus:]
We're burning' it down
We're burnin' the roadhouse down
The band is in full swing
And man there ain't no stoppin' now
There'll be nothin' left but ashes
When Sunday rolls around
But that's all right
It's Saturday night
And we're burnin' the roadhouse down

It's a mob out on the dance floor
And the pressure's getting higher
One spark from that fiddle bow could set this place on fire
It's so cool to be here
In the hottest place in town
Feels so right
It's Saturday night
And we're burnin' the roadhouse down

[Chorus]

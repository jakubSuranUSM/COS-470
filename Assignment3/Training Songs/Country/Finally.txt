Finally yes darling finally you'd stop denying my love for you
Oh wonderful yes it's so wondeful to hold you close to me finally
For so long I wanted you to be my pretty queen
And no you're mine my pretty one you filled my every dream

Oh finally yes darling finally my lips keep whispering finally
For so long I wanted you to be my pretty queen
And no you're mine my pretty one you filled my every dream
Oh finally yes darling finally my lips keep whispering finally

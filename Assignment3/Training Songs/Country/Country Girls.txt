I've been to California, where the ladies look so fine
They could take a long-haired country boy and softly bend his mind
Made love in New York City where they dress in silk and pearls
But Lord I swear there's nothing anywhere
That's better than a country girl

[Chorus]
'Cause country girls are sweeter'n a tube full of honey
And country girls are warmer than the Georgia sun
They know how to touch you, they know how to love you
Take you right out of this world
I'm so glad that God made country girls

There's women in Chicago in their high rise penthouse rooms
With fine champagne and other things you could drown in their perfume
But I'll take a night down in Mobile, just looking out across the bay
With a country girl lying next to me, taking my breath away

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm so glad that God made you country girls

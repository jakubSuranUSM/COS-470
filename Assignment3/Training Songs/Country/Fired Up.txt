I drove ninety miles and hour comin' to pick you up
Wasn't nothing but gravel flyin' in a cloud of dust
When I saw you comin' out the door my heart was jumpin' out of my chest
Never seen somethin' looking so good rockin' out a little sundress you got me

Fired up
Hotter than the hood of this truck
Fired up
Feels just like lighting struck
Right here in this seat beside me
Girl you got my temperature risin'
Ah look just what your kiss has done
You got me
Fired up
Yeah girl you  got me 
Fired up

This cold beer sittin' in the console
Ain't coolin' anything down
This cool breeze cuttin' through the window ain't puttin' this flame out 
You got me buzzin' girl with the touch of your fingertips
You got me shakin' girl when you put your smile on my lips you got me

Fired up
Hotter than the hood of this truck
Fired up
Feels just like lighting struck
Right here in this seat beside me
Girl you got my temperature risin'
Ah look just what your kiss has done
Yeah you got me
Fired up
Aw you  got me 
Fired up

You got me 
Fired up
Hotter than the hood of this truck
Fired up

You  got me 
Fired up
Hotter than the hood of this truck
Fired up
Feels just like lighting struck
Right here in this seat beside me
Girl you got my temperature risin'
Ah look just what your kiss has done
You got me
Fired up
You got me 
Fired up
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah you got me all fired up

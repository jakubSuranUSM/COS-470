Give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

You live in a world that suits you well
But it feels like a cage to me
And the pedestal you tried to put me on
Just slipped out from under my feet

Oh give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

Well you never knew me anyway
I just couldn't make you see
While you were lookin for the words to make me stay
I was lookin for my keys

Oh give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

I couldn't love you any better than that
You never seemed satisfied
What I'm tryin to say is I need a man
Who don't mind lettin me drive

Give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings
Give me some wheels
Give me some wheels
Give me some wheels

Shades of night are falling
As the wind begins to sigh
And the world's silhouetted against the sky

Blue shadows on the trail
Blue moon shinin' through the trees
And a plain tiff wail from the distance
Comes a driftin' on the evening breeze

Move along, blue shadows, move along
Soon the dawn will come and you'll be on your way

Until the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be, blue shadows on the trail

Move along, blue shadows, move along
Soon the dawn will come and you'll be on your way

Until the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be, blue shadows on the trail
Shadows on the trail

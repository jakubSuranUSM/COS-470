I want to tell you all the story 'bout
The Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High

Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
She said, "Mama, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley P.T.A."

The note said, "Mrs. Johnson you're a wearing
Your dresses way too high, it's reported you've been
Drinking and a running 'round with men and goin' wild
We don't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary Harper Valley P.T.A."

Well, it happened that the P.T.A.
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson
Wore her miniskirt into the room

She walked up to the blackboard
And I recall the things she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address
This meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A."

Now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use
A lotta ice whenever he's away

And Mr. Baker, can you tell us
Why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't make it
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin

When you have the nerve to tell me
That you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Payton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No I wouldn't put you on because
It really did it happened just this way?
The day my mama socket it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.
The day my mama socket it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

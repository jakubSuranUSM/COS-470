Blackbird on the old church steeple
Spanish moss hangin' in the settin' sun
Every house house has got a Bible and a loaded gun
We got preachers and politicians
'Round here it's kinda hard to tell which one
Is gonna do more talkin' with a crooked tongue

This town's got the good lord shakin' his head
Lookin' down thinkin' we ain't heard a word he said
A word he said

Baptized in Southern Gothic
In the garden of good and evil
Devil right here, who would've thought it?
In a town full of God-fearin' people
Dogs and deadbolts guard the night
Nothin' left to do but kneel and pray
We got a church on every corner
So why does heaven feel so far away?
Far away (ooh)

Must be somethin' in the muddy water
Turns the whisky 'bout as sweet as sin
Every drunk in town can sing a brown bag hymn
Good fences make good neighbors
But good neighbors make good lovers too
And when your man ain't home any man will do

This town's got the good lord shakin' his head (shakin' his head)
Lookin' down thinkin' we ain't heard a word he said
A word he said
Word he said

Baptized in Southern Gothic
In the garden of good and evil
Devil right here, who would've thought it?
In a town full of God-fearin' people
Dogs and deadbolts guard the night
Nothin' left to do but kneel and pray (kneel and pray)
We got a church on every corner
So why does heaven feel so far away? (Feel so far away)
Far away

High on homegrown, smokin' that brimstone
Mama ain't stoppin', poppin' that cotton
No happy ever after, waitin' on the rapture now

Baptized in Southern Gothic
In the garden of good and evil
Devil right here, who would've thought it? (Who would've thought it?)
In a town full of God-fearin' people
Dogs and deadbolts guard the night (guard the night)
Nothin' left to do but kneel and pray
We got a church on every corner (every corner)
So why does heaven feel so far away? (Far away)
Far away

If there's a chance that your heart misses the words I try to say with kisses
If I don't seem to be as happy as I should
I wouldn't want to live without you I love everything about you

Yes even the bad times are good

Oh your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
Even in my darkest moments you made it easier to see
I wouldn't change one thing about you if I knew that I could

Yes even the bad times are good

You never let me feel mistreated your love is all I ever needed

When I was weak somehow you always understood
We're not afraid of stormy weather

That's what keeps our love together
Yes even the bad times are good yes even the bad times are good

In and out of honkey tonks from one town to the next. 
But anything worth loving 
Lord's just too hard to forget. 
Everydays another day of feeling more the same. 
Looks like I'll run out of highway before 
I out run the rain. 

But if there's fire and smoke, 
Ooo what a rush I got when your love was hot. 
Oh but I couldn't see. 
That when the flame burned out you'd leave 
A cold dark cloud a raining down on me.

So I'm reaching out to someone wishing, she were you instead. 
Everything I left behid was waiting up ahead. 
Pulling on the bottom baby, looking back on you. 
Anyways the right way babe as long as I pull through.

But if there's fire and smoke, 
Ooo what a rush I got when your love was hot. 
Oh but I couldn't see. 
That when the flame burned out you'd leave 
A cold dark cloud a raining down on me.

Yeah, and when the flame burned out you left 
A cold dark cloud a raining down, a raining down on me.

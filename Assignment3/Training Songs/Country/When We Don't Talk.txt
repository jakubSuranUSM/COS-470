The silence that's fallen between us
Is the loneliest sound that I've heard
How can we find forgiveness
If we can't find the words

When we don't talk
When we don't speak
When we don't share all the feelings
That are buried so deep
How can we know
What's hidden behind these walls
When the doors locked
When we lose touch
When you and I lose sight of us
The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk

When so much goes unspoken
And sorry is left unsaid
The silence remains unbroken
And our hearts are breaking instead

When we don't talk
When we don't speak
When we don't share all the feelings
That are buried so deep
How can we know
What's hidden behind these walls
When the doors locked
When we lose touch
When you and I lose sight of us
The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk

The honesty's lost
And the tears say it all
When we don't talk

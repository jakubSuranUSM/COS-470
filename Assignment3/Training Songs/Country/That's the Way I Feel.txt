Like gravel in the driveway
Asphalt on the highway
Like a blown out worn down tire
Like the head of a hammered nail
Like the bars in the county jail
Like a red hot branding iron

That's the way I feel
Since I lost you
That's the way I feel
Oh, baby, boo hoo hoo
That's the way I feel

Like overcooked spaghetti
With my ex-wife Betty
Every day more rain
Death Valley on the 4th of July
Like a fish at a catfish fry
Heartache heartbreak pain

That's the way I feel
Since I lost you
That's the way I feel
Oh, baby, boo hoo hoo
That's the way I feel

Like gravel in the driveway
Asphalt on the highway
Overcooked spaghetti
With my ex-wife Betty

That's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
I'm blue

That's the way I feel
Since I lost you
That's the way I feel
Said, I'm blue blue blue
That's the way I feel

I'm dreamin' of you,
And that makes me
Atlanta blue
Blue, blue.

Just a name I remember,
Just someone I used to know
Someone I never quite got over
A long long time ago.

[Chorus]
I'm Atlanta blue,
Wishin' I could be with you
Summertime in Georgia
I'm dreamin' of you,
And that makes me
Atlanta blue
Blue, blue.

Don't wipe away my mem'ries
By makin' all my dreams come true
The way it was always seems better,
So let me keep on missin' you.

[Chorus]

I'm Atlanta blue,
Wishin' I could be with you
Summertime in Georgia.

I'm dreamin' of you,
And that makes me
Atlanta blue
Blue, blue.

And that makes me
Atlanta blue

She gets in her car, October Friday night
Home from work down 31, past Franklin High
She can see the stadium lights, she can hear the band
A thousand crazy high school kids screamin' in the stands
Quarterback and homeoming queen
Love too young to know what it means
She goes back in time, oh in her mind, it's like a dream.

He would be sixteen
The son she never knew
It hurt so much to give him up
But what else could she do
He would be sixteen

A child should have a home, she knows her folks were right
She never heard the couple's name, just that they were nice
She wonders if he's taller than his father was
Does he drive a car by now, has he been in love
She shakes back to reality 
She knows things turn out the way they should be
But she just can't help but ask herself 
?Does he know about me'?

He would be sixteen
The son she never knew
It hurt so much to give him up
But what else could she do

He would be sixteen
She never even got to hold him
And nights like this is hurts to miss
A son she's never seen
He would be sixteen

[ trumpet ]
Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you

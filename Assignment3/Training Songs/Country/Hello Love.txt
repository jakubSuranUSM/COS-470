My life was cold and you came and warmed my soul
I need you everyday to stop my loneliness
In you I see everything that's good for me

Goodbye, misery, hello, love
I ain't believing this wonderful feeling
That I'm receiving when I touch your hand

And now I see what a happy thing it can be
Goodbye, misery, hello, love

No, I ain't believing this wonderful feeling
That I'm receiving when I touch your sweet head

Oh, now, now I see what a happy thing it can be
Goodbye, misery, hello, love

Hello, love you know I'm glad to see you
Goodbye, misery, hello, love
To stop my loneliness
Hello, love

Lawdy mercy land of goshen shades of gray out on the ocean
Don't you dare take that boat out to sea
For the high seas are runnin' you will sure enough be done in
If you dare take that boat out to sea

Cause out there in the gulf the wind is blowin' like a bandit
And I'm talkin' bout a hurricane and your riggin' will not stand it
There's an ill wind a blowin' you better get back to your moorin'
Don't you dare take that boat out to sea
You better take a weather warnin' you'll be shark bait in the mornin'
If you dare take that boat out to sea

You better give up on that shrimpin' you just might come home a limpin'
If you dare take that boat out to sea
You better not make one more drag you're gonna wind up in a bag
If you dare take that boat out to sea

Cause out there in the gulf the wind is blowin' like a bandit
And I'm talkin' bout a hurricane and your riggin' will not stand it
Lawdy mercy land of goshen shades of gray out on the ocean
Don't you dare take that boat out to sea
For the high seas are runnin' you will sure enough be done in
If you dare take that boat out to sea

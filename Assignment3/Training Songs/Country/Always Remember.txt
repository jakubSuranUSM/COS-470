Always remember I love you I love you only you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
I'd give anything in this world if I could be with you right now
And hold you real tight in my arms
But since I can't I thought maybe if you knew how much I missed you
It might help you feel peaceful and warm
Always remember I love you I love you you just you
Always remember your whole life through I love you just you
And I ever thought I won't be there to lay down beside you tonight
It's not because I don't care
Darling you're in every thought that I think every dream and every prayer
So always remember I love you I love you just you

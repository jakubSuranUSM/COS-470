Well you like flowers and I like liquor
Your way's nice, but my way's quicker
I been watchin' you all night long
And I gotta say something, don't care if it's wrong
I'm feelin' outrageous
Hope it's contagious
I want to spend the night with you

Well I'm the kind of boy who's slow and lazy
Little bit lost and a little bit crazy
You're the kind of girl who wakes at dawn
Walkin' through the kitchen till the soaps come on
Well baby it's only
That I'm feelin' lonely
And I want to spend the night with you

Well I'm no good at sweet romancin'
Pillow talk or limbo dancin'
I'm just a fool hidin' from the rain
Sittin' with a bottle of cheap champagne
But I'm feelin' funky,
Drunker than a monkey
And I want to spend the night with you

We'll go home and leave the lights on
Wear G-Strings and see-through tights oh
We'll make love and we'll have a ball
In the kitchen, against the wall
I'm getting excited,
Hope I'm invited
I want to spend the night with you

Well you like flowers and I like liquor
Your way's nice, but my way's quicker
I been watchin' you all night long
And I gotta say something, don't care if it's wrong
I'm feelin' outrageous
Hope it's contagious
I want to spend the night with you
Yeah, I'm getting excited,
Hope I'm invited
'Cause I want to spend the night with you

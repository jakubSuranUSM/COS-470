Baby tomorrow's a brand new day
We're gonna love all our troubles away
I don't wanna live like a ghost from the past
You're not the first but you will be my last

There'll come a time when all of your dreams
Will all disappear like a thief in the night
(A thief in the night)
It's never too dark to keep out the light
There's never a wrong that you couldn't make right
(You couldn't make right)

Baby tomorrow's a brand new day
We're gonna love all our troubles away

There's always a doubt and always a fear
That maybe this time it's all really over
(It's all really over)
It's more than a game I don't wanna lose
There'll never be another like you
(Another like you)

Baby tomorrow's a brand new day
We're gonna love all our troubles away
I don't wanna live like a ghost from the past
You're not the first but you will be my last

Baby tomorrow's a brand new day
We're gonna love all our troubles away

Baby tomorrow's a brand new day
We're gonna love all our troubles away

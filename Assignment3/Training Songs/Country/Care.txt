Care oh, what a beautiful word
For those who had somebody to care
Where they go, what they do, what they say
And if they are happy or blue

Care, wish I could recall how it was
When somebody cared long ago
'Cause the difference is driving me out of my mind
And the difference I'd sooner not know

Life in two dollar rooms and cheap hotels
They mean less and less every day
So if I don't see tomorrow
Well, who's gonna care anyway

Oh care, wish I could recall
How it was and the way our love used to be
But the difference is that I'll always care
And now you don't care about me

Oh care, oh, what a beautiful word
For those who have somebody to just care
Where they go, what they do, what they say
But no one will care if I go, oh care

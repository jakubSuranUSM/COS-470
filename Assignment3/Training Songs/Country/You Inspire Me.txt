You inspire me
When my eyes begin to glaze
You inspire me
In so many ways
When I'm on the ground
You seem to know
How to pour blessings down
And spread them all around

You inspire me
When my well is almost dry
You inspire me
And in the twinkling of an eye
I'm back on my feet
You're so inspiring to me

The road is long
And it winds through the night
But when you're near
You let there be light

You inspire me
When my eyes begin to glaze
You inspire me
In so many ways
I'm back on my feet
You're so inspiring
I don't have to wish upon a star
That's how inspiring you are

Handle with care please treat her gently don't break her heart like I did before
Don't do what I did I was unfair please love her for me but handle with care

[Steel]

Hold her forever don't let her go you might lost her like I did a long long time ago
I've hurt her so deeply left her in despair please love her for me but handle with care

[Fiddle]

Don't do what I did I was unfair oh please love her for me but handle with care

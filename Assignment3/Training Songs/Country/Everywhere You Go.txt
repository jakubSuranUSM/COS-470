Everywhere you go sunshine follows you everywhere you go skies are always blue
Children love you they seem to know you bring the roses out of the snow
The whole world says hello everywhere you go

(Everywhere you everywhere you go) sunshine follows you
(Everywhere you everywhere you go) sunshine follows you the skies are always blue
Children love you

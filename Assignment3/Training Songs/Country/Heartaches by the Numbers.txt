Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
Oh, you came back, but never meant to stay

And now I got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
Is the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you was coming home to stay
With hoping heart I waited for your knock at the door
I waited but you must've lost your way

And now I got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
Is the day my world will end
Oh, the day that I stop counting
Is the day my world will end

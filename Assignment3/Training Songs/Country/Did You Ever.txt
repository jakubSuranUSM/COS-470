Did you ever not so much that you could notice
Could you estimate how many eight or nine
Will you do it anymore as soon as you walk out the door
I just wondered did you ever all the time

Could I fix you one small no thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big that would be just fine
Is there any special way oh no whatever you say
I just wondered have you ever all the time

Does he look like no he's taller and more handsome
Is he as old oh no he's young and in his prime
Does your mother know I'll bet oh no I haven't told her yet
I just wondered do you ever all the time

Just for old times sake no that would be much harder
Then how about well are you sure that you don't mind
Hey I know just the thing for us no I'm afraid I'll miss my bus
I just wondered did you ever all the time
I just wondered did you ever all the time

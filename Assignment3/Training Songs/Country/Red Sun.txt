Well I hate to see the red red sun go down
I hate to see the red red sun go down
That's when the hogbone man lay his knuckle down

I've become convinced that you're the one
Cause you never flinch under the gun
Lovers kneel by the roadside in pools of broken glass
Gator tails fly like black angels from the wheels - as they pass

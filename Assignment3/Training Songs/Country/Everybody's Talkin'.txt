Everybody's talkin' 'bout me
But I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes in my mind
Everybody stops to starin'
But I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through a pourin' rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
And sailin' on summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' 'bout me
But I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
Everybody stops to starin'
But I don't even see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
But I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behind

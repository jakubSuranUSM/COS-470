Which way's the wind, how hard does it blow
Up over the hill and away we go

Ridin' in the sky
You never want to come down
You never want to touch the ground
Somehow mother nature's 
Gonna bring you back down

Sky surfer, ridge rider, 
Latest thing to try
Don't give a damn for 
Our hot-dogging gliders
I just want to fly, want to fly

Feel the lift coming off of that rise
You're moving up, can't believe your eyes

Ridin' in the sky
You never want to come down
You never want to touch the ground
And you wonder how mother nature's
Gonna bring you back down

Friends and parents think 
You've lost your mind
They think you want to die
Some have crashed 
And burned before their time
But I just want to fly, want to fly

Check all the lines, the sail's okay
Helmet on, here comes your day

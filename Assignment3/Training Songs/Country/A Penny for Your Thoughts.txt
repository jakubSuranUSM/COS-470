While walking by your side along the way I spied
A tiny copper penny on the ground
Because your thoughts that day seemed oh so far away
I handed you the penny I had found
A penny for your thoughts, a penny for your thoughts
I asked you not expecting the answer that I got
You told of someone else and how you cared a lot
Look at all the heartache one tiny penny bought
[ steel ]
My penny's worth of tears will last a million years
And burn forever in this heart of mine
I'll be so well supplied with dreams I know have died
My penny's worth should last a long long time
A penny for your thoughts...

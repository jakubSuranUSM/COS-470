The ol' cat on the roof
He could stand a little push
'Cause he's got nine good lives to live

But like my Mama said
You only live 'til your dead
And you got to give and give and give

There's a pebble in the pond
Rollin' on and on
Makin' waves and tides and ripples and rain

There's a leaf in the wind
That don't know where to end
Chasin' days and ways and wishes and dreams

Seems like everyone is out lookin' for the sun
Singin' rain and pain on he who hesitates
But it'll shine when it shines
You might think I'm wastin' time
But I'm just a good ol' boy that's learned to wait

Whippoorwill's in the dawn
Pretty soon he'll be gone
And he's got one good song to sing

But like my Daddy said
It's in your heart not your head
And you got to sing and sing and sing

There's a window in the wall
Lookin' out on it all
Leavin' fears and tears and troubles alone

There's a fire in the stove
Keepin' out the cold
Warmin' wine and winters and babies and homes

Seems like everyone is out lookin' for the sun
Singin' rain and pain on he who hesitates
But it'll shine when it shines
You might think I'm wastin' time
But I'm just a good ol' boy that's learned to wait
Yes, I'm just a good ol' boy that's learned to wait

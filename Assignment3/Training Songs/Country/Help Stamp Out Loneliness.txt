Help help help stamp out loneliness bring back the happy that we had before
Let's all get together tonight and begin by lining the ladies up next to the men
Then two by two let's march day and night
Till loneliness leaves us and goes out of sight
Help help help stamp out loneliness help help help bring back happiness
Help help help stamp out loneliness bring back the happy that we had before

Go search every tavern and nightspot in town
'Cause that's where the most of the lonely are found
Tell them the lonely are meeting tonight
Come join in the start of the world's big fight
Help help help stamp out loneliness

Now somewhere in your town this very night
There's broken hearts wishing with all of their might
That someone might lead them back to love's door
So they can be happy like they were before
Help help help stamp out loneliness

Friday night and its snowing outside
I'm all alone here watching it fall
TVs on but the sounds turned down
Somehow I knew he'd know to call right now

I oughta just let it ring
'Cause every time it's the same damn thing

Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that it's gonna be different this time but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?

He left a message saying he was only fifteen minutes away
And that's just enough time for me to figure out if I should stay or leave
But if I think it through
I ain't got nothing better than you

Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that its gonna be different this time but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?

He's at the front door now
With his magic smile
And he'll be gone tomorrow
But right now he's mine for a little while

Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?
It's so wrong to be leading me on and I can't say no
He swears that it's gonna be different this time but it won't be
Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?

Why is he always gotta be calling me when I'm lonely?

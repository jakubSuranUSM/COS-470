Now baby don't worry, if he troubles your mind,
'cause it'll all wash away girl, in the river of time,
if you need a shoulder, i'll be around,
i'll be your rock to hold onto, till the river goes down.

(chorus)
It's hell and high water, that your goin' thru,
but come hell and high water, i'll be here waiting for you.

Can't keep you from cryin', and I can't stop your pain,
bright instant sunshine, never could stop the rain,
but you know that i'll be there, just like that ole sun,
to be your good morning, when your cryin's all done.

It's hell and high water, that your goin' thru,
but come hell or high water, i'll be here waiting for you

(repeat chorus)

Hey Daddy!
Oh yeah
Well I'm a big dog daddy you know my face
and the joint starts rockin' when I walk in the place
The band starts stompin those rhythm guitar
And the dance floor is jumpin' through the back of the bar
Everybody looks better in the neon lights
When a plan comes together on a Saturday night

Yeah, the parking lot is packed and that's a pretty good sign
I take it right in the back I don't stand in line
The boys all lookin' and a hittin' the spot
Sayin' the girls start shaking everything that they got
When a little cat momma gets ready to ride
I got Lincoln continental waitin' right outside

I'm a big dog daddy (Big dog daddy), yeah a big dog daddy (Big dog daddy)
Boys stand back and the girls are gettin' caddy
Something goin' down with the big dog daddy

You gotta stay out late if you are makin' the rounds 
'Cause there are a lot of good joints on the way downtown
I got some good buddies that can rock all night
They ain't looking for trouble but they know how to fight

If your girl starts actin' like she is one of a kind
Ya grab the next one standin' at the head of line

Big dog daddy (Big dog daddy), just big dog daddy (Big dog daddy)
Got miles screaming from here to Cincinnati
Try to compete with the big dog daddy

Big dog daddy (Big dog daddy), just big dog daddy (Big dog daddy)
Boys stand back and the girls are gettin' caddy
Something goin' down with the big dog, big dog

Big dog daddy (Big dog daddy), just big dog daddy (Big dog daddy)
Boys stand back and the girls are gettin' caddy
Something goin' down with the big dog daddy

Got 'em all screaming from here to Cincinnati
Try to compete with the big dog daddy

C'mon boys
Let's roll...

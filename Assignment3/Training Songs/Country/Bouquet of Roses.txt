I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part

I begged you to be different, but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin', now there's nothin' left to do

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you?

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart

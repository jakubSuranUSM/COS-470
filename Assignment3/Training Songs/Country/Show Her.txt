You can tell her
That you love her,
A hundred different ways.

But it won't mean as much,
As just the right touch,
At just the right time of day.

You've got to show her
A little each day.
Really show her, You mean what you say.
It's not enough just to tell her you love her.
If you want her to know
You've got to let it show.

When her laughter,
Turns to tears,
For reasons she can't explain.
Remember this,
That just one kiss,
Was all your love needs to say.

Go on...
And show her.
A little each day.
Really show her, You mean what you say.
It's not enough just to tell her you love her.
If you want her to know
You've got to let it show.

So, if you can't live without her,
You better learn to let her know how you feel.
Just remember that you hold the power,
To tell her all that words can't reveal

You've got to show her
A little each day.
Really show her, You mean what you say.
It's not enough just to tell her you love her,
If you want her to know
You've got to let it show.

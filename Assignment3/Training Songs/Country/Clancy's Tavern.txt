Any minute the 5 o'clock crowd will be coming
Taps'll be flowing with beer
The cigarette smoke is soon to be risin'
And at 5:30 Clancy gets here 

She knows all their faces, she's practically
Raised them
And that why they're loyal and true
They'll pay their tabs, and that pays the light bill 
And she keeps their glass full of brew 

[Chorus]
And the welders and the drivers
And the old nine to fivers and the regular Joe's 
Of the world
Are singing here's to you Clancy and your 
Neighborhood tavern
Pour me another my girl

There's a waitress named Lily, shows up at 7
To make sure their service is great 
And there's a black dude named Elmo that 
Cooks in the kitchen
Burgers and chicken fried steak
Yeah around 9 o'clock the band will start
Playing
And the music will fill up the air 
Then they'll take a break every 45 minutes 
And the jukebox takes over from there 

[Chorus]

It's 1:35, last call's upon us
It's time to settle the score 
Won't you call me a cab and bring me a tab
And while you're at it, bring me one more 

She's cleaned the last table and shined up the bar
It's late and everyone's gone 
Then she'll cock her pistol and count all her money
Then drive that old Chrysler back home 

[Chorus]

Yeah good night sweet Clancy 
In your neighborhood tavern
We'll see you tomorrow my girl

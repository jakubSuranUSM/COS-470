We shouldn't be together tonight
But here we are 
I shouldn't taste the thrill of your kiss
Here in the dark
'Cause were not free to be this free or go this far 
Hearts on Fire burnin' for each other

Hearts on Fire burnin' for each other

Goin' down in flames
Somewhere in the night
Stealin' love again when we're together
It's too late now, we cant put it out, hearts on fire

You shouldn't feel this good in my arms, but you do
I shouldn't whisper these things in your ear, there true
So wrong or right, I'll stay tonight with you 
Hearts on Fire burnin' for each other

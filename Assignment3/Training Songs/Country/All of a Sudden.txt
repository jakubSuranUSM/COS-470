I can't remember the last time I smiled
But I can tell you it's been a quite a while
I thought I'd never get out of the rain
You gave me shelter now everything's changed
I used to wonder just where it would end
I thought I'd never be happy again
You came along and showed me the way
Now I can feel your love every day
All of a sudden the rain disappeared

I can see sunshine the skies are more clear
There's not a rain cloud for miles around
All of a sudden your love's comin' down
It takes a good love to make the sun shine
Everyone needs love and now I got mine
Now that I found you I'm gonna go on
Even the shadows to walk in the sun
All of a sudden the rain disappeared
All of a sudden the rain disappeared

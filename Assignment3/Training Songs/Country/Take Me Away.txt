You should have been there when 
The time was right for the music to begin
You shoulda been there when 
That band of gypsies started rollin' in
You should seen it  
You'da swore for sure the circus came to town
There were ladies ridin' bareback 
And the mystery man
All painted like a clown
You should seen October feelin' 
Like I never felt before
Flashin up New England skies  
Like the fires of the revoluntionary war
You shoulda heard the music comin' down 
Like the hardest rain that ever fell
Wakin' up in the afternoons
With a hundred lovers feedin' in the same motel

Take me away take me away  take me away
Take me away take me away take me away
Take me away take me away take me away
Take me away take me away take me away

To the place where the greatest 
Show on earth is playin' high on your highway
You shoulda seen me I've been told 
I had a smile upon my face
Slippin' from state to state  
Endin' up in a drunken state of grace
It wasn't very long ago  
I used to say this kind of life is rough
You shoulda been there 
But I can tell you even that was not enough

Take me away take me away take me away
Take me away take me away take me away
Take me away take me away  take me away
Take me away take me away take me away

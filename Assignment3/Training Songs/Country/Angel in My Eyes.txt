I watch her lyin' in bed asleep,
And I thank my lucky stars,
For every second she's here with me,
I want to hold her in my arms,

She is my day,
She is my night,
She is the breath that gives me life,
But Sometimes we laugh,

And Sometimes we cry,
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why,
But no matter what she believes in me,
She's the closest thing to Heaven,

I'll ever see,
She always be an angel in my eyes,
Sometimes I feel her by my side,
Like she's watchin' over me,

I get a chill runnin' down my spine,
And that's all the proof I need,
That she fills my heart,
She fills my soul,

She is the half that makes me whole,
Well Sometimes we laugh,
And Sometimes we cry,
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why,

But no matter what she believes in me,
She's the closest thing to Heaven,
I'll ever see,
She always be an angel in my eyes,

Well Sometimes we laugh,
And Sometimes we cry,
Sometimes we fight and we don't know why,
But no matter what she believes in me,

She's the closest thing to Heaven,
I'll ever see,
She always be,
She always be,
She always be, An angel in my eyes

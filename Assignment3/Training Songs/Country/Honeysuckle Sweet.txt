Bare feet on southern soil
Burning up in the August heat 
Tall grass and butterflies 
Were all praying for breeze
I'm going down to the river
Gunna wade into my knees 
Rest a while there on Herd Bank 
Under cypress trees

(Chorus:)
There's a back road in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me 
If only in a daydream 
Cause it's long gone and it's in my past 
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be 
Honeysuckle sweet
Honeysuckle sweet

In the evening on the back porch
You can see the stars like you've never seen
Patsy singing that sweet old song
I'm dancing on my daddy's feet
Oh I was growing fast
I was restless as the wind
To young to know that once you leave 
You'll never be the same again

(Chorus:)
But there's a back road in my mind
Taking me back here every time
And it's all mine it waits for me 
If only in a daydream 
Cause it's long gone and it's in my past 
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be 
Honeysuckle sweet
Honeysuckle sweet

I try to reach back in time
And touch those summer days
But as each year passes by
I feel them starting to fade
Oh there fading away yeah

(Chorus:)
But there's a back road in my mind
Taking me back there every time
And it's all mine it waits for me 
If only in a daydream 
Cause it's long gone and it's in my past 
I can close my eyes when I want to go back
To the days when life could be 
(Honeysuckle sweet)
Come on wind won't you take me home
I want to see how that grass has grown
Dirty water won't you wash me clean
(Honeysuckle sweet)
Ooo I smell it on the vine
I got to taste it one more time
(Honeysuckle Sweet)

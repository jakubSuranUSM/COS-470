I don't care how long you've loved him makes no difference now he's gone
And I know your heart is broken from holding on too long
But I'll gladly take the pieces all I'm asking for is time
And half the love you gave him and I'll give you all of mine

Oh I'd love to see those pretty eyes see no one else but me
And hold you tightly in my arms know that's where you want to be
But with the storm not nearly over I won't ask the sun to shine
Just give me half a love you gave him and I'll give you all of mine

Oh how I'd love to see those pretty eyes see no one else but me
And hold you tightly in my arms know that's where you want to be
Even in your darkest hours all the world seems so unkind
Just give me half a love you gave him and I'll give you all of mine
Just give me half a love you gave him and I'll give you all of mine

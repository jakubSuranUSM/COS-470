Which way can we go, only the moon casts a shadow.
When we look far below the path is sharp and narrow.
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.
Are the stars very bright in the place where you are sleeping?
Can you hear this song and this song that I am keeping?
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.
And this story it goes as we move along the shadows.
And this story it goes along the sharp and narrow.
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.

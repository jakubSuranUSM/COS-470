Take it easy, Greasy
You've still got a long way to slide
Don't you worry, there's no hurry
Believe me there's plenty of time

[Chorus:]
'Cause come rain or shine
Everything will work out fine

Got some jingle in my pocket
I don't owe a single dime
Got a tune that I'm hummin'
Walkin' in the spring time

[Chorus]

Black clouds may follow you around
But don't let those dark times
Bring you down
Hear what I say

[Chorus]

Black clouds may follow you around
But don't let those dark times
Bring you down
Hear what I say

[Chorus]

You got some troubles
I've got some troubles too
Go on and do what you do
Someone may be countin' on you

Yeah come rain or shine
Everything will work out fine
Will work out fine
Everything will work out fine
I say everything will work out fine

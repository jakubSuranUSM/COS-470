Here she comes again, but me and you
We're gonna close the door
We won't her in, we're not gonna do it, like we've done before
Stay here with me, keep a steady beat
But not to loud, she might be listening

Oh heart, don't fall now
If you do I might never bring you back around
Heart take it slow, don't let her know 
Just how much we really need her now
Heart, don't fall now

She can break me down but she won't get through
If you'll be on your guard, when she reaches out
Oh, I'm counting on you, not to fall apart
Here comes that touch
We've been missing for such a long, long time
I feel you giving in

Oh heart, don't fall now
If you do I might never bring you back around
Heart take it slow, don't let her know 
Just how much we really need her now
Heart, don't fall now

You'll pull it off some how
This can be our finest hour
Ah, heart without you
I might not get through it
Don't know if I can do it

[Reapeat x3]
Oh heart, don't fall now
If you do I might never bring you back around
Heart take it slow, don't let her know 
Just how much we really need her now
Heart, don't fall now

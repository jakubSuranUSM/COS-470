Don't think that I don't see the way you struggle
Watching me struggle
Don't think that I don't feel you turn away
Every time I turn away

And please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
For the same thing

You're 5' 3" born in Carolina
Front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I never knew I had a fighter

I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while

You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town
My t-shirt in the morning
Midnight in my hands
At day you're still here, I just don't understand
Never knew I had a fighter

Just when I thought I knew everything about you
You're 5' 3" born in Carolina
Still front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I Never knew I had a fighter
I Never knew I had a fighter

Please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
Never knew I had a fighter

Where is our hero tonight?
The bars are all booming
And he's nowhere in sight
Wherever he is Lord, we hope he's alright
Where is our hero tonight?

He used to be king of the bars
He's opened and closed them from Waco to Mars
Now he sings on the streets and he sleeps in his car
But he used to be king of the bars.

Where is our hero tonight?
He left here a-sailing, he was high as a kite
Feeling kinda sorry, and looking for a fight
Where is our hero tonight?

Where is our hero today?
Can we just tag along, we'll stay out his way.
Does he still write the sad songs and can he still play
Where is our hero today?

Where is our hero tonight?
The bars are all booming
And he's nowhere in sight
Wherever he is Lord, we hope he's alright
Where is our hero tonight?

Wherever he is Lord, we hope he's alright
But where is our hero tonight?

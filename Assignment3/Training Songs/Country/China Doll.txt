I'm tired of cry-why-yin'
And all her lie-ie-iein'
That's why I'm buy-why-in'
A china doll

Her eyes are blu-you-uer
Her faults are few-ewer
Her lips are tru-uer
My china doll

I'd rather have a doll of clay
That I could call my own
Than someone else just like you
With a heart of stone

She'll never lea-eave me
She'll not decei-eive me
And never grie-ieve me
My china doll

No tears or sor-orrow
No sad tomorr-orr-orrow
No one can borr-orr-ow
My china doll

Her eyes are blu-you-uer
Her faults are few-ewer
Her lips are tru-uer
My china doll

I'd rather have a doll of clay
That I could call my own
Than someone else just like you
With a heart of stone

She'll never lea-eave me
She'll not decei-eive me
And never grie-ieve me
My china doll

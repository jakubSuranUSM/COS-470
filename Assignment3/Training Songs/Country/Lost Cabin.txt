Ridin' in the back of our old limousine
Wond'rin' if we pass or we fail
Took by surprise we were only alive
Laughin' 'cause the dragon had a tail

Talkin' with a friend that I'd known so long
Tryin' to make a wall disappear
Nobody won, no it couldn't be done
But the wall was never so clear

Lost cabin, found in the nick of time
Lost cabin, back where the river winds
Lost cabin, high above the timberline
Lost cabin, man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find

(Guitar solo)

Fishin' in the dark where the moonlight failed
We all lit a pole in the stream
Might of been fate or it could have been the bait
We were standin' in a fisherman's dream
Sweatin' on the steps of a fate done past
Holdin' at my handful of keys
How was I to know when I got up to go
The landlord said, "it was free"

Lost cabin, found in the nick of time
Lost cabin, back where the river winds
Lost cabin, high above the timberline
Lost cabin, man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find
Man what a lucky find
(Harp solo)

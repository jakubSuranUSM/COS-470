Time goes by
Slowly but surely
Time goes by
And baby here am I
I'm wasting my time on you

Time goes by
Slowly but surely
Time goes by
And sometimes I have to cry
For loving you like I do

I'm watching a clock
And waiting for you
But how long
How long must I wait?

The beat of my heart
It's telling me true
'Give it up
You made a mistake'

Time goes by
Slowly but surely
Time goes by
And baby here am I
Oh, I'm wasting my time on you

Time goes by
Slowly but surely
Time goes by
Oh, slowly but surely
Time goes by
Slowly but surely
Time goes by

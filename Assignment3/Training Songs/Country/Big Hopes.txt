I am not brave and I'm not too smart
The tin man wouldn't trade for my heart
Got two left feet when I am dancing
and a long history of brief romances

Got no rubies, got no diamonds
None passed down and I cannot buy them
Got a box of hurt and a bag of shame
and you barely know my name
I've got big, big hopes about you
Yeah, I've got big, big hopes.

Got an old leather jacket, would look good on you
and lots of friends, they would like you too
I've got some pull with the moon and tides
and thirty-two dollars, lets go somewhere tonight.
I've got big, big hopes about you
I've got big, big hopes
Oh yeah

I've had hopes before, but not like this
I'm flying over the edge into the sweet abyss

I've got some pull with the moon and tides
and thirty two dollars, lets go somewhere tonight

I've got big, big hopes about you
I've got big hopes
I've got big hopes about you

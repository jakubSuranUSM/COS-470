Long, long time ago
When we were young
You swore to me
I'll be the one.

I'll be the one you love
But we had to part
You asked me to wait for you
And keep you in my heart.
Keep you in my heart.

Night after lonely night
I'm waitin' for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on Heartbreak Hill.

Now maybe I'm the foolish kind
To hold you so long
Have you found another love
Am I still the one?

Am I still the one for you
But you're far away
Do you ever dream
Of comin' back to me someday?
Back to me someday.

Night after lonely night
On HeI'm waitin' for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on Heartbreak Hill.

Heartbreak Hill alone at night
I'm thinkin' how you held me tight
And one day if I ever will
See you again on Heartbreak Hill.

--- Instrumental ---

Oh Lord, if I only could go
Back in time I know
I'd hold you in my arms again
And never let you go.

Never let you go my love
Or leave you far behind
High upon this lonely hill
Where you swore to be mine
You swore to be mine.

Night after lonely night
I'm waitin' for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on Heartbreak Hill.

Night after lonely night
I'm waitin' for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on Heartbreak Hill.

Here on Heartbreak Hill.
Here on Heartbreak Hill...

It seems funny I remember your number 
After all this time 
And I know that it's late 
And I hope that I'm not out o' line 

But for some crazy reason 
I bin thinkin' 'bout you all day 
And every three hours now 
I bin thinkin' of somethin' to say I

love you like a fool 
Always have, always will 
But you know that it's just my point of view 
But I love you still 
Always have, always will 
Always have, always will love you 

Well now, are you sleepin' any better 
Now that I'm gone 
And I want to know who's holdin' you tight 
Or are you just holdin' on 

You're awfully quiet, I guess you're tired 
So I'll hang up the phone 
But you know that this ol' heart 
Can't leave well enough alone

I love you like a fool 
Always have, always will 
But you know, yes you know that it's just my point of view 
But I, I love you still 
Always have, always will 
Always have, always will love you

Big iron horses road across five yards bridge
And me and my grandpa we watched from the ridge
He knew all the trains, he'd call out each one
Where they're goin' too, where they're comin' from

He'd say that one's from Memphis, bound for Moline
An old '97, she's from New Orleans

Big Iron Horses
Steel turning round
The sparks and the thunder
As the wheels shook the ground
The boxcars and the flatbeds
And the whistles blowin' steam
That was yesterday, now those big trains don't come anymore

Now the years passed so quickly
And the world had moved on
And change cast her shadow as they left one by one

Steel turning round
The sparks and the thunder
As the wheels shook the ground
The boxcars and the flatbeds
And the whistles blowin' steam
That was yesterday, now those big trains don't come anymore

Anymore
Iron Horses

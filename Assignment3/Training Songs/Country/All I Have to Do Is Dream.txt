When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream.

When I feel blue in the night
When I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream, dream.

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away.

I need you so, that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream.

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away.

I need you so, that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream.

Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream

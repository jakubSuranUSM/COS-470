All the time yes darling all the time tenderly constantly I'll love you
Every day I'll prove it every day in happiness or loneliness I'll love you
Other arms may tempt me don't let that worry you
For even when they tempt me I'll never be untrue
All the time yes darling all the time
Through the years through smiles or tears I'll love you

All the time yes darling all the time

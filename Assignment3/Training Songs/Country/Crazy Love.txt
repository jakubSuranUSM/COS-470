Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory

Just when I think I'm over her
This broken heart will mend
I hear her name and I have to cry
The tears come down again

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Count the stars in the summer sky
That fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear
These teardrops coming down

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I've never been imprisoned by
A faded memory

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wrapped around my heart
Refusing to unwind
Ooh-ooh, crazy love, ah

Tonight I'm gonna break away

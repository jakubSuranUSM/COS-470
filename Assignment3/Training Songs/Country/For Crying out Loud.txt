Your trying to forget
But can't believe how long it's taking
You see him on the street and
Still you feel your poor heart achin'
Don't let him that it hurts that much
Don't let him see it's been that rough
Don't let him think that you even miss him at all

You can cry in your sleep
Cry in your heart
Cry in your pillow
Cry in the dark
You can cry in your dreams
Cry in your mind
But cry on the inside if he walks by
'cause just hate yourself anyhow
For crying out loud

If he's out in a crowd
Then just pretend that you don't see him
Look the other way and make believe that you don't need him
Don't let him take your diginity
Don't let him make you feel so weak
Don't let him think that even crosses your mind

You can cry in your sleep
Cry in your heart
Cry in your pillow
Cry in the dark
You can cry in your dreams
Cry in your mind
But cry on the inside if he walks by
'cause just hate youself anyhow
For crying out loud

And if he ever asks
Just say you're all right
And put on your brightest smile
Until he's out of sight
Then if you got to cry

You can cry in your sleep
Cry in your heart
Cry in your pillow
Cry in the dark
You can cry in your dreams
Cry in your mind
But cry on the inside if he walks by

You can cry in your sleep
Cry in your heart
Cry in your pillow
Cry in the dark
You can cry in your dreams
Cry in your mind
But cry on the inside if he walks by
'cause just hate youself anyhow
For crying out loud

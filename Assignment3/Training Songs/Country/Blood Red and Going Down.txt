That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

Daddy said, "Now come girl
We're heading down the road to Augusta"
An thinking through his clenched teeth
He called mama's name, then he cursed her

He said, "Girl, you're young, but some dude has come along
And stole your mother"
Ah, but you can't steal a willing mind
Whose mom is always looking for a lover

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

With dusty teardrops on his face
My daddy cried and big steps he was taking
And halfway running to keep up
My shorter legs were so tired and shaking

Where did I go wrong, girl?
Why would she leave us both this way?
At times like these, a child with tears
Never knows exactly what to say

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

We searched in every bar room
And honky-tonk as well
And finally daddy found them
But Lord, you know, the rest is hard to tell

He sent me out to wait
But scared, I looked back through the door
And daddy left them both
Soaking up the sawdust on the floor

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

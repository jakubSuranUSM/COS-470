I was a fool to say it was over
I was concerned with my pride
The words are crazy and fall out of place
From this heartache I can't hide

I hear your name in slow conversation
I see your face in the crowd
My heart desires so many things
That my pride just can't allow

I'd close down this heart tonight
Leave without a fight
Say goodbye to your sweet memory
If I can lie in your arms tonight
If I can lie in your arms tonight

Was I the fool to think you would see me
When all I wanted was you
Then I saw your eyes go through those changes
And wondered how you knew

I hear your name in slow conversation
I close my eyes and knew
I'd never find a way to deceive you
I just can't let you go

I'd close down this heart tonight
Leave without a fight
Say goodbye to your sweet memory
If I can lie in your arms tonight
If I can lie in your arms tonight

I was a fool to say it was over

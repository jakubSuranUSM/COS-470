Saturdays, holidays, easy afternoons
Lazy days, sunny days, nothing much to do.
Rainy days are better days for hangin' out in-side
Grainy days and city ways make me want to hide
Someplace cool an' green an' shady.

Find yourself a piece of grassy ground,
Lay down close your eyes.
Find yourself and maybe lose yourself
While your free spirit flies.

August skies, and lullabies, promises to keep
Dan-de-lions and twisting vines clover at your feet.
Mem-o-ries of Aspen leaves, tremblin' on the wind.
Honey bees and fantasies, where to start again,
Someplace cool an' green an' shady.
Cool an' green an' shady, (Repeat and fade.)

Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love
They say up in heaven the streets are gold
Once you get past the pearly gates
And the angels are singin'
At the top of a dove white staircase

And I say heartache can burn you down like hell
Leave you beggin' "Baby, please don't go"
'Til you're scrapin' rock bottom
And cryin' in a deep, dark hole

Oh, and love can make you fly like a rocket
Put you on top of the world

I'm talkin' 'bout
Heaven - it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache - that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

Well the preacher says when your time is up
You take a chariot to the lord
Well I'm hopin' my chariot's
A torch red Thunderbird Ford

And my old flame said "I hate to break it to you darlin'"
"I was born the leavin' kind"
Left me standin' in the drive
Cryin' why baby, why baby, why?

Oh, but real love's got me back in the saddle
Shoutin' "Amen!" again


That's what I know about
Heaven - it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache - that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

I've gotta keep lovin' and livin'
And learnin' and burnin'
Movin' on down the road

Heaven - it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache - that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of

Heaven - it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache - that's where I've been
Heaven, heartache and the power of love, uh-huh
Heaven, heartache and the power of love

Heaven, heartache and the power of love
Heaven - where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache - that's where I've been
Heaven - mmhmm
Heartache - oooh

Heaven - that's where I'm goin'
Heartache - oh, that's where I've been
Heaven - where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache

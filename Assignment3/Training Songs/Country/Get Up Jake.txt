Get up Jake, it's late in the mornin'
The rain is pourin', we got work to do
Get up Jake, there's no need a lyin'
You tell me that you're dyin' but I know it's not true

Now, me and Jake, we work down on the river
On the ferry Baltimore
And when Jake don't rise up in the mornin'
People lined up all along the shore

Get up Jake, it's late in the mornin'
The rain is pourin', we got work to do
Get up Jake, there's no need a lyin'
You tell me that you're dyin' but I know it's not true

Crap game will take you to the cleaners
Rye whiskey to the grave
River Woman, don't you come no closer
'Cause me and Jake got no time to save, oh, oh

Get up Jake, it's late in the mornin'
The rain is pourin', we got work to do
Get up Jake, there's no need a lyin'
You tell me that you're dyin' but I know it's not true

Dirty Dan, he came up from Savannah
Carried a mean streak in his eye
Now, him and Jake both wanted Annabella
I guess one man here has got to die

Get up Jake, it's late in the mornin'
The rain is pourin', we got work to do
Get up Jake and no need a yin'
Annabelle's cryin' and it's all for you

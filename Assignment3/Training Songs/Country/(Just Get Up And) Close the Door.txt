How can I be sure you're being honest with me? Can I take your love for true
There comes a time in ev'ry man's life
When he needs a little proof. So show me something different. Something I ain't never seen before. This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to him;

Just Get Up And Close The Door.
Just Get Up And Close The Door. And say you'll stay with me tonight,
Say you won't regret morning light,
Then I'll believe the words of love you've said to me before, if you'll
Just Get Up And Close The Door.

This time instead of getting up and goin' home to him, Just Get Up And Close The Door.

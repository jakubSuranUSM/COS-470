He plays guitar at a hotel bar 
For out-of-towners and business men 
He struts and sings to his drum machine 
But he won't make it big at the Holiday Inn 
But she thinks that he looks like Elvis 
When he runs his fingers through that jet black hair 
And sometimes she forgets an order 
Cause she's so struck by him she just stops and stares 

[Chorus] 
They gotta love bigger than the Beatles 
Wild and Free like a Rolling Stone 
They gotta a love takes 'em higher than the Eagles 
Ain't love such a sweet, sweet song 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah 

She pours 'em drinks, loads up the sink 
And dreams of bein' a movie star 
Her mama said, she'd knock 'em dead 
But Hollywood hasn't called so far 

But he thinks she's as pretty as a picture 
When she wipes down tables in her apron strings 
And sometimes he forgets a chorus 
Cause she's shinin' like a beauty on the silver screen 

[Chorus]

No you won't find their names on the walk of fame 
But they ain't missin' much 
Cause when the lights go down on tinsel town 
All you need is love 

[Chorus]

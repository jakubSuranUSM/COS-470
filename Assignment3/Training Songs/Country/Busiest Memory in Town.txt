You're with me from my first cup of coffee right up till the last beer goes down
You're on my mind so I can't sleep till morning you're the busiest mem'ry in town
Had a talk last night with your new love
But then he mentioned a few more you'd found
So we drank a toast to the next in line and the busiest mem'ry in town
Babe sometimes you simply amaze me
With how fast you spread that heartache around
It must be hello I love you I'm leaving you're the busiest mem'ry in town
[ steel ]
Babe sometimes you simply...
It must be hello I love you I'm leaving you're the busiest mem'ry in town

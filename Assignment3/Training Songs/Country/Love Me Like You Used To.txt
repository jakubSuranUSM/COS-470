In a cozy little restaurant for lovers
It seems so out of place for you and me
We used to play around under the covers
But now it's just a place to watch TV

[Chorus:]
So love me like you used to 
When our love was brand new
And darlin' when we're through
You can love me again.
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love me.

Baby we could use a long vacation
But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each other's inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

[Chorus]

Well we used to sit and talk about forever
But now we hardly ever talk at all
We walked a lot of tight ropes together
We always caught each other when we'd fall

[Chorus]

Love me like you used to
When you used to love me...

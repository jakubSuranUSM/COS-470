Breakin' the rules every time I hug and kiss you darling
While you wear another's name
If you're breakin' the rules in any kind of game you're playing reckless
And taking chances just the same

Can it be a sin to love you like I do
And we'd just be called a pair of fools
If it's so wrong to want to be with you my darling
Then I guess I'll go on breakin' rules

Can it be a sin

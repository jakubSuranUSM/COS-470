You'll be leaving me to look for greener pastures
It really isn't love that you are after
You would climb the highest hill if you thought you'd find a trill
And greener pastures on the other side

I guess I'll be the next to fall in line (fall in line)
With all the broken hearts you left behind (left behind)
I can tell the thrill is gone and you'll soon be moving on
You've got greener pastures on your mind

You'll be leaving me to look for greener pastures
It really isn't love that you are after
You would climb the highest hill if you thought you'd find a trill
And greener pastures on the other side

I don't know why I thought that I could win (I could win)
I've seen you do it time and time again (time again)
You will trade a love that's true for a thrill from someone new
And those greener pastures win again

You'll be leaving me to look for greener pastures
It really isn't love that you are after
You would climb the highest hill if you thought you'd find a trill
And greener pastures on the other side
And greener pastures on the other side

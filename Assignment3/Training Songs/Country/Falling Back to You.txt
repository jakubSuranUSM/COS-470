Yes, I keep falling back to you
What else can I do
I keep falling back to you
I can't forget the past we knew

So many times, I've had you on my mind
It seems, I just can't leave the past behind
I know you've been untrue dear
But oh, what can I do?
For every time the sun goes down
I fall right back to you

Yes, I keep falling back to you
What else can I do
I keep falling back to you
I can't forget the past we knew

So many times, I've had you on my mind
It seems, I just can't leave the past behind
I know you've been untrue dear
But oh, what can I do?
For every time the sun goes down
I fall right back to you

Yes, I keep falling back to you
What else can I do
I keep falling back to you
I can't forget the past we knew

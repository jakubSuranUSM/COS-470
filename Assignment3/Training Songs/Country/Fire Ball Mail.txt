Here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by it's the fireball mail

Let her go look at her steam hear her blow whistle and scream
Like a hound waggin' his tail Dallas bound bound bound it's the fireball mail

Engineer makin' up time tracks are clear look at her climb
See that freight clearin' the rail bet she's late late late it's the fireball mail

Watch her swerve look at her sway get that curve out of the way
Watch her fly look at her sail let her by by by it's the fireball mail

Here she comes look at her roll there she goes eatin' that coal
Watch her fly huggin' the rails let her by by by the fireball mail

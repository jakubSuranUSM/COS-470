"Hey y'all,
Watch this!"

Daddy's belt
Mama's drapes
Standing tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my Superman cape

I told the neighborhood girls,
said "Hey y'all, watch this!"
My fate was a broken arm
My reward, one big kiss

When Daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it

Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!

Blacktop road
Learner permit
Though I was Earnhardt
Drvin' fast
But I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox
Then a fence, then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmers daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it!

Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Oh yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!

Just throw caution to the wind my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin!

'Cause scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Yeah, pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah, life is short so go on and live it
'Cause the chicks dig it!

Scars heal
Glory fades
And all we're left with all the memories made
Pain hurts
But only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it,
Hey, the chicks dig it!

Oh yeah
The chicks dig it
The chicks dig it
Oh hey, oh yeah
The chicks dig it!

"I got this scar when I was three years old showin' off for the girl next door on my tricycle. And the one over my eye, well i got that back in '82 jumpin' off the train trestle bridge. But I got the girl...uh The chicks dig it."

I saw you out the other night
I thought you'd be with him
I guess things didn't turn out right
I tried to call you on the phone
But you weren't there
Did you get tired of bein' alone

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out all right
?Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you with all of my might

You told me you were over him
And I believe in you
And now he wants you back again
He tried to call you on the phone
But you weren't there
He's probably tired of being alone

I've got this feeling inside
Tomorrow will turn out all right
?Cause I'll have you here by my side
To hold you and love you with all of my might

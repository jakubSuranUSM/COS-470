I'd be lyin' if I said, I never prayed for this
I can show you here and now, how much love you've missed
I'm happy that you're sad, I know that sounds so wrong
But darlin' you must know the pains gone on too long

Come in out of the pain, let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Lay down in my arms there ain't no shame
Now don't just stand there girl, come in out of the pain

Well I know how, a heartache feels shattered when it breaks
And if you believe in me, he'll be your last mistake
I can't stop the wind and I can't stop the rain
But I can promise you that I can stop your pain

Come in out of the pain and let me dry your tears
Well he's been gone for days and I've loved you for years
Oh lay down in my arms, there ain't no shame
But don't just stand there girl, come in out of the pain

Come in out of the pain, let me dry your tears
Come in out of the pain
Girl I've loved you for years and years and years

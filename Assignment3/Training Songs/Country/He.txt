He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea;
He alone decides who writes a symphony;
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright;
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night;

He still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer;
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live,
He'll always say, "I forgive."

He can grant a wish or make a dream come true;
He can paint the clouds and turn to gray the blue;
He alone is there to find a rainbow's end;
He alone can see what lies beyond the bend;

He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold;
He knows every lie that you and I have told.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we liv,
He'll always say, "I forgive."

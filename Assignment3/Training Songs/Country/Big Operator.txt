I've been through a lotta states and a lotta towns most of them have different names
But you'll find the streets all run the same
Girls are a lot like this if you work it right and I do this well
How I do it is my secret and I refuse to tell
But I'll tell you I'm a big operator I know how to talk that talk
I can talk my way into their hearts without even tryin'
Yes I'm a big operator I know how to walk that walk
You can bet when I walk away I'll leave 'em smilin'

There are many girls in every town that I have left behind
But that don't ever trouble my mind
I won't look back now but if I ever change someday when I get old
Then I'll have these memories to keep away the cold
For they call me a big operator

I'll be smooth as glass if you want me to or rough as desert sand
It depends on what you want in a man
My aim is to please and I believe I do for a back track many times
I was always welcomed by the ones I left behind
You can see that I'm a big operator

This old Mexican cowboy at the bar looked a hundred years old
He had a million dollar smile and his weathered brown skin shimmered like California gold
He said I'm a little short on cash, but I'm long on life
For a shot of tequila, I'll give you some dang good advice

He said don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun
Don't argue with a woman while she's holdin' a gun
Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes 
Vaya con dios said the old Vaquero

Well my heart sank the more he drank, the more he poured out his misery
How he lost her after forty-seven years and his tears started flowing like the Rio Grande
He started speakin' in Spanish, then he kissed is rosary
Said "por siempre mi amor" his one more to her memory

He said don't live your life like a sad country song
A fool on a stool is still a fool right or wrong
[?] San Benito breaking hearts as he goes
Vaya con dios said the old Vaquero

I walked over to the corner, turned the old jukebox on
When I turned back around, like a ghost he was gone

So I paid his tab, called a cab, called it a night, and came straight home to you
As we laid there in bed, I told you all the things he said
we laughed, we cried, and I held you the whole night through

You know I think of him often, out there all alone
Maybe he was an angel, or just an old man from San Antone

He said don't leave your beer in the hot Texas sun
Don't argue with a woman while she's holdin' a gun
Never cheat when it comes to love or dominoes 
Vaya con dios
He said don't live your life like a sad country song
A fool on a stool is still a fool right or wrong
[?] San Benito breaking hearts as he goes
Vaya con dios
He said vaya con dios

This old Mexican cowboy at the bar looked a hundred years old

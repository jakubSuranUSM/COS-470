I remember holdin on to you
All them long and lonely nights i put you through
Somewhere in there i'm sure i made you cry
But i can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]
But i recall all of them nights down in mexico
One place i may never go in my life again
Was i just off somewhere just too high
But i can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin; up from the caribbean
Most novembers i break down and cry
But i can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]

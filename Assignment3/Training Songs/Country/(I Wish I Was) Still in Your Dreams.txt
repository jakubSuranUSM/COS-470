I saw you through a cafe window down on second avenue
The passage of time sure has been good to you
I was tempted for just a moment to run out in the street
But what do you say when two old lovers meet

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn’t let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

In my favorite fantasy
You’re the one who’s missing me
It all comes back so easily
When I hear you say

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

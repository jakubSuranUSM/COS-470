There's a mighty battle coming and it's well now on it's way
It'll be fought at Armageddon, it shall be a sad, sad day
In the Book of Revelation, words in Chapter 16 say
"There'll be gathered there, great armies for that battle on that day"

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said, "Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass"
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see
Start with Chapter 24 and read from 1 to 33
In our Savior's blessed words he said on earth, he prophesied
For he spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been trials and tribulations, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said, "Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass"
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars
Oh, the hearts of been shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth
Those who seek it will receive it, mercy at the Savior's feet

All the way from the gates of Eden to the battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair
He has said, "Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass"
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last

A friend is someone you like to be with
A friend is someone who likes to be with you
And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

A friend is someone who stands beside you
When others are treating you mean
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And are you a friend?
Do you think you'd make a good one?
'Cause you've got to be fair
And show them you care
'Cause a best friend is someone who knows how to share

A friend is someone who makes you happy
A friend is someone you make happy too
And a friend isn't just a friend on Sunday
A friend is a friend every day of the week

And big or small, short or tall
It don't matter at all to a friend

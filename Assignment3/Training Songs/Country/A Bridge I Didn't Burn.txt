Can feel the need and know it won't be long                            
Until I give into rising weakness and I pick up the phone
I always head in her direction when there's no place else to turn                                 
And tonight I'll take a walk  across the bridge I didn't burn                         
Tonight I'll take a walk across the bridge I didn't burn                            
Pickup where we left off on a lesson still unlearned                           
It's like I never had a choice where loving her is concerned                                      
So tonight I'll take a walk  across the bridge I didn't burn                                           
I should have struck the match a long long time ago                           
But courage takes a backseat when old feelings take control                         
Lord she plays me like a fool every time that I return                                             
But tonight I'll take a walk  across the bridge I didn't burn
Tonight I'll take a walk across the bridge I didn't burn

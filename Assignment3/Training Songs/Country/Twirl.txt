[Chorus:]
Just a small town girl 
Till you learned to twirl 
Then you set the world on fire 
Like a drive-in Cinderella 
In a Chevy named Desire 
So leave your teddy-bear 
At the county fair, 
Honey, Hollywood's on the phone 
For a small town girl 
From a small town world 
You're a long, long way from home 

They say that dreams come true in Indiana 
That Momma loves you up in Abilene 
And if you wish upon a star in Texarkana 
Some day you may be a twirling queen 

[Chorus]

Then you turned around and yesterday was over, 
Childhood's like some long lost lullabye 
Way back when all the pearls were in the ocean, 
Way back when all the stars were in the sky. 

[Chorus x2]

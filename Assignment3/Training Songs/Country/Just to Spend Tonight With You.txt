What good is love if you're not wearing it, baby
When you're dying of thirst and drowning in maybe's
When nobody else can touch that part of you

Me I stood out here in the open
And offered the one thing that nobody else had broken
As if I didn't know what you might do, I might lose

I have broken every rule, the hard way for you
And I would do it all again
Just to spend the night with you

You took my love like a one armed bandit
Got reason to cry, got more than I can stand
And I'm going down for the third time over you

It hurts the most when the knife keeps coming
I was standin' still when I should have been running
As if you didn't know what I might do, I might choose

I have broken every rule the hard way for you
And I would do it all again
Just to spend the night with you

I would follow every road with nothing else in view
Just like the frozen willow bends I have
Just to spend the night with you

Do you love to watch me break
Do you just love to watch me ache
On the chances that I take

Do you love to watch me break in two
Honey, just to spend the night with you

DON'T GO
(Oney Wheeler)

WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

As I sat at home with my troubles today
I was tempted to walk the wrong way
I remember the voice that once led me from sin
And I heard the same voice again
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back to the tavern and sin
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back and start drinking again
I could hear lots of laughter just over the way
My friends sounded happy and gay
I started to walk but my knees gave away
As I fell I heard the voice say
Don't go don't go don't go don't go just kneel by your bedside and pray
Don't go don't go don't go don't go God will answer your prayers today
God freed me from sin like he did once before
Now I'm happy as a man can be
God's voice sounded pleased as he spoke the next words
God must have seen a great change in me
Go on go on go on go on ask your friends there to kneel down and pray
Go on go on go on go on ask God will answer their prayers today

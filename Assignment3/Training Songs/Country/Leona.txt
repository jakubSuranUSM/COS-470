Can I Lean on you Leona
Could I rest here for a while
Could I lean on you Leona
Please help me make another mile
Could I lean on you Leona
Oh would you help me till I'm strong
Could I lean on you Leona
Till I can make it on my own
Well you have been my rock for ages
The only truth I've ever found
And every time I've stumbled
You've picked me up on my way down
Oh you have been my sanctuary
You've been my haven in the storm
And I've always found a shelter
Here inside you loving arms
Could I lean on you Leona?
Could I rest here for a while
Could I lean on you Leona
Please help me make another mile
Could I lean on you Leona
Would you help me till I'm strong
Could I lean on you Leona
Till I can make it on my own?
You have always been my sunshine
When I'm running from the rain
Well I know I'm wearin' out my welcome
Just one more time please ease the pain
Could I lean on you Leona
Could I rest here for a while
Could I lean on you Leona
Please help me make another mile
Could I lean on you Leona
Would you help me till I'm strong
Could I lean on you Leona
Till I can make it on my own
Could I lean on you Leona
Could I rest here for awhile
Could I lean on you Leona
Please help me make another mile

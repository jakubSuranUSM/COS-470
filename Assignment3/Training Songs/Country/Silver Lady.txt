Tired of drifting, searching, shifting
From town to town
Everytime I slip and slide
A little further down
I can't blame you if you wont take me back
After everything I put you through
But honey you're me last hope
And who else can I turn to?

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh I've seen the light
It's just one more night without you
Here I am a million miles away from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone
Chilled to the bone
Silver lady

Double talkers and back street walkers
In every turn
Seedy motels and no star hotels
Still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my life
Was the sweet love I had with you
And honey your my last hope
And who else can I turn to?

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh I've seen the light
It's just one more night without you
Here I am a million miles away from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone
Chilled to the bone
Silver lady

Can't you find it in you to forgive me
'Cause here I am a million miles away from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone
Chilled to the bone
Silver lady

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh I've seen the light
It's just one more night without you

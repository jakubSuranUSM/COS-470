Call her your sweetheart whenever she feels blue
You know there's not a thing she wouldn't do for you
And when you are tempted to wander astray
Remember there are times she feels the very same way

Share all your sunshine and all your heartaches too
Let her know that she means more than all the world to you
You'll find the future holds a treasure worth much more than gold
If you'll only call her your sweetheart

Share all your sunshine and all your heartaches too
Let her know that she means more than all the world to you
You'll find the future holds a treasure worth much more than gold
If you'll only call her your sweetheart

Where you been Johnny?
What you been doin'?

I'm just fiddlin' round

I played this guitar till my folks were sick of it
They won't never get well as long as you're pickin' it

I played this old harp 'til my mouth looka funny
It aint no fiddle but it sure makes more money

You'll live to a hundred though, fiddlin' 'round

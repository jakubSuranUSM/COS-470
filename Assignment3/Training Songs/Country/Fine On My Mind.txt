Well girl you're fine on my mind all the time fine on my mind all the time
I never met a woman quite like you and all the sweet things you do
Stay fine on my mind all the time
My papa said someday boy true love's gonna come your way
Someday some woman's gonna love you right out of your mind
You'll lose your appetite it won't be able to sleep at night
For thinkin' bout some woman all the time
Well girl you're fine...

Well if papa could just see me Lord I know how tickled he'd be
To know some woman got me talkin' to myself
And it's been like this since it come first time we kissed
I can't seem to think about nothin' else
Yes girl you're fine...

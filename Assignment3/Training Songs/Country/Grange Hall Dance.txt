Have you ever been down to a country dance
And listend to the music of a hillbilly band
And danced with your darlin' all through the night
And don't go home til the morning light
Well if you ain't you don't know what your missing
Laughter and dancin' a huggin' and a kissin'
Everybody there's just havin' a ball
A dancin' all night at the old Grange Hall
The people they come from miles around
The ranchers farmers folks from town
There's bald headed men and old fat women
Kids in their teens and little bitty children
So put on your boots and stomp on the floor
And have more fun than ever before
Man we're really havin' a ball
A dancin' all night at the old Grange Hall

Well, the sun's comin' up and it's time to go home
The band they're playin' that final song
Everyone's leavin' and sayin' good night
But you're lookin' forward to next Saturday night
So put on your boots...
So put on your boots...

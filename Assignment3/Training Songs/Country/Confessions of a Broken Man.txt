I'm just askin' you to listen not to understand
These confessions of a broken man

I don't know where my story starts or I'd go back to them
All I know it's a sad sad tale so for it has no end
I know I drank too much though I didn't take thirst
Oh I'd have a beer or two and it just seemed to go from bad to worse

Then one day I noticed my money was goin' out
Faster than it was comin' in
And I got scared and I started gamblin'
And I'm the kind that just never seems to win

I had a woman guess every man does
And every man thinks his is the best mine was
Stuck by me through thick and thin
Till it just got too thin I guess

She walked in one day and said she had believed me
I could've sworn I saw big tear in her eye
I heard the other day that she got married again
I hope he treats her better than I

Well if you get me idea that I'm some kind of a bum
You're catchin' on pretty fast
And if you wonder if I've turned into a wino
For these are all my fingerprints on this glass

I've been sittin' here in this bar since they opened up this mornin'
And it's almost time to close tonight
I guess it's about time to go find me a gutter
Tuck myself in tonight

Where does a man go when he's already on the bottom
It's really not much choice he's got
He either picks himself up and tries again
Or just lays back down to rot

No life starts out to be like mine
Pain is never planned
And yet here I sit with nothing in the world
But these confessions of a broken man

I'm just askin' you to listen not to understand
These confessions of a broken man

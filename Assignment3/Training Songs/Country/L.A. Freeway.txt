Pack up all your dishes 
Make note of all good wishes 
Say goodbye to the landlord for me 
That sum-bitch has always bored me 

Throw out them old LA papers 
And that moldy box of vanilla wafers 
Adios to all this concrete 
Gonna get me some dirt road back street 

[Chorus] 
If I can just get off of that L.A. freeway 
Without getting killed or caught 
Down that road in a cloud of smoke 
For some land that I ain't bought bought bought 
If I can just get off of that L.A. freeway 

Here's to you old skinny Dennis 
Only one I think I will miss 
I can hear your Bassman singin' 
Sweet and low like a gift your bringin' 

Play it for me one more time now 
Got to give it all we can now 
I believe everything your saying 
Just keep on keep on playing 

[Chorus] 

Put the pink slip in the mailbox 
Leave the key in the old front door lock 
They will find it likely as not 
With all the things that we have forgot 
Oh Susanna now don't you cry, babe 
Love's a gift that's surely handmade 
We've got something to believe in 
Before you know it's time we're leavin'

[Chorus]

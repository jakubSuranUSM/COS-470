Here I am once again asking
You to dance with me tonight
Sadly pretending I'm happy
And God above only knows why

Dance with me once again darlin'
Though you no longer be mine
Soften the pains that are starting
Dance with me just one more time

I know I made my mistakes dear
By telling you things that weren't true
Don't worry about being too near
When I have this last dance with you

Dance with me once again darlin'
Though you no longer be mine
Soften the pains that are starting
Dance with me just one more time

Dance with me once again darlin'
Though you no longer be mine
Soften the pains that are starting
Dance with me just one more time

Dance with me just one more time

[Chorus]
You wrote Your Cheatin' Heart about
A gal like my first ex-wife
You Moan The Blues for me and for you
Hank Williams, You Wrote My Life.

The Cold, Cold Heart and a doubtful mind
I have known a few myself
And the gal that loved me Half As Much
As she loved somebody else.

[Chorus]

I've heard that blue old whipporwill, too
And the Lonesome Whistle whine
I know that feel; so cold, so real
When The Blues Come Around at midnight.

We've never met, I know and yet
I know you well, My Friend
And if ever I, get to heaven on high
I hope you'll shake my hand.

[Chorus]

I got ten toy soldiers for Billy Joe I got coloring book for Sue
I got a little toy train for Danny boy and a cowboy suit for Loui
I got a talkin' baby doll for Cindy I got a pair o'roller skates for Jane
And baby if we ever have any more kiss Christmas shoppin's gonna drive me insane
Gonna go this Christmas shopping well I wonder if I'll ever get through
I tried to get everybody somethin' that they wanted
But I didn't know what to get you
I read the kids letters to Santa Claus I read 'em over one by one
And I surely like to get my hands on the fella that said Christmas shoppin's fun
I got ten toy soldiers
Well I must've walked a hundred miles or more I went to every store in town
My feet started swellin' and my head started achin'
And I couldn't find a place to sit down
But to tell you the truth well I really don't mind it I could even walk another mile
Cause on Christmas mornin' when they open up the presents
Well it's worth it just to see them smile
I got ten toy soldiers

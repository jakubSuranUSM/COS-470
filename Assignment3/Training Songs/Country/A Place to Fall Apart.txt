I'll probably never see you eye to eye again
This letter's meant to be my last farewell
But you need to under-stand I'm nearly crazy
You need to know my life has gone to hell

Write me back and tell me why it ended
Send a letter that I can show my heart
I'll be somewhere between "I love you" and what you're feeling now
Lookin' for a place to fall apart

Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start
Lookin' for a place to fall a-part

I can't seem to justify your leavin' me
I'm be-wildered as to how it all came down
I thought everything was fine until your phone call
The call that turned my world around
Send me word and tell me why it ended
I need some final proof to show my heart
I'll be somewhere between "I love you" and what you're feelin' now (I love you)
Lookin' for a place to fall apart

Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start
Lookin' for a place to fall a-part

Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start
Lookin' for a place to fall a-part

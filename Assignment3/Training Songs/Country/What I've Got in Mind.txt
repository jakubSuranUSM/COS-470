There's a million things
That we could do this evening
With all the night life
And the silver screen

Oh, we've got time
And we could take the town in
Or take a fast jet, baby
Down to New Orleans

But what I've got in mind is
A small cafe out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is making love to you

Well, I confess
And you can find me guilty
I'm a selfish lover
I can't deny

But I love you 
And I don't want to share you
With any night lights
Or, darling, any other's eyes

But what I've got in mind is
A small cafe out of the way
Oh, baby, let's don't stay
No and be too late

What I've got in mind is to disappear
Or maybe just stay right here
Oh, to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is making love to you
Oh to tell the truth what I've got in mind
Is making love to you

Here it is Christmas Day and you're many miles away
And I wonder if you feel the way I do
In the air there's happiness but in me there's loneliness
For all I want for Christmas dear is you

Presents wrapped in green and gold have no arms for me to 
Hold
No lips to whisper softly I love you
Oh how happy I would be to find you underneath my tree
For all I want for Christmas dear is you

Presents wrapped in green and gold have no arms for me to 
Hold
No lips to whisper softly I love you
Oh how happy I would be to find you underneath my tree
For all I want for Christmas dear is you

I ain't afraid of her
I've hurt so much it feels just like normal to me now

I'm alone and I'm dancin', with you now, 
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin', with you now, 
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that your gone
Now that your gone

Everything you ever touched, the fingerprints like
Crime scene evidence undisturbed in dust
I don't dare touch anything of yours, because it's evidence of us
And it means everything
Well sort of

I'm alone and I'm dancin', with you now, 
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin', with you now, 
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that your gone
Now that your gone
Now that your gone
Now that your gone
Gone

I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now, 
In your old room, in your old house
I'm alone and I'm dancin' with you now, 
In your old room, but there's nobody there

Now that your gone
Now that your gone, for good

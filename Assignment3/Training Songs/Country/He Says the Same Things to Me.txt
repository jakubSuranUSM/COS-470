Shall I tell you what he said to you
When he kissed you last night
I could tell it sigh for sigh
And here's the reason why

He says the same things to me
He says the same things to me

And shall I tell you what he said to you
As he held you so tight
Let me tell you from the start
I know it now by heart

He says the same things to me
He says the same things to me

But I know how it must hurt you
To find his love isn't real
And if your heart is breaking
Think how I must feel

And did he tell you, there's no other girl
That his only love is you
If he did, there's no surprise
That's just the way he lies

He says the same things to me
He says the same things to me

Well I forded the river
I paid all my bills
Gave a gift to the giver
Now I'm headed for the hills

I paid back my borrows
Likewise all my dues
I'll be gone tomorrow
Nothing here I can use

Headed for the hills
Headed for the hills
I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

Once I had a a woman
Deaf and mute and blind
Only one could hear me
When I tried to speak my mind

Once I had a fiddle
Once I had a bow
There's nothing on the griddle
But I paid back all I owed

Headed for the hills
Headed for the hills
I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

Can't roll off to glory
Much less Arkansas
Or freedom teritory
Till you satisfy the law

No love, lock and chain
Provides me the key
No blood-soaked law of Cain
Can set my spirit free

Headed for the hills
Headed for the hills
I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

Last thing I got to do
One thing before I go
To say my love for you
Was all the love I know

If you don't forget me
I'll do the same for you
Forever in your memory
To pay back all that's due

Headed for the hills
Headed for the hills
I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

Headed for the hills
Headed for the hills
I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

I can't hear 'em calling
Headed for the hills

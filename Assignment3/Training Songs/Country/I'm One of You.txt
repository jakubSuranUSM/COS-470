They say it takes more now 
To do what our Mom & Daddy's did 
They made it look so easy 
Working hard and raising kids 
If you get in trouble at school 
You got in trouble at home 
You can't outrun mommas wooden spoon 
Or the principles telephone 
Raise your hand if you only had 
Three channels on TV 
And that little town 
That kept you down 
Is where you want to be 
Yeah I'm one of you 
Yeah I'm one of you 
No your not by yourself 
There's somebody else 
Who's been there too 
If you still wish you still had 
Some growing up to do 
Your one of me 
And I'm one of you 
Tell the truth 
Do you still wonder 
How fast your car will go 
When Sweet Home Alabama 
Comes on the radio 
I bet Jesus, and your momma 
Now their way up there 
On your mind 
Anytime you take a sip 
Or you walk across the line 
If you understand why your old man 
Said the whole worlds gone to hell 
But you still believe the American Dream 
Is alive and well 
I'm one of you 
Yeah I'm one of you 
No your not by yourself 
There's somebody here 
Who's been there too 
I know what ya thinking 
What ya drink 
And I know why you do 
Your one of me 
Yeah and I'm one of you 
Do you feel a little bit 
Out of touch 
Or politically incorrect 
Then you and me both agree 
What did you expect 
I'm one of you 
Yeah I'm one of you 
No, No your not by yourself 
There's somebody else 
Who's been there too 
I know what you think 
About the good 'ol 
Red, White, and Blue 
Your one of me 
And I'm one of you 
Your one of me 
And I'm one of you

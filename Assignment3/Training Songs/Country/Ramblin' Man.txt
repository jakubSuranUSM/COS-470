I could settle down
And be doin' just fine
Till I hear that old freight
Comin' down the line
Then I hurry straight
Home and pack and if I didn't go
I'd be 'bout lose my stack
I love you, baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I got to see
Sometimes it's hard, but you gotta understand
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Let me travel this land
From the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe
He meant for me
And when I'm gone, and at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home your ramblin' man

Dark city streets twist and moan 
In the heat as night descends 
Two searching eyes find their way into mine inviting me in 
Dancing so close, we already know how good it will be 
We slip out from the unseeing crowd, we find what we need 

[Chorus]
In the heart of the night we run like bandits 
Two hungry hearts under the gun 
In the heart of the night when we find each other 
Were stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night Heart of the night 

Cool city moon lays its touch on the room, 
Your eyes reach to me 
Two shadows fall saying nothing at all, 
We know what we need 
In the release two prisoners are free from the darkness 
One more escape surviving the heartache and madness 

In the heart of the night we run like bandits 
Two hungry hearts under the gun 
In the heart of the night when we find each other 
Were stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night Heart of the night [Chorus: x 2]

In the heart of the night 
In the heart of the night

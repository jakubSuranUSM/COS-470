I wish you never even loved me                    It makes it so hard to live without love now      I know you're often thing of me                   Sometimes I feel you so close by that it takes all my might to keep from trying to track you down

I can surly keep you out of sight                 Forget about the way you look,your smile,the way you speak                                         But I've heard in the dead of night               Outside my window silence breaking with the sollid
destination of your lonesome speed

Chours
I know the sound of your wheels
yeah,yeah,yeah
I know the sound of your wheels
yeah,yeah,yeah
I know the sound of your wheels

I had a handle on my sorrow
My composure was in order if not sufficiently intact                                            But every reminiscent echo
Brings a blow to chill my sesses and my heart quakes and tenses 'till those moments pass

Chours

Every trace, every vision
Brings my emotions to collision
Past love's lost tokens
Every cherished thought once spoken
False hope of reconciliation

Chours

Well I've never been so lonely and I've never been so blue
I'm leaving in the morning gonna backtrack to you
Your picture's here beside me and never leaves my sight
I'm kissin' like I'm kissin' you oh how I'm missin' you tonight
Well tomorrow night will be a different story well I get to hold you in my arms again
Will you find it in your heart to forget me if you do how little fool I've been
I'm hoping and I'm praying that all my prayers all come true
I'm leaving in the morning gonna backtrack to you
Well tomorrow night...
Gonna backtrack to you gonna backtrack to you gonna backtrack to you

Going gray around the temples
Usually days when I won't shave
Have a habit of tripping over ripples,
And watching them roll in to waves

[Chorus]
I've been too long riding this range
Running wild, without reins
Always traveling against the grains
And pretty girls deserve better
I'm too old to change

Can't say I've been sorry
About anything I've ran off to see
And all the nights that we roared
And going home never dawned upon me

[Chorus]

You better get gone and grow old graceful
As graceful as push-ups can get ya
But some times I look over my shoulder
And smile about what they said about me

[Chorus]

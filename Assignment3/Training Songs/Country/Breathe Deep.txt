Out of town for three days
When I hit the door
Kids running to my arms
As I kneel on the floor

Saying something about the puppy
And some kid up the pool
Something about something
That somebody did at school
Something whispered inside me

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like these are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep

I don't see her often
She just turned eight-two
The other day she didn't hear me
Slipping to her room

I watched her for a minute, didn't even speak
And she turned my way, her eyes lit up
She kissed me on my cheek
Something whispered inside me

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like these are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep

I heard it said we don't know
What we've got until it's gone
Time slows down for no one
It just keeps rushing on

Babe, I never told you
But sometime late at night
When we've said our last, "I love yous"
And you're asleep but I'm not quiet
I lie awake in the moonlight

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like this are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep, breathe deep
Breathe deep, breathe deep

She's got a big heart and her own mind a deep love it's the strong kind
She's got them long legs and that soft skin she's got a big heart
The way she moves through this old world is the way she moves my soul
Every room that she walks into comes alive
With her head held high she digs down deep and struggles like we all will
But she makes it look so easy I could die
She's got a big heart
Big old tears fall down when she's unhappy
Big old moon comes rising when she smiles
With her hair of gold and eyes so blue they haunt you when you're sleeping
Sometimes I wake up laughin' right out loud
She's got a big heart and her own mind sweet soul man she's so fine
She'll live a long time she comes from a long line she's got a big heart
Big heart she's got a big heart

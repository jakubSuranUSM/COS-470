Don't tell me your troubles
I got troubles of my own
Don't tell me your troubles
Just leave me alone

Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own

You say your sweet love's left you
What you think about me?
I got them same old heartaches
The same old miseries

Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own

It happens to the best of us
That's what they always say
So take it boy like a man
Don't stand in my way

You tell me that she's not good
She's mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face
Any heartbreak fool can see

Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own
Trouble of my own

Well, it happens to the best of us
That's what they always say
So take it boy like a man
Don't stand in my way

You tell me that she's not good
She's mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face
Any heartbreak fool can see

Leave me alone
Go on home
Tell it to a friend
I got troubles of my own
Trouble of my own

Some men drink alcohol
Some men drink juices from the vine
But as for me I'm very simple
Give me coffee every time

Make it warm and make it sweet
Just the way my life has been
Give me coffee, coffee, coffee
Coffee, coffee

And let me tell you
You have found yourself a friend
Cincinnati early in the morning
I'm waitin' on an old Greyhound

All make in Georgia
Right around a new town
I bring that coffee for a round

Make it hot, make it now
Put a little cream and sugar in
Give me coffee, coffee, coffee
Coffee, coffee

And you have absolutely found yourself a friend

A cup of china, a silver spoon
Cream out ever golden can
See that pot, ah, it's a pretty little
And it's just like a music from a band

These old bones are tired and weary
The man you can put and love again
Give me coffee, coffee, coffee
Coffee, coffee

I guarantee that you have found yourself a friend
Yes sir, you have found yourself a friend
I guarantee that you have found yourself a friend

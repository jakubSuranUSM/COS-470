I've got a blue love in my heart
What can I do, love, with my heart
It's got a burnin', yearnin' while we're a-part
I've got a blue love in my heart.

So blue the nights, so blue the days
Why don't you write to me and say;

You've got a true love in your heart
An "I'll come thru love" in your heart
And stop this burnin', yearnin' while we're a-part
I've got a blue love in my heart.

I've got an old flame in my heart
A solid-gold flame in my heart
I'm like a weepin'-willow, while we're apart
I've got a blue love in my heart.

What can I do, where can I go
I never knew I loved you so

I've got a blue love in my heart
What can I do love with my heart
I'm like a weepin-willow, while we're apart
I got a blue love in my heart.

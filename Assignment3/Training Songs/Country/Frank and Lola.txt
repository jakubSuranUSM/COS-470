Lola loves Frank, Frankie loves Lola
On their second honeymoon in Pensacola
Tryin' to find a little privacy, oh me
There'd been too much screamin', fussin' and fightin'
The doggies were yellin;, the children were bitin'
Frank and Lola tryin'to get together again 

So he took her to this movie called "Body Heat"
She said, "The Junior Mints were mushy and the sex was neat.
Oh my, Frankie weren't we better than that before our spat."
Frankie told Lola, "Honey, can't you see that I'll jump start you if
you'll kick start me."
Frankie and Lola, tryin' to get together again. 

So they strolled along the highway, they walked along the beach
They stopped at several raw bars where they slurped a dozen each
Bought a bunch of popcorn from the fat man on the dock
Baby, turn back the pages, turn round the clock. 

Lola told Frank, "Time we put it to the test."
After Frankie told Lola she was stil the best
They fell asleep in the sand underneath the Florida moon in June.
Lola counted rainbows, Frankie counted sheep
Til they almost got run over by the lieguards' jeep
Frank and Lola tryin' to get together again. 

Go, Frank, go
Lola, Lo
Go Frank, go, wow 

So they strolled along the highway, they walked along the beach
They stopped at several raw bars, ......ETC.
.......turn round the clock. 

Lola loves Frank, Frankie loves Lola
On their second honeymoon in Pensacola
Trying to find a little priva
Trying to find a little priva
Trying to find a little privacy 

Go, Frank, go
Lola, lo
Go, Mango

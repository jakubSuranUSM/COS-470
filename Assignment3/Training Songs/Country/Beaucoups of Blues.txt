I left Louisiana, I had me big plans
To go out and take me all over this land.
To see me the world, I left my sweet girl
And gave it a whirl but now here I stand,
Along side the road with holes in my soul and my shoes
And beau coups of blues.

Oh, sweet magnolia,
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf.
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough.

Oh, where are the things I saw in my dreams?
Where's the happy that freedom should bring?
I see me today and know yesterday
That I threw away my most precious things.
I see me a man who's lonely, wants only to lose
Beau coups of blues.

Oh, sweet magnolia,
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf.
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough.
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough.

You've been around for a long, long time
I've seen you here before
You'll meet some guy who really turns you on
And sneak out of the side door.

You'll never look my way I know
I ain't much to look at
But one of these nights you're going
Home with me, I'm gonna see to that.

Well I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line
I got a lot of loving I'm saving inside for you
Yes I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line
But you're gonna know that you've
Been loved when I get through loving you.

You look right at me and smiled
One time just last week
And what one look from you did to me
It kept me in my seat

But you picked another guy to entertain you that night
And I was left to entertain myself so I got into a fight

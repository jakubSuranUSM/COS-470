If half of all the things you say, were true instead of lies
Then there'd be only half as many teardrops in my eyes
If half of all the dreams I dream, were ever to come true
Then in my heart I'd feel I had, a half-way chance with you

If most of all the things I hear, were only half-way true
Then I'd be half-way happy dear and only half as blue
If you spent half the time with me, you spend with someone new
Then in my heart I'd feel I had, a half-way chance with you

A half-way love is not enough, it's always kiss an run
I just can't fool my heart that way, I must have all, or none
If part-time love is all you want, or all you care to give
Why bother with the love at all, and only half-way live

If some of all the tears that fall, were yours and not all mine
Then half the clouds would disappear and half the sun would shine
If things were only turned around and you were feelin' blue
Then in my heart I'd feel I had, a half-way chance with you

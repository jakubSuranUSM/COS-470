Take my strength, take my pride, 
Take my selfishness away 
Take my rights, take ambition, 
Capture me, make me a slave 

Break my walls, break my bones, 
Break my hardened heat 
Rip my rule, rip my will, 
Rip independency apart 

Breathe Your life, 
Breathe Your love, 
Breathe You breath and I'm sustained 
Take my hate, take my hurt, 
Express healing to my pain 

Take my flesh in all its arrogance, my stability away 
Take my life, bring fire, til only You remain 

Chorus:
Laid out on my face 
My tongue hanging out to taste 
Of You and Your death 
And to know Your name 

Accept my gifts, take my crowns, 
I spread them at your feet 
When I bleed, I bleed with joy as I taste Your suffering 
Flood life, flood peace, speak acceptance to my shame 
Allow to kneel, allow to praise, 
Give the right to speak Your name 

(chorus)

It's two tickets to a concert, it's a Daytona airbrush t-shirt
Wonderin' who's gonna kiss who first, you know what I'm talkin' about
Hey baby what you doin' tonight? 
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes of a beach towel in a spring break town
It's playin' in the night air, through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin' that American country love song

In every town and every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American
Country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on

Well it's "Chris loves Jenny" on a license plate
It's daddy gettin' mad 'cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey radio DJ, can you play that song that she loves
So I can turn it up, and maybe turn her on
An American country love song

In every town and every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American
Country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on, and on

So let's raise a glass
Cheerleaders and quarter-backs
Cowboys and country girls
All around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines
We've tried a million times
All the bad and good is against
The ones that you ain't met yet

In every town and every place
There's a boy who's tryin' to take a chance and dance
And find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar just lookin' for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes
Let them fireworks start
That American
Country love song
Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on

Am I losing you
Are my fears coming true?
How I wish I knew
Am I losing you?

Is your love really true
Is there somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?

Am I too blind to see
What's then happening to me?
Every road has a bend
Will I be sweetheart or friend?

Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?

Am I too blind to see
What's then happening to me?
Every road has a bend
Will I be sweetheart or friend?

Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new?
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you?

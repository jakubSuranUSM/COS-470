Well, I called my baby and I told her to be
Down at the juke joint a-waitin' for me
'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny
I know every joint in town
I'm a juke joint Johnny
And I'm always jukin' around

Now, I work all weekend and I draw my pay
I hit a juke joint and I throw it all away
'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny
I guess I'll always be
I'm a juke joint Johnny
And a juke joint is home to me

Now I can dance all night to a juke joint song
When the sun comes up I'm still goin' strong
'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny
Yeah, now watch me go
I'm a juke joint Johnny
And baby, you're steppin' slow

These lonesome blues don't bother me none
'Cause I know every gal that wants to have fun
'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny
There ain't no flies on me
I'm a juke joint Johnny
And a juke joint is where I'll be

Well, I told my gal I just couldn't stay
She wants to marry, but I wants to play
'Cause I'm a juke joint Johnny
I like to go all the time
I'm a juke joint Johnny
And I juke on down the line

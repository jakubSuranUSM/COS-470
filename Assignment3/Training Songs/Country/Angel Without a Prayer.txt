She's got wings that shine so bright.
They keep her up most every night.
Burning the candle at both ends.
Livin' a lie up with all her friends.
Heaven only knows what's up her sleeve
She flies to fast, an' she dips too deep.

She's an angel too high to come down.
She's an angel on the wrong side a-town.
The lights go dim on her long golden hair.
She's an angel, an angel without a prayer.

She wears a smile just like a clown.
She never seems to touch the ground.
The stars in her eyes keep her amused.
She keeps getting further from the truth.
Every day goes by just the same,
Same old lies with a different name.

She's an angel too high to come down.
She's an angel on the wrong side a-town.
The lights go dim on her long golden hair.
She is an angel, an angel without a prayer.

Devil's around every corner.
Waitin' for her to fall.

She's Daddy's little girl.
She's lookin' down at the rest of the world.
It gets lonely way up there.
She believes, but she just don't care.
Only heaven knows what's up her sleeve,
She flies to fast, an' she dips too deep.

She's an angel too high to come down.
She's an angel on the wrong side a-town.
The lights go dim on her long golden hair.
She's an angel, an angel without a prayer.

She's an angel too high to come down.
She's an angel on the wrong side a-town.
The lights go dim on her long golden hair.
She's an angel, an angel without a prayer.

She's an angel without a prayer.

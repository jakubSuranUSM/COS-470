Come live with me and be my love share my bread and wine 
Be wife to me be life to me be mine 

Come live with me and be my love let our dreams combine 
Be mate to me be fate to me be mine 

With these hands I'll build a roof to shield your head 
And with these hands I'll carve the wood for a baby bed 

Come live with me and be my love share my bread and wine 
Be part of me the heart of me be mine 

I'll try to do my best for you I'll promise you 
I'll laugh with you I'll cry with you my whole life through 

Come live with me and be my love share my bread and wine 
Be part of me the heart of me be mine

(If you don`t know E very well throw a capo on the 2nd fret and play it in D)

Faded love and winter roses always bloom in memory
Faded love and winter roses yearning hearts that used to be

Will they meet again tomorrow where we parted yesterday
Give me back the winter roses and the love you took a(E)way

Faded love and winter roses sprinkled with a lonely tear
Faded love and winter roses still recall each yester year

Will I always be a dreamer dreaming of the used to be
Faded love and winter roses live and die in memory

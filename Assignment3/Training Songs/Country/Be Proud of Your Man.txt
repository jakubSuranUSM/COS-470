Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man
Walk with me not on me talk to me not about me
Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man
Laugh with me not at me look at me not through me

Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man
Pull with me not against me see some good in the bad in me
Be assured me don't destroy me be proud of your man
Be behind me not above me hold me don't control me
Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man
Help me don't hurt me be proud of your man

For a long long time now just about every night
You found some excuse not to hold me tight
No matter what I do you sit and pout
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

Don't let that doorknob hit you going out honey
Others lips now thrill you there's no doubt
There's no burden like the love you make me live without
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

I've laid awake nights to two or three
So near to you but you're so far from me
The battle's done you won the fight no doubt
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

Don't let that doorknob hit you
Don't let that doorknob hit you going out

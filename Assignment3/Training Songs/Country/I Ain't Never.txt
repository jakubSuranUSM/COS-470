Welllllllllll, I ain't never
I ain't never
A-seen nobody like you
No no no
Never, have I ever
A-seen nobody like you

You call me up and say you'll meet me at nine
I have to hurry, hurry but I'm there on time
I walk right up and knock on your door
The landlord says she ain't here no more

I ain't never, oh darling
A-seen nobody like you
Boo-hoo but I love you
Yeah I love you
I love you just the same

Well you tell me sweet things that you don't mean
You got me livin' in a honey dream
You make me do things I don't wanna do
My friends'll say, "Webb what's wrong with you?"

I ain't never, oh darling
A-seen nobody like you
Boo-hoo but I love you
Yeah I love you
I love you just the same
I love you just the same
I love you just the same

I woke up today with a headache
More bills to pay than a corporation
Hey when will it end?
My mirror says I could use a break
An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend?

When days like these start to fall in on me
I gotta face my reflection and say
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Been burned by the fire
Been stuck under water
Strung up on the wire and still the world goes around

Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows
Pull the curtain on the hurtin' 
'cause I'm not going down

I'm not going down

Inside of me is the only 
Highway that leads 
To a true freedom
Holdin' out it's hand. 
(Holdin' out it's hand)
I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend
(Just around the bend)

Days like these bring out the strength in me
So I can face my reflection and say

Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]

I still get 
Dizzy and frantic
Lonely and paniced
But next time I won't let it beat me
No
I can see clearly
I know who I am
That's how I know I've began
Livin'

[Chorus]

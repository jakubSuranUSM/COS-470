I say that I don't worry and our parting brought no pain
I tell them I'll be happy if we never meet again
About the time I get 'em fooled and think I'm really smart
I realize that I can't hide my cry baby heart

Cry baby heart I wish you were a stone
So I could really laugh and say I'm better off alone
But like an actor in a play I stumble through my part
You're always giving me away you cry baby heart

I try to find somebody else but no one else will do
I'd rather sit at home alone and worry over you
I wish that I could run away and make another start
But what's the use I'd still obey my cry baby heart

Cry baby heart I wish you were a stone

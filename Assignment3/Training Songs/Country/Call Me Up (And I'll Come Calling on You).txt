When you're all alone and blue
And you don't know what to do
Call me up and I'll come calling on you
When you're all alone at home
And no one calls you on the phone
Call me up and I'll come calling on you
When there's teardrops big and round
In your eyes so big and brown
And your little old heart is about to break in two
Well, I know you know we know that they know
I'm in love with you
Call me up and I'll come calling on you

In Fort Worth Dallas or Houston or in San Antone
There's a little girl waitin' for me and she's all alone
In Beamount Lubbock or Austin or in El Paso
She waits for me I know
I don't care if she is pretty or sexy
As long as she comes from deep in the heart of Texas
Somewhere round about Fort Worth Dallas or Houston or ol' El Paso
She waits for me I know

In Fort Worth Dallas or Houston or in Abilene
Down there she's waitin' the girl of my dreams
In Wichita Falls or Waco or San Angelo
She waits for me I know
Don't even know what her name is just know she's somewhere down in Texas
Somewhere round about Fort Worth Dallas or Houston or ol' El Paso
She waits for me I know she waits for me I know

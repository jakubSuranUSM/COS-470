I love you so much that I can't leave you
Even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think you really want me
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good

You've got me heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You keep hurting me, I know but I just can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Now friends tell me they see you out with others
And in my heart I try hard to forget
But you come home and tell me you still love me
And I still hope there's some chance for us yet

You've got me heart over mind
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

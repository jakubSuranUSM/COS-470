I was sitting down, all by myself
Listening to everybody, everybody
He ain't be like everybody else
Oh you see, I gotta be me
And there ain't nobody just like this
I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss

But then I looked at you just sitting there
All by yourself
You listening to everybody, everybody
He ain't be like everybody else
Oh, you see
You gotta believe
And there ain't nobody just like this
You gotta believe
Oh, baby hit or miss

I was sitting down, all by myself
I was listening to everybody, everybody
He ain't be like everybody else
Oh you see, I gotta be me
And there ain't nobody just like this
I got to be me
Oh, baby hit or miss
No there ain't nobody just like this
I got to be me
Oh, baby hit or miss

I gotta be me
Baby hit or miss
You've got to believe
Baby hit or miss
You've got to believe
In yourself
Don't listen to anybody else
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe
In yourself
Don't listen to nobody but yourself
Yeah
Yourself
Be yourself
Be yourself
Like nobody else
Gotta believe

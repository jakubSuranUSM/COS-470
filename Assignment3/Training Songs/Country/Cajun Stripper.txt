Say child have you seen the Bourbon Street queen
She's feeling it revealing it down in New Orleans that Cajun Stripper queen
Dance dance dance little stripper dance while the music's hot
Dance dance dance little queenie do give it all you've got

She's got what it takes to drive you insane
She'll show you things like you ain't never seen that little cajun queen
So dance dance dance little stripper...
[ harmonica ]
She doesn't undress like all of the rest
She kicks off her shoes when she feels the blues the Cajun Stripper blues
So dance dance dance little stripper...

If would you go down to that cajun town
Tell her that I said to let her hair hang down and show you round the town
And dance dance dance little stripper...

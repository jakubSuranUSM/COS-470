I'm not worried, 'cause I know
I'll forget you in a million years or so

I'll miss you, but I know
I won't miss you but a million years or so

How I loved you, loved you so
How I lost you, maybe time and tide will let me know

But I'm not worried, 'cause I know
I'll forget you in a million years or so

How I loved you, loved you so
How I lost you, maybe time and tide will let me know

But I'm not worried, 'cause I know
I'll forget you in a million years or so

In a million years or so

My early morning sunshine with her long golden hair
Brings my cup of coffee to my bed
And her silken nightdress brushes cross my chest as she bends down
And last night's mem'ries rush into my head
With her kiss she makes me feel that even if the sun would go away then
Everything would still be just fine
And it's such a shame that every man can't start the day
With early morning sunshine but she's mine

She gives up her smile so easy and it makes the day go better
She's brightened every night we've ever known
Her hands are so warm and gentle she brushes my cheek softly
It's so good to know sunshine is my own
We've been through so much together all the joy and tears and laughter
And we've been so down we didn't have a dime
But it's such a shame that every man can't start the day
With early mornin' sunshine but she's mine

My early morning sunshine with her long golden hair...
She's mine she's mine she's mine

Gonna Find Me A Bluebird
Gonna find me a bluebird
Let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken

Much too long
Gonna chase me a rainbow
Through a heaven of blue
Cause I'm all through crying over you.
There was a time my love was needed
My life completed, my dreams come true

Then came the time my life was haunted
My love unwanted, all for you.
(Repeat 1st verse )

Whatcha' hiding? Where you running?
Baby you've been up to something
Don't you tell me it's not what it looks like

Had my heart but you tore right through it
Had your chance but you went and blew it
I might have been naive but I'm not polite

Done me in, oh, you done me wrong
Got me good baby good as gone
Don't you know you should know better than this
Then to cover up the truth with your poisonous lips
I'm not falling for it this time
Try and try to little too late
Better open up your mouth if you got something to say
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me hanging on a lie

Think you made your great escape
But I'll be the one that got away
When you finally figure it out you won't find me

Done me in, oh, you done me wrong
Got me good baby good as gone
Don't you know you should know better than this
Then to cover up the truth with your poisonous lips
I'm not falling for it this time
Try and try to little too late
Better open up your mouth if you got something to say
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me hanging on a lie

Don't you know you should know better than this
Then to cover up the truth with your poisonous lips
I'm not falling for it this time
Try and try to little too late
Better open up your mouth if you got something to say
Don't keep me waiting
Don't leave me hanging on a lie

Don't keep me waiting
Don't leave me hanging on a lie

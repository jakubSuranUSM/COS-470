"Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
"This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
"It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
"Honey won't you open that door." 
I honky-tonked around Dallas,
I got in a poker game.
Well, somebody must-a been a-cheatin',
I lost everything but my name.
Well, I walked half way to Memphis,
I finally got back home.
But I'd been better off where I was,
'Cause here's where things went wrong.

"Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
"This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
"It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
"Honey, won't you open that door." 
Instrumental break.

I went right down to see old Bob, 
I thought he was my friend.
The landlord said that Bob's not here,
The police done hauled him in.
I ran right back to little Honey's house,
I got me a rockin' chair.
"Now, Honey if you don't open that door,
"I'm gonna rock on away from here."

"Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
"This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
"It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
"Honey won't you open that door.

"Honey, honey, honey won't you open that door,
"This is your sweet daddy, don't you love me no more?
"It's cold outside, let me sleep on the floor,
"Honey won't you open that door. 
"Honey, honey, honey, honey, 
"Now, honey won't you open that door."

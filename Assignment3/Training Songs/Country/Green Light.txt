I turn your hole card upside down
I caught you cheatin' and runnin' around
There's a smile upon your face while another takes my place
And now at last dear the truth I'd found

Babe there's the green light you're free to go
You'll take a high road I'll take the low
Here's your coat and shoes and don't forget your blues
You're on canoe now you'll have to row

Babe there's the green light shift your gear
I know you fooled me for all these years
I'll hold my head up high and forget you by and by
And there'll be laughter instead of tears

Babe there's the green light kick up your heels
There'll come a day you know how it feels
To have your aces trump and be taken for a chump
Now there's the green light so spin your wheels

I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heart broke country song 
I ain't really happy 
Unless the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain

And my whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars I should have run away
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
And hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

I wake up every morning, a thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy 
To find a better way
Oh but I know I'll never change

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain

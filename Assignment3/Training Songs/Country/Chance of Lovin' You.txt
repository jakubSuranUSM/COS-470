Like a young and courageous fool
Ready to take on the night
You came dressed to kill all of the boys
And it looks like you've done enough right

You say that love is your only rule
It kinda comes from the heart
When it all comes down to what lovers do
You fall in love and just fall apart

But that's the chance you take with a lonely heart
That's the price you pay with a lonely heart
That's the game you play when there's nothin' to loose
And I could never refuse the chance of lovin' you

You're beginning to look like you're feelin' content
Just for one night of romance
If it wasn't for love, you'd still be my friend
And I still put my heart in your hand

That's the chance you take with a lonely heart
That's the price you pay with a lonely heart
That's the game you play when there's nothin' to loose
Girl I could never refuse the chance of lovin' you

That's the chance you take with a lonely heart
That's the price you pay with a lonely heart
That's the game you play when there's nothin' to loose
And I could never refuse the chance of lovin' you

The chance of lovin' you
The chance of lovin' you
The chance of lovin' you

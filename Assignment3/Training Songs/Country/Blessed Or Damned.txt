God blessed some folks with music and what a holy art
Then the devil seen us envious soles and damned the songs in our hearts
We go through life just like it was planned
Always wondering who we are blessed or damned

Read about a singer that took home all the awards
I guess he's one of the chosen few that's his reward
But there's a troubadour in a beer joint and he's singing to empty chairs and his empty can
No it ain't hard to figure out who's blessed or damned

I hope heaven has a place for those of us who lost our way
And I pray He'll understand and bless the damned

I hope heaven has a place for those of us who lost our way
And I pray He'll understand and Bless the damned
And I pray He'll understand and Bless the damned

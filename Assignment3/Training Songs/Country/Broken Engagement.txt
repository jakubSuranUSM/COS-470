They were standing in the moonlight
When he kissed his love goodbye
He had broken their engagement
For to her he told a lie

I have someone else my darlin'
I know I proved to be untrue
That is why I'm asking of you
Will you please forgive me, too

Then she murmured, oh so sadly
And the tears they filled her eyes
Then his heart it filled with pity
For he took her by surprise

If it's true you love another
Better dear than you love me
Dear, I want you to be happy
I'll forever set you free

Tho' you leave me broken hearted
I hope we'll meet again someday
In that far up home up yonder
There our love won't end this way

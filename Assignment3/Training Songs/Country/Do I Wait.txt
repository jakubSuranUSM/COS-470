Do I want to say the things I say
When I know that they are wrong
Do I wait here forever for you, would you ask me to?
I been waiting here, all night

If your not going to show
Were not gonna fight
I could stay, forever, if I tried
Surrounded by things, 
Like a shadow in the light

Do I try and stay still for you
And the clowns who park here
Fill the emptiness of the room
Do you watch me from the corner of your eye
Do we say goodbye

I waited in the wings
For you to appear
But your never coming back
Your never gonna feel
Like we did, I waited all night
I tried to let you go
Like a shadow in the light

The light, do I wait
Do I wait for you
Do I wait
Do I wait for you

Do I wait here forever for you
Did you ask me to?

Hello old broken heart I see you're back once more
Hurtin' the same way as you did before
Listen old broken heart I've got some news for you
Achin' won't help things and tears just won't do
I promised myself that I'll see you no more but you have me crying as you did before
Look here old broken heart go away and let me be
Just because he has gone don't come crying to me

I promised myself that I'll see you no more but you have me crying as you did before
Get lost old broken heart I wish you'd let me go
But no matter what happens I still love him so

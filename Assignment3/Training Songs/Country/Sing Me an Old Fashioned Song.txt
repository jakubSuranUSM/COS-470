Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song

Shoo fly don?t bother me
Shoo fly don?t bother me
Shoo fly don?t bother me
I don?t want your company
Flies in the buttermilk two by two
Flies in the buttermilk shoo fly shoo
Flies in the buttermilk skip tae ma loo
Skip tae ma loo my darlin

Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along

A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song

When I was young I used to wait
Upon my master and drain his plate
And pass the bottle when his was dry
And wash away the blue tail fly

Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t care
Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t care
Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t caaare
The Master?s gone away

Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song

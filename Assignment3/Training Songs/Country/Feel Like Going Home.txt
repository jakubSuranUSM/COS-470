Lord I feel like going home
I tried and failed and I`m tired and weary
Everything I've done was wrong
And I feel like going home

Lord I tried to, to see it through
But it was too much for me
So now I`m coming home to you
Yes I feel like going home

Cloudy skies are closing in
And not a friend around to help me
From all the places I have been
Lord I feel like going home

Lord I feel like going home
I tried and I failed and I`m tired and weary
Everything I've done was wrong
Lord I feel like going home

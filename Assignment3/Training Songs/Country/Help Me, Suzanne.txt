Help Me Suzanne
I've gotta figure it out 
While the whites of my eyes are red.
What I wouldn't give for:
A bed, a fire or a phone

Who could I call? What would I say?
I've been working all week for you.
Where would I go to even if I could go
Home?

I've been living on the memory of a dream I once had

You gave me the reason, 
For feeling like I do,
You gave me the reason,
I'd like to thank you

Help me, Suzanne
I've gotta set my sights 
On a bright sun shiny day
Coz my whole worlds gone grey
And it's going wrong
You've gotta big heart beat
And a body of work
You could do me a world of good
Yeah you could, and you did
And I'm begging you to keep on

I've been living on the memory of a dream I once had

I have lost my way,
Like I always do,
You gave me the reason,
I'd like to thank you

I've been living on the memory of a dream I once had

I have lost my head,
I have come unglued,
You gave me the reason,
I'd like to thank you (x5 and fade)

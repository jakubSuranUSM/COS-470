That hot, old summer sun 
Make you beg for your next breath 
So, you best be on the creek bank 
Laying in the shade 
Chewing on a hickory twig 
Pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig 
I ain't got a lot but I think I got it made
In the shade 

I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind 
Catching these fish like they're going out of style
Drinking this homemade wine 
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow
People, I have had a good time 
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind 

I bet the old man's in the kitchen 
He's got my kind of music on his radio 
Aah, drinking his beer and 
Dialing up the request lines 
Mama and old Aunt Joan probably in the 
Dining room trying to use the phone 
Me, I'm thinking about that girl and later tonight 

I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind 
I'm catching these fish like they're going out of style 
I'm drinking this homemade wine 
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow
People, I have had a good time 
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind 

You know the rednecks and the preppies
They're in their discos and honky-tonks 
Somewhere between raising hell and Amazing Grace 
Lord, I know just how they feel
You gotta get out and kick it up your heels 
And ain't it great to be living in the USA

Me, I'm laid up here in a 
Country state of mind 
Catching these fish like they're going out of style
Drinking this homemade wine, all the time 
If the sun don't shine tomorrow 
People, I have had a good time 
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind

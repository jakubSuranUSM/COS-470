It's too late to change your mind
I can see you're leavin' for good this time
I know I don't stand a chance
At stoppin' you from leavin' me behind

But let me tell you
I won't stand in your way
Oh babe, let me tell you
There's somethin' I got to say, hey

Baby, take a piece of my heart
Don't just throw it away
You're gonna miss my lovin'
Save it for a rainy day

I can't stop you from leavin'
I can't make you stay
Baby, take a piece of my heart
Save it for a rainy day

Now don't you worry about me
I'll make it through this dark and lonely night
I don't want your sympathy
And your apology don't make things right

But let me tell you
I won't stand in your way
Oh babe, let me tell you
There's somethin' I got to say, hey

Baby, take a piece of my heart
Don't just throw it away
You're gonna miss my lovin'
Save it for a rainy day

I can't stop you from leavin'
I can't make you stay
Baby, take a piece of my heart
Save it for a rainy day

Baby, take a piece of my heart
Don't just throw it away
You're gonna miss my lovin'
Save it for a rainy day

I can't stop you from leavin'
I can't make you stay
Baby, take a piece of my heart
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store
I might have been without a gold, just dream and nothing more
I might have known life alone but that's where you came in
Your loving arms have saved me from the things I might have been

I might have been the kind who roam a stranger everywhere
Or one of those who stay at home with no one's lips to share
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin
Keep loving me, don't let me be the things I might have been

I might have been the kind who roam a stranger everywhere
Or one of those who stay at home with no one's lips to share
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin
Keep loving me, don't let me be the things I might have been

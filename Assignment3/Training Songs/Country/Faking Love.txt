You turn down the covers
I'll turn down the lights
As we turn to each other
There's no turning back tonight

I lay on I love you
And you lay on your charms
As we lie here
In each other's arms

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

You put on the coffee
I'll put on a smile
We'll put each other on
And laugh and talk a little while

There's no use in crying
For a feeling that's all gone
We both knew we were lying
All along

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

We're just faking love

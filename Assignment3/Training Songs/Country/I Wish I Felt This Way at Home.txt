If I, could be with you forever 
My restles heart 
Would never want to roam 
I've never been loved 
The way you love me 

[Chorus]
I wish I felt this way at home 
When you kiss me 

It's words without speaking 
And I don't believe that 
God would call this wrong 
Your arms are the refuge 
I was seeking

[Chorus] 

But I don't, and I won't 
We did all that we could 

He and I 
We tried hard 
But it's just no good 
I may never be free 
'Cause I've no reason 
And I don't expect you to wait that long 
But I'll say one more time 

As I'm leavin' 

[Chorus] 

Yes, I wish I felt this way at home

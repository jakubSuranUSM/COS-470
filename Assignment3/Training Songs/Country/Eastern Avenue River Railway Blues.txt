Shadows come creepin' down the alleys,
Lonesome lines the boulevard
Neon flickers to the rhythm of the night,
But this evenin', sleep is coming hard
Down the concrete hallways in this part of town
You can hear the young hearts drowning in thirst for life
The back streets full of mystery, people 
Frozen in their dreams
Too little mercy, too little love, 
Too much night, it's too much tonight

[Chorus:]
The eastern avenue runs level with the river
In between lies the freight yard of boxcar blues
Eastern avenue railway, come on, come on and deliver
This load of tears and this pair of walking shoes
Boy's got the eastern avenue river railway blues
Trapped between him and the city,
He packed a bag and took one south bound over the line
Trapped between him and the pity, he suffers for those unfaithful times
Well, eastbound river railway runs swift and hard
He swears tonight he's gonna take that ride
Jerk a cold steel freight train right down the boulevard
He ain't gonna stop 'til all the loneliness collides
'Cause it's too much tonight
[Chorus (2x)]

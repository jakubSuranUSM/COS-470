I can see in your eyes there's been a change
My kiss that thrilled you is just a kiss now it's not quite the same
And the touch of your hand is only casually
I got a feeling that I'm losing the best part of me
The best part of me belongs to you and if I lose you what's the rest of me gonna do
You control all I am or ever hope to be
I got a feeling that I'm losing the best part of me

The best part of me belongs to you

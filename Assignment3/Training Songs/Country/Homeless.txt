She started out a rodeo queen, 
Future looked just fine
Fell in love with a boy in school, 
Married an assembly line
They were huntin' down the American dream
Wonderin' where it'd gone
When they found themselves 
To be fair game lost their home

He was laid off on a Friday night went out
Drinkin' with his friends
She stayed in the car with the kids all night, 
He never came back again
Oh what was she to do, 
Where was she to go
Is home really were the heart is 
When the heart can't feel at home

Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car 
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes

Her time is now so precious, 
She hunts for work and food
Their clothes are torn and tattered, 
So her kids stay out of school
She looks for hope under every can 
"At the sound of the tone
Just leave a message. We'll call you back" 
But they know she's not at home

Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car 
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes

In this land of milk and honey 
We share with all who need
Except the ones outside our door, 
The ones we cannot see
It's the proud, the true, 
The faithful left out in the cold
It's people just like you and me 
At the end of the road

Homeless, her and her family
Homeless, is this the way of livin' free
And her house is an abandoned car 
At the side of the road
Homeless, will she find where that road goes
Homeless, will she find where that road goes

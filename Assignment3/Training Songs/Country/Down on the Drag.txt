Down on the drag, down on the drag
Where some lowdown son-of-a-bum
Even stole my sleepin' bag
Left me standin at the news stand
Readin' want ads in the rag
My baby's back up in Lubbock
And I'm down on the drag

Well the sooner I get to Houston
The sooner I'll catch me a boat
I'm gonna cross that Gulf of Mexico
I'm takin' anything that will float
I been

Down on the drag, down on the drag
Where some lowdown son-of-a-bum
Even stole my sleepin' bag
Left me standin at the news stand
Readin' want ads in the rag
My baby's back up in Lubbock
And I'm down on the drag

Well the sooner I leave this town behind
The sooner i'll get control
Of all my dirty dreams and my hard-losin' schemes
My heart, body, mind and soul
I been

Down on the drag, down on the drag
Where some lowdown son-of-a-bum
Even stole my sleepin' bag
Left me standin at the news stand
Readin' want ads in the rag
My baby's back up in Lubbock
And I'm down on the drag

If you don't believe my story
I ain't gonna tell you no more
And if you ever expect to see me anymore
I'll be sleepin down in some doorway

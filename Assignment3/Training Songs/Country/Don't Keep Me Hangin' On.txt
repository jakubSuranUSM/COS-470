Don't keep me hangin' on let me go let me go let me go
If your love is through if your love is gone don't keep me hangin' on
I'm a big fool to love you when you treat me like I'm your clown
It's easy to see that you don't love me you just want me hangin' around
Don't keep me hangin' on...
Times when I say I'm leaving you keep begging me to stay
When I try to go you put on a show somehow I can't get away
Don't keep me hangin' on...
Don't keep me hangin' on...
Don't keep me hangin' on

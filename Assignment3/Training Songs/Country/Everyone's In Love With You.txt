Everyone's in love with You 
Everyone's in love with you 
But you don't seem to mind 
But it must be tough when you're cleanin' up 
Them broken hearts sometimes 
Or maybe you just struggle through 
And leave 'em where they lie 
But everyone's in love with you 
In love with you 

Everyone's in love with you 
They fall down at your feet 
And impale themselves knowin' full well 
You'll only watch 'em bleed 
And they won't stop 'til the final drop 
Cause they think it's what you need 
And everyone's in love 
In love with you 

You want everyone to want you 
But you don't want anyone to need you 
Cause baby you don't need to 

Everyone's in love with you 
Or don't you think I know 
The way they all light up when you show up 
And you're baskin' in the glow 
I'd like to say that I ain't that way 
Like all your other fools 
But everyone's in love with you 
And I am, too 
I am, too

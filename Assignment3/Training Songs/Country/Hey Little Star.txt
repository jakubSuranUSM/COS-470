Hey hey little star i don't know how far away you are
But tell me how does it feel to stand that close to heaven
Hey little star see the tears that i've cried here count 'em
Said she'd be here at eight it's almost eleven

See this broken heart of mine, can this broken heart of mine
Teach me how to live without her, how to forget all about her
Hey little star there you are close to heaven
Lucky you lonely me little star

See this broken heart of mine, can this broken heart of mine
Teach me how to live without her, how to forget all about her
Hey little star there you are close to heaven
Lucky you lonely me little star

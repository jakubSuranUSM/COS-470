I know your leaving is to long overdue
For far to long I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes
I watched your plane fade off west of the moon
Than I felt so strange to walk away alone

No regrets, no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The ours that were yours echo like empty rooms
But the thoughts we used to share
I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
Than it felt so strange lay awake alone

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place
Can't keep the ghosts away
But just beyond the darkest our
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone

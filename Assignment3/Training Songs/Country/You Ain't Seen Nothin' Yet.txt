Lay down the law, don't make a sound
Just critical, just going down
I don't belong, I've lost the plot
Not gullible, can't be what I'm not

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet

If I don't get with your system then I'm sure to fail
Well you ain't seen nothin' yet

Lay down the truth, don't make a sound
Just a piece of fruit who's hit the ground
I don't respond, I've lost the plot
Unethical, not what I thought

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet

I'm a bit transgressive and suppressive as well
Well you ain't seen nothin' yet

Am I a disruption to your corruption?
You ain't seen nothin' yet

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet

If I don't get with your system then I'm sure to fail
You ain't seen nothin' yet

No longer elated, now you're frustrated
You ain't seen nothin' yet

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet

If I don't get with your system then I'm sure to fail
Well you ain't seen nothin' yet

You can think that I'm evil and I'm off the rails
You ain't seen nothin' yet

I'm a bit transgressive and suppressive as well
You ain't seen nothin' yet

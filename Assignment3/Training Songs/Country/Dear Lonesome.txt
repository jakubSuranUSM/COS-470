Dear lonesome with a broken heart
If I could write myself a letter here's how I would start
Dear lonesome with a broken heart
How are things since she has left you has your whole world fell apart
Dear lonesome with a broken heart

In answer to this letter I'd say yes it's very true
No lonely heart in all the world could feel the way I do
If I could write myself a letter here's how I would start
Dear lonesome with a broken heart

In answer to this letter

My mind knows full well I should leave here
But my heart, my foolish heart will not turn
She fills me with a crazy wild desire
And, lying helpless, I know just how I'll burn

Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?
Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me

At times I've gone as far as believing
This tortured soul of mine was finally free
Then those long, silent, leftover feelings
Say I'm a pretender, and I'll surrender willingly

Back in the fire where my heart must long to be
If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?
Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me
I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me

Well, I been watchin' you cryin'
When you do, I just feel like dyin'.
Well, I could give you somethin' that would ease your mind.
Let me give it to you, 
Just a little bit would do you,
It's somethin' you been needin' for a long, long time.

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you.
Keep it close to you and save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey.
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you.
It'll grow with you and some day you can bring it back to stay.

Don't you keep me waiting now,
What's the use in hesitating?
You know as well as me, it's what you're looking for, yeah.
Put your lips on mine now, 
We can make it feel so fine now.
You never have to be without it any more.

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you.
Keep it close to you and save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey.
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you, baby
It'll grow with you and some day you can bring it back to stay.

Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you.
Keep it close to you and save it for a rainy day, hey, hey, hey.
Here's some love, take a little bit of it home with you.

[Chorus]
I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Just come on home and fool around with me

Well, I wasn't foolin' 'round the day I said "I do"
But many a night I wished that I'd been foolin' too
I know it's foolish takin' all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be

[Chorus]

So honey, fool around, you know right where I'm at
And don't worry if I'm lonesome, cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me!

[Chorus]

Please come on home, baby, I'm waiting for you, see
Mm-hm, just for you

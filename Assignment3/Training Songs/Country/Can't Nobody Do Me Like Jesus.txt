Can't nobody do me like Jesus
Can't nobody do me like the Lord
Can't nobody do me like Jesus
He's my friend

Let me tell you that He healed my body
Then He told me to run on
I said He healed my body
And then He told me to run on
I said He healed my body
Then He told me to run on
Ev'rybody say He's my friend

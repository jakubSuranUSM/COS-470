You're back in town again spreadin' talk around
That I'm still in love with you though you let me down
I hate to admit it but I guess the talk is true
Or else you couldn't make my heart ache the way you do.

I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue.

I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue...

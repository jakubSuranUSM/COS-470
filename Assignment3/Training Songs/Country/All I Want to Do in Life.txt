Last week, he spent his whole paycheck on whiskey
I know on Friday night, he'll do it all again
Oh, he'll drink till he falls down then he'll order one more round
And then go home with that bottle in his hand

And the only thing I can hold on to is this bottle in my hand
I'll know, I'll never have to share it with any other man
I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand

She told George that changing diapers can sure become a drag
And the clean a house and cooking for him is not her kind of bag
She said he needed someone who'd love and understand
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand

And the only thing I can count on now is this bottle in my hand
I'll know, I'll never have to share it, oh, with any other man
And I'm so glad you introduced us, oh, I'll do the best I can
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand
Yes, we'll be faithful to this bottle in our hand

40 days, 40 fights
40 showdowns in 40 nights
Town to town, in high demand
Can't slow down. I'm a wanted man.

Chorus
I'm a gunslinger honey
Hunting you down
Tell all your other boys
The man is back in town
Gunslinger honey gonna
Fire at will, taking aim on you and 
I shoot to thrill. Gonna show you 
How the west was won
Lock stock barrel and a smokin' gun

Jessie James got nothin' on me
Billy the Kid better let me be
They think they're good
They think they're fast
I think they're funny
I'll shoot 'em last

Chorus

you're stealing my heart you're a love outlaw
You're the hottest little pistol that I ever saw
You got the moves they're legendary
Stick 'em up I'll be your huckleberry

chorus

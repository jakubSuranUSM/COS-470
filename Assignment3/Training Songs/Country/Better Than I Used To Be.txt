I know how to hold a grudge 
I can send a bridge up in smoke 
And I can't count the people I've let down 
Or the hearts I've broke 
You ain't gotta dig too deep if you wanna find some dirt on me 
But I'm learnin' who you've been ain't who you've gotta be 
It's gonna be an uphill climb 
But honey I won't lie 

I ain't no angel 
But I've been sittin' out a few more dances with the devil 
And cleanin' up my act little by little 
I'm gettin' there 
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see 
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get 
But I'm better than I used to be 

I've pinned a lot of demons to the ground 
Got a lot of old habits licked 
But there's still one or two I might need you to help me kick 
Standin' in the rain so long has left me with a little rust 
But put some faith in me 
Some day you'll see there's a diamond under all this dust 

I ain't no angel 
But I've been sittin' out a few more dances with the devil 
And cleanin' up my act little by little 
I'm gettin' there 
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see 
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get 
But I'm better than I used to be 

I ain't no angel 
But I've been sittin' out a few more dances with the devil 
And cleanin' up my act little by little 
I'm gettin' there 
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see 
I ain't as good as I'm gonna get 
But I'm better than I used to be

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you've found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Oh it won't be long before it's cryin' time

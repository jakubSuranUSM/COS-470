Getting used to losing you is not an easy thing to do
For anyone can see I'm missing you
I still hurt the same old way and it grows worse day by day
For I lie each time I say I'm getting used to losing you
I walk down the same old street meeting friends we used to meet
Trying not to let them know that I'm so blue
But I'm afraid my heartaches show yes I'm afraid they know
But I lie each time I say I'm getting used to losing you
Getting used to losing you...

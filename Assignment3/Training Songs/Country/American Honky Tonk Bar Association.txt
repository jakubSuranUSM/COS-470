If your conversation calls for a little more than a coffee pot
If you need to pour your heart out and try to rectify some
Situation that you're facin'
Contact your American honky-tonk bar association

But when your dollar goes to all of those standing in a welfare line
Rejoice you have a voice if you're concerned about the destination
Of this great nation

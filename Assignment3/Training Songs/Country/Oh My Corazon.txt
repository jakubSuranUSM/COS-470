You are the spark
That fuels my heart
Everything for us is written in the stars
But you're feeling used
And so confused

Why do we do this to each other?

I didn't mean to make you cry
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to say goodbye
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to hurt you

I have to leave
You on your own
Back to the country where I once belonged
So adios
Mi corazon

I swear to bring my love back home now

I didn't mean to make you cry
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to say goodbye
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to hurt you

Moonlight on the patio
A kiss for a tear
Always giving me a sunrise
Help me through the fear
I will look into your life
Won't you leave with me tonight?

I didn't mean to make you cry
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to say goodbye
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to make you cry
Oh my corazon
I didn't mean to say goodbye
Oh my corazon

I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't mean to hurt you

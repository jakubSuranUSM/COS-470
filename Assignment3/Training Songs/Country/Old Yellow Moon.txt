We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon

With you
Right by my side
I got nothing to hide
From an old yellow moon

And now
As I turn back the years
So little I’ve learned
About heartache and tears

[Chorus]
But still
I’m making my way
Into the heart
Of an unknown highway

We are
Following stars
Way cross the sky
Round an old yellow moon

[Chorus]

We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon

Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon

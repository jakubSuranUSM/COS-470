Well the beer's on the bar and the smoke fills the air
And there's a fool in every corner man I just don't care
Tight pants, line dance, stetson hats and cowboy boots
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well the waitress never leaves you with a half-empty glass
And every girl's on the dance floor shakin' her... Well
It's a two step, three step, outta step, country mood
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well now everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose

Hey bartender pour us another round, 
We're just get gettin' started don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romanced, last chance rendezvous
We need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

If you've got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude
Yeah you need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

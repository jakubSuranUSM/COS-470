I was lousy at math, a failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarterback in the back of the class
She was the whiz kid in the horned-rimmed glasses
It'd been a long time since I'd been around
Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old schoolyard
And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says
?I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever?
It took a second to put it all together, I said

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

She said, ?Hop in, let's go for a spin
Tell me what you been doing boy, and where you been?
I said, ?I write songs, you probably didn't know
I finally got a couple on country radio?
She said, ?What a switch, ain't it funny
I've got a PHD., Now I'm modeling for money
Imagine little miss four point o
Smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue?
I said, ?You've come long way since graduation
Let me say without reservation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations?

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

I said, ?I hope to see you again someday?
She said, ?Another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my Mama's at eight,? I said

Oo-la-la-la-la-la lookin' good Carlene
Oh-my-my-my-my-my time's been good to you
If you know what I mean, girl you glitter like Hollywood
Good God Carlene, you sure are lookin' good

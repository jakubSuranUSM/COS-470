What I'm looking for after all this time
Keeps me moving forward, trying to find it
Since I learned to walk, all I've done is run
Ready, on my mark, doesn't everyone
Need a place in the world?

Could be right before your very eyes
Just beyond a door that's open wide
Could be far away or in your own backyard
There are those who say you can look too hard
For your place in the world

Takes some of us a little longer
A few false starts gonna make you stronger
When I'm sure I've finally found it
Gonna wrap these arms all around it

Could be one more mile or just one step back
In a lover's smile, down a darkened path
Friends will take our side, enemies will curse us
But to be alive is to know your purpose
It's your place in the world
Your place in the world
Your place in the world

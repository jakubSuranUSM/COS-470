Baby sweet sweet baby my world's so cold and empty since you've gone
Baby sweet sweet baby without you I don't know how I'll go on
I've got that lonesome feeling deep inside of me
And it just keeps right on hurtin' all the time
Oh I'd forget you if it wasn't for your memory
You're out of sight but you're never never out of my mind
Oh baby sweet sweet baby I can't help loving you the way I do
Baby sweet sweet baby please come on back and call me baby too baby

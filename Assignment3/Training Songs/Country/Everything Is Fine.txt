I got a home down on the river
I'm married to the woman of my dreams
Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
Everything is perfect or so it seems
Momma and daddy come by sometimes
And everything is fine
My old dog does a little singing
Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
Let us go and see who's getting baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
Cause everything is fine

Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine

Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week we're gonna have a fish fry

Cause everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
Wahoo!!

I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine
I'm feeling good and everything is fine

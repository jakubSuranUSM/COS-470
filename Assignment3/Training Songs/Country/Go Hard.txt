There's a girl around town
For real she's amazing
Hottest thing around
No doubt she keeps it right
And the word that came down
She's looking for a date, and
She rocks the kinda style
Every man loves to see

And I want to get that
I want to get that
Gotta be wanna be her latest lover
She's the baddest ever
I'm here to tell ya
That if it's cool for it
I know what to do for her

[Chorus:]
Have you seen her?
She's a superstar
Gotta meet her
I need to see if the love
Is as good as it looks
I'm a roll in like I should
And now watch me go hard
Real G's go hard
I really need her
I know I got a girl
But I can leave her
That's the reason I'm on
Got me blown
She's my favorite thing that I want
And now watch me go hard
Real G's go hard

Now the swagger she bring
It's the coldest thing
She looks like a handful
I want to get a handful
I gotta let her know in time
Every day in every way she blows my mind

And I want to get that
I want to hit that
Gotta be wanna be her latest lover
She's the baddest ever
I'm here to tell ya
That if it's cool for it
I know what to do for her

[Chorus]

And I tell you what
Through our conversation
She'll know whats up
See, I don't play that
So when I say that
Give me a week at the most
And I'll be inside on the low

And I want to get that
I want to hit that
Gotta be wanna be her latest lover
She's the baddest ever
I'm here to tell ya
That if it's cool for it
I know what to do for her

[Chorus]

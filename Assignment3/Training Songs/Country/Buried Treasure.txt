Now if the aim in your life is to settle me down,
I couldn't change my point of view;
I got a lady in red at the back of my head,
But the woman in white is you.

Do you want to be the only one,
Fade away in the morning sun?
I could love you all of my life;
You are my wife; haven't I let you know?

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.

Well, it's a long way down, and you've got to get up,
You've got to figure on a master plan;
You couldn't do it; if you don't get ready,
You'll be beaten by the other man.

Do you want to be the last one in;
Play the game that you just don't win?
I can see me making you cry, saying goodbye,
But I could never let you go.

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.

Well, you've taken my life in the palm of your hand Ã¢??
Make you mine for another day;
There ain't nobody that doesn't need anybody
When the good times turn away.

I don't want to be the lonely one,
Fade away in the evening sun;
I could love you all of my life;
You are my wife; haven't I told you so?

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.

We don't need it, we don't need it

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.

Yesterday you smiled and my world stopped its turning
All the love in your eyes was so strong
From my first hello to last night's bitter tears
And darling I have loved you though in my world you don't belong
Do you remember that first night when I told you I'm not free
And the way we tried so hard not to fall
But somehow time and fate had brought our lives together
And darling I have loved you though in my world you don't belong

Do you remember
Yes darling I will love you though in my world you don't belong

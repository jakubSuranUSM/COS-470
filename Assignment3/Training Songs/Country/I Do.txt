I got a letter today 
An invitation
And the writing looked like you
Hello how are you and by the way
Please RSVP I do 

I thought of writing sad words of how it used to be
But I didn't want to bring you down, no
I guess the bells will ring pretty well there without me
Don't worry 'bout me baby I'll wear the thorny crown
I will play the clown 

[Chorus:]
If you think that I don't love you, you're just wrong
And that don't matter now anyway
I couldn't bear to see you up there with a white dress on
Here's my vow to you
I'll stay away 

I remember when in a lover's whisper you said
No other man would ever share your bed
Well we both know that's not been so 
And I wish I'd never let you go now
You found a better man instead 

I wish you health and wealth and a white house on a hill and I
I hope you raise a family
Little boy and a little girl, a little more joy in this little old world
Well, that'd be enough for me 

[Chorus] 
Time rolls on
And dreams they die
And I've thrown out the pictures I had of you and I
And if you're ever wondering if love can be true
Well, think of me and remember darling like I, like I do 

Ole friendships fade away, love falls apart
And you've not spent a single day outside my heart
But, there's just one more dream that I have left for you
I hope you're smiling when he turns around and says I do. . .
I do
I do
I do
I do

Three days that I dread to see arrive  
Three days that I hate to be alive 
Three days filled with tears and sorrow 
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow 

There are three days I know I will be blue 
Three days I'll dream of you 
And it does no good to wish these days to end 
'Cause the same three days start over again 

Three days that I dread to see arrive 
Three days that I hate to be alive 
Three days filled with tears and sorrow 
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow

There are three days I know I'll be blue 
Oh, three days I'll always dream of you 
And it does no good to wish these days would end 
'Cause these three days start over again 

Three days that I dread to see arrive 
Three days that I hate to be alive
Three days filled with tears and sorrow 
Yesterday, today and tomorrow

Three days
Three days
Three days

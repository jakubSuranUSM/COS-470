Christmas trees in window panes
Shimmering where tinsel hangs
And the butter light of candle sticks
Chases snowflakes off the breaks

The postman, is shivering
With packages he's delivering
Ribbons pull and try to hide
Wishes waiting warm inside

And everything looks better in gold and green
The lights on the trees shining all through the city
Are the prettiest I've ever seen
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight

The carolers, they sing Noel
Silent Night and Silver Bells
And all around you, snow will fall
Like confetti stars, and paper dolls

And everything looks better in gold and green
The lights on the trees in the eyes of our children
Are the prettiest I've ever seen
And the world decides to sleep safe tonight

The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields where they lay

Everything looks better in gold and green
(Everything looks better in gold and green)
Everything looks better in gold and green
(Everything looks better in gold and green)
Everything looks better
Everything looks better

Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to show, the last one to know
The last one you thought you'd see there
I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
Then I toasted you, said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and there beer chases
My blues away and I'll be OK
Hey, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

I guess I was wrong. I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's all right, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
But give me an hour and then
I'll be as high as this ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and there beer chases
My blues away and I'll be OK
Hey, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

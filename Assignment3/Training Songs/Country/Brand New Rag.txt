Oh, darlin', you say that I blew your life away
But I can tell you, you're gonna get it back someday
I've got a brand new rag, it ain't the same old rag
I've got it in the bag, I'll bring it home to you

Sugar, I wanna make it nice for you
Yeah darlin', I'll bring it overnight to you
I've got a brand new rag, it ain't the same old rag
I've got it in the bag, I'll bring it home to you

Honey, I wanna give it all I can
Yeah woman, I'm gonna be a better man
I've got a brand new rag, it ain't the same old rag
I've got it in the bag, I'll bring it home to you

Lord I know you've got your own world
And you look good, I done you wrong, girl
But I want you to love me like you did before

And Lord I know you've got your own dream
Don't I know I've done a wrong thing
But I want you to love me like you did before

I can tell you I'm gonna give it all I can
Woah, now woman, I'm gonna be a better man
I've got a brand new rag, it ain't the same old rag
I've got it the the bag, I'll bring it home to you

It ain't the same old me, you've gonna have to see
I'll bring it home to you, I'll bring it home to you
I'll bring it home to you, I'm comin' home to you

I'm tryin' to get over you, seems to take so long
I'm cryin', it's about you, God, where did this thing go wrong?

Forever I will love you, I?ll never get over loving you
Forever I will love you, I?ll never get over loving you

I had always thought I?d spend my life with you
Now I know I?ll only spend my whole life through, remembering you

Forever I will love you, I?ll never get over loving you
Forever I will love you, I?ll never get over loving you
Forever I?ll be loving you

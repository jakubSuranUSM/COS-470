Every year about this time the local gentry
Have a meeting in Chickasaw land
They all come to judge each and every entry
That wants to try out for the Okolona band

All the way from the Kosciusko
Up from Biloxi Shore
All in all there's not a half grown man
That wouldn't like to be
In the Okolona River Bottom Band

La la la la la
Ooh hey hey hey
La la la la la

The semi-annual
Come as you can-ual
Five man band-ual
Okolona River Bottom Band

La la la la la
Ooh hey hey hey
La la la la la

The backwood majority
No hold barr-edy
Come as you are-edy
Okolona River Bottom Band
La la la la la

All the way from Kosciusko
Up from Biloxi Shore
All in all there's not a half grown man
Who wouldn't like to be
In the Okolona River Bottom Band

La la la la la

See, I told you society
Green apple pie-ety
Delta variety
Okolona River Bottom Band

La la la la la
Ooh hey hey hey

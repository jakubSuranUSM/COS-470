All of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over
I've been pushed and I've been shoved been put down by the people I love
I've been hurt and I've been scorned at times I've wished I'd never been born
But all of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over
I was raised in a two room shack the only thing I owned was hanging on my back
Been in trouble thrown in jail I had nobody to draw my bail
But all of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over
[ strings ]
I been lost but now I'm found there ain't no way to keep a good man down
You came along and took my hand and now I feel like a newborn man
And all of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over
All of my hard times soon be over all of my hard times soon be over

Every night and every day you go on the same old way
Do you have to keep reminding me he's gone now
And you're saying I was wrong but I knew that all along
So be quiet mind we stayed away too long now
Now that he's no longer mine you think of him all the time
If you let me be I might forget him somehow
Yes I've lost my love it's true do I have to lose you too
Please be quiet mind I want to go to sleep now

Well it's almost breaking dawn must he still go on and on
We'll just have to learn to get along without him
For the only thing you do is to drive me out of you
Please be quiet mind let's hear no more about him
Now that he's no longer mine
Please be quiet mind I want to go to sleep now

Now broken hearted people always seem to drink
And tryin' to drown those sorrows ain't as easy as you think
But living with a liar is a hard old way to go
Laughin' just to keep from crying ain't no way to grow old

[Chorus]
So take me to a barroom driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool

They say that whiskey ain't the best way, but then I ain't too smart
To think I just found out she was lyin' from the start
So if this is nothing but a bad joke lookin' for a laugh
Hold on to your lampshade darlin' cause I'm looking for a hat

[Chorus]

So get this taxi movin' cause I got no time to lose
There's no time to be choosy, any old bar will do
Cause I'm lookin' to get silly and I'm lookin' to get loose
And if that don't get it done darlin', I'll come looking for you

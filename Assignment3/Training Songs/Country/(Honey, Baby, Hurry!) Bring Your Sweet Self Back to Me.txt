Honey, baby
Listen, oh my darlin', please listen and hear me
And take those feet of yours and come to me
So you can take those arms of yours and squeeze me
I'd be so happy, things would be right
Oh, you could take those lips of yours and kiss me all the night
So hurry darlin', I'm in misery
Yes, yes, hurry and bring your sweet self back to me

Smile with those eyes of yours, tell me you care
Then take those hands of yours and run through my hair
And love me, darlin', both night and day
Well, I know just what you'll do, sweetheart, if you feel the same old way
You'll hurry, honey, my sweet baby
Oh yes, you'll hurry and bring your sweet self back to me

Come take those ears of yours, hear what I say
And take those things of yours, and head my way
And don't be slow, hon, please hurry up
Oh, catch a plane because a train just ain't fast enough
You've been away, dear, too long, you see
Oh yes, yes, please, please hurry, bring your sweet self back to me

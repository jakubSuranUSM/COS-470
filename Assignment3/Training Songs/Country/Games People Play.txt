Games People Play
Oh the games people play now 
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
 
Never saying what they mean
So they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
'Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

[Chorus]
La da da da da la da da dada dee
I'm talking 'bout you and me 
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
 
Break their hearts and they say goodbye
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one would ever give in

So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the ways it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

[Chorus]

People walkin' up to you
Singin' glory hallelujah
And they try to send it you
In the Name of the Lord

Oh they teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
And the further more the hell with hate
Come on and get on board

[Chorus]

Look around and tell me what you see
What's a happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

'Cause you're givin' up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
Whoa and you don't give a dah dah dah

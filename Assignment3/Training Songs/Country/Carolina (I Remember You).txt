When it's Christmas time in Carolina
The kinfolks gather up at Grandma's house
And they fill the house with love
And they honor God above
They remember what the season's all about

It's been ten long years since I've been there with them
And I can't face another holiday alone
And tonight I'm going back
And if this train don't jump the track
I'll spend Christmas Eve with all the folks at home

Carolina I hear you calling
I just have to close my eyes and I'll be there
Carolina I hear you calling
I can almost touch the mountains in your hair

When I left my home in Carolina
I never thought that things would get this far
I was only seventeen when I struck out for New Orleans

Trying to do or die on my guitar
Well I always thought someday I'd be returning
But I kept drifting with that same old traveling wind
Can I still call you home or have I stayed away too long
Carolina would you have me back again

Carolina I hear you calling
I just have to close my eyes and I'll be there
Carolina I hear you calling
I can almost touch the mountains in your hair

(Carolina)
Carolina I hear you calling
I just have to close my eyes and I'll be there
Carolina I hear you calling
I can almost touch the mountains in your hair
I can almost touch the mountains in your hair

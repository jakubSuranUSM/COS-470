Miranda works the late night counter
In a joint called Betty's Diner
Chrome and checkered tablecloths
One steamy windowpane

She got the job that shaky fall
And after hours she'll write till dawn
With a nod and smile she serves them all

Here we are all in one place
The wants and wounds of the human race
Despair and hope sit face to face
When you come in from the cold

Let her fill your cup with something kind
Eggs and toast like bread and wine
She's heard it all so she don't mind

Arthur lets his earl gray steep
Since April it's been hard to sleep
You know they tried most everything
Yet it took her in the end

Kevin tests new saxophones
But swears he's leaving quality control
For the Chicago scene, or New Orleans
Where they still play righteous horns

Here we are all in one place
The wants and wounds of the human race
Despair and hope sit face to face
When you come in from the cold

Let her fill your cup with something kind
Eggs and toast like bread and wine
She's heard it all so she don't mind

Jack studies here after work
To get past high school he's the first
And his large hands seem just as comfortable
With a hammer or a pen

Emma leaned and kissed his cheek
And when she did his knees got weak
Miranda smiles at 'em and winks

Here we are all in one place
The wants and wounds of the human race
Despair and hope sit face to face
When you come in from the cold

Let her fill your cup with something kind
Eggs and toast like bread and wine
She's heard it all so she don't mind

You never know who'll be your witness
You never know who grants forgiveness
Look to heaven or sit with us

Deidre bites her lip and frowns
She works the stop and go downtown
She's pretty good at the crossword page
And she paints her eyes blue black

Tristan comes along sometimes
Small for his age and he's barely five
But she loves him like a mama lion

Veda used to drink a lot
Almost lost it all before she stopped
Comes in at night with her friend Mike
Who runs the crisis line

Michael toured Saigon and back
Hair the color of smoke and ash
Their heads are bowed and hands are clasped
One more storm has passed

Here we are all in one place
The wants and wounds of the human race
Despair and hope sit face to face
When you come in from the cold

Let her fill your cup with something kind
Eggs and toast like bread and wine
She's heard it all so she don't mind

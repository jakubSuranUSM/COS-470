I've been holding back words
And waiting for time
Cause there's a lesson here somewhere
I know it's mine
And though I'll remember the promise we made
Promises don't justify feeling this way anymore

It's time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooh, the hurt grows
Every time I think it's over

You've been keeping all your secrets inside
I know the truth now baby
You don't have to hide, no no no
But my mind wanders to the very first day
What a shame things had to turn out this way

Oh, it's time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooh, the hurt grows
Every time I think it's over

No words could bring back your affection
And no lies could keep me holding on
And holding on and holding on, yeah

And now I know it's time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooh, the hurt grows
Every time I think it's over
It's time to realize
That we're both just living lies
And way down deep inside
The time is telling me it's time for letting go

Let it go
I keep telling myself over and over
Let it go
But my love's still strong
I just can't keep holding on
And holding on and holding on
I know, oh I know

We shared the same last name and the same color eyes
But we fought like tigers over that old red bike
"I'm battin' first and you can't use my glove"
It wouldn't take long until push came to shove

But we looked out for each other
With brotherly love

You hated girls 'til I had my first date
I brought her home from the movies, you stayed up late
Three on the couch watchin' TV
I was smilin' at her while you were laughin' at me

But, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Brotherly love

There's a bond that brothers know
And it gets stronger as they grow
A love that time and miles can't come between
We disagree but in the end
There will never be two closer friends
And brotherly love is something we all need

They share the same last name and the same color eyes
But they fight like tigers over one old red bike
And lookin' at them reminds me of us
They're gonna fight and they're gonna fuss

But, they've got something special
It's brotherly love

Yeah, they've got something special
It's brotherly love

The five o'clock Friday blows
I let it go
I got to let it go
I put on my weekend clothes
Turn on the rock n' roll 

Throw all our cares away
It's a ragtop day
It's a ragtop day 

Classy little white and red turns everybody's head
My baby meets me at the Five and Dime
She's always right on time 

We roll all our cares away
It's a ragtop day
It's a ragtop day 

Cruise across the county line
A little dance and dine
A drive in picture show
And when the midnight's comin' down
We're headin' back to town
She lets her lovin' show 

Feels like we're the only ones to see the morning sun
Sleepin' through the afternoon and risin' with the moon
Oh don't the stars look bright
It's a ragtop day
It's a ragtop day
We'll throw all our cares away
I live for that ragtop day

Blue boy
That's what they call me
'Cause I'm so lonely
Since I lost you

Blue boy
I'm known as blue boy
You found a new boy
And now we're through

I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you

Blue boy
I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me
As I need you

I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you

Blue boy
I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me
As I need you (blue boy)
As I need you (blue boy)

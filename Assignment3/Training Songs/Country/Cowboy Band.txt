When I was young and just a boy
I Had myself a dream
I'd get a horse and ride the range
With Roy and Gene
We'd save the girl in the nick of time
And have the fastest guns
Sing a song while the credits rolled
And disappear into the setting sun

I didn't want to play football
Or be a business man
All I ever really wanted to do was play in a cowboy band

So give me a guitar
And some shined up boots
And I'll show you where I stand
Somewhere out on the Navajo trail (Somewhere out on the stage tonight)
Playin' in a cowboy band

When I was nine I stood in line
To see Merle and The Strangers play
But when the show was over and the lights went down
I climbed up on that stage
I looked at all that I would play
And they'd be dancin' in the aisles

So give me a guitar
And some shined up boots
And I'll show you where I stand
Somewhere out on the Navajo trail (Somewhere out on the stage tonight)
Playin' in a cowboy band

Yea, I just might be in your hometown tonight
But I'll be playin' in a cowboy band

I used to do you like this
Do you like that
This way that way anyway but the right way
Was OK baby
Oh I guess you had to leave before I could see

That you're the only one with everything I need
But you won't even call me
You won't even talk to me
Come on and talk to me

[Chorus]
Oh baby,
If I could be back in your arms again
I'd tell you all the things
I should have said back then,
I want to let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey,
You know if I could just hold you one more time
And tell you all the things
That I've got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

You used to do me so good
Do me so right
Everytime I need you in the middle of the night
You'd be right there baby

Oh I never thought I'd wake up and you'd be gone
If you could find it in your heart to come back home
Honey if you let me
I can make it up to you,
I'll make it up to you

[Chorus]
Oh baby,
If I could be back in your arms again
I'd tell you all the things
I should have said back then,
I want to let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey,
You know if I could just hold you one more time
And tell you all the things
That I've got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

I was havin' me a good time givin' you a bad line
Everytime I got home
But now I'm goin' insane I thought
I had a good thing
My good thing's as good as gone

[Chorus]
Oh baby,
If I could be back in your arms again
I'd tell you all the things
I should have said back then,
I want to let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey,
You know if I could just hold you one more time
And tell you all the things
That I've got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

Oh baby,
If I could be back in your arms again
I'd tell you all the things
I should have said back then,
I want to let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey,
You know if I could just hold you one more time
And tell you all the things
That I've got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

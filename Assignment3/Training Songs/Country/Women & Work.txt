Now it's one shot of women, one shot of work
One shot's sweeter but both can hurt
Just let it go, kid just let it go

Feels alright for being so wrong
Don't look back cause it wont last long
Just let it go, kid just let it go

Raise up your glass, lets make a toast
It'll hurt in the morning but you still need 'em both

A honkey tonk and a jack knife
A tomahawk and an ex wife
Come on kid let's drink 'em down
Kid dont let it get you down

I'm playing too fast, thinking too slow
Women and work and the kid don't you know
Just let it go, kid just let it go
Now come on in get out of the cold
The women and the work
Got you froze to the bone

A honkey tonk and a jack knife
A tomahawk and an ex wife
Come on kid let's drink 'em down
Kid dont let it get you down

Now the women and the work and the booze in between
Got you puking in the aisles, smashing tvs
Kid don't let it get you down

It's one shot of women, one shot of work
Don't try to sip 'em cause it only they only taste worst
Just let it go, kid just let it go

Raise up your glass, let's make a toast
You can't win 'em all but you still need 'em both

A honkey tonk, jack knife
Tomahawk, ex wife

A honkey tonk and a jack knife
A tomahawk and an ex wife
Come on kid let's drink 'em down

Come on kid let's drink 'em down
Kid don't let it get you down

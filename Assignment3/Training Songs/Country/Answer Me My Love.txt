Answer me, oh my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please, answer me sweetheart
You were mine yesterday
I belived that love was here to stay
Will you tell me where I've gone astray
Please, answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still care about me
Please, listen to my prayer
You should know I've been blue
Will you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please, answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still care about me
Please, listen to my prayer
You should know I've been blue
Will you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please, answer me my love
Answer me my love

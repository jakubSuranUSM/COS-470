When he needs arms to hold him mine are always there
When he needs lips to kiss him mine are always near
And when he needs consolation my voice is loud and clear
I want to be enough of a woman to please my man
Know enough to tease him know enough to please him
I want to be enough of a woman to hold my man
His moods are many he changes with the wind
Like a little boy one minute the next a big strong man
I understand him like a mother and love him like a lover
I want to be enough of a woman to please my man
Know enough to tease him

I want to be enough of a woman to hold my man

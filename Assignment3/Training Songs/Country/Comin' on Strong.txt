I said I'd call sometime
No I think I just said I might
'Cause I was cool as Colorado
Mr. Saturday Night
We're talkin' shades on
Leanin' on the pay phone

I let her know right off I was the restless kind
Don't expect for me to get all tangled up and tied
I was one smooth cowboy
But don't look now boys

She's comin' on strong from outta nowhere
She's some kind of sweet and I'm some kind of scared
She's touching my hat and I don't even care
She's comin' on strong
In her big blue eyes I can do no wrong
I was doin' alright gettin' by on my own
'Til little miss you-know-who comes along
She's comin' on strong

Now who's that callin' me her little honeybear?
Sittin' next to me with her head on my shoulder
We're talkin' up close
And I'm thinkin' uh-oh
Where's all this lovey dovey stuff comin' from?
I've tried to tell her I'm no good
And anyday I'm bound to run but she just laughs
Man, what's up with that?

She's comin' on strong from outta nowhere
She's some kind of sweet and I'm some kind of scared
She's touching my hat and I don't even care
She's comin' on strong
In her big blue eyes I can do no wrong
I was doin' alright gettin' by on my own
'Til little miss you-know-who comes along
She's comin' on strong

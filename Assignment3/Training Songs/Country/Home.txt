These days I wake up in some place new
Where my old guitar's the only familiar face in this room
And if I close my eyes I don't have to think real hard
I can almost see me standing in my old backyard

Chorus:
There's no place like home
It holds you like a warm soft kiss
Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed
I could travel around this world
No matter where I go
A part of me will always be at home

There's a world of things that money just can't buy
Like the smell of momma's coffee, the sound of crickets in July
Sometimes I dream I'm back there once again
In a town you can't pass through without shaking someone's hand

Chorus:
There's no place like home
It holds you like a warm soft kiss
Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed
I could travel around this world
No matter where I go
A part of me will always be at home

Miles and dreams may come between us
But no one's gonna steal the feeling
Of the place where you grew up

Chorus:
Home, it holds you like a warm soft kiss
Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed
I could travel around this world
No matter where I go
A part of me will always be at home

The heart of me will always be at home
Home

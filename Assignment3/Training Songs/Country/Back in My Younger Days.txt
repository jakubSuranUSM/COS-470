Back in my younger days I used to go all night long
Now I just stay at home and everything is all right
Back when I first met you I used to live in a haze
But that was so long ago back in my younger days
I would do anything just to stumble and fool
It's a wonder I'm standing here I've broken so many rules
Now I dance with you every night and still I'm amazed
Your love made a man of me back in my younger days
Oh it doesn't seem that long ago
You you make it feel like the first time we made love
And I ain't even gettin' enough well well well

As I go through the photographs I laugh and turn the page
It's the ballad of me and you from such an innocent age
Talk about a dream come true we reinvented the phrase
It's better than it used to be back in my younger days
Back in my younger days back in my younger days
It's better than it used to be back in my younger days

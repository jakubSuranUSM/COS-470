You're on my mind I'm in the dark
You're taking your time I'm falling apart
Girl you're holding mine in your hands and you know it
I'll get it right if you give me the chance to get closer
I'll give you my heart if that's what you're after
I'll give you my love if that's all the matters to get over
Yeah that's all right with me if you want to play hard with me
Don't make it easy for me
Down on my knees take a look at me
I'm easy to please so why can't you be
Girl you're holding mine in your hands and you know it
I'll get it right if you give me the chance to get closer
I'll give you my heart if that's what you're after
I'll give you my love if that's all the matters to get over
Yeah that's all right with me if you want to play hard with me
Don't make it easy for me
Yeah that's all right with me if you want to play hard with me
Don't make it easy for me

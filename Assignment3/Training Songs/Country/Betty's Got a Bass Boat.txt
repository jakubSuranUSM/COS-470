Now Betty was your average ordinary girl
Never wanted very much out of this world
Just an occasional dinner and a twirl from a regular guy

So Betty sat up one lonely night
Trying to figure out what a man might like
Then like a bolt right out of the blue she got herself a plan

Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town
Since she got a new rifle and a hunting hound
It might be coincidental, just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better
Since Betty got a bass boat

Now lately getting a date isn't all that hard
There's a half a dozen bubbas fighting in the yard
She won 'em all over with her southern charm and a satellite dish

Now Betty can't believe her popularity
She's thinking 'bout marketing her recipe
So ironic that the funny thing is she never even liked to fish

Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town
Since she got a new rifle and a hunting hound
It might be coincidental, just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better
Since Betty got a bass boat

She's got bowling shoes, she can't lose
She's got them boys just blowing their fuse
She's got a big screen, she's in the "in scene"
They're even gonna make her watermelon queen

Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town
Since she got a new rifle and a hunting hound
It might be coincidental, just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better
Since Betty got a bass boat

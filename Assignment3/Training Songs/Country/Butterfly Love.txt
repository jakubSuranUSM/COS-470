Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower, drops their heads to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love comes drifting by

I found out just what it is that you like most of all
To take a little honey then let our poor hearts fall
How I got mixed up in this I guess I'll never know
I would like to clip your wings and then tell you no

Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower, drops the leaves to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love comes drifting by

I'm just one of a hundred flowers waiting for your butterfly love

I grew here in a garden with a hundred more or so
I've never dreamed my face would come from a love as pure as snow
Every time I see your wings a floating in the breeze
I know I'm helpless and you come and go just as you please

Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower drops the leaves to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love come drifting by

I'll need a net to catch you and when I finally do
I'll make you taste a bitter love the kind I got from you
I'll take a hundred others and love them one by one
And you can watch just like I did then I'll have all the fun

Your butterfly love that flutters around
From flower to flower drops their heads to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love comes drifting by

I'm just one of a hundred flowers waiting for your butterfly love

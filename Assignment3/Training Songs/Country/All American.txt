All Americans

There’s a strip mall round the corner, Lease signs in every window
All Americans

There’s a strip mall round the corner, Lease signs in every window
And fear in almost all my neighbors’ eyes
There’s a disconnect between the politicians and the people
We know half the time their gonna lie
Aren’t we all on the same side?

There’s no us and there’s no them were all out there on a limb
There’s no Kings and there’s no Queens just a pot of melted dreams
What makes us so quick to fight no one wants to compromise
Sometimes its all so hard to understand. Aren’t we all Americans?

We can’t agree on nothing even as our country's hanging in the balance by a thread
There’s bonuses for bosses and bankers hiding losses while our leaders
Close their eyes and turn their heads
Aren’t we all on the same side

What if my sons class was closing down, by brothers house the bank sold out, 
My father’s farm we could not save. 
My mother lost her job today
My wife just said tuitions more another year we can’t afford 
So my Daughters dropping out of school if this was me what would I do?

There’s no us and there’s no them were all out there on a limb
There’s no Kings and there’s no Queens just a pot of melted dreams
What makes us so quick to fight 
No one wants to compromise for some time its all so hard to understand
Get back to being neighbors and friends, 
Aren’t we all Americans

I blame the vain for what we wear
And I blame the blind when we can't see
I blame it all on somebody else
'Til there's nobody left, then I just blame me

I blame her mind for the thoughts we share
Whoa, and I blame her heart for the time we cared
I blame it all on how we used to be
'Til she's finally gone, then I'll just blame me

So go ahead and blame anything that you want
'Cause it all end up the same
When everything that you've been claiming is wrong

Oh and don't you know that blame
Is always never enough
It just keeps you in the game
'Til you've only got yourself left to bluff

I blame the vain for what we wear
And I blame the blind when we can't see
I blame it all on somebody else
'Til there's nobody left, then I just blame me

'Til she's finally gone, then I'll just blame me

When the man comes to you
Tells you what you always knew was comin'
You feel it came twice as fast
You always thought the world would last way past you
But now you find it's time
'cause there's nothin' left around you
Spaceship orion's there waiting to part the air above you
Â 
Waiting to take you
Waiting to place you
In a world exactly different
From the one you leave behind
If you find it man you're lucky
But it still won't be the same
If can't be like home
It can't feel like home
To you there
It can't be like home
It can't feel like home
To you there
If can't be like home
It can't feel like home
To you there

You slipped around you played a game you just couldn't be true
This broken heart beat only for one while yours was divided by two
I've never known a broken heart or what shame was all about
Until you broke the trust that I had and filled my life with doubt
I'm broken hearted and lonesome tonight you've got somebody new
The love that I gave you was only for one while yours was divided by two

I've never known a broken heart or what shame was all about
Until you broke the trust that I had and filled my life with doubt
Your love alone was all that I asked after we said I do
The vows that I made were only for one yours were divided by two

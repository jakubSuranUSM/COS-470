Lost in the eyes
Back through the eyes
Where the simmering rain
Has come boiling over again

Locked in a cage
Down in the cave
Where the night never ends
But nighttime was always a friend

As I walk together
So I drift away

You say
It's just the taste of the sun you're after
But you're calling out to the wind
In your broken laughter

Locked in a cage
Down in the cave
Where the night never ends
But nighttime was always a friend
Touched by some hand
Born stupid
I'm at your disposal again

Lost in my room
Locked open
The sparkling shadows of dance
I'm endlessly caught in this weight

I had lived a life of sin in this world were living in
I had done forbidden things I shouldn't do
I ask a beggar along the way, & u can tell me where to stay
Where I'd find real happiness and love that's true

Across the bridge, there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge, there's no more pain
The Sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again

Follow footsteps of the King and you'll hear the voices ring
They'll be singing out the glory of the Lamb
The river of Jordan will be near, the sound of trumpets you will hear
You'll behold the special place ever known to man

Across the bridge, there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge, there's no more pain
The Sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again

Across the bridge, there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge, thees no more pain
The Sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again

Across the bridge, there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge, there's no more pain
The Sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again

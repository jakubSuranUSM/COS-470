I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all
I'm gonna be your full time man or I'm not gonna answer your call
Well I'm sick and tired of this song and dance from now on I'm gonna wear the pants
I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all
Well I'm gonna be your number one I don't like number two
Yes a number three well I might be well just between me and you
I'm all through bein' your puppy dog all through with jumpin' when you say frog
Well I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all
[ dobro ]
Well I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all
Yeah I'm gonna be your full time man or I'm not gonna answer your call
The next time you treat me like a mouse I'm gonna rat your hair for the house
I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all
Yeah I'm gonna be your full time daddy or I won't be no daddy at all

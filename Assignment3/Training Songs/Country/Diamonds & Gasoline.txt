Undercover 
And blame it on the season
It ain't no kinda reason baby 
Why come and go

Had a Lover
She felt as good as trees 
And you can ask her if its pleasing 
You can ask the wind to blow

And I would buy for you a diamond
Or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you darling 
Then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving?
Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still or will I feel the wheels a spinning round?

Well I ain't the brightest 
Bird that ever flew
I'm just someone you knew
A road you traveled on

All the colors
They shine and fade away
Well they're just like News Years Day
They're here and then they're gone

And I would buy for you a diamond
Or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you darling 
Then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving?
Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still or will I feel the wheels a spinning round?

Lord I love you
I wish you only knew
Well I wish you had a clue
I wish you had a clue you know
But I'm stuck here in Tulsa
With my Oklahoma blues
With a pair of concrete shoes 
That got me sinking pretty low

And I would buy for you a diamond
Or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you darling 
Then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving?
Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still or will I feel the wheels a spinning round?
The wheels a spinning round
The wheels
A spinning

I did the best I could do
Or the best I could tell
The higher I flew, the farther I fell 

Born in the mud,
Raised in the wild
Washed in the blood,
God's Problem Child

I feel the shine, following me
Not far behind, that's where I wanna be
A little out of town, fine by me

Darkness may fall
We still got a light
Keeping us all
Safe through the night

Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
God's problem child

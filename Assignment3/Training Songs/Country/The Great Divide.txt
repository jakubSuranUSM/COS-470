Here we are
Standing where the highways cross
Here we are
Sayin' goodbye

Just another love
Lost in the great divide

Here we are
Acting like two crazy kids
We've come too far
To ever see it end like this

Just another love
Lost in the great divide

Remember how we used to dance together?
Remember how I used to hold you tight?
You asked me if I'd leave and I said never
And that's still right

Summer sun
No prettier than summer rain
Summer gone
Summer coming back again

Other loves
Lost in the great divide

Remember how we used to dance together?
Remember how I used to hold you tight?
You asked me if I'd leave and I said never
And that's still right

Summer sun
No prettier than summer rain
Summer gone
Summer coming back again

Other loves
Lost in the great divide

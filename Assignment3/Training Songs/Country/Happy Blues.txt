I woke up this morning not a cloud in the sky
It made me so happy I fell like I could fly
Over mountains cause I'm in love with you
And you'll be back tomorrow
That's why I've got the happy happy blues

I'll have no more crying no more lonely days
All my cares and worries will be far away
Whenever the sun shines when this whole day is through
And you'll be back tomorrow
That's why I've got the happy happy blues ha ha
[ guitar - piano ]
I'll have no more crying no more lonely days...

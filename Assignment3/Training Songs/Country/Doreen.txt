Doreen, long and lean
Strangest girl I've ever seen
Calls me names and treats me mean
But I'm prumb clazy 'bout Doreen

Doreen's got a thing
About movie stars and limousines
Says I'm her very own James Dean
I'm prumb clazy 'bout Doreen

Doreen, Doreen

Doreen, seventeen
Tight sweaters and blue jeans
When she walks, she's obscene
I'm prumb clazy 'bout Doreen

Alright

Doreen, long and lean
Strangest girl I've ever seen
Calls me names and treats me mean
But I'm prumb clazy 'bout Doreen

I'm prumb clazy 'bout Doreen

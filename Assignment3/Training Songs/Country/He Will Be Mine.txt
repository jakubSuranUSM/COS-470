In the silence before the morning breaks 
I listen to every breath he takes 
I look at him and my heart aches 
I love him and he will be mine 

He opens up those baby blues 
When he looks at me I can't refuse 
He lets me know his heart beats true 
I love him and he will be mine 

[Chorus:]
He's all I ever want or need until the end of time 
I'll show him what he means to me 
I love him and he will be mine 

I'm grindin' up some coffee beans 
As he slips into his faded jeans 
He looks at me and my heart sings 
I love him and he will be mine 

My baby he's a workin' man 
With a gentle touch from callused hands 
He holds me like nobody can 
I love him and he will be mine 

[Chorus]

Turnin' my world upside down 
Spinnin' my head around and around 
Better not try and drive my car 
'Cause when he kisses me than I see stars 

In the silence before the morning breaks 
I listen to every breath he takes 
I look at him and my heart aches 
I love him and he will be mine 

[Chorus]

There are times when my heart is uneasy with fear
The answers are nowhere in sight
Then I hear a sweet voice whisper soft in my ear
Everything's gonna be alright

When I see the people with hunger in their eyes
And no guidance through the night
Once again that sweet voice whispers soft in my ear, sayin'
Everything's gonna be alright

I'll show you the way if you'll only believe
Everything's gonna be alright
I'll show you the way if you just believe me
Everything's gonna be alright

Now I can see it's all comin' home
The message rings clear and bright
Just as He promised, no one ever walks alone
And His love will show the light

See the light shine, oh how it shines
Everything's gonna be alright
See the light shine, oh how it shines
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

Maybe I am not that one and only guy whose touch will thrill you to the sky
And bring the love light to your eyes

Until the day the love you dream of comes your way
Because I love you so oh let me stay close to you
If your dear is waiting for that song you hear so far away and yet so clear
You feel your lover must be near

But till the day he seems that song the angels play
Because I love you so oh let me stay close to you close to you close to you
For maybe I am just a sentimental guy whose heart believes as time goes by
You'll come to me with misty eyes

Filled with love for I'm the one you really love
And hold me just the way I dream you do close to you close to you

To steal him's been your number one ambition
Bur sister here's one safe that you don't have to crack
I'll hand him over under one condition
A deal's a deal and you can't give him back

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

Go ahead and take him with my blessing
He might even let you be his Sunday girl
If your not used to worrying and guessing
He'll soon shake up your cozy little world

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
And I'll hive him to you

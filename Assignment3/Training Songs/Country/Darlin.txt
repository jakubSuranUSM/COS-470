Darling,
I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime.
Darling,
You're so far behind me,
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line.
Taking me some paper
Pencil in my hand,
I'm gonna write:
Darling,
All I feel are cold nights,
Thinking 'bout the old nights
Spent along with you.
Darling,
Tears are in my eyes now,
Knowing I should try now
To make it back to you.
(Instrumental)
Darling,
Love you more than ever;
Wish we were together,
Darling mine.
Darling,
I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime.
Darling,
You're so far behind me,
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line.
Taking me some paper
Pencil in my hand,
I'm gonna write:
Darling,
I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime.
Darling,
You're so far behind me,
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line.
Taking me some paper
Pencil in my hand,
I'll write darling,
Love you more than ever,
Wish we were together,
Darling mine.
Darling,
I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime.
Darling,
You're so far behind me,
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line.
Taking me some paper
Pencil in my hand,
I'm gonna write

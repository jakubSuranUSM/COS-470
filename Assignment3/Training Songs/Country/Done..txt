You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far to long 'cause I never gave up the fight, until now

It's gonna hit you hard til you see stars
It's gonna put through you a world of hurt
Oh I don't believe in getting even but giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be your just for fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done, done

You crossed the line too many times,
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite don't be surprised when I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
I don't wanna be part of your fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done

(Done) with your selfish ways
And all the games you play
I'm through with you and everything you say

Mama told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave that advice

Mama always told me that I should play nice
But she didn't know you when she gave that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Scatter the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da (la ti da)
I don't wanna be your just for fun,
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
All I wanna be is done

Hey ooh, I wanna be done (so done)
So done (so done) so done

Day by day, we let love just walk away,
And I'll be the first to say,
I was glad to see it go and day by day,
Ever since you went away,
I'm finding I'm still missing you,
And I just got to know.

Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you,
I want to hold you close to me,
And feel just like it used to be and
Baby, if you feel like I do,
You can come to me,
Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you?

On my mind, you were right there all the time,
I could search and never find someone,
That does me like you do,
Here's the part, where I'm giving you my heart,
I was a fool to let you go,
Girl I just got to know.

Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you,
I want to hold you close to me,
And feel just like it used to be and
Baby, if you feel like I do,
You can come to me,
Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you?

Night after night, I look to the stars,
Wondering where you might be,
And I've thought to myself,
Is that very same moon,
Shining on you like it's shining on me?

Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you,
I want to hold you close to me,
And feel just like it used to be and
Baby, if you feel like I do,
You can come to me,
Does that blue moon,
Ever shine on you?

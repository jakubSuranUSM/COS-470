Well, you can't deny how good he looks
Couldn't find another on the cover of a book
Believe me
Well, I've almost loved him once or twice

[Chorus]
But don't be fooled by his innocent smile
He's clever as the devil and just as wild
He's crazy
But a little crazy is kinda nice
He's a heartache
Lookin' for a place to happen
Lookin' for a little action
Livin' for the moment not for lovin'

He's a heartache
Lookin' for a place to happen
Temporary satisfaction
If you try to hold on he's gone

Well, I might as well tell someone else
I know I'll never have him to myself
Not likely
But I wouldn't mind just one more night

If he wants to hold you, let it be
Don't pass up the opportunity
To know him
You won't forget him all your life

But whatever you do be wise enough
Not to fall in love

[Chours]

But whatever you do be wise enough
Not to fall in love

[Chorus]

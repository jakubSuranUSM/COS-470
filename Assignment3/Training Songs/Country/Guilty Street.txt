Tonight I lost my way and I found Guilty Street
I saw faces there I never dreamed I'd see
I saw the one I love but he did not see me
While the guilty were laughing I was standing there crying alone on Guilty Street

The lust and sin fill the night on Guilty Street where I cry
Guilty Street is the place where's happiness out of my face
Tonight he'll hold me close and tell me I'm so sweet
But I know what his mind's on and tomorrow he'll be gone back to Guilty Street

The lust and sin fill the night...

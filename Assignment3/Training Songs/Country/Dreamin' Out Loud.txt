Pardon me mister, it was my mistake
I gotta be more careful in a crowd
If you caught me talkin' to myself
Don't mind me, I'm dreaming out loud

I can't stop wondering what did I do wrong
To lose the only one I cared about
If I do my living in the used-to-be
Don't mind me, I'm dreaming out loud

All I hear is her whisper my name
All I see is her hair tumble down
When I feel the touch of her hand in mine
I find I'm dreaming out loud

Well, I'd better be going, got some place to be
I know she's somewhere in this town
And until I find her and she comes back to me 
I'll be dreaming out loud

All I hear is her whisper my name
All I see is her hair tumble down
When I feel the touch of her hand in mine
I find I'm dreaming out loud

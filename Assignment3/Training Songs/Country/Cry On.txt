There's been a chain of tears
That's been a-holdin' me here
Cause you know how much I hate to see you cry

Well before I go
I just want to let you know
This is the last time that you'll hear me say goodbye

So baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on

Every time before
When I was headed for the door
You misty eyes would always make me stay

This hurtin' you
Is somethin' I never want to do
But you know you can't keep me here this way

So baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on

Yeah

Baby just cry cry on
Well I've done all I can to hold on
You're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on

You know you're only gonna find me gone
So baby cry on baby cry on

You can just cry on
Yeah yeah you can just cry on

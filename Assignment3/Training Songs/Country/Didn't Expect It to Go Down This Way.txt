I'm overworked and I'm overweight
I can't remember when I last had a date
Oh, I didn't expect it to go down this way

I used to love and I used to be loved
And now love's a scary thing to think of
Oh, I didn't expect it to go down this way

I been dating for years, honey, that ain't natural
I thought by now I'd find my man and settle down
Ain't a good one left in town
I'm lonely, how in the world did I end up lonely'

I knew life would be hard, but I didn't know how hard
I thought by now I'd be happy
Who's happy? Honey, not me
I'm lonely, how in the world did I end up lonely'

Oh, I didn't expect it to go down this way
No, I didn't expect it to go down this way
Oh I, I didn't expect it to go down this way

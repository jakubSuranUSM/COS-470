I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)

It was red headed Luie who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiac rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
I was as innocent as I could be I didn't know Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below
(When it's springtime in Alaska he'll be six feet below)

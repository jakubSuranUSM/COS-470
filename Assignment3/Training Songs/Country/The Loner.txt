When I see you walking with some other guy. 
I know that I'm a man I'm not supposed to cry. 
But when I see you I cry inside. 
I guess I'm a loner I don't run with your crowd. 

You only smile at me when there's no one around. 
We have to meet in secret 'cause we know the town, 
They'll talk of me,they'll talk of you.and they'll say 
"Oh what a shame,he's ruining her name." 

Some people say when you're alone like me. 
Life has no meaning, but I know. 
The reason you love me.is because I'll never be 
Never be,what you want me to be. 

So go on laugh and walk and talk with other guys. 
I'll never let them see the love that's in my eyes. 
We'll meet tonight you'll make it right, when you say 
We'll be together forever and ever.

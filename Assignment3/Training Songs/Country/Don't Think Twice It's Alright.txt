Ain't no use in calling my name, gal
Like you never did before
Ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
When your rooster, calls at the break of dawn
Look out your window, and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm travelling on
Don't think twice, it's alright

Walking down that long, lonesome road, gal
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye’s too good a word, gal
So I’ll just say fare thee well
Well I ain’t saying that treated me unkind
You could have done better, but I don’t mind
You just sort of wasted my precious time
Don’t think twice, it’s all right

Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I'll never know
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still, I wish there was something you would do, or say
To make me try and change my mind and stay
You never did too much talking anyways
So, don't think twice, it's alright

Ain't no use sitting in wondering why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
Ain't no use in sitting and wondering why, babe
If you, don't know by now
I'm a thinking man, wondering, all the way down the road
I onced loved a woman, a child I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya fight the feelings of love
'Cause love is something nobody ever gets enough of
So reach out your hand, take in all the sunshine from above
Well, now love is believing so don't fight the feelings 
Don't fight the feelings of love

A boy and a girl in a big spinning world 
Upside down in love from the start
Sunny days and laughing skies true love in both their eyes
Spending happy good times in the park
Learning all about living taking and the giving 
Love is growing stronger every day
Well, now there'll never be another 'cause they're trusting each other
Good love seems to just work out that way

I said now don't ya, don't ya, don't ya fight the feelings of love
'Cause love is something nobody ever gets enough of
So reach out your hand, take in all the sunshine from above
Well, now love is believing so don't fight the feelings 
Don't fight the feelings of love
Don't fight the feelings, don't fight the feelings 
Don't fight the feelings of love

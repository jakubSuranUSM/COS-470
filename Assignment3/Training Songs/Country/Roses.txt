(Roses roses au au ua)
Roses I send you roses with all the love their tender blossoming discloses
Just like my arms they'll open wide you'll see my heart inside
Please dear embrace the roses until I come to you and when the long day closes

Our spark of love will burst to flame and put the red red roses to shame

I know that it is freezing
But I think we have to walk
Keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning the lights on
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
And everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper
Have no phone conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
When I start polishing in the evening
By the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to live
Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
But what I tell you in the evening
By the morning won't make sense

You looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Only say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one kid
I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning it's such a drag

Got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I'll try to do the same
Well we might die from that medicine
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
What started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is
It was simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated

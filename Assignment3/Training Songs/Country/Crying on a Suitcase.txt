Boy, don’t wait, don’t think, don’t lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck and hit the gas
Burn some rubber up
Yeah, your time’s running out, do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road, take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket, hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate

She’s crying on a suitcase, sitting at the airport
Waiting on the airplane ‘bout to take her out of here
They’re gonna call her number, she’ll sit down by the window
The plane’ll leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
You’ve gotta run while you’ve still got time
She’s crying on a suitcase

Admit it boy, you blew it, really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really wanna lose her
It’s all on the line, do or die time, getting on your knees time
Tell her that you want her, need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can, come on, man, be a man

She’s crying on a suitcase, sitting at the airport
Waiting on the airplane ‘bout to take her out of here
They’re gonna call her number, she’ll sit down by the window
The plane’ll leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
You’ve gotta run while you’ve still got time
She’s crying on a suitcase

She’s crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane ‘bout to take her out of here
They’re gonna call her number, she’ll sit down by the window
The plane’ll leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
You’ve gotta run while you’ve still got time, you've still got time
She’s crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
She’ll fade into a goodbye sky

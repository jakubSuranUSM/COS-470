The sun is setting on my lonely heart
In this cheap motel
What I though would be brand new start
Is just a prison cell

Independence was calling my name
Screamin' in the wind
Sayin', Son you need a change
But now these walls are closin' in

Chorus:
'Cause freedom's just a prison 
For a fool like me
Chains around my heart
Ain't liberty 

You left me standin' tall
But now I'm beggin on my knees
You've still got me (oooo, still got me)
So baby, unlock me (ooo, unlock me)
From this freedom

My soul is burning for that sweet release
Where only moonlight can find us
Hey, I miss your kiss, I miss you holding me
And all the ties that used to bid us

[Chorus]

You left me standin' tall
But now I'm beggin on my knees
You've still got me (oooo, still got me)
So baby, unlock me (ooo, unlock me)
From this freedom

[Chorus]

Yeah! You've still got me (you've still got me)
So baby, unlock me (oooo, unlock me)
From this freedom (freedom)
I can't take this freedom (freedom)
No more freedom (freedom)

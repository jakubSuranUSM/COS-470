Come all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer morning they first appear and then they're gone
They'll tell to you some loving story and make you think they love you so well
Away they'll go and court some other and leave you there in grief to dwell

Oh love is handsome love is charming and love is pretty while it's new
But love grows cold as love goes old and fades away like morning dew
And fades away like morning dew

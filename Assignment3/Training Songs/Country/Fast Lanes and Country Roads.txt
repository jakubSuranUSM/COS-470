There's an eight lane highway out in L.A.
Headed nowhere
Every day is a rat race, they're fighting for first place
It's like a nightmare

It's a life of mass confusion, it's a heavy load
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road

There's a New York skyline but there's no sunshine
Down on Broadway
Watching the stocks rise keeps them paralyzed
Up on park place

It's a 5th Avenue elusion digging for the gold
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road

I'm gonna take a turn for the better
It's been a long hard ride
This can't go on forever
I need a Sunday drive

Let me get behind the wheel before I lose control
And trade this fast lane for a country road

There's a desert sunset I haven't seen yet
Just out of Tucson
Down in hot springs Arkansas, you can get an overhaul
I sure could use one

I'm gonna rise above the madness then I'll be laying low
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road

I'm gonna take a turn for the better
It's been a long hard ride
This can't go on forever
I need a Sunday drive

And let me get behind the wheel before I lose control
And trade this fast lane for a country road

Come on, get out of the fast lane, get on a country road
No more fast lanes, get me a country road
(Get out of the fast lane, get on a country road
Get out of the fast lane, get on a country road, get out of the fast lane)

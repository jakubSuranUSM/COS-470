When was the last time
You got up before the sun
And watched while the night and day
Melted into one?

When was the last time
You really looked at rain
Dripping down the gutter
Splashing on the window-pane?

My fondest memories
Are tied around these things
Sunday school, bedtime rules
Grandma's squeaky swing

Sneaking out behind the barn
My love would meet me there
Tripping in the hallway
Over Grandpa's rocking chair

Back in the country
Now I know you're gonna say
Back in the country
Don't you wish that you had stayed

Back in the country
Where the roses still grow wild
Back in the country
Where you walked those country miles

When was the last time
You saw sundown through a tree
Sitting on the front porch
In a cool evenin' breeze

When was the last time
That you heard a Bobwhite song
When was the last time
I'll bet it's been too long

Back in the country
Now I know you're gonna say
Back in the country
Don't you wish that you had stayed

Back in the country
Where the roses still grow wild
Back in the country
Where you walked those country miles

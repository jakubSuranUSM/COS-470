I wandered far away from the place
Where I was born and raised
I suffered through the Oklahoma dry lands
And through New York City's cold and rainy days

And now these dried up bones of mine are powerful thirsty
Just once again to feel them Mississippi rains

Lord, I got that Delta dirt, Lord
I got that black land Delta dirt down in my veins
In my veins, added in my veins
(In my veins, added in my veins)

I'm goin' home this mornin' if I have to walk, run or fly
I promised me as sure as I was standin'
That I'm never, ever gonna say goodbye
Cause this heart of mine keeps tellin' me I'm crazy
To keep on wearin' the city's ball and chain

When I got that Delta dirt Lord
Got that black land Delta dirt down in my veins

Lord, New York is mighty pretty
If you don't mind what you say
But I'd take a hundred acres of black land dirt
Over Detroit, New York and L.A.

I'm goin' home to Delta mama
Cause she's got everything
Gonna cure my aches and pains
And I got that Delta dirt, Lord
I got that black land Delta dirt down in my veins

I got it in my veins
(In my veins)
I got it in my veins
(Got it in my veins)
Lord, I got it in my veins

Early morning riser
I can still feel all your sunlight shine before the dawn
First light morning feeling's got me losing so much sleep
I just can't say how much I miss you when you're gone

‘Cause I get a feeling something like a summer wind
When you love me like a sister, then you're gone again
But there's so much light shining in your eyes
That you just can't help but keep a love alive

Now I hear some other loving sunshine brother's
Left you crying and you're all alone
So dry your eyes and try and say your goodbyes
‘Cause you're old enough to get back on your feel all on your own

Don't you kind of get a feeling like a summer wind
‘Cause he loved you like a brother, now he's gone again
But there's still a lot of love light in your eyes
And you sure know how to keep a man alive

Well you can stand right there and tell me something's wrong
It's so hard to know your problems when you're gone

So, early morning riser
There's not much more I can do to try and make things right
If you need another sunshine brother
I can be right there beside you by the early morning light

And I'll forget that feeling like a summer wind
And I'll probably start to think about you now and then
But there's still a lot of light shining in your eyes
And you still know how to keep a love alive

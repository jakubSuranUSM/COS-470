Blue star over my shoulder
Blue star, can't you see?
Blue star, it's a little colder
She's gone away from me

And I wish I never seen her with the sunlight in her eyes
And I wish I'd never learn the game she played
And I wish I'd never listen when she told me all the lies
And I wish I'd never seen her walk away

She was everything I wanted
She was sweet mystery
Blue star, every night I hold it
She's gone away from me

And I wish I'd never seen her with the sunlight in her eyes
And I wish I'd never learn the game she played
And I wish I'd never listen when she told me all the lies
And I wish I'd never seen her walk away

Dark eyes shining like two diamonds filled with fire
Dark hair blowing in the wind of hot desire
Red lips pulling me now

Dark eyes glowing like two diamonds filled with fire
Dark hair blowing in the wind of hot desire

Blue star over my shoulder
Blue star, can't you see?
Blue star, it's a little colder
She's gone away from me

And I wish I'd never seen her with the sunlight in her eyes
And I wish I'd never learn the game she played
And I wish I'd never listen when she told me all the lies
And I wish I'd never seen her walk away
And I wish I'd never seen her walk away

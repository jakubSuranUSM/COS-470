I only call when I've had that one too many
And my lonely room goes spinning in a whirl
And tonight I couldn't even find my pillow
I've got the emptiest arms in the world

I no longer wear the gold band on my finger
And from time to time I find myself a girl
But when I realize that she's not who I'm holding
I've got the emptiest arms in the world

My empty arms can't ever hold you close again
And these cheap hotel is like a prison cell that keeps closing in
And you alone can fill this empty feeling
Of the emptiest arms in the world

And you alone can can fill this lonely feeling
Of the emptiest arms in the world

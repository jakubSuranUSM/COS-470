I was a rover on land and on sea till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning it was so incomplete
Till a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Stead of roamin' I go home in the evening she's waiting there
And I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when the night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love

Stead of roamin' I go home in...
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love

Saw the ad in the paper
Said the hell with it all
Took a gig with the circus
As the human cannonball

It didn't take long
To learn my trade
Very first show
Man, I blew the folks away
Now, the job's a little risky
But I'm my own boss
I got to tell ya, Jack
It really gets me off

I live in a tent with
The world's strongest man
When I met the mother
Like to broke my hand
My baby, she's a lady
In the high-wire act
When I'm feeling tense
She walks on my back

Now, the pay's okay
The benefits are great
I get to shoot the bull
With the world's smartest ape

Ah ha
I'm the human cannonball
I'm the human cannonball, y'all

Well I'm a hot shot
I'm a cool breeze
Underneath the big top
I'm the big cheese
I lay it on the line
Let it all hang
When I go, least I know
I'll go with a bang

I reckon I'm living
Every kid's dream
It's a buzz, it's a gas
It's a real scream

Ah ha
I'm the human cannonball
I'm the human cannonball, y'all

Yeah

Alright, folks
Just make yourself at home
Have a snow cone and enjoy the show

They put me on the cover
Of the U.S.A. Today
Tell the world what the human cannonball got to say
On the Carson show
They sayin' "HC, what you do, you got to be
Right outta your tree!"

Well, it's a little risky
But I'm my own boss
I got to tell you, John
It really gets me off

Ah ha
I'm the human cannonball
I'm the human cannonball, y'all

I'm the human cannonball
I'm the human cannonball, y'all

Yeah

Hahahahaha!
Now, blast off!
I said blast off!

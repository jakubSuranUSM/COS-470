Well who's that girl with the sock feet and holy blue jeans
The one that dances like a hurricane
And shakes it like a washing machine
Guess I got to get my courage up and tell her I don't know how to dance
But if she can hoochie coochie I can hold her tight
We can stand in one spot or go honky tonk walkin all night

So let's go honky tonk walkin' honky tonk walkin' 
You could be my honky tonk girl so break up the double shuffle it's a honky tonk world
We'll go wading in the waters of the rhythm and rhymes in this world 
When I go Honky tonk walkin' with my arms around a honky tonk girl
Come on sugar baby

Well now the party's over and I got no license to drive
When she pulls up beside me and says I've got a marvelous ride
Yeah she's under my wheels I'm under the spell of her love
But if she can hoochie coochie I can hold her tight 
We can get out on the road and go honky tonk walkin all night

So let's go honky tonk walkin' honky tonk walkin' 
You could be my honky tonk girl so break up the double shuffle it's a honky tonk world
We'll go wading in the waters of the rhythm and rhymes in this world 
When I go Honky tonk walkin' with my arms around a honky tonk girl
Come on sugar baby

When I go honky tonk walkin' with my arms around a honky tonk girl
I'm goin' now

Been crying a little
Been caught in the middle
It's something you'd hate to admit to
But you are the only one
Who can show you've been sad and lonely

She shouldn't have said it
You shouldn't have done it
And after all is said and done
We are the only ones who can
Start where we want to start

Come lie with me sir
Come lie with me
Make good with love
It's better than envy

You say you regret it
Now learn to forget it
There's so much more to dwell on
And we are the only ones who can
Know where we want to go

Come lie with me sir
Come lie with me
Make good with love
It's better than envy

Oh I'm soft in the middle
Still hurting a little
All I wanted was for you
To lay in my arms arms
And show me what good Lovin' can do

So kiss me goodnight
I'm suddenly suddenly tired
Let the sun go down on me and you, we've got the time
And truth be told
I've been sad and lonely,
I've been sad and lonely too

On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind 
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left him behind 
Too long he'd been el bandito Carmela had left him alone 
But today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old San Antone 
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride hard and I make it by dawn 
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone 

He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight 
He'd sent for Carmela to meet him on the banks of the Brazos tonight 
She was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago 
As he dropped the guns that she hated in the muddy Brazos below 
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride hard and I make it by dawn 
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone 

Then the night came alive with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found 
As the rangers' badges shone brightly and bandito lay on the ground 
Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain 
As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again 
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride hard and I make it by dawn 
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone 
I'm safe when I reach San Antone

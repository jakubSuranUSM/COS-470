I'm gonna take me a ride on a riverboat
Down to New Orleans
Gotta pocket full o'money and a liquor bottle
Gonna drink away my dreams

Don't really wanna leave
Sure I can't stay
I'm gonna get on that riverboat
And gamble my life away

Makes me fly like an eagle
Higher and higher every day
Cause in my mind and in my dreams
I can't get her away

Gonna sit down at the poker table
Five card stud's my game
Gonna try and forget that crazy woman
Gonna try and forget her name

I don't know how I'll make it
But I'll forget her some way
This is the time and the only time
She ain't gonna get away

Chorus

I thought that I'd forget about you
And easily find someone new
But my heart can't live without you
So what am I supposed to do

When every now and then I get that old time feeling
Every now and then your memory comes stealing
Like a thief in the night it cuts like a knife
To know that you don't love me

I know that I'm the one to blame

I filled your life with so much pain
I hurt you and I'm so ashamed
How I wish it could be the same

But every now and then...

Love can be taken for granted it's so easy to do
You can learn from mistakes in your life my mistake was
hurting you

And every now and then...
You don't love me every now and then

Happiness means you dear our life's complete no rivers too wide no hills too steep
I'll face life smiling and no room for the blues
Cause we both know dear happiness means you
Everyone will know dear I found love at last
No time for old memories or tears from the past
Oh what a difference true love can made a heart that's lonely it's sure to break
Happiness means you dear

I never found happiness as a rolling stone
Your love changed my world when you came alone
Our love is the same dear it works both ways if my heart's got lighter it will fly away
Happiness means you dear,
Yes we both know dear happiness means you

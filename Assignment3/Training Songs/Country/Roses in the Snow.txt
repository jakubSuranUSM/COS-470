I met my darlin' in the springtime 
When all the flowers were in bloom 
And like the flowers our love blossomed 
We married in the month of June 

Our love was like a burning ember 
It warmed us as a golden glow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow 

Now God has taken my darlin' 
And left me with a memory 
A memory I will always cherish 
Are these last words he said to me 

Our love was like a burning ember 
It warmed us as a golden glow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow 

My darlin's buried on the hillside 
Where all the wild spring flowers grow 
And when winter snows start fallin' 
On his grave I'll place a rose 

Our love was like a burning ember 
It warmed us as cold winds blow 
We had sunshine in December 
And threw our roses in the snow

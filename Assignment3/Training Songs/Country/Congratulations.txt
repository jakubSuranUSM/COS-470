I can tell that you're already growing tired of me
You want no part of me even started lying to me
And if you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.

I pass you on the street and you don't speak to me
You just look at me and then you walk away from me
And if you started out to make a fool of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.

Well, you should be commanded for the sorrow you cause me
How does it feel to be the Queen of Misery
If you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine.

Well you should be commanded for the sorrow you cause me
How does it feel to be the Queen of Misery
If you started out to break this heart inside of me
Congratulations to you dear you're doing fine

You can dance every dance with the guys who give you the eye, let 'em hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', (Save) Save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music is fine like sparkling wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arms you're gonna be
No, no, no darlin', (Save) save the last dance for me

Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never ever let you go
I love you oh so much
(Now listen)
You can dance, go and carry on 'till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone, can he take you home, you must tell him, "No"
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home and in whose arm's you're gonna be
No, no, no darlin', (Save) save the last dance for me
Hmm, save the last dance for me
Hmm darlin', save the last dance for me
Hear me what I am saying, save the last dance for me
Baby please, save the last...

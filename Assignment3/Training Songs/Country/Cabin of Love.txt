I'm only a dreamer of romance
My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile through these tears dear at you

I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue

Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me

Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you

You say you want to take me out so we can paint the town
Well, I don't care a thing about you're kind of running 'round
The town will go unpainted if you depend on me
I don't intend to wreck my life with a man who isn't free

You've got a good wife at home you know she's never been untrue
She's got the whole world of fate and fast and competence in you
How you can be unfaithful I just can't understand
Now why don't you go home to your wife and act like a married man

Well I suppose you wonder why I say the things I say
Well it's because I'm making plans to have a home someday
I want to be a good wife and never be untrue
And I don't want my man to be a cheater such as you
You've got a good wife

Bring me sunshine in your smile
Bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow

Make me happy through the years
Never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun bring me sunshine, bring me love

Bring me sunshine in your smile
Bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow

Make me happy through the years
Never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun bring me sunshine, bring me love

Bring me sunshine in your smile
Bring me laughter all the while
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun bring me sunshine, bring me love

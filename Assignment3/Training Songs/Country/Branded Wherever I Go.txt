I received the letter you wrote, dear
In which you said you'd wait for me
I'm asking you to please not wait, dear
It will only ruin your life I see

Please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know
I'll always be an ex convict
And branded wherever I go

In three years my sentence is over
Them gates will swing wide for me
The warden will say I'm a free man
But my name will never be free

Please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know
I'll always be an ex convict
And branded wherever I go

May God bless you for your kindness
You've stuck with me through thick and thin
I love you too much to disgrace you
In closing God bless you again

Please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know
I'll always be an ex convict
And branded wherever I go

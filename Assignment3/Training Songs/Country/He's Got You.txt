I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed With Love just like it used to be
Oh the only thing different the only thing new
I've got this picture he's with you

I've got the records we used to share
And they still sound the same like when we were here
Oh the only thing different yeah the only thing new
I've got these records he's got you

Yeah I got these memories yeah and they've got me
Oh what I don't know I don't know they won't let me be

I got these memories yeah and they've got me
Oh what I don't know I don't know they won't let me be

I've got your class ring that proved you'd care
And it still looks the same like when you gave it dear
Oh the only thing different yeah the only thing new
I've got these little things he's got you
Yes I've got this picture he's with you he's got you

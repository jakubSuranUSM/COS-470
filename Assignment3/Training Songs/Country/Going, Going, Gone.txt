At first I thought it was the moonlight
Shining through the mist
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought
But I must have been wrong

It could have the music
Cause it sounded so sweet 
Something sure was sweeping me
Off my feet

All night long, it sure was strong
Before  I knew what was going on
I was going, going, gone

I suppose it could have been the perfume
From a honeysuckle vine
Something sure was driving me 
Out of my mind

But I should have known all alone 
It was your love and it was strong
And now I'm goin', going, gone

It might have been the magic 
Written in the stars
Some gypsy might have read it
Somewhere in the cards

It really doesn't matter
Cause whatever it was
It led me straight to your arms

First I thought it was the moonlight
Shining through the mist
After all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought
(So I thought)

But I must have been wrong
Before I knew what was going on
I was going, going, gone

Going, going, gone
Going, going, gone

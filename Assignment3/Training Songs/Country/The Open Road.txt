Shrunken head and Mardi Gras beads
Hanging on a rearview mirror that bleeds
Keepinâ?? her eyes on the open road
No tellinâ?? where that son-a bitch goes
 
Got her doors locked doinâ?? 75
Donâ??t care to be caught now, dead or alive
Seen enough to kill anyoneâ??s soul
Keepinâ?? her eyes on the open road
Keepinâ?? her eyes on the open road
 
The open road where the hopeless come
To see if hope still runs
One by one they bring their broke down loads
And leave â??em where the hobo dreams are stowed
Out on the open road
Out on the open road
 
Midnight fallinâ?? like a bag of bones
Weighted down now the rest with stones
Bouncinâ?? off a river the moon made steel
Cracking off the chrome of a steering wheel
 
Anything back there is burned and dead
Any love they made any words they said
Nothing to do now but drop it and roll
Into the lights of the open road
Into the lights of the open road
 
The open road where the hopeless come
To see if hope still runs
One by one they bring their broke down loads
And leave â??em where the hobo dreams are stowed
Out on the open road
Out on the open road
 
Shrunken head and Mardi Gras beads
Hanging on a rearview mirror on the beach
Keepinâ?? their eyes on the open road
No tellinâ?? where that son-a bitch goes
 
The open road where the hopeless come
To see if hope still runs
One by one they bring their broke down loads
And leave â??em where the hobo dreams are stowed
Out on the open road
Out on the open road

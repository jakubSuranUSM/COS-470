Morning comes and Lord my mind is aching sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor
Once again the whole town will be talking Lord I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand it's his sorrow not another woman
And no matter what they say I know he tried
Baby's packed everything and he's left me he's left me
And I know he didn't mean to make me cry
It's not his heart Lord it's his mind he didn't mean to be unkind
Why he even woke me up to say goodbye
It's not his heart Lord it's his mind he didn't mean to be unkind
Why he even woke me up to say goodbye goodbye baby

(Walt Aldridge/Brad Crisler/Drew Womack)

Everyone says it's no big deal
Nothin' a little more time won't heal
Sooner or later the way I fell will change
But they never hurt the way I do
'Cause they never had to get over you
So they never shared my point of view of the pain

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first

There's only so much a man can take
Before his reality starts to break
Especially holdin' an old heartache like you
Somebody's leavin' I don't care who
But there's not enough room in my mind for two
It's finally come down to me or you

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'd do anything, go anywhere
Show me some way out and girl I'm there
It's gotten to the point where I don't care
Blessing or curse
I'll take whatever comes first

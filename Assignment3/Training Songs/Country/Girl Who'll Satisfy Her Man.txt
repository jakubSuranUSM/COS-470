I know your heart is aching mine is too
I know exactly what you're going through
So helplessly I've had to just stand by
And watched her hurt you so much I could die
So maybe now I'll have the chance to try
To kiss away your tears and help them dry
Please accept my love and take the hand
Of a girl who'll always satisfy her man
Inside my arms it's nice and warm always for you

And I know I'll make you understand
There'll be no doubt you'll never be without a love so true
From a girl who'll always satisfy her man
So come to me I'll hold you tenderly you'll be in the hands
Of a girl who'll always satisfy her man

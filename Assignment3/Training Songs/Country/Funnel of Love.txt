Here I go, going down, down, down
My mind is a blank, my head is spinning around and around
As I go deeper in the funnel of love

It's such a crazy, crazy feeling
Get weak in the knees
My poor old head is a-reelin' around
As I go deep into the funnel of love

I tried and I tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
Ya just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's bound to get you someday (it's bound to get you someday)

It's such a crazy, crazy feeling
Get weak in the knees
My poor old head is a-reelin'
As I go deep into the funnel of love (deep into the funnel of love)

I tried and I tried to run and hide
I even tried to run away
Ya just can't hide from the funnel of love
It's bound to get you someday (it's bound to get you someday)

Here I go, going down, down, down
My mind is a blank, my head is spinning around and around
As I go deep into the funnel of love

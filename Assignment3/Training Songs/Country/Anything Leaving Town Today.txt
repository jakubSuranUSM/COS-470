The place I would like to see I know
But not the place where you told me to go
So anything that moves will be okay
I'll take anything leaving town today

You may think that I'm joking when I'm talking
But to get away from you I may try walking
I want something that's moving right away
I'll take anything leaving town today

I got a sudden urge to get away
I'd like to cut my time away from town
But I know there ain't no airport in this bitty town
Don't think I'm leaving just for what I think of you

But I'd even crawl not knowing where I'm crawling to
Don't think it has it hasn't leave it lay
I'll take anything leaving town today

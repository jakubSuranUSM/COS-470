If an angel wears a housewife's dress
And fills a home with happiness
One wakes me gently every morning
And serves my coffee with a kiss

My life is heaven everyday
Because of all the love you give
Your smile drives all my cares away
And makes life heaven everyday

If heaven is all they say
I know for certain I've found mine
Your tender touch and understanding
Makes my life heaven all the time

My life is heaven everyday
Because of all the love you give
Your smile drives all my cares away
And makes life heaven everyday

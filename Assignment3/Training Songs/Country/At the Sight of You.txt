I go all to pieces at the sight of of you
I tried to look the other way when you're around
But that takes more strength than can be found
I just get weak as memories pass through I go all to pieces at the sight of of you
How could anyone control me so completely and make me do the crazy things I do
Little things like forgiving you for being so untrue
I go all to pieces at the sight of of you

You've hurt me so many times that I've lost track
Yet given half a chance I take you back
You're the master of my life and there's nothing I can do
I go all to pieces at the sight of of you I go all to pieces at the sight of of you

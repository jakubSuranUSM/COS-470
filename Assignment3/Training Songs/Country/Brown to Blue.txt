(Changed his name from Brown to Blue)

We stood there in the courthouse room
So close yet far apart,
You had brought your lawyer
And I'd brought a broken heart,
The judge pronounced the words
The way you wanted him to do,
And changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

I couldn't keep my tears from falling,
On the courtroom floor,
By law, they took away my rights,
To love you anymore,
My world just seemed to stop,
While I stood there so close to you,
They changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

The judge forgot to tell me
How I'd live my life alone,
What I would do without you
After loving you so long,
He didn't seem to care that
I am still in love with you,
He changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

I couldn't keep my tears from falling,
On the courtroom floor,
By law, they took away my rights,
To love you anymore,
My world just seemed to stop,
While I stood there so close to you,
They changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue...

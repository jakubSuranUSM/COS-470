I come to you with empty hands 
I guess I just forgot again 
I only got my love to send 
On Valentine's Day 

I ain't got a card to sign 
Roses have been hard to find 
I only hope that you'll be mine 
On Valentine's Day 
I know that I swore that I wouldn't forget 
I wrote it all down, I lost it I guess 
There's so much I want to say 
But all the words just slip away 

The way you love me every day 
Is Valentine's Day 

If I could I would deliver to you 
Diamonds and gold; it's the least I can do 
So if you'll take my IOU 
I could make it up to you 
Until then I hope my heart will do 
For Valentine's Day

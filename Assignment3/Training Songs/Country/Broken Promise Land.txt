There's a Bible on the dresser and a sign hung on the door
And a woman in my arms who shouldn't be
I'm to the point of no returning but I've been here before
This cheating life is nothing new to me
There's someone to be considered so I call her on the phone
And say the job is taking longer than I planned I don't have the heart to tell her
That a stranger's turned me on and I'm headed for
The boken promise land

[Chorus:]
Tonight, I'm crossing over and I'll reach the cheating side
And I'll hate myself for coming here again
Where the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on lies
A place they call the broken promise land

I found a note left on the dresser and a key left in the door
And on the floor I found her goldeb wedding band
Guess she finally had to tell me She's not waiting anymore
She's headed for the broken promise land

[Chorus II:]
Tonight she's crossing over and she'll reach the cheating side
And I'll hate myself for giving her the chance
Cause the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on lies
a place they call the broken promise land

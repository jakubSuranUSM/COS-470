(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The music stopped in my hand
My hand
My hand
Sadly smiled the band
The band
The band
Softly echoes your laughter
Riddled with tears
When time is stolen it flies
It flies
It flies
Lovers leave in disguise
Disguise
Disguise
Weariness hangs like a curtain
Heavy and old
Heavy and cold.

It is said to never look back
Look back
Look back
To shadows you left on the track
The track
The track
Gather your roses and run
The long way around
And if time should ever be right
My love
My love
I'll come to you in the night
My love
My love
But now there is only the sorrow
Parting is near
Parting is here
Parting is here
Parting is here

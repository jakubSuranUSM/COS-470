Girl you sure look pretty there 
Standin' in the doorway in the sunset light
Baby I read you wrong 
Thinkin' I could be your Mr. Right
While I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line 
You'd say you needed some time
Just a little more time to make up your mind
But it's been long enough, time is up so

Bye-bye love I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator
And the rear view mirror torn off so I ain't ever lookin' back
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lovers fashion
But I've got pride and I'm takin' it for a ride
So bye-bye, bye-bye, bye baby
Bye-bye

Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here
Like they've done before
You'll see what's left of us 
In a cloud of dust on highway four
Darlin' what did you expect me to do
Just sit around and wait on you
I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
I know it sounds trite, I've seen the light

Bye-bye love I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator
And the rear view mirror torn off so I ain't ever lookin' back
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lovers fashion
But I've got pride and I'm takin' it for a ride
So bye-bye, bye-bye, bye baby
Bye-bye

I lost the game I guess, but I did my best to win the part
But i'm leaving here with what's left of my heart

Bye-bye love I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator
And the rear view mirror torn off so I ain't ever lookin' back
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lovers fashion
But I've got pride and I'm takin' it for a ride
So bye-bye, bye-bye, bye baby
Bye-bye

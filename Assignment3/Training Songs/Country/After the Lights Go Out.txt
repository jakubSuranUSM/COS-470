Tonight I'm out with the crowd
I'm out where the music's playing loud
And I'm hiding all the memories we knew
But it won't be long 'till I'll be missing you.

'Cause after the lights go out your pillow starts talking
All I can hear in my ears are the words I love you
I'll jump to my feet and slowly start walking
Memories in the dark tear at my heart
After the lights go out.

The day break finally comes, I'm feeling better
For the sun helps to dry the tears away
And pretty soon now I'll get all my thoughts together
In the busy and the worries of the day.

'Cause after the lights go out your pillow starts talking
All I can hear in my ears are the words I love you
I'll jump to my feet and slowly start walking
Memories in the dark tear at my heart
After the lights go out

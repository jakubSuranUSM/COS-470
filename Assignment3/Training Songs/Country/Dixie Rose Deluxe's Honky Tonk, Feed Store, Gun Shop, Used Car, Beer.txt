There ain't a four lane road within twenty some miles of here
This town ain't got a Wal-mart and never ever will
There's a church and filling station where ya get your gas
Then there's Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop,
Used Car, Beer Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat

Well, I stop by Dixie's half a dozen times a day
I ain't there for super duper deals or the famous fried steak
Dixie's daughter is hotter than a hound on a fresh coon track
Down at Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop,
Used Car, Beer Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat

Yeah, I got four of everything in there, bunch of stuff I can't use
Hundred cans of Skoal on my dashboard and I don't even chew
Yeah, I'm there when they open, and I'm there when they close
Standing at the check out line just checking out Becky Jo
Down at Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop,
Used Car, Beer Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat

She wears a nothin' to hide sun dress that'll make you melt
Makes a country boy think she got eyes for nobody else
Yeah, truth is she got us lined up clear out the back
At old Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop,
Used Car, Beer Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat

Boss shouts out, where ya goin', I tell him I'll be right back
I just remembered I needed a dozen eggs and an '87 Cadillac
Some question my persistence and some my sanity
But ya'll I ain't quitting till that gal is crazy over me

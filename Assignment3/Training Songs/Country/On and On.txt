Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Memories of how we once loved each other
And now we are saying good-bye.

On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.

I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.

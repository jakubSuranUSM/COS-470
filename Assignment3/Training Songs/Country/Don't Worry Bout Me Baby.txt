There's no way to know, how this is all gonna end 
Don't be afraid that you might make me cry 
We fell in love once, we could fall again 

Don't worry 'bout me baby, 
For telling me lies 
It makes no difference how it all works out 
How can I make you understand 
This night with you is all I'm thinking about. 
If I can't have it all, I'll take what I can 

[Chorus:] 
Don't worry 'bout me baby, I'll be alright 
Don't worry 'bout me baby, just love me tonight.

This can't be wrong, I know that it's right 
So as long as it's good, keep holding me tight-ight 

[Repeat Chorus]

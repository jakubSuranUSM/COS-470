Don’t ever think you’re the first one who did it 
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it 
And you wouldn’t believe you’re add the new 
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it
They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go
Don’t ever think so
From the outside they’re handsome devils
From the inside they’re true burn rebels

Woh, woh
Got a cross vanguard let’s go Dos Bros
Woh, woh
Let the freak flag flag Dos Bros vamonos
Hey give up do commo do loquo 
Viva Dos Bros I need your vachaleo
Hey give up do wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos

Don’t ever make Dos Bros your enemy
They’re unbeatable, they’re uncheatable
And if help breaks loose you will understand
It’s here to have friends in a rock band
They rule, you drewl, they rock until you’re drown
No one can stop them, blow blow
Don’t ever think so
From the outside they’re pure gold getters
From the inside they’re real jet setters

You better never ever mess with Dos Bros
Because you’re messing with the loss Dos Bros

Don’t ever think you’re the first one who did it
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it
And you wouldn’t believe you’re add the new
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it
They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go!
Don’t ever think so

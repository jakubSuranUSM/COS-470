Way down on Mississippi big river came a mighty big man
He built a town on that river and owned everything in that glen
He fell in love and married a girl she was young and mean and wild
He tried to tame her but it couldn't been done it was too late to devil's own child
Big river (keep on growin' growin') big man (keep on growin' growin')
Big river (keep on growin' growin') big man (keep on growin' growin')
The love you have for greed and power surely pull you down
You lose your friends you lose your soul in that darn city to big man's town
Big river (keep on growin' growin') big man (keep on growin' growin')
Big river (keep on growin' growin') big man (keep on growin' growin')
Look down in the water all around you hear the steamboat whistle blow
Come on big man get a movin' you got a long way to go
Just like a big river big man you gotta move on and on
Take your money keep your dough you're gonna be left all alone
Big river (keep on growin' growin')...

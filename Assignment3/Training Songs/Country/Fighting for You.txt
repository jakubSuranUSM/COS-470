I don't know, if I can recover
How can we be friends, if we can't be lovers
It's killing me, thinking of you with him

Call it pride, call it stubborn
But I won't give up till I know
There's no other way to start all over again

'Cause there's just so much, one man can take
Even the strongest heart can break
When the tears start to roll
It's like trying to hold back the sea

But I won't give up, you know how I am
I'll fight till I fall and make one more stand
How can I lose fighting for you

'Cause there's just so much one man can take
Even the strongest heart can break
When the tears start to roll
It's like trying to hold back the sea

But I won't give up, you know, how I am
I'll fight till I fall and make one more stand
How can I lose fighting for you
Tell me, how can I lose fighting for you

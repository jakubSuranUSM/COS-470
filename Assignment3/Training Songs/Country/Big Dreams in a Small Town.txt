Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town 

Rollin' down a dusty road
In my daddy's Ford
I wish that I
Could feel that way again 

I remember those summer nights
On the brink of love
You and I made
More than plans back then 

Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town 

Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town 

We were gonna try to set the world on fire
We were gonna make it all come true
We used to say that we couldn't wait to leave this town
That was something we were born to do  

Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town 

Oh, ain't it funny how it always seems
That time has a way of changin' all your dreams 

Big dreams in a small town
Guess it's time to settle down
Don't ya like the way it sounds
You and me in a small town 

Big dreams in a small town
Big dreams in a small town

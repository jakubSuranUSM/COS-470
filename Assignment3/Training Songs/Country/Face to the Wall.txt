Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall
I suspected there was something that you weren't telling me
And last night I learned the reason for it all
I was looking through your window saw you kissing someone else
You reached up and turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall so you wouldn't have to see anything at all to make you think of me
Did the cheapness of the moment make you feel ashamed and small
Was I farther from your conscience standing face to the wall

Alone out in the darkness were the eyes that worshiped you
As you cheated me I watched my idle fall
With your arms around another and his lips where mine should be
Then I saw you turned my picture slowly face to the wall
Face to the wall...

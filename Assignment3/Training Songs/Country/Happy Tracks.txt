I know that you've heard people say many, many times
You don't pass through this world
But once you'll get yours and I'll get mine
But I've got a philosophy I believe I'd rather go by
And if you'll just listen you may want to give it a try

Leave a lotta happy tracks as you go down life's road
Leave a lotta happy tracks everywhere you go
Leave a lotta happy tracks and keep this in mind
Others will have to follow in the path you leave behind

As you walk the tangle streets of life notice your fellow man
And when he gets in trouble, lend him a helping hand
Sow good seeds in your fields of life as you go along
Let others reap your happiness a long time after you're gone

Leave a lotta happy tracks as you go down life's road
Leave a lotta happy tracks everywhere you go
Leave a lotta happy tracks and keep this in mind
Others will have to follow in the path you leave behind

Don't ever use a good friend for a personal game
To gain wealth and lose one friend would only be in vain
Let your happy tracks be many, leave them everywhere you go
Others will have to harvest each and every seed you sow

Leave a lotta happy tracks as you go down life's road
Leave a lotta happy tracks everywhere you go
Leave a lotta happy tracks and keep this in mind
Others will have to follow in the path you leave behind

Woke up this mornin'
With nothin' on my mind
Nothin's all I'm a lookin' for
Nothin's all I'll find
And I've been happy here for now on forty years
Here I have noone to hate, I have noone to fear
Its just a way of life so easy to find
But it won't be on maps they make
And you can't buy it on time

If you find that city life is not the life for you
If you're wantin' somethin' old and tired of somethin' new
Come out to the country when the trees are all in bloom
Cleanse your mind, cleanse your soul and give your head some room

And you're welcome to Goose Creek won't you come?
The boys would like to invite everyone
We'll take ya there its not so far away
If you'll just sit back and listen to us play(Play!)

Do ba do da loo, do do do(x8)

Welcome to Goose Creek won't you come?
The boys would like to invite everyone
We'll take ya there with us we're on our way
Pack your bags incase you wanna stay

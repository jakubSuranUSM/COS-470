There you go drivin' in your big long car you got a house overlooking the town
But be nice to everybody on your way up you're gonna need 'em again coming down

You don't even speak when we pass on the street you don't even know your old friends
But don't get too proud you're gonna need the old crowd
Cause we all remember you when
There you go drivin' in your big long car

Not long ago you crossed over the tracks and now you don't know me at all
Takes a long time you know for a big tree to grow but just a few seconds to fall
There you go drivin' in your big long car
There you go drivin' in your big long car
You're gonna need 'em again comin' down
You're gonna need 'em again comin' down

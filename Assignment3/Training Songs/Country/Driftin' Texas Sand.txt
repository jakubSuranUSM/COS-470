Well, I went to the river to water my horse
I couldn't find the river, just rode across
On that drifting shifting Texas sand

Texas sand, drifting Texas sand
Sandy land down by the Rio Grande

Well, sand in my coffee sand in my tea
When I die they're gonna bury me
But deep in that drifting shifting Texas sand

Texas sand, drifting Texas sand
Sandy land down by the Rio Grande

Well, I went to the river to water my horse
I couldn't find the river, just rode across
On that drifting shifting Texas sand

Well, sand in my coffee, sand in my tea
When I die they're gonna bury me
But deep in that drifting shifting Texas sand

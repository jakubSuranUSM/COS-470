If there was any way out, where I could slip away and take my heart with me
If there was any way out, where I could slip away and make my mind at ease
'Cause if my head was on right, I wouldn't be sitting tonight watchin' me 
shakin' it
But if my heart was intact, you know I'd let you have the first crack at 
breakin' it

If you were anything less than what you are to me, I would have a reason then
Callin' it quits instead of havin' these fits over where you've been
If the love that you stole wasn't still the best I've known, I wouldn't be 
takin' it
And if my heart was intact, you know I'd let you have the first crack at 
breakin' it

If my body didn't burn every time my head didn't turn, I wouldn't be fakin' it, 
Oh, no
And if my heart was intact, you know I'd let you have the first crack at 
breakin' it
Oh, if my head was on right, I wouldn't be sitting all night watchin' me 
shakin' it, Oh, no
And if my heart was intact, you know I'd let you have the first crack at 
breakin' it

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know
If I can be your girl
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know
If I can be your girl?

When I saw you walking down the street
I said, "That's the kind of guy I'd like to meet"
He's so pretty, Lord, he's so fine
I'm gonna make him mine, all mine

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know
If I can be your girl?

When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if I can be your girl?

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know
If I can be your girl?

When you turned and walked away
That's when I wanna say
Come on baby, give me a whirl
I wanna know if I can be your girl?

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know
If I can be your girl?

Hey, hey baby

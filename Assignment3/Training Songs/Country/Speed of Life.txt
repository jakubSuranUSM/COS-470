We drove all night to get to Corpus Christi 
My parents slept right through 
They never missed me 
We were far from sleepin' 
When the truth began to creep in 
That we weren't goin' home anytime soon 

The mornin' light sure took us by surprise 
We grabbed our clothes 
Watched a beautiful sunrise 
We were one together 
And we must have talked forever 
And it was then and there I realized that 

[Chorus]
(And) I don't want to wait even one more night 
It's hard to slow it down when it feels so right 
Knees buckled, white knuckled 
We're holdin' on tight (holdin' on tight) 
(We're) travelin' at twice the speed of life 
(Yea, yea, yeah yeah) 

We worked our way through college waitin' tables 
Bought a little white house with a picket fence and cable 
I asked if he was ready 
To become a Mom and Daddy 
And then I found my answer in his eyes 
And he said... 

[Chorus]

Now, our oldest girl is almost grown 
She's got a boyfriend of her own 
I heard her sneakin' out with him last night 
And if she's anything like me 
She's desperate to be wild and free 
We know now it's just a matter of time 
'Til she says 

[Chorus]

I've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.

I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.

Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.

I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight

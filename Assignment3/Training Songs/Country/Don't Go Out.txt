Baby, your heart is in serious danger,
Don't go out with her.
She'll lead you on, treat you like a stranger,
Don't go out with her.
You need someone like me,
Who'll love you endlessly.

Baby, your headed for a brand new heartache, 
Don't go out with him.
The fire of midnight burns out at daybreak,
Don't go out with him.
Darling wake up and see,
I'm waiting patiently.

My love is everything you'll ever need,
I'll start by holding your heart close to me.
I know just what she'll do,
Her kind is never true,
He can't take care of you like me.

I know a place where love is for certain.
Don't go out with her.
Bring me your heart, there won't be no hurtin',
Don't go out with him.
When it's all said and done,
I'll be your only one.

Baby, your heart is in serious danger,
Don't go out with him.
She'll lead you on, treat you like a stranger,
Don't go out with her.

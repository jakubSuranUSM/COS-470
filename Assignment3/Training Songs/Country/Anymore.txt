I can't hide the way I feel about you anymore.
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore.

My tears no longer waiting.
My resistance ain't that strong.
My mind keeps recreating a love with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

Let me make one last appeal
To show you how I feel about you.  Mm hm.
'Cause there's no one else I swear holds a candle anywhere
Next to you.  Mm hm

My heart can't take the beating
Not having you to hold.
A small voice keeps repeating
Deep inside my soul.
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore.

I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life.

My tears no longer waiting.
Oh my resistance ain't that strong.
Oh my mind keeps recreating
A love with you alone.
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

I got a star on my car and one on my chest,
A gun on my hip and the right to arrest
I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway
So watch out what you're doin' when you're drivin' my way
If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know
I'm a-workin' for the state I'm The Highway Patrol.

Well, you'll know me when you see me,
'cause my door's painted white
My siren a-screamin' and my flashin' red lights
I work all day and I work all night
Yes a-keepin' law and order, tryin' to do what's right
If I write you out a ticket, then you'd better drive slow
I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm The Highway Patrol.

I'm the Highway Patrol, the Highway Patrol,
my hours are long, and my pay is low.
But I'll do my best to keep you driving slow,
I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm The Highway Patrol.

If your driving to fast, like you shouldn't do,
you can bet your boots, I'm coming after you.
If you wanna race, then get on a race track,
cause if you try and run away, I'm gonna bring ya back,
I'm here to keep all the speeders driving slow,
I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm The Highway Patrol

I'm the Highway Patrol, the Highway Patrol,
my hours are long, and my pay is low.
But I'll do my best to keep you driving slow,
I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm The Highway Patrol.

I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm The Highway Patrol

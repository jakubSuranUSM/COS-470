You got a gal you love on Sunday
Then you get another for Monday

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You say you're always home alone
How come I can't get you on the phone

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

All night long your playin' poker
Tell me what's the name of that joker

Ain't nobody's business but my own

I come over, say "Here I am!"
Then I hear the back door slam

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

You tell me you're in bed by seven
But your light's on past eleven

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Now you ain't so smart and you ain't good lookin'
How come you got so much cookin'

Ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

And you wear the prettiest ties and collars
Whereabouts do you get those dollars

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You always talk about settlin' down
When I bring a ring, you're not around

Well, I'll be there the next time that you call

Well let's not fuss and let's not fight

I'm sick and tired of sayin' "Goodnight"

Well, let's make up and hold each other tight

We both know we're birds of a feather
Let's go into business together
We can start a business of our own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but our own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but our own

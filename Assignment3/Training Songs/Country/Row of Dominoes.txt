Carmen must have been the devil's daughter
At least he taught her how to wear her clothes
And the boys followed her to the slaughter
Where they fell like a row of dominoes
They fell like a row of dominoes

Don't let your past drive you under
You know how a memory comes and goes
Well, the years rolled away just like thunder
Where they fell like a row of dominoes
They fell like a row of dominoes

Won't you tell me how you been?
Something more than you've been feelin' fine
I'm havin' that feelin' again
There's a whole lot more to lay on the line
A whole lot more to lay on the line

Share and share alike, you know I love you
But I also love the way the wild wind blows
So don't set your dreams up there above you
Where they'll fall like a row of dominoes
They'll fall like a row of dominoes

They say a fool never knows what he misses
And a wise man never misses what he knows
What can I say, your ten thousand kisses
Fell on me like a row of dominoes
They fell like a row of dominoes

Won't you tell me how you been?
Something more than you've been feelin' fine
I'm havin' that feelin' again
And the dominoes are standin' in a line
Yes, the dominoes are standin' in a line

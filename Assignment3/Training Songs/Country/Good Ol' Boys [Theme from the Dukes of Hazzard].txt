Just the good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you ever saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born

Straigh'nin' the curve
Flat'nin' the hills
Someday the mountains might get 'em
But the law never will

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

I'm a good ol' boy
You know my momma loves me
But she don't understand
They keep a showin' my hands
And not my face on TV

Just the good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you ever saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born

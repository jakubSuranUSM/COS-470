This town's gotta shake down to its roots
I don't know if that's the sands or the tropical fruits 
I don't believe all the things I see 
But I'm still betting on you and me 

Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A. 
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A.

And on a scale of one to ten she was twenty-three

Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of LA

A big fat man's gonna make me a king 
He got a see-through tan and a pinky diamond ring (yeah)
Slicked-back hair, shirt to his thigh

Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A. 
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A.
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta go get out of L.A.

Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L,A.
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A.
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta go get out of L.A.
Hey, hey baby, we've gotta go ...

Well, babe, you could be a standing in my kitchen
Or floating on your back in a deep blue sea
A wiser is the man who seeks new visions
And tries to keep his heart and mind toll-free

Look away, oh, Lord, look away, yeah
Look away, oh, Lord, look away

A running along, peeking down hole and alley
Just tryin' to find the Gospel, don't you know
I heard the sound of a cryin' down in the valley,
But what is there is only sticks and stones

Look away, oh, Lord, look away, yeah
Look away, oh, Lord, look away

A checking it out in town I'm feeling lonely,
You know that some of them women sure look good
A checking it up and down, now you should have told me
There ain't no pretty things in my neighborhood

Look away, oh, Lord, look away, yeah
Look away, oh, Lord, look away

Look away,
Look away,
Look away

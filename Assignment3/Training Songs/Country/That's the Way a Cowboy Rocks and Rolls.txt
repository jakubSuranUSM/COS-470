You can find him in a dance hall Saturday night listening to the
Music and drinking beer, he'll dance and hold the lady's hand and
Whisper pretty things in their ears, but they know he's easy come and easy
Go 'cause that's the way a cowboy rocks and rolls, cowboy ride on forever
You know there's good times waiting on down the road, cowboy ride on forever

Life is just one big old rodeo,he can here a lonesome song and start to cry,
Sometimes his heart's too big for his own good, but it sure a'int
Hard to make him want to fight, oh my, and he won't stop until he's
Understood, drivin' pick up trucks at different stores that's the way

A cowboy rocks and rolls, cowboy ride on forever don't you ever let 'em
Tie you down, cowboy ride on forever, there's horses who never thrown you
And women who never known you they're just waitin' for you to come around,

Cowboy ride on forever, you know there's good times waitin' on down the
Road, cowboy ride on forever don't you ever let 'em tie you down

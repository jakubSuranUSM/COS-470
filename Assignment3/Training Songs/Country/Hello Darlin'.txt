Hello darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be

How's your new love?
Are you happy?
Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know it means so much to me

What's that darlin'?
How am I doin'?
Guess I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep
And I cry all night 'til dawn

What I'm tryin' to say is
I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong

Look up, darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time's sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time

Thank you, darlin'
May God bless you
And may each step you take bring you closer
To the things you seek to find

Goodbye, darlin'
Got to go now
Got to try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true

And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back, darlin'
I'll be waiting for you

Hurt me as much as you want to if tears make you happy then I'll cry
Do anything that you want to but don't ever tell me goodbye
Break my heart if that brings pleasure and take the twinkle from my eyes
Do anything that you want to but don't ever tell me goodbye
Don't tell me goodbye whatever you do for I just couldn't live if I ever lost you
Tell our friends that it's all over say that the fault was all mine
Do anything that you want to but don't ever tell me goodbye
Oh don't ever tell me goodbye

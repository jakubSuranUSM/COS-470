I'm going out tonight to find myself a friend
I need a welcome smile and the grasp of an open hand
Gonna sit for hours in a small dark place, catch up with a long lost face
And talk about how long it's really been
I'm going out tonight with perfume on my wrist
I'm need to find someone to show me what I've missed
And when I see that someone sittin' there, gonna tell your memory I don't care
If he offers something more than just a kiss
Underneath the moon so bright, I wanna fall tonight
Beneath a spell
Underneath the sky so clear, I wanna find someone waiting there
Who used to know me well
I'm going out tonight without a chaperone
I'm gonna leave that meddling heart of mine at home
Cause it don't like crowds or closing time, neon blues or pickup lines
It makes me spend my Friday nights alone
Underneath the moon so bright 
Underneath the sky so clear 
I'm gonna tell myself that someone I adore
Is the one I'm with, ain't that what friends are for
Cause my empty arms are open wide; I'm long on spite, and short on pride
And the old way isn't working anymore
I'm going out tonight to find myself a friend

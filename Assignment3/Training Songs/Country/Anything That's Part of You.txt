I memorize the note you sent go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through for anything that's part of you

I kept a ribbon from your hair a breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue anything that's part of you

Oh how it hurts to miss you so when I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you knowing you don't need me

No reason left for me to live what can I take what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new for anything that's part of you

At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps comin' on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me

They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us, oh, some day
You and me, huh, at the dark end of the street
You and me

And when the daylight hours roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh, darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street

I ain't gonna call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore
Even though I know what all his daddy done before
Hank weighs close to 200 pounds and he stands about 6 foot 4
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore

Just a little bit of Waylon sure goes a long way
But old Tex Ritter rode his horse and that was hell to pay
Willie said,"Don't nobody lay a hand on the bay
Jimmie Rodgers is the only reason that I'm standin' here today"

And I ain't gonna call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore
Even though I know what all his daddy done before
Hank weighs close to 200 pounds and he stands about 6 foot 4
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore
Dickey Betts

Hank sang it all right from the heart, took the whole world by surprise
Stood right next to Elvis in Memphis and looked him straight in the eyes
Ten years later young Bocephus busted through the door
And I just can't call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore

I ain't gonna call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore
Even though I know what all his daddy done before
Hank weighs close to 200 pounds and he stands about 6 foot 4
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore

From Alabama young Bocephus busted through the door
And I just can't call Hank Williams Junior Junior anymore

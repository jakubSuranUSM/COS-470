Refrain:
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born. 
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.
Refrain: 

The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo! above the earth,
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth.
Refrain: 
  And lo! When they had heard it,
They all bowed down to pray,
Then travelled on together,
To where the Baby lay.
Refrain: 
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.
Refrain: 

I too am like a shepherd,
My flock of days to guard,
Each day finds time for praying,
From this I won't retard.
Refrain:

If only I could walk out in the sunshine and see the world a way my eyes should see
And if only I could hold a hand of someone who loves me
Without your shadow hanging over me
You turned my world into a shady garden you placed yourself between the sun and me

Oh if only I could feel the arms of someone who needs me
Without your shadow hanging over me
Without your shadow hanging over me I could be what I want to be
There's so many things these eyes of mine would love to see that's good for me
Without your shadow hanging over me without your shadow hanging over me

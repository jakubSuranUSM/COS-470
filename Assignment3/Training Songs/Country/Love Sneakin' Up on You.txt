All right, let's give it to 'em!

Rainy night and I'm all alone
Sittin' here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold, cold sweat
Thinkin' about the things we haven't even done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same?
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?

Don't worry, baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', baby, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Ain't nowhere on Earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin' up on your blind side
You might as well, baby, stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be
Turn this mother up 365 degrees

Don't worry, baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', baby, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Don't worry, baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Don't worry, baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

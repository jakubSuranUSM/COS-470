Sitting up here in this New York townhouse
Decorated in grays and blues and everybody knows
Love won't grow for a cactus and a rose

When that old wild streak beneath my skin
Sets my crazy spree again
They'll all say I told you so
Love won't grow for a cactus and a rose

'Cause I still like to drink my beer
And I still love a honky tonk
Where the good ole girls will always dance with you
When the high falootin' women won't

And I'm locked into a way of life
I can't give it up, I know it makes me sad
Love can't be had for a cactus and a rose
It makes me sad
Love can't be had for a cactus and a rose

Sometimes falling makes more sense
Than sitting in the middle of the same old fence
You're gonna loose either way you go
And love won't grow for a cactus and a rose

So I'm sitting up here in this New York townhouse
Decorated in grays and blues and everybody knows
Love won't grow for a cactus and a rose

'Cause I still like to drink my beer
And I still love a honky tonk
Where the good ole girls will always dance with you
When the high falootin' women won't

And I'm locked into a way of life
I can't give it up, I know it makes me sad
Love can't be had for a cactus and a rose

It makes me sad
Love can't be had for a cactus and a rose

Bye bye love bye bye happiness hello loneliness I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress hello emptiness I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

There goes my baby with someone new he sure feel happy I sure look blue
He was my baby till she walked in goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love

I'm through with romance I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
I guess the reason why I'm so free is both my babies walked out on me
Bye bye love

Bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbye bye bye my love goodbye

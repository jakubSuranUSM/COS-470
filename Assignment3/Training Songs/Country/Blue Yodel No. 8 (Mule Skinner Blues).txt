Good mornin' captain, good mornin' shine
Good mornin' captain, good mornin' shine
Do you need another mule skinner
Workin' on your new road line? 

My line's been rollin'
I'm rollin' all the time
My line is work
I'm rollin' all the time
I can carve my initials (ha)
On an old mule's behind 

I said hey, little waterboy (hey)
Bring that water bucket 'round
(Bring it 'round, bring it 'round, bring it 'round, bring it 'round)
I said hey, little waterboy
Bring that water bucket 'round
And if you don't like your job
Shut that water bucket down 

Good morning captain, good mornin' shine
Good morning captain, good mornin' shine
Do you need another mule skinner
Workin' on your new road line? 

Well I like to work,
I'm rollin' all the time
Well I like to work,
I'm rollin' all the time
I can carve my initials
On an old mule's behind 

I said, good mornin' captain
Good mornin' captain
I said good mornin' captain
Mornin' captain
Said good mornin'captain
Mornin' captain
I said good mornin' captain
Mornin' captain
Mornin' captain
Mornin' captain
Working on your new road line

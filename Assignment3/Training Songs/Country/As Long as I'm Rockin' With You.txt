Wherever I'm goin', wherever I'm stayin'
It doesn't matter, long as I'm stayin' with you, stayin' with you

I'm always happy, whatever I'm doin'
It doesn't matter, long as I do it with you, do it with you

I may never have much silver and gold
But, I've got something more precious and warmer to hold
And that old rockin' chair don't scare me, like it used to
It doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you

Wherever I'm workin', whatever it's payin'
It doesn't matter, long as it's workin' with you, workin' with you

These things I believe in, some people call dreamin'
It doesn't matter, long as I'm dreamin' with you, dreamin' with you

I may never have much silver and gold
But, I've got something more precious and warmer to hold
And that old rockin' chair don't scare me, like it used to
It doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you

No, it doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you
No, it doesn't matter, as long as I'm rockin' with you

As long as I'm rockin' with you

Dim, dim the lights, it'll be alright
Let me hold you tight tonight
The night is yours and mine
So, baby, take your time
You know you look so fine tonight, tonight

And every time we kiss like this
Don't you know you drive me crazy, baby
And every time you say you love me again
Well, my heart, my heart, my heart stops beating

Dim, dim the lights, it'll be alright
I wanna hold you tight tonight

And every time we kiss like this
Don't you know you drive me crazy, baby
And every time you say you love me again
Well, my heart, my heart, my heart stops beating

Dim, dim the lights, it'll be alright
I wanna hold you tight tonight
Why don't you dim, dim the lights

Why don't you dim, dim the lights
It'll be alright
I wanna hold you tight tonight

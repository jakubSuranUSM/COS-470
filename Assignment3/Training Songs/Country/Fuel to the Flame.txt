You kindle the fire of love inside me 
Each time our lips meet 
I'm not strong when you're around 
Your kisses make me weak 
You must know how I feel 
But do you feel the same 
Everytime you kiss me 
You add fuel to the flame 

My eyes light up when I see you 
I burn with desire 
Each time you're near 
You say it's clear 
But still I'm not sure 
Please don't ask me to love you 
If you're not going to change my name 
Cause everytime you kiss me 
You add fuel to the flame 

The spark of love 
You started inside me has reached my very soul 
You're adding fuel to a flame 
That's already out of control 
When you give me your name 
I'll give you everything 
Yes, everytime you kiss me 
You add fuel to the flame

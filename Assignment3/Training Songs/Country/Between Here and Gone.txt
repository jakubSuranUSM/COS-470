Tonight the moon came up, it was nearly full
Way down here on earth, I could feel it's pull
The weight of gravity or just the lure of life
Made me want to leave my only home tonight

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
Is it in a photograph or a dashboard poet's song?
Will I have missed my chance to right some ancient wrong
Should I find myself between here and gone?

Now I could grab my keys, clear out in my truck
With every cent on board bringing me their luck
An' I could drive too fast like a midnight sleeve
As if there was a way to outrun the grief

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
In a song that's left behind, in the dream I couldn't wake from
Could I've felt the brush of a soul that's passing on
Somewhere in between, here and gone?

Up above me, wayward angels
A blur of wings and grace
One for courage, one for safety
One for just in case

I thought a light went out but now the candle shines
I thought my tears wouldn't stop then I dried my eyes
And after all of this, the truth that holds me here
Is that this emptiness is something not to fear

Yeah, I'll keep wondering how we know where we belong
After all the journey's made and the journey's yet to come
When I feel like giving up instead of going on
Somewhere in between

Yeah, I'm just wondering how we know where we belong
Is it in the arc of the moon leaving shadows on the lawn?
In the path of fireflies and a single bird at dawn
Singing in between, here and gone

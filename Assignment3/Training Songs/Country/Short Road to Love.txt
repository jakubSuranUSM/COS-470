Baby oh baby, why do you treat me this way'
You're acting like a baby. 
All you want to do is play.
But I just want to get down to business.
I just want to get next to you. 
Baby oh baby, why do you hurt me so'
You tease me then you leave me all hot chilled cold.
Gettin' me crazy. 
And I don't know where I'm bound.
It's a short road to love,
But you're taking me the long way around.

Why don't you come and cuddle up next to me,
And help me forget.
Well you've been nothing but a heartache to me,
Since the night we met.
It's a short road to love,
But you're taking me the long way around.

Baby oh baby, why do you hurt me so'
You tease me then you leave me all hot chilled cold.
Gettin' me crazy. 
And I don't know where I'm bound.
It's a short road to love,
But you're taking me the long way around.

It's a short road to love,
But you're taking me the long way around.

It's a short road to love,
But you're taking me the long way around.

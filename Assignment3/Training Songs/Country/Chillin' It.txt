I got my shades on, top back,
Rolling with the music jacked,
One on the wheel, one around you baby

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky,
Shinning off the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride,
Breeze blowing in, your hair blowing round
You're scanning through the stations looking for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat,
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

I got my shades on, top back,
Rolling with the music jacked,
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up,
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl, you so fine I wouldn't mind if this is all we did.
You got me high on kisses, you got me missing signs
Hard looking left when my world is on my right

I got my shades on, top back,
Rolling with the music jacked,
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up,
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where I wanna be

I got my shades on, top back,
Rolling with the music jacked,
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset
I bet
There's a chance we can get
Sure enough
Tangled up,
Laid back and lazy

Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it
Long as I'm rocking with you, girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it

Yeah, I love rocking with you when, girl, we're just chilling it

I once had a friend named Joe the biggest lumberjack in old Idaho
He worked like a dog from day to day he drew ten cents an hour for his pay
Come Saturday evenin' it have him a ball it'd ride him along the Idaho Falls
But now old Joe he's laid to rest he forgot this slogan that he learned best

Don't you cut timber on a windy day stay out of wood better listen what I say
Winds and top flowers go either way don't you cut timber on a windy day
Don't you cut timber on a windy day...
Now Joe had a girl and her name was Anne had arms like a bull and muscles like a man

And when she heard old Joe is dead she picked up rags and away she plead
Up in the mountains where the trees grow tall it was in her mind to cut 'em all
Folks around here say to this day that end still up they're chappin' away
Don't you cut timber on a windy day...

Oh, the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on

Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone

The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone
It amazes me, not knowing any better

Than to think I had a love who would be true
Why, I should be taken out, tarred and feathered
To have let myself be taken in by you

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone

The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

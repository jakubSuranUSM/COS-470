She likes adventure with security
And more than one man can provide
She planned adventure feeling sure that he
Would not be home â€˜til after five

He turned on the lights and turned them off again
And said the one thing he could say
All these years
Where have I been
Well I've been down the road from work and home again
And I'm still here, until I'm gone
And don't you rub it in too hard that I've been wrong
All these years

She said you're not the man you used to be
And he said, Neither is this guy
She there's some things you refuse to see
But I guess sometimes so do I

She made not excuse why she was lying there
She said the one thing she could say
All these years 
What have I done
I made your supper and your daughter and your son
Still I'm here, and still confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years

I'm still here and so confused 
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years

Well, I went to see my baby
She said stay away from me
'Cause I'm a hot wire
And you're a flat tire
And I'm a-lettin' you go, you see

[Chorus]
And now, I'm gone
You can look for me
Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

Well, I never thought my baby
Would ever say goodbye
That goes to show
That a man don't know
Just how the cards can lie

[Chorus]

She left me here to weep and moan
Nothin' but the doggone blues
I've made my bid
But she flipped her lid
And now I've got the walkin' shoes

And so, I'm gone
You can look for me
Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

Well, the tears I shed this mornin'
And the tears I shed last night
I cried, by gosh
But it just can't wash
My baby from my sight

[Chorus]

When I looked out on the ocean
Lord, it was deep and wide
Well, my baby's gone
And I can't go on
So I hung my little head and cried

[Chorus]

Where?

Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

It was nearly summer, we sat on your roof, 
Yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon, 
I showed you stars you never could see 
It couldn't been that easy to forget about me 

Time meant nothing, anything seemed real 
Yeah, you kissed like fire and you made me feel 
Like every word you said was meant to be 
It couldn't been that easy to forget about me 

Baby, even the losers, get lucky sometimes 
Baby, even the losers, keep a little bit of pride, 
They get lucky sometimes 

Two cars park on the overpass, 
Rocks hit the water like broken glass 
I shoulda known right then it was too good to last, 
God, it's such a drag when your living in the past 
Baby, even the losers, get lucky sometimes 
Even the losers, 
Keep a little bit of pride, 
They get lucky sometimes

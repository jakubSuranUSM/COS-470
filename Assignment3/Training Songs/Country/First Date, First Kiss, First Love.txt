First date
Tonight was our first date
We couldn't anticipate
Emotions we now feel
First kiss
Tonight was our first kiss
And now we know the bliss
That only young love can yield
I've got a funny feeling
I've worked hard at concealing
But I can't hide this wonderful thrill
I kept up a constant chatter
Pretending nothing matters
And I begged my heart
To please, please be still
Oh, first love
This is our first love
Our one and only love
Our first love and our last
I've got a funny feeling
I've worked hard at concealing
But I can't hide this wonderful thrill
I kept up a constant chatter
Pretending nothing matters
And I begged my heart
To please, please be still
Oh, first love
This is our first love
Our one and only love
Our first love and our last

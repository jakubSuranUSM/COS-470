They shot the tiger on his chain
In a field behind the cages
He walked in circles till he was crazy 
And he lived that way forever

And he lived that way beside them
Separate from the other tigers
He could not know another tiger

They shot the tiger on his chain
In a field behind the cages
Walked in circles till he was crazy
And he lived that way forever

And he lived that way forever
Just as long as he could remember
If he'd wanted to remember

When was the last time that he felt alive
When he saw that brown haired lady
She fed with a bottle as a baby
And he recalled her face and smiled

They shot that tiger on his chain

They shot the tiger on his chain
They shot the tiger on his chain
They shot the tiger on his chain
They shot the tiger on his chain

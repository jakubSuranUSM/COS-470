Holidays are lonely days for me no Christmas ain't like Christmas used to be
Since you've gone it's not the same no more no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy but now it makes me blue
There's something about Christmas that starts me missing you
No I don't have the spirit as before no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
[ piano ]
This lonely house don't need no mistletoes for I'm the only one that comes and goes
And since that day you walked out the door well Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy...
Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore

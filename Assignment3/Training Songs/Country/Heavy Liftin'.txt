I hit the ground running
With the morning sun
When a job needs doing
I get it done
I show up early and I go home late
Everybody knows I pull my weight

'Cause I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'

Baby I heard he done you wrong
The going got tough and he got gone
Well he ain't here and I ain't him
And even if the walls come falling in

You know I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'

Baby when your heart is achin'
Lean on me, my back ain't breakin'
All I'm sayin'

Is I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'

Honey I ain't quittin'
I'm always giving my everything
As long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'

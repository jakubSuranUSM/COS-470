It's another back-door sneakin' in
Where you been?  Midnight
Quiet as a Mack Truck-Lotsa luck
Thinkin' up an alibi
But every light in the house is on
Everything is gone

She's left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red "Goodbye" in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation
No reconciliation
No let's-talk-it-over number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye

She could have thrown a knock-down
Scream-and-shout
Have-it-out tirade
She could have made it real tough
Bringing up
All the hell that I raised
But no more wasted words on me
No, she kept it short and sweet

She's left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red "Goodbye" in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation
No reconciliation
No let's-talk-it-over number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye

No more wasted words on me
No, she kept it short and sweet

She's left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red "Goodbye" in lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all
No long explanation
No reconciliation
No let's-talk-it-over number I can call
Goodbye says it all
Goodbye

Window seat
30,000 feet
Above the ground
Blue moon beams on silver wings
Brings me down
Slipping off my coat for the long night flight
I finda note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words
As I close my eyes:

Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are

These days I leave
The one who needs me
More and more it seems
It's a high price that she pays
For the dreams I dream

Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are

Goodnight, Sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are

When the fiddlin' man came to our town
Sister dressed up in her prettiest gown
Momma told sister don't be hanging around
That no good fiddlin' nan

'Cause a fiddlin' man he ain't on the level
He'll fiddle like an angel act like a devil
Sister wouldn't listen she was a rebel
She liked that fiddlin' man

She went to the dance stayed all night long
Momma waited up 'til the break of dawn
Momma found a letter and said she's gone
Off with that fiddlin' man

Sister ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

So I bought me a fiddle and I got me a bow
Practiced in the woods where
Momma wouldn't know
Knew she'd never ever let me go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

And the leaves and the wind would dance and twirl
As I played for the rabbits and played for the squirrels
Couldn't wait 'til I played for the girls

Had to be a fiddlin' man
And late one night when the moon was low
I packed my fiddle and I packed my bow
Momma found a note and said "Oh, no"
He's gone to be a fiddlin' man

And I ran off to be a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

Well then one night when I started to play
I saw a pretty gal looking my way
She was dancing with her brother
And I heard her day I like that fiddlin' man

Now her little brother was about knee high
Looked at the fiddle with a gleam in his eye
Said to me sir, I'd sure like to try
To learn to be a fiddling man

I said son, there's a whole lot a boys gotta know
Like chicken in the brier patch squawking at the crow
He said I don't care I just got to go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

So I had an old fiddle that I never did play
Sister winked when I gave it away
Ain't no doubt what momma's gonna say
That no good fiddlin' man

And brother ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

And his sister ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

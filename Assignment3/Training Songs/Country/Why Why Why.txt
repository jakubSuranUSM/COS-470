Walkin' down the streets
You look into a dump
You look into a dump and you say
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Running down the highway
As fast as you can
You throw a tin can and you say
Why, why, why, why, why, why

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

I'm knocking on your door
My knees are on the floor
I get you on the phone and you say no
Why, why, why, why, why, why

You gotta have a Porsche
You gotta have a white horse
You gotta be a California dream man
Why, why, why, why, why, why

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

Walkin' down the streets
You look into a dump
You look into a dump and you say
Why, why, why, why, why, why

Medieval warrior riding on his horse
Promised you heaven, but put you through hell
Why why why why why why

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

And you try, and you try
To destroy

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why do you destroy
And you try, and you try
To destroy

And you try, and you try
To destroy

Well I've been looking at the numbers
And it makes me really scared
And I can't help but wonder
How we'll ever get anywhere
Hope can die so young
Long before the race is run

[Chorus:]
And the odds are, we're all gonna get out heart broken, someday
And the odds are, some of our dreams will get left along the way
And every time you hold me close, it's the light against the dark
And here we are, evening up the odds
Evening up the odds

And I want you to tell me
How safe I am with you
And how our hearts together
Can't help but make it through
And for every love that leaves
There's a love that's meant to be

[Chorus]

Smile a smile, for every tear that falls
That's not fair, but darling after all
Here we are, here we are

[Chorus]

Evening up
Evening up
Evening up the odds.

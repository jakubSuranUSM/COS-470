Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights of town.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
When the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

I lie awake at night and wait till you come in.
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.
For every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry. 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
And you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye,
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry. 
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

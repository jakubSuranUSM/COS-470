As I slowly turn the pages and see all these smiling faces
It's hard to believe it was today, ten years ago
Here is the invitation to our wedding celebration
Just look at the promise these pictures show
Now I know

If I had loved her by the book
She would be right here by my side
But fool that I am, I overlooked
My promise to love her forever
For worse or for better
We'd still be together
If Id've loved her by the book

If I opened this book more often, then I wouldn't have forgotten
How much she cared and how much I meant my solemn vows
To honor to have and hold her, but as I read them over
I know it's too late to say I'm sorry now

If I had loved her by the book
She would be right here by my side
But fool that I am, I overlooked
My promise to love her forever
For worse or for better
We'd still be together
If Id've loved her by the book

If I had loved her by the book

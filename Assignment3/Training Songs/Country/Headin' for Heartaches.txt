You're headin' for heartaches by playin' around
You know as well as I that a new love can't be found
You're headin' for heartaches so don't you be surprised
When there's no one there to dry the teardrops in your eyes

You're headin' for heartaches I'm warnin' you now
Does he mean so much to you that you'd break all our vows
You're headin' for heartaches oh, don't you realize
That maybe he is telling you a bunch of little lies

You're headin' for heartaches now that you've made up your mind
You believed in someone else who's love would be so kind
You're headin' for heartaches and it won't be very long
Till I have someone else to love and you left all alone

Raindrops like bullets on my fragile skin
Insecurities I've had are creeping within
Now I'm twenty miles outside of the place that you live
And I need one more chance now that time's running thin

Well you are the things that'd make up my dreams
When I've spent every dime that jingled my jeans
I deserve every stone that's thrown out at me
I'll think of your smile, I'm in love with your teeth

I'm losing when I am not playing no games
Now would you take me back when I've gambled my pay
And I've got no directions without her little fingers
Barbed wire, razor wire, nothing keeps me from her

And if I had no boots I'd trek through the mud
While mosquitoes are racing to draw the first blood
If you're running away then I'm looking for you
And if you've lost your way I'm seeing you through
Oh if your running away then I'm looking for you
And if you've lost your way I'm seeing you through

If your running away then I'm looking for you
And if you've lost your way I'm seeing you through
Oh if your running away then I'm looking for you
And if you've lost your way I'm seeing you through
Oh if your running away then I'm looking for yo
And if you've lost your way I'm seeing you through

I've seen a lot of places
I've been around the world
I've been seen pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls

After all I've witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe

[Chorus]
('Cause) God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave 'em a place where they could dnace
If you want to see heaven, brother, here's you chance
I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas.

First, He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see

Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest, then on the very next day

[Chorus: x2]

Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas.

The rich man's eatin' with a golden spoon
The poor man's worried bout a gettin' to the moon
They say World War III is a comin' any day
But me I couldn't careless either way

I ain't got time to be unhappy I ain't got time to be unhappy
Lovin' you makes me wanna slap my puppy
And I ain't got time to be unhappy

[guitar]
The world keeps changing everyday
The things in the heart stay the same old way
Rockets to the Moon and filter cigarettes
Ain't had no bet though my life as yet

I ain't got time to be unhappy...

[harmonica]
So take my advice if you ever get blue
Find a little girl that just digs you
Live on love let the war out be
Then you can sing my little song with me

I ain't got time to be unhappy...
(Come on now)
I ain't got time to be unhappy...
Oh I ain't got time to be unhappy...

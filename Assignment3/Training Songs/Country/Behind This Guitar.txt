He's gross, she's got cooties
That's just how it's supposed to be
He hates dumb tea parties
And she won't climb a tree

It's a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

She'll stop wearin' pigtails
And get the braces off her teeth
He'll stop makin' faces
And start savin' her a seat

It's a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

She'll start wearin' makeup
And he'll start noticin' the curves
They'll get a little nervous
When she's with him and he's with her

Is he gonna kiss me?
Wonder if she wants me to?
Awkwardly embarrassed
Not sure what to do

It's a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

They'll throw around 'I love you's'
Start makin' plans to say I do
Start a brand new life together
And probably have some babies too

They'll fight and act like children
But make up like they're seventeen
And even when they're eighty
It's still gonna be

A boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

A girl and a boy thing
A boy and a girl thing

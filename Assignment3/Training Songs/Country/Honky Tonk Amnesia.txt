She'd be hurt if she knew I was drinkin'
Cause one's too much and twelve's not enough
She knows how it messes up my thinkin'
How it makes me look for someone else to love

I get honky tonk amnesia
I forget where all my love belongs
I get honky tonk amnesia
And sometimes it lasts all night long

She'll accept my story without question
About the overtime I'm putting in
Till someone calls she'll tell them that I'm restin'
While I wonder what I've done and where I've been

I get honky tonk amnesia
I forget where all my love belongs
I get honky tonk amnesia
And sometimes it lasts all night long

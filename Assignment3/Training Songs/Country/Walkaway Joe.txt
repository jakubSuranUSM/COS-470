Mama told her baby girl take it real slow
Girl told her momma hey I really gotta go
He's waiting in the car
Mama said girl you won't get far
Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lovers lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh if she could've only seen
That fate's got cards that it don't want to show, and

That boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

Now just a little while into Abilene
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waiting in the car, oh, underneath the Texaco star
She only wanted love didn't bargain for this
She can't help but love him for the way he his
She's only seventeen and there ain't no reasoning
So she'll ride this ride as far as it can go, 'cause

That boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy's just a walkaway Joe

Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arms
But she'll just keep reaching on
For the cold hard truth revealed what it had known

That boy's just a walk away Joe
Born to be a leaver tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boy was a walkaway Joe

Mmm yeah,
All he was was a walkaway Joe
Oh,
(Walkaway Joe)
He was a walkaway Joe
Mmm

I have packed my clothes and made my plans to go
At least a hundred times or more
But every time I tried to leave your love behind
I could not walk out that door

It's a hard road when you try to walk alone
It takes a long time to find a love so strong
If your heart is saying yes don't let your pride say no
It's a hard road to go

I know, you're just like me, you've thought of being free
'Cause I have seen it in your eyes
You know I'm just like you I've thought about it too
But not enough to say goodbye

It's a hard road when you try to walk alone
It takes a long time to find a love so strong
If your heart is saying yes don't let your pride say no
It's a hard road to go

It's a hard road when you try to walk alone
It takes a long time to find a love so strong
If your heart is saying yes don't let your pride say no
It's a hard road to go

Adiós México
Adiós México
How I got along without ya, I never know
Now it's adiós México

I got a little chavala
Down there in Lake, Lake Chapala
Adiós México

Well, a sweet señorita is waiting for me
Down there in Ajijic
And I love her
Adiós México
Adiós México
Adiós México
How I got along without ya, I never know
Now it's adiós México

Adiós México
Adiós México
How I got along without ya, I never know
Now it's adiós México

Well, a sweet señorita is waiting for me
Down there in Ajijic
And I love her
Adiós México
Adiós México
Adiós México
How I got along without ya, I never know
Now it's adiós México

Adiós México
Adiós México
How I got along without ya, I never know
Now it's adiós México

Adiós México, fade

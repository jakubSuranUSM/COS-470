Tonight they're singing in the villas tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me while Amigo plays his blue guitar
Ay ay ay ay the moon is lonely tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Manana morning my darling I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar

They've hushed their singing in the villas all is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego upon his lonely blue guitar
Ay ay ay ay the moon is lonely...

I like to do me a little rock, do me a little roll
Country boogie woogie God is deep down in my soul
But it's good, got a hold on me
And I'm the boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, woogie man from Tennessee

Hey woman, let me catch you bulldog, let me take your bone
Shake it for ya, break it for ya all night long
It's got a hold on me
And I'm your boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, woogie man from Tennessee, yeah baby

Was born in Louisiana in the middle of a swamp
I'm like a backwater bullfrog, I'm ready to jump
Thank God, it's got a hold on me
I'm your boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, woogie man from Tennessee

Play it Kenny

Oh Lord, I love to boogie, I damn sure love to boogie
But oh, boogie, woogie
I'm your boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, woogie man from Tennessee, yeah

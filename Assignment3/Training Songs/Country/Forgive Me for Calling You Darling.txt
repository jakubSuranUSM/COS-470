Forgive me for calling you darling but I can't stop myself from loving you
Yesterday I slipped and called you darling and I saw him look at you and wonder why
If I've caused one drop of rain to fall on your new dream
It's because I just forgot that you're not mine
Forgive me for calling you darling I'm sorry for the things I say and do
Forgive me for calling you darling but I can't stop myself from loving you
[ steel ]
Forgive me for calling you darling...
I can't stop myself from loving you

We're goin' west to Kaintuck, down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road, down the dug road, the old reedy creek road
The road down troublesome, the road through Moccasin Gap

Well, it's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kid with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day
Young Jim Boone's dead, now twenty miles away

Well, if you love your wife and love your baby, man
You better turn that wagon back as soon as you can
Every Injun in them hills has gone berserk
And you never gonna make it to Kaintuck
Ah, I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck

I'm goin' west to Kaintuck, down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road, down the dug road, the old reedy creek road
The road down troublesome, the road through Moccasin Gap

Hurricanes in December-earthquakes in the heartland
Bad air index on a flashing warning sign
Bound for trouble-the picture is dirty

We'll know when we get there
If we'll find mercy

Flotsam and Jetsam in charge of the agency
Where truth gets twisted in danger of dissolving
When war is profit and profit is war

We'll know when we get there
If we'll find mercy

Certified minds exacting a toll
Trying to fit a square block in a round hole
A heart of darkness facing 1000 bloodshot eyes

We'll know when we get there
If we'll find mercy

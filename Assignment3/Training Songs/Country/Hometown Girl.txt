Years ago in my hometown I was a headstrong girl and a heart-strong one
We'd ride all summer with the top rolled down through the sleepy streets of that Jersey town 
Now I knew girls when I was sixteen 
Could make a smart boy stutter, turn a nice boy mean 
And the boys made the girls into homecoming queens 
Married each other instead of their dreams

[Chorus]
These days I'm mostly out on my own 
Looking for someplace that I can call home 
Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
It never seemed that hard before 
What happened to that hometown girl?

The seasons changed in my hometown 
The way they changed in yours 
The windows opened up to the spring 
Like every spring before 
And I ran with boys who weren't like you 
I was young, but somehow I knew 
The difference between a man and a fool 
Sometimes I think that could have been you

[Chorus]

Hometown girls are like hometown dreams 
Some start fading, others stay keen 
I won't forget you, but I'll let you be 
Love never was that kind to me

Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
You had your madness and you had your charm 
But only when your heart allowed 
And my heart just won't allow no more 
What happened to that hometown girl?

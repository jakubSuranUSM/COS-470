In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings there on display

She smiles and nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you
It's not much, but it's the best that I can do"

Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Waiting there (waiting there) for someone to take it home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune

Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring, I thee wed"

Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Shining ring (shining ring) now at last it's found a home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

Ooh-ooh

In a small two room apartment 
As they fight their final round
He says, "You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town"

But she says, "One thing's for certain
I don't love you any more"
And throws down the ring as she walks out the door

Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Cast aside (cast aside) like the love that's dead and gone
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings there on display
Golden ring

Are you going to Alabama
Where the trees grow tall and green
I'd like to see the gulf of Mexico
If you're going, won't you take me

Are you going to Alabama
Where the skies shine bright and blue
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
If you're going, I want to go with you

Are you going to Alabama
Where the folks say "how do you do"
I'd like to see those big ol' cotton fields
If you're going, I'm going too

I'm ready to run, baby
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellias
And watch the sun shine

If you're going to Alabama
I could use a change of view
But if you're going to California
That's alright, any place will do
Well, I guess I just want to go with you

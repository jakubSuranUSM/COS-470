I've searched for words of sweet description to best describe
The thrill it gives me just to have you by my side
But I can't find one single word that properly defines
How sweet it is just knowing that all your love is mine

Your love is heavenly sunshine, heavenly sunshine
You fill my heart with your sweet love devine
Heavenly sunshine, heavenly sunshine you make me happy cause your love is mine

The colors in the rainbow are a lovely sight to see
But even rainbows lose their glow when you smile at me
And when you kiss me I can hear a thousand bluebirds sing
No matter how that sounds, the words could only mean one thing
Your love is heavenly sunshine...
Heavenly sunshine, heavenly sunshine...

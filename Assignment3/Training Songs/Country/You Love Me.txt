You're the one and the everyone
Got a list of the things that you've done
Life's dirty and you know that it's true
Take a look at what is coming out of you

[Chorus:]
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb
Hoverin' in the moonlight

Livin' cheap and it's never untrue
Never met but I feel it in you
Ever think that it's everything wrong
In a world that is totally blasted

[Chorus]

Livin' cheap and it's everyone
Never met but it's comin' out of you
Ever think that it's everything wrong
In a world that is totally plastered

[Chorus]

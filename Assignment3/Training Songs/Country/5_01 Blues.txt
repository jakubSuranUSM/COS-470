I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I punch out and put in
Another long night again, missin' you
I got these 5:01 blues

I used to watch that old clock on the wall
Wishin' I could make time fly
But ever since you walked out on me
Quittin' time just make me want to cry

I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I punch out and put in
Another long night again, lovin' you
I got these 5:01 blues

I could go out and find somebody new
I'd only spoil her fun
My mind still says that it's time to love you
When the clock says the workday is done

I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I punch out and put in
Another long night again, missin' you
I got these 5:01 blues

I got those 5:01 blues another work day is over
Time to go home but no one to go home to
That whistle just blew bad news
I punch out and put in 
Another long night again, missin' you
I got these 5:01 blues

(Spoken):
Oh man, I got no place to go
No one to go to

Well hello there my it's been a long long time
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems now that it was yesterday
Oh ain't it funny how time slips away

Say how's your new love I hope he's doing fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me it seems like yesterday
Oh ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now I hope I'll see you around
But I don't know when though never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you in time you're gonna pay
Oh ain't it funny how time slips away

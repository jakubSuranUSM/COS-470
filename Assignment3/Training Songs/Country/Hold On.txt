If you want to keep a woman like me, you got to hold on
If you want to see how good it can be, baby, hold on
All my friends think that I'm a fool
I tell you something honey, they're not that cool
If you want to keep a woman like me, you better hold on

If you want to know how far we can go, you got to hold on
If you take it slow then I got something to show you
Baby, hold on
All those girls with their empty heads
Can't fill 'em up with the lies they've been fed
If you want to know how far I can go, you got to hold on

She'll give you reasons for her kind
You might believe it, but I'm not that blind

If you think you need a woman like me, you better hold on
If you want to find what I've got on my mind, baby, hold on
All this small talk that keeps us apart
Is only hiding how we feel in our hearts
If you want to keep a woman like me, baby, hold on

I killed Oscar, shot him in the head
Put the gun in his mouth, watched his brains fly out
My worries fade as the hole got bigger
Solved all my problems with a trigger

I don't need forgiveness for my sins
I don't need redemption for my sins
Got the satisfaction of a job well done
With my own bare hands

Oscar, Oscar was destroying me
I killed Oscar, burden lifted off of me
I killed Oscar now I'm happy, happy, happy
I killed Oscar before he killed me
I killed Oscar before he killed me

I don't need forgiveness for my sins
I don't need redemption for my sins
I don't need salvation 'cause I saved myself
I don't need your help because I helped myself
I don't need nobody trying to save, save, save me

I killed Oscar and I forgave me
I killed Oscar and I forgave me
I killed Oscar and I forgave me

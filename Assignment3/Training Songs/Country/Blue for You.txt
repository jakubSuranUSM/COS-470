Lonesome for you through the day every moment you're away
Long to see you smiling say I'm in love with you ever will be true
Long to see your smiling face and to feel your warm embrace
No one else can take your place when the day is through darling I'm so blue for you
(Long on and on) feeling kinda blue (thinking of you) don't know what I'll do
I'll love you so much more than you'll know the whole day through
(Long for your knock) knocking at my door
(Long for your kiss) kiss and hold you more
Please don't stay away hurry home today darling I'm so blue for you
(Long on and on) feeling kinda blue...

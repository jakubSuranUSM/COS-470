There were fourteen reasons for sayin' goodbye
Like the look on her face and the look in her eye
And the way that she broke the man down
Left the man in pieces here on sinkin' ground

There were fourteen nights when she didn't come by
Fourteen days when she left the man 
Wondering why he even bothered to try
So baby bye bye

[Chorus]
On the outside
Baby's such a pretty girl
On the inside baby ain't so pretty
Pretty soon she'll find a lonely little world

And there'll be one less man that girl can bring down
One less man with his eyes on the ground
And his heart in his hands for the take
No more promises for baby to break

There'll be one less man with a tear in his eye
One less man who'll be hangin' 'round
Wondering why he even bothered to try
So baby bye bye

[Chorus]

And there'll be one less man that the girl can count on
One less man she'll find hangin' strong
To the dream that she could never change now
Comes to change and baby don't know how

Baby's such a pretty girl

[Chorus]

Don't need no whiskey
When I've had a bad day
No prescription honey
When my skies are grey

No poppin' the pills
No smokin' the pills
That make me feel okay
But you go down easy baby
I could drink you by the case

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh will you take it away
You take it away

Don't need no fixin'
I don't need no therapy
You're love drunk kissin'
Is my kinda remedy
You're always lookin' to fall
You're like the hair of the dog
When I'm feelin' cursed
Don't need no doctor honey
I don't need no nurse

You're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh you take it away
You take it away
Oh you take it away
You take it away

Ah la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
La la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
La la la la la la la
Ooh oh
La la la la la la la
Ooh ooh

You're my (la la la) painkiller (ooh ooh)
You're my (la la la) painkiller (ooh ooh)

Hey you're my painkiller
A little dose of you goes a long long way
You're my painkiller
Oh you take it away
You take it away
Oh you take it away
You take it away

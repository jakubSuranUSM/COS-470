Donald and June enjoyed their brief honeymoon
Then they came home to lead the big baby boom
June wanted boys so Margie wore short hair and corduroys
Soon they had Claire then Linda and Louise a matching pair June liked boys
Donald and June they put some money aside
But all in four years they gave away three young brides
June spent it all Donald tried to keep each wedding small
When they were broke he offered Claire a thousand to elope Claire said Nope
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far

Donald and June had finally emptied their nest
They planned a long trip and then a couple years rest
But Claire had a spat and turned up with her suitcase and her cap
Marg moved next door now she won't need day care anymore and the twins had twins
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far

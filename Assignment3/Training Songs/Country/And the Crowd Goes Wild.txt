Ahh, come on
Here we go

He was an underdog
A no threat
A nascar drunky
A rooky
A wanabe
Still wet behind the ears
A red line baron just gammin his gears
There are those that are
And those that ain't
The quickest get stickers
He was nuttin but paint
Chartreuse paint

Then he rased
Now we cut to
The last ten laps
And here comes junior
Sneakin up from the back of the pack
With fire in his eyes
Wavin out the window
As he's passin' um by
The tension mounds
Now he's number two
All out of rubba
And runnin on fuse
He's door to door
Outta time for
He sees those checkers
And he hears that roar

And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!

He played the honky tonks
The road side bars
A real hum dinger
A blue eyed singer
With a red guitar
Around his neck
Payin them dues
'bout stoppin his debt
But he told his mama
Every time he come back
One of these days
I'm gona buy you a big, long Cadillac
And get you outta this shack

And then he hit the road
Frontin the band
Six long hairs bobbin up and down
In a chevy van
All beat up
He did a lot of givin
But he never gave up
But one night
He wrote a song
Made a little record
That started catchin on
Now it's collisiums
He's all the rage
The lights go down
When he hits the stage

And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
Hey

"and here's the 2/2 to parker
Hit high in deep, right field
Jones to the back
To the wall
Goodbye!"
"Setup is good
Kick is in the air
It's got the distance
It's good!"
"He gets the four main front
And three wide receivers
Two to the left
He goes back to throw
Has time
To the end zone
Touchdown!"

And the crowd goes wild!
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
And the crowd goes wild!
You're shinnin like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild!
Whoa!
You're shinnin like a superstar baby
You're shinnin like a superstar

She got a candy red Cadillac Coupe DeVille
Great big house on a great big hill
Big time needs big time friends
She wear you flat out then start all over again

She's a fast girl
She got a high tone way of gettin' real low down
Sometime she screams sometime she don't make a sound
She got homegrown tomatoes ripe on the vine
Gently takes your hand then drags you over the line

She's a fast girl you can see it in her face
In the way she moves she's all over the place
Body in motion brain in a whirl no bout a doubt it she's a fast girl

She got big red lips she give real good phone
Big pointed breasts filled with silicone
Never automatic she got manual drive
Know how to crash and burn and come through alive
She's a fast girl

Martinis and the smell of cigar smoke
Hangin' in the air till you're ready to choke
On life itself future and past
As long as it's big as long as it's fast
She's a fast girl

She's a midwest fundamental grew up in church
A Catholic girl on a lifelong search
For some kind of meaning that's big and fast

She's a fast girl you can see it in her face
In the way she moves she's all over the place
Body in motion brain in a whirl no bout a doubt it she's a fast girl
No bout a doubt it she's a fast girl

She's a fast girl she's a fast girl she's a fast girl

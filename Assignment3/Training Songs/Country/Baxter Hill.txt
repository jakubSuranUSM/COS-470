Years ago grandaddy Baxter gave dad 40 acres
Daddy proudly named it Baxter Hill
Him and Mom raised seven kids
And gave us each 1 acre
In hopes someday that's where we all would build
Daddy's greatest dream in life was Baxter Hill

The rest all moved away but
I stayed on with mom and daddy
But they all gathered in when Mama died
They were quick decidin' papa couldn't handle business
And the six of them all said let's subdivide
You could see them dollar bill signs in their eyes

Yeah, they subdivided daddy's forty acres
The place where him and mama worked and saved
Not out of need, just out of greed
They built them six room houses
Bet mama's turnin' over in her grave
Just knowin' they've done papa this away

Well, they agreed that I could keep
The acre papa gave me
So I left that old house standin' where it was
And just a few days later
Them big old yellow graders
Started pushing up the ground my daddy loved
Tearin' up everything that he'd dreamed of

Now papa didn't say much
He just sat there on the front porch
And watched them big bulldozers rape his fields
He'd look straight ahead
And say I know your mama's dead
But she'll be comin' back to Baxter Hill
And she'll rattle chains in every room they build

Yeah, they subdidvided daddy's forty acres
But the houses stand there empty,cold and still
They sold a few, but the people moved
And swore they'd never come back
Papa just grins and says they never will
While your Mama walks on Baxter Hill

Yeah, Mama walks at night on Baxter Hill

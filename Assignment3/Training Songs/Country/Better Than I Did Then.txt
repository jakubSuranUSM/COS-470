When you're lyin' there in bed, late at night and all alone
With nothin' on but the radio
Listenin' to the midnight man takin' telephone requests
Playin' songs that you and I used to know

Do you ever think of me and all the nights
That we wasted and can't get back again
But if we ever do, honey, I promise you
I'll even love you better than I did then

When you go for a walk in the leaves when it's cold
Or lay when it's warm in the sun
With time on your hands and memories on your mind
Or a long sleepless night has just begun

Do you ever think of me and all the nights
That we wasted and can't get back again
But if we ever do, honey, I promise you
I'll even love you better than I did then

I'll even love you better than I did then
I'll even love you better than I did then

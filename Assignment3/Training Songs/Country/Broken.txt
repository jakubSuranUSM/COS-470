Thank God for these sunglasses
That hide my eyes and keep these tears from showin'
If I don't get home soon, I'm gonna run into you somewhere
I just know it, I just know it

You pulled the rug right out from under me
Now it's one day at a time
An uphill climb

I'm broken but I'm holdin' on
It's over but it's just the dark before the dawn
And I know before too long
That broken will be whole again
I know I'm gonna get back on my feet
And then I won't be broken, broken

I'm workin' nine to nine
Then I try to eat and find some time for sleepin'
And on the weekend
It's just me and way more TV than I'm needin'

You pulled the wool right over my eyes
Now my world is upside down
But still goin' round

I'm broken but I'm holdin' on
It's over but it's just the dark before the dawn
And I know before too long
That broken will be whole again
I know I'm gonna get back on my feet
And then I won't be broken, broken

Sometimes it seems just like it's gonna take forever
For the pain to finally end, for the healing to begin
Sometimes I feel like I'm this far from feelin' better
A quiet from within, almost new again

I'm broken but I'm holdin' on
It's over but it's just the dark before the dawn
And I know before too long
That broken will be whole again
I know I'm gonna get back on my feet
And then I won't be broken, broken

I'm broken but I'm holdin' on
It's over but it's just the dark before the dawn
And I know before too long
That broken will be whole again
I know I'm gonna get back on my feet
And then I won't be broken, broken

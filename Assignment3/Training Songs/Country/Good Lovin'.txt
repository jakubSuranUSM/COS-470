Good lovin' keeps a home together.
Good lovin' sure can make it right.
If you never want to be without him,
It means loving everything about him.
And that keeps your man around at night.

It takes a whole lotta woman to hold it together today.
'cause a lot of other women have a whole lotta time to play.
You gotta be a Saint on Sunday morning, a devil on Saturday night.
And when you're lovin' do it right.

Oh, she's around every corner, wrapped in fur,
And you've gotta be just a little bit better than her.
A little bit sweeter with your morning kisses,
A whole lot warmer in the night.
With a lot of good lovin' to make everything all right.

Good lovin' keeps a home together.

If you never want to be without him,
It means loving everything about him.
And that keeps your man around at night.

If you don't believe what I'm telling you is so,
Put your man right out on the street and watch him go,
Right to the arms of a woman, who couldn't even hold you a light,
When a lot of good lovin' woulda made everything all right.

If you don't believe what I'm telling you is so,
Put your man right out on the street and watch him go,
Right to the arms of a woman, who couldn't even hold you a light,
When a lot of good lovin' woulda made everything all right.

Yeah, a lot of good lovin' woulda made everything all right.

AIN'T IT FUNNY WHAT A FOOL WILL DO
(George Jones - Johnny Mathis)

(Funny what a fool will do)
Here am I without your love again
Oh how many times have you walked out and walked back in
And I cry just like a baby after you
Oh oh it's funny what a fool will do
Here am I with empty arms again
Counting all the times that you walked out and walked back in
Still my heart goes right on wanting you
Oh oh it's funny what a fool will do
Oh oh it's funny what a fool will do

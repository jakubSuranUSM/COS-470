Picked my clothes up, grabbed my suitcase
Never looked back at the look on your face
I just took off drivin'

There's gotta be someplace I could go to
Help me forget about how much I love you
Maybe Dallas, San Antone, a two lane highway all alone
Drivin' and a-cryin', drivin' and a-cryin'

Got the radio up the petal pushed down
The night wind blowin' my tears around
Gotta get back where I used to be
But I'm racin' with your memory

Drivin' and a-cryin', drivin' and a-cryin'
Sometimes in Texas ain't nothing out there
A man could get lost headed for nowhere
That's where I'm goin' without you

At least the long nights won't desert me
If I got nobody ain't nobody gonna hurt me
Hello honey it's been a long time

I'm out of her life and out of my mind
Drivin' and a-cryin', drivin' and a-cryin'
Got the radio up the petal pushed down
The night winds a-blowin' my tears around
Gotta get back where I used to be

But I'm racin' with your memory
Drivin' and a-cryin', drivin' and a-cryin'
Drivin' and a-cryin'
Oh
Cryin', 
Cryin', 
Cryin', 
Cryin'

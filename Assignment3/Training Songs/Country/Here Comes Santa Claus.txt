Speaking of Christmas spirit, each year out in Hollywood, California
They have what they call the Santa Claus parade
A few years ago, while I was riding in this parade
I saw smiles on thousands of faces, both young and old alike
Waiting for a look at that most popular man all over the world
I can hear 'em shouting now
"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus"

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin', all is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, oh what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed, and cover your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when chimes ring out, it's Christmas time again
Peace on earth will come to all, if we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the Lord above 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin', all is merry and bright
So jump in bed, and cover your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Peace on earth will come to all, if we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the Lord above 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight
So let's give thanks to the Lord above 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Charlies somewhere in the bar and this time he's gone too far
Cause she loves him still she's giving up fine
While he's spreading on the charm with a new love on his arm
Ill be helping Angel make it through the night
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight
I'm in heaven while I'm holding her tight
Charlie acted so unwise walking out on paradise
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight

Charlie thinks his game is cool but he's the picture of a fool
Giving up what most men dream of all their life
Hell wake up but much too late and fine his angel couldn't wait
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight
Yes I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight
I'm in heaven while I'm holding her tight
Charlie acted so unwise walking out on paradise
And I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight
Yes I'm holding Charlies Angel tonight

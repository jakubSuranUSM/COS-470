Hey yo, told you before
Tell you when I find a decoy
Sittin' in the water
With your hopes up high
Have you takin' a nosedive, hard boy

Hey yo, told you so
They'll be aimin' at you

You know I told you so
But I didn't say it wouldn't get boring
From the bar to the loo
To the buckaroos
Hopin' that you'll choose the real thing
Dance on, don't you know
We got somethin' to do

Hey yo, anywhere it goes
It's high time for a detour
Deep, deep water pulls you down
Time to get your feet on the ground

Hey yo, anywhere it goes
It's high time for a detour
Hey yo, anywhere it goes
It's high time for a detour

Hey yo, told you before
Tell you when I find a decoy
Sittin' in the water
With your hopes up high
Have you takin' a nosedive, hard boy

Hey yo, don't you know
They'll be aimin' at you

Hey yo, anywhere it goes
It's high time for a detour
Hey yo, anywhere it goes
It's high time for a detour

Hey, hey, hey hey yo
Hey, hey, hey yo
Hey yo

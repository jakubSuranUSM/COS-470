Forever lost in comparisons
Between you and the better man
Yeah you're always so quick
To take a bow

And your postcard sincerity
I've got to laugh at your circus sympathy
Don't you ever get tired
Of being yourself

It's getting so hard to find you
As you fade into your world of reprisal
As you slip into the comfort
Of your denial
Your patriotic smile

Your go down in style
And you say that you're not to blame
Yeah you're proud of what you did
And you'd do it again
But that's too bad about the little snag
All in the name of God and country

'Cause getting caught is such a drag
Even in the name of God and country
Still you're all the same to me
You're just trying to make points on national t.v.
Yeah you try to make points for God

God and country
You call this justice
I call this self-service

And I hope that I never find
What you call good conscience
Or peace of mind
As another man dies for God and country

'Cause I'm sure while you're sitting there talking
Well the bombs are falling

All in the name
All in the name
All in the name of God and country

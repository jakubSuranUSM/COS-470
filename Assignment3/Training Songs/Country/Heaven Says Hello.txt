Heaven says hello every morning when the sun says hi I've come to spend the day
Heaven says hello with the songbirds and the little flowers that nod along my way
And when the day is through and I hurry home to you
As the twilight steals across the golden skies
Heaven says hello when you kiss me and I look into the blue of your eyes

Heaven says hello when you kiss me and I look into the blue of your eyes
And I look into the blue of your eyes

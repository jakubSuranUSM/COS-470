Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
That's the only song we hear him sing

Santa, please remember Bobby's lonely
The closest neighbour's farm is quite a ways
And the country school don't have no children Bobby's size
And I'd like to give him something he can raise

And Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
But, Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
And that's the only song we hear him sing

Butch and Susie won't be here for Christmas
And he won't see his cousins now till spring
If we can find a playmate he can play with
Santa, that'll be all you have to bring

And Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
I know you plan to bring electric trains
But, Bobby wants a puppy dog for Christmas
That's the only song we hear him sing

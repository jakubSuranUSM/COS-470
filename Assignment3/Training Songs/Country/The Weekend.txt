Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just nine to fiving my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods looking like Panama City
A bunch of jacked up trucks and bikinis
Got a Yeti full of good ideas
Like I ain't worried 'bout driving, I'mma stay right here

And I'mma live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Somebody said something 'bout church on Sunday, amen
Somebody said something 'bout work on Monday (shhh, don't say it again)

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we're at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Live it up, live it up for the weekend (come on)
Live it up for the weekend
Live it up, live it up for the weekend
Live it up, live it up
It's the weekend

Carolina sundown red
Making the mountains gingerbread
And the magical road's a golden thread
That winds me home
Carolina sundown red
Tucking a weary world in bed
Only a few more miles ahead
And finally, home

Carolina sundown red
Don't worry 'bout a place to lay my head
I'll be sleepin' in my old bed tonight

And I'll say all the words I left unsaid
Cry all the tears I left unshed
Carolina sundown red
You'll find me home

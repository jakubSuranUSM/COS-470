I don't wait on women
I don't open doors
I'm not much of a gentleman
And by the way, I keep score
So if you are thinking
You're sitting on top of the world with me
Baby, you'd better think again

And I don't care for girls
Who give compliments to themselves
How glamorous they are
And how they're really something else
I've been taken in
By women like that before
So baby, you'd better think again

I could be more accommodating
But somehow it's lost on me
All this useless talking
About how it's gonna be
I'll come along for the ride
And this sad clown company
Hey baby, you'd better think again

Well, I'm about as dependable
As a drunkard who needs a drink
Have no real interest
In what you might say or think
But I got the ice cubes
And pour you a drink
So baby, you'd better think again

I could be more accommodating
But somehow it's lost on me
And all this useless talking
About how it's going to be
I'll come along for the ride
And your sad clown company
Baby, you'd better think again

I'd like to apologize
For all my shortcomings now
And sure, I get lonely
But I get over it somehow
I'm not exactly a young girl's dream
'Cause you figured that out by now
So baby, you'd better think again
Hey girl, you'd better think again

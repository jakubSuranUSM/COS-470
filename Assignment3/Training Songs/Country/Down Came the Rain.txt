You told me that you'd love me until the end of time
But you are only human and humans change their minds
You left me without warning and the storm brought me pain
And down down down came the rain
All your love would bring a man so much happiness

That the heavens had to send the rain to divide it up I guess
I stumble through the darkness still calling your name
And down down down came the rain
All your love...

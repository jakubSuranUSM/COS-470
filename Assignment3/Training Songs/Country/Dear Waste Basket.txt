I've been writin' Mary Lou letters every day
But I just found out lately 
How she throws them all away
She don't even bother to read the things I say
So I'm gonna write just one last time
And I'll begin this way
I'll say oh dear wastebasket care of Mary Lou
If you see her say I need her 
Like I'll always do
She won't read my letters 
Now I write to you dear wastebasket care of Mary Lou
No she don't even bother.

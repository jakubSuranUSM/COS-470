Elroy was an old man
And I was only thirteen
But he was my best friend
And he could make a guitar sing

On hot summer evenings
I'd play along with him
Settin' up on his front porch
While the june bugs beat on the screen and I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

The ring finger of his left hand
Was buried out in texas
From the time when his work glove
Got hung in a cotton gin

But it didn't slow him down none
He could play like lightning
He'd fly through a breakdown
And then sit back and grin - when I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

I said "I've been workin' on that lick you played last week
I think it goes like this
He said, "Sakes alive, son, I think you've flat got her down"
Now you can work on this"
And I said

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

Now the years have gone by
I play along with the best now
And owe that old man
For this good life of mine

When his heart was failin'
I flew back home to see him
We set up on his front porch
And I said one last time
Won't you

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

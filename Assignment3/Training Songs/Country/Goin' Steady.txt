Oh, me and my baby are Goin' Steady,
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot, and I'm gonna make her my own.
Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her;
Finders keepers, losers weepers,
She's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
Well, I've been honky tonkin' 'round
Nearly all my life, 
But now I've got a steady babe 
And I'm gonna make her my wife.
All you Rovin' Ramblers can leave her alone!
Don't even try to date her on the phone!
'Cause she's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
 
Well, now, sweet baby, that we're Goin' Steady,
I'll pull up and ask your daddy 
What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
'Cause I love you and you love me,
We're both as happy as we can be, 
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.
We'll get the ring, then be on our way
To see the preacher man,
And when I say: "I do, sweetheart!"
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand
Ev'ry thing's gonna turn out fine,
I'll be yours and you'll be mine,
'Cause you're my baby, you're Goin' Steady with me.

I drive an army jeep, my bumper sticker reads
'Drink 'til he's cute', that's what I'm gonna do
Ain't got no serious thing don't wear a diamond ring
I got a new tattoo, I think you'll like the view
And in my mind the sun shines all the time

('Cause)
I'm just a summer girl I wear my flip flops
When I let my hair down
(That's when the party starts)
(The party never stops)

Who needs a boyfriend, I got my girl friends
When we get together the summer never ends
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Tank tops and cutoff jeans, bikinis and belly rings
We'll make that scene when the DJ plays 'Dancin' Queen'
Fellas, lay your money down we'll let ya buy a round
Don't push your luck, don't get more than your hopes up
In my world day or night, rain or shine

I'm just a summer girl I wear my flip flops
When I let my hair down
(That's when the party starts)
(The party never stops)

Who needs a boyfriend I got my girl friends
When we get together the summer never ends
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Everybody needs a little bit of sunshine
Everybody needs time to unwind
Everybody's got to have a good time
(I'm just a summer girl)

Everybody get up on your feet
Everybody got to shake your body
Everybody got a right to be free
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

('Cause)
I'm just a summer girl I wear my flip flops
When I let my hair down
(That's when the party starts)
(The party never stops)

Who needs a boyfriend I got my girl friends
When we get together the summer never ends
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Everybody needs a little bit of sunshine
Everybody needs time to unwind
Everybody's got to have a good time
(I'm just a summer girl)

Everybody get up on your feet
Everybody got to shake your body
Everybody got a right to be free
(I'm just a summer girl)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

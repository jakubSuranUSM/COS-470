We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run aground like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
We got the kind of love to see us through

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

Found each others arms in troubled waters
Found that that's the safest place to go
From now on we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause the roughest storms just seem to make love grow

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailin', sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We got smooth sailin', sailin'
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth

Just open your window 
On a night like tonight 
No matter which way the wind blows 
Let your heart out to ride 
High above all the care and woe 
In the world down below 
Just open your window 
Then you'll know where to go 
On a big city sidewalk 
All alone in a crowd 
No one listenin' when he talks 
To himself right out loud 
He was somebody's darlin' boy 
She held him close when he cried 
Just open your window 
And let him inside 
You may think that you're dreaming 
You may think you've gone blind 
If your eyes fail to see 'em 
Listen hard and you'll find 
There's a song that the angels know 
Ringin' true every time 
If you open your window 
Let the music inside

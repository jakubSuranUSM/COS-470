(When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there)

When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When you see that moon above don't just stand there
You gotta laugh dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there

When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night
You're not havin' any fun then maybe you ride with the wrong one
When you feel like you're in love hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above all shine brighter
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
[ guitar ]
You gotta laugh dance and sing...
When the moon is shining bright...
You gotta laugh dance and sing...

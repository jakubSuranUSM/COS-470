Sure he gives me everything I ask for a kind of love that I never knew
And every night he comes home at the same time
But he'll never ever take the place of you
He kisses me goodbye every morning does the little things you've always used to do

But no matter how he tries it ain't the same thing
'Cause he'll never ever take the place of you
So don't try to see me when you come back to town
I finally found myself up straight so please don't drag me down

I'll be good to him I'll make him happy I owe him so much what else can I do
And our little boy already calls him daddy still he'll never ever take the place of you
No he'll never know oh that I still love you so
And he'll never ever take the place of you

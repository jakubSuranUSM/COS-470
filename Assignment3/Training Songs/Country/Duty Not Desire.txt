When my lips get kissed it's just from force of habit
For a long long time I've known what's going on
His pretending hasn't fooled me for a minute
And it's duty not desire that brings him home

My heart is a foot stool he uses and he only takes advantage of my love
The woman in me he abuses cause it's duty not desire that brings him home
[ piano ]
Oh does he think I'm such a fool that I don't notice
The changes that have taken a place in him
Where once there was pession now there's coldness
And the love once burning bright now burns so dim

My heart is a foot stool he uses...
Yes it's duty not desire that brings him home

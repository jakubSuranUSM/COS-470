I can’t believe your lips are touchin’ mine
After all the hurt and all this time
But I believe that sometimes losers win
Yesterday just passed my way again

I should have known the tears I made you cry
Would never mean we’d really say goodbye
Tonight sweetheart we’re back were we began
Yesterday just passed my way again

They say you can’t turn back the hands of time
But tonight I’m holdin’ the hands that once were mine
And you’re lovin’ me as if the world might end
Yesterday just passed my way again
Yesterday just passed my way again

Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
It's heartbreak hotel.

Oh well, baby
I've been so lonely, baby
I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely I could die.

Although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom.

Oh well, I've been so lonely, baby
I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely I could die.

Well, the bell hops tears keep flowin'
The desk clerks dressed in black.
It's been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.

I've been so lonely baby,
I've been so lonely,
I've been so lonely I could die.

Well now, if your baby leaves you,
You got a tale to tell.
You take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel.

Well, I've been so lonely baby,
I've been so lonely,
I've been so lonely I could die

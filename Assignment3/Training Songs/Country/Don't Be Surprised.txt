I've known all alone that you had leavin' on your mind
My sign of questions have been answered by the look that's in your eyes
Any day now you'll come to me and I know just what you'll say
First you apologize say that you expect the words and then walk away

Don't be surprised if I don't look surprised when you say goodbye
Don't be takin' by surprise but you expect the absence of tears in my eyes
Any day now you'll come to me...

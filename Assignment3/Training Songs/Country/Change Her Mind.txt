Mornings closing in on me, how can I face another dawn?
My life lost all meaning, the minute she was gone
I begged and I pleaded, I done all a man can do
I've tried everything lord, now it's time I turned to you

I know you can move a mountain, take the stars out of the sky
You can send down a rainbow, you can even turn the tide
Once you even made a blind man see, changed the water into wine
I need a miracle, please Jesus, would you change her mind?

When she was here beside me, lord you know how good it was
Who have ever thought back then I could have lost her love?
Now I'm standing here a broken man, I can't make it by myself
I may not be worthy lord, but won't you get me through this hell

I need a miracle please Jesus would you change her mind?

Now when I was young my 
Momma read me nursery rhymes beside my bed
Though they sounded mighty fine they made no sense to me
Now that I am all grown up it seems my nights have changed such
So I went out and made me up a nursery rhyme for me

[Chorus]
It goes bar light bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may wish I might 
Find someone to hold me tight
Hey diddle diddle a man with a fiddle and the
Girls sings along with the tune
Just a one more dance til you turn off the lights and 
You can shut down this saloon

Well I never understood 
How a big ole gal could raise no kids in a shoe 
And any old jack that goes jumping a candle 
Needs to find something better to do
Rub a dub dub 3 men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky tonk nursery rhyme 
And it's the only one I'll sing

[Chorus]

Well I never understood 
How a big ole gal could raise no kids in a shoe 
And any old jack that goes jumping a 
Candle needs to find something better to do
Rub a dub dub 3 men in a tub sure sounds kinda funny to me
So I made up a honky tonk nursery rhyme 
And it's the only one I'll sing

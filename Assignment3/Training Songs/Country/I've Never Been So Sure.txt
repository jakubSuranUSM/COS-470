I see the questions in your eyes:
"Is this love I feel?"
I don't need to wonder why,
I just know it's real.

So where do we go from here?
How do I make it perfectly clear?
I've never been so sure.
My heart knows you're gonna be the one.

Love's never felt like this before.
I've never been so sure.
Ooooh.
I don't know where this road's gonna take us,

Or what tomorrow might bring.
I just know that we're gonna make it,
'Cause I've got a heart full of dreams.
And there's nothin' it can't do,

As long as you got me and I got you.
I've never been so sure.
My heart knows you're gonna be the one.
Love's never felt like this before.

I've never been so sure.
Instrumental break.
There's not a doubt in my mind:
This love will stand the test of time.

I've never been so sure.
My heart knows you're gonna be the one.
Love's never felt like this before.
I've never been so sure.
I've never been so sure.

My heart knows you're gonna be the one.
Love's never felt like this before.
I've never been so sure.
To Fade.

I've never been so sure.
My heart knows you're gonna be the one.
Love's never felt like this before.
I've never been so sure.

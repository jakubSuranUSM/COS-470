My granddaddy was a miner, but he finally saw the light 
He didn't have much, just a beat-up truck and a dream about a better life 
Grand mama cried when she waved goodbye, never heard such a lonesome sound 
Pretty soon the dirt road turned into blacktop, Detroit City bound 
Down that hillbilly highway 
On that hillbilly highway 
That old hillbilly highway 
Goes on and on 

Now he worked and saved his money so that one day he might send 
My old man off to college, to use his brains and not his hands 
Grand mama cried when she waved goodbye, never heard such a lonesome sound 
But daddy had himself a good job in Houston, one more rollin' down 

that old hillbilly highway 
That old hillbilly highway 
That old hillbilly highway 
Goes on and on 
On and on, on and on 
Here it goes

Granddaddy rolled over in his grave the day that I quit school 
I just sat around the house playin' my guitar, Daddy said I was a fool 
My mama cried when I said goodbye, I never heard such a lonesome sound 
Now I'm standin' on this highway and if you're going my way 
You know where I'm bound

Bound that hillbilly highway 
On that hillbilly highway 
That old hillbilly highway 
Goes on and on 
Hmm, yeah that's the road I'm on it

Hillbilly highway 
Hillbilly highway

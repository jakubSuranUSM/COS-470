He keeps a spit cup wedged 'tween the dash and the windshield
Wore out spot where his hand lays in the wheel
Fourteen years of back and forth
Of work and church and honey do's

He's a hardhat hammer swiggin' won't hear him wine
Kick some butt, wrap it up, crack a beer high five
God-fearing son of pride and strength
That's exactly what he's turned into

He'll fight tooth and nail for his family
Give the shirt off his back for a friend in need

[Chorus]
So let's all raise a glass to the guy who never asked
Any praise for a job well done
All the blood, sweat, and tears standing tall no fear
It's long overdue
Here's to the American man

Flies the stars and stripes on a pole in the front yard
Picture of his wife and kids as a bookmark
To keep his place inside the good book
The words he believes and lives by

He's gonna make mistakes like anyone
But he's gonna make it right 'fore the day is done

[Chorus]

So let's all raise a glass to the guy who never asked
Any praise he just gave
All the blood sweat and tears
He stood tall no fear

[Chorus]

This songs for you
The American man
The American man

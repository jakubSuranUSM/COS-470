The coffee's all gone and my eyes burn like fire
It's way past the hour when most folks retire
You said that you'd call me but you haven't yet and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigarette you're down to the last chance you'll get
For you're out there somewhere with someone you've met
And I'm down to my last cigarette

I can't leave this room you might call while I'm gone
The minutes seem hours soon will be dawn
And with every minute I give more upset and I'm down to my last cigarette
I'm down to my last cigarette

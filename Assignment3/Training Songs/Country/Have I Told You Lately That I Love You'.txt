Have I told you lately 
That I love you
Could I tell you 
Once again somehow
Have I told with all my heart 
And soul how I adore you
Well darlin' I'm telling you now

My world would end today 
If I should lose you
I'm no good 
Without you anyhow
This heart would break in two
If you refuse me
Well darlin' I'm telling you now-ow

Have I told you lately 
How I miss you
When the stars 
Are shining in the sky
Have I told you why 
The nights are long
When you're not with me
Well darlin' I'm telling you now

My world would end today 
If I should lose you
I'm just no good 
Without you anyhow
This heart would break in two 
If you refuse me
My darlin' I'm telling you now-ow

I swore that I was living free.
Oh, you couldn't talk to me,
And the pride that kept me, didn't want no company.
Early morning subway train,
Feeling lost and running late,
Well, he held the car, and he gave his seat to me.

I can't find nothing feels so fine as loving 
A good hearted man.
He can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man.

I told him that he'd better go
Cause I was crazy and impossible,
That my love was broken, my dreams had run off wild.
But patient as the easy rain,
He never turned away,
Calling, "Hey sweet woman, you know you're not a child."

There just ain't nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man.
He can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man.

Good hearted man, now the night makes sense,
Because your tenderness is sheltering me.

So I'm trading in that hothead kid
For a woman I can give to him.
It ain't easy, but I'm gonna do the best I can
For that good hearted man.

There just ain't nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man.
He can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man.
And I'm grateful, got to say thank you 
To a good hearted man.

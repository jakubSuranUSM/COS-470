Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad 
And cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams 
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music 
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
But thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
And if I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music 
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

It's guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music 
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

Yes Lord, it's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

Tonight we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I never let you go
So won't you say you love me I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go
So won't you please be my little baby say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now ooh

I'll make you happy baby just wait and see
For every kiss you give me I'll give you three
Cause since the day I saw you I have been waiting for you
You know I will wait for you till eternity
So won't you please be my little baby say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now

So won't you say you love me

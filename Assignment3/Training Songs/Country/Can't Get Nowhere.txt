Wade in the water about half way up
Baby said whoa that's far enough

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere
Can't find my way from here to there
Can't get started can't get nowhere

You're a fast ball baby inside curve
I'd take a swing I ain't got the nerve

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

Takes me all night must be somethin' wrong
Just to do what I used to do all night long

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

Six-foot-four five-foot-one
Have to stand her on a chair just to get things done

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

There was a time I used to get on down
Now I can't seem to get off the ground

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

Takes me all night must be somethin' wrong
Just to do what I used to do all night long

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

Oh me oh my oh you what's a poor boy gonna do
Oh me oh my I can't get started and I don't know why

Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere
Can't get nowhere can't get nowhere

Can't find my way from here to there
Can't get started can't get nowhere

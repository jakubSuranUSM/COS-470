Just about a mile off-a one-oh-nine,
There's a little church sittin' back in the pines.
I promised that girl she was gonna be mine;
I wouldn't be surprised if she was standin' there cryin'.

Chorus:
Wo-ah, I didn't know this bored-out Ford could go so slow.
Wo-ah, You got to put your foot down on the floor,
'Yeah we've been rocking all night, now, don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road.

Billy's passed out in the back, But I think he's alive.
Bobby's got his head hangin' over the side.
Here we are doin' only ninety-five.
What's the matter with you, man? I thought you said you could
drive!

(Chorus)

Verse3:
Sweeter than the dew on a honeysuckle vine,
Hotter than noon on the Fourth of July,
Cutest little girl that I ever have known
Waitin' at the church on Cumberland Road.

(Chorus)

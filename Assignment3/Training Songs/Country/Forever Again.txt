I wish I could step out of my mind
Then I could be someone that's never known you
But I can't change the way I am much less the way you feel
Or you'd be loving me forever still

I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again

If I had a way of changing time
I?d stay busy turning back the pages
If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you
And you'd be loving me forever too

I can't stop the winter from turning into spring
Or summer giving way to autumn winds
But if I could take the world and make it face the other way
Then you'd love me forever again, you'd love me forever again

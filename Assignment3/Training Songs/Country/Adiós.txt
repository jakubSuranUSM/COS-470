Ran away from home when I was seventeen
To be with you on the California coast
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
Out on the California coast

Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose
Adiós, adiós

We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adiós, adiós

Going up north where the hills are winter green
I got to leave you on the California coast
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than the California Coast

Our dreams of endless summers
They were just too grandiose
Adiós, adiós

And I'll miss the blood red sunset
But I'll miss you the most
Adiós, adiós
Adiós, adiós
Adiós, adiós

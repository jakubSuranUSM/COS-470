I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do

Well I can't sleep nights because I'm restless
And I don't know what to do I feel so helpless
And since you've been away I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do

Well my nights have been so lonely my days have been so blue
I don't know how I stand it but I do
Each night I sit alone I tell myself
That I would fall in love with someone else
Well I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do

Well I guess I'm wasting time

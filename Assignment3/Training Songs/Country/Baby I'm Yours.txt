Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry in other words until I die
Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines

Yours until the poets run out of rhymes in other words until the end of time
I'm gonna stay right here by your side do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in this world can drive me away cause everyday you'll hear me say
Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountains crumble to the sea
In other words until eternity baby I'm yours

I'm gonna stay right here by your side
Till stars fall from the skies baby I'm yours
Until the rivers all run dry baby I'm yours
I'm yours until I die baby I'm yours

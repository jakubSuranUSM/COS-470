Without a warning, you're outta control
The ground shakes and the oceans roll
This is the big one, there's no way to run
On the Richter scale of romance
You hit twelve and you don't stand a chance
This is the big one, I'm fallin' in love

Now it's beat, beat, beat
My heart's sending out a message
Please, please, please don't save me tonight
S.O.S. in this situation means she's outta site
No need to panic I tell myself
But I never felt this feeling with anybody else
This is the big one I'm falling in love

Now it's beat, beat, beat
My heart's sending out a message
Please, please, please don't save me tonight
S.O.S. in this situation means she's outta site
No need to panic I tell myself
But I never felt this feeling with anybody else
This is the big one I'm falling in love

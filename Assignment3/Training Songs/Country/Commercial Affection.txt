I was lonely I guess, the night that we met
In a tavern down on old Broadway
And there were tears in her eyes
And she whispered a sigh
Stranger, please take me out of here

But it was only commercial affection
'Cause a fool and his money will part
Yes it was only commercial affection
But she walked away with my heart

I stood in disbelief as she hurried off
To meet another fool down on Broadway
Now many nights have come and gone
Still the echo lingers on
Stranger, please take me out of here

But it was only commercial affection
'Cause a fool and his money will part
Yes it was only commercial affection
But she walked away with my heart

He left a letter for you by the door
Just saying "Goodbye, I don't love you no more"
He made you feel like you weren't worth anything
But if you were mine girl I'd have everything

[Chorus]
Your touch, your kiss, your tenderness
Your blue eyes burning with fire
Your heart and soul when he let them go
He left a lot to be desired

What was he thinkin' was he out of his mind
How could he walk away how could he be so blind
No I'll never understand why he gave you up
He was one lucky man when he had your love

[Chorus]

He left a lot to be desired

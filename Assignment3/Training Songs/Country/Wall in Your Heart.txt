I feel your pain
I feel the rain
What happened to you
I can't get to you
Cause there's a wall
In your heart

That no one can get through
And it's cold and it's dark
And you don't have a clue
But this wall it will fall
If it's the last thing I do
I'll get through this wall in your heart

I know your soul
I know I'm home
Just come here to me
I'll let you run through me
Cause there's a wall
In your heart

That no one can get through
And it's cold and it's dark
And you don't have a clue
But this wall it will fall
If it's the last thing I do
I'll get through this wall in your heart
We'll break down all the troubles we have found
And I'll find a way to mend your broken pieces

We'll hold hands and be friends
Until the end and our love will be forever
But there's a wall
In your heart

That no one can get through
And it's cold and it's dark
And you don't have a clue
But this wall it will fall
If it's the last thing I do
I'll get through this wall in your heart

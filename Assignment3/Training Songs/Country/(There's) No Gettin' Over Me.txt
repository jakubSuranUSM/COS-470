Well you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling
There's ain't no getting over me
Well you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling bass run up
There ain't no getting over me
I'll be the bill you forgot to pay bass run up
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no

Don't you know
You can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling
There's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling lead, bass run up
There ain't no getting over me

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
So you can walk out on me tonight

If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling
There's ain't no getting over me
You'll see sweet darling
There's ain't no getting over me
No no no no No Darling
There ain't no getting over me

Oh
No darling
There ain't no getting over me

Oh darling
There ain't no getting over me

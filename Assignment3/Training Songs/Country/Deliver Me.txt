They followed him for seven days
And lost him when he turned away
From where they thought
He would surely go
But they caught him up in Lewistown
And when they shot that convict down
They could hear him
Praying soft and slow

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me
Deliver me
I'm lost and alone
And I wanna come home

She was just a simple girl
Been a step behind a changing world
Ever since the day she was born
So she found herself a city gent
He loved her for a while and then
She cried as he walked out the door

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me
Deliver me 
I'm lost and alone
And I wanna come home

You been using and you been using
All your precious time
No use crying
You've been trying to stay ahead
Of what you left behind
You oughta stop trying
I've been here for oh so long
Only barely holding on
To everything I always thought was true

But all my diamonds turned to dust
There's nowhere I can place my trust
Someone has the answer
But I don't know who

Deliver me
Let your waters wash over me
Deliver me
I'm lost and alone
And I wanna come home

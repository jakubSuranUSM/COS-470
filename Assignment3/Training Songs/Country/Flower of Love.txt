Well that ain't a gonna be as long now as it has been
I got a feelin' that me and love are in tune
And that ain't a gonna be as long now as it has been
Some wilt the flower of love that's waitin' to bloom

Sunshine and laughter just over the hill all I got to do is fly
Someone is waitin' true love to give waiting over on the other side
Well that ain't a gonna be as long...

Sunshine and laughter...

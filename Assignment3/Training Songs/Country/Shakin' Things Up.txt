I've been told, better safe than sorry
And to look before I leap
To think about what I should say
Long before I speak
Well, I'm tired of holding back my true emotions
I can't help but cause a little commotion

I like shakin' things up
I like pushing the boundaries
I like living my life on the edge
And chasing farfetched dreams
I'm gonna feel young when I grow old
I'm gonna challenge the status quo
When being good just ain't good enough
I like shakin' things up

I've been know to aim too high
And sometimes I've missed my mark
But I'll never know how far I can go
Until I go too far
I believe in moderation
But once in awhile I need a celebration

I like shakin' things up
I like pushing the boundaries
I like living my life on the edge
And chasing farfetched dreams
I'm gonna feel young when I grow old
I'm gonna challenge the status quo
When being good just ain't good enough
I like shakin' things up

I like shakin' things up
I like pushing the boundaries
I like living my life on the edge
And chasing farfetched dreams
I'm gonna feel young when I grow old
I'm gonna challenge the status quo
When being good just ain't good enough
I like shakin' things up

I like shakin' things up, yeah
I like shakin' things up

Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you
Well darlin' I'm telling you now

My world would end today if I should lose you
I'm no good without you, anyhow
This heart would break in two if you refuse me
Well darlin' I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately how I miss you
When the stars are shining in the sky
Have I told you why the nights are long 
When you're not with me
Well darlin' I'm telling you now

My world would end today if I should lose you
I'm just no good without you, anyhow
This heart would break in two if you refuse me
My darlin', I'm telling you now

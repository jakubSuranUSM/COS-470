Every single morning before I wake up lonely
I feel you here beside me but I know it's only
A fading shadow, an illusion
Every little thing reminds me of you
Every shining colour has a shade of you in it
I was blind but now I see it

If I could only have a day
In the shelter of your arms
Or just an hour, I would pay
Any price to be where you are
And if it got down to a minute
That'd be precious time
â€˜Cause a second's all I need to tell you
Losing you is gonna take a life time for me

Every other night I still dream about you
Every song I hear has a sound of you in it
And I can't believe that it's over
There were many things that I should have told you
And there were many times when I could have done so
But I know baby that it's too late

If I could only rearrange the hands of time
I'd make it up to you, I'd make you change your mind

If I could only rearrange the hands of time
I'd make it up to you, I'd make you change your mind

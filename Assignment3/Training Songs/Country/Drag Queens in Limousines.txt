I hated high school, I prayed it would end
The jocks and their girls, it was their world, I didn't fit in
Mama said, "Baby, it's the best school that money can buy
Hold your head up, be strong, c'mon Mary, try"

I stole mama's car on a Sunday and left home for good
Moved in with my friends in the city, in a bad neighborhood
Charles was a dancer, he loved the ballet
And Kimmy sold pot and read Kerouac and Hemingway

Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in

Charley and I flipped burgers to cover the rent
And Bourbons at happy hour for .35 cents
One day before work we got drunk and danced in the rain
They fired us both, they said
"Don't y'all come back here again"

Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in

My dad went to college, and he worked for the state
He never quit nothing and he wanted me to graduate
My brother and sister both play in the marching band
They tell me they miss me, but I know they don't understand

Sometimes you got do
What you gotta do
And hope that the people you love
Will catch up with you

Yeah, drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
Poets and AWOL marines
Actors and bar flys
Writers with dark eyes
Drunks that philosophize

We might disagree
Sometimes it's just you
Sometimes it's just me
We can't break the chain
So we must bare each other's pain

It's the livin', the dyin'
The life and the cryin'
That brings us together again
Woah again 

Brother to brother
It's time that we all understand that we are
Brother to brother
So why must we make it so hard?
There will always be more
To bring us together than to ever
Keep us apart
As long as we stand
Brother to brother

There's a world breaking down
And god only knows how long it will go round
If love don't survive
There'll be nothing left here
To keep us alive

Don't take it for granted
The seed has been planted
To heal all the hurting inside

Brother to brother
It's time that we all understand that we are
Brother to brother
So why must we make it so hard?
There will always be more
To bring us together than to ever
Keep us apart
As long as we stand
Brother to brother

The road's so long and life's so short
For us to lose our way
We've come this far
There is no other way

Brother to brother

Brother to brother
It's time that we all understand that we are
Brother to brother
So why must we make it so hard?
Brother to brother
It's time that we all understand that we are
Brother to brother
So why must we make it so hard?
There will always be more
To bring us together than to ever
Keep us apart
As long as we stand
Brother to brother

The livin', the dyin'
The life and the cryin'

Don't take it for granted
The seed has been planted

Brother to brother
You are my brother
Brother to brother
You will always be my brother
Brother to brother
You are my brother

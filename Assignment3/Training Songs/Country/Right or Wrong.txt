RIGHT OR WRONG

(Keith Sykes)

You don't ever worry where I've gone
When I'm not at home
I'm the lonely one
You don't talk about it
In the way what you use to say
Couldn't be undone

Is it right or wrong
Baby I can't tell
A lot of people do it
And they do it so well
Right or wrong
Baby I don't know
It's the only thing I think about
Wherever I go

You don't ever ask me where I've been
When I'm coming in
You're not concerned
I could be sleeping all around
All over town
I think it's time I learned

Is it right or wrong
Baby I can't tell
A lot of people do it
And they do it so well
Right or wrong
Baby I don't know
It's the only thing I think about
Wherever I go

Is it right or wrong
Baby I can't tell
A lot of people do it
And they do it so well
You don't love me
And I tag along
Baby can you tell me
Is it right or wrong

Is it right or wrong
Baby I can't tell
A lot of people do it
And they do it so well
Right or wrong
Baby I don't know
It's the only thing I think about
Wherever I go

Right or wrong
Right or wrong
Right or wrong

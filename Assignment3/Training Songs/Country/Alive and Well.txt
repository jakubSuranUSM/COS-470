I wish my love for you
Could die the way that your love did for me
I wish that I could lay to rest
The memory of how good it used to be
If I could, I'd take a gun
Aim it at the past and shoot to kill
Instead I lay here every night
And all my love for you is still:

Alive and well
And in the best of health
Although it's been through hell
Since you left, it hasn't shown one sign of giving up
It still won't let me love nobody else
My love for you is still alive and well

I didn't know that love
Could ever live this long all by itself
And keep on feeling just as strong
As it was feeling on the day you left
In this cold and lonely bed
The memory should die just from the chill
But it stays warm inside my heart
'Cause all my love for you is still:

Alive and well
And in the best of health
Although it's been through hell
Since you left, it hasn't shown one sign of giving up
It still won't let me love nobody else
My love for you is still alive and well

Since you left, it hasn't shown one sign of giving up
It still won't let me love nobody else
My love for you is still alive and well

My love for you is still alive and well

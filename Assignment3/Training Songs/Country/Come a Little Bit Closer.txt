In a little cafe just the other side of the border
She was a sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way she belongs to bad man Jose
And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer you my kind of man so big and so strong
Come a little bit closer I'm all alone and the night is so long

So we started to dance in my arms she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist the one a little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say "Vamos, Jose's on his way"
And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer

Then the music stopped when I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say man you know you're in trouble plenty
So I dropped my drink from my hand and through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear her say to Jose
Come a little bit closer

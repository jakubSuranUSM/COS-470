The moon is full but my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July

Your bags are packed and not a word is spoken
Guess we said everything with goodbye
Time moves so slow when promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up down on main street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
Looks like spring and feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up down on main street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

The moon is full but my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July

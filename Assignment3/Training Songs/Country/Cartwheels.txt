I'm beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar
Would you believe that we were happy once

True like an answered prayer
You were mine, and we were rare
Now I fight to find what's left of us

I give, I give, I give you never take
I bend, I bend, I bend so we won't break

I've been doing cartwheels anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels

Bright as a sparkler light
I write our names across your night
It's only me who sees it fade away

Into shame that I can't keep you honest
Blame that you don't even want this
Love is not enough to make you stay

I give, I give, I give you never take it
I still, I still, I still believe we'll make it

So I've been doing cartwheels anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels, oh

After everything I've done you still run and disappear
Maybe all I've got is hoping I can show you how it feels

So I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels, oh

I've been doing cartwheels anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels

I'm beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar

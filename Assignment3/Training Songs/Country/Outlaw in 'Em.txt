It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey, and water, and to wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
But it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with the quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em (Hmm)

When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
When you're backed against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
Yeah, that rebel fights inside of you

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with the quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Oh
Ooh

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Huh, everybody got little frontman swagger
Stone cold rollin' like a young Mick Jagger
A new tattoo that you can't keep hidden
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, yeah
Oh
Ooh
I said, everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, aw

I can see it in your eyes
Hear it when you speak my name
It's been comin' on so long
But you're not the one to blame
Stayin' longer than was in your heart
Just to keep from hurtin' me
You hid your feelin's very well
It took me long enough to see

Six years ago 
I took you for my wife
Our savin' everything
You gave me your life
My best was all I could offer you
You needed more, I know
You coulda done better 
With someone else
But you never let it show

You were all I had left
And now you're leavin' me too
I'd like to say
Don't go away
All that I had left, 
Left with you

You know a man can always tell
When his love's growin' cold
And the woman lyin' next to him
In his arms so cold
Rememberin' the man she once had loved
Who she could never doubt
Rememberin' how it use to be
And what it's turned to now

You were all I had left
And now you're leavin' me too
I'd like to say
Don't go away
All that I had left, 
Left with you
Honey, all that I had left 
Left with you

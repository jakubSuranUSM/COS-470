I was raised by the good book
Learned to work hard every day
Thought that if you can't say something good
There's nothing good to say
And I caught on pretty early it's no use to work
No harder than you play
So I guess that's how I ended up this way

[Chorus:]
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace
Is a place I keep finding myself
Yeah I get a little crazy trying to have a little fun
Then I end up back where I started from
Down on my knees, I pray
Oh Lord let me see another day
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace

Well I give everything I got, try to give more than I take
For Heaven's sake I keep on smiling
No matter what comes my way
And I may be passin' out on Friday night
But come Sunday I'll be passing the collection plate

[Chorus]

Yeah I know I'm a sinner, but I've got faith
Oh my good side is what he's gonna see
When I'm standing at them Pearly Gates
He'll have nothing but mercy for me

[Chorus]

Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace

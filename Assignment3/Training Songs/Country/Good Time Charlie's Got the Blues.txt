Everybody's goin' away
Said they're movin' to LA
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town's a waste of time
I guess they're right, it's wastin' mine
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Ya know my heart keeps tellin' me
"You're not a kid at thirty-three"
"Ya play around, ya lose your wife"
"Ya play too long, you lose your life"
I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
But everybody's leavin' town
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
(whistling to end)

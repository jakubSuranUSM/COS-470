Dear me
I'm writing this letter to try and tell myself
It's time for me to feel better

Dear me
How could I turn away when he needed me?
Now all that's left to say is,dear me
Oh,what have I done?

Oh,and dear me
He's my only one
If he could see me now
Sitting here all alone

If he could read these words
Would he run back home?
Dear me

Dear me
Do you really mind?
You're the friend
Who will take the time to hear me

Oh and all the plans we made
If he'll take me back
I'd do anything to make him stay
Oh dear me

We'll start all over again
Oh,and dear me
I hope he'll stay to the end
If he could see me now

Sitting here all alone
If he could read these words
Would he run back home?
Dear me

Dear me
We'll start over again
Oh,and dear me
I hope he'll stay to the end

If he could see me now
Sitting here all alone
If he read these words
Would he run back home?
Dear me

Dear me
You know I need him near me
You know I love him,dear me

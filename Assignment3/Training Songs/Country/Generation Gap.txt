When you see a little baby sittin' on his mama's lap
Well it's just the beginnin' of a thing called the generation gap
It's not the difference of age now everybody's talking bout
It's all those no-no's that make up the generation gap
Well the grown-ups go out now to parties and get stoned
But that's somethin' they won't talk about around the children at home
But they ain't foolin' anybody now cause the kids are gonna find it out
It's just another reason for the thing called the generation gap
The generation gap is a mighty mighty big hole
You ain't gonna fill it up with all the lies bein' told
Wa wa wa you'd better clean your house
If you expect to narrow the generation gap

Wa wa wa wa wa wa
Daddy says that drinkin' is a sin that we'll have to pay for
Well then what's that liquor bottle doin' in the dash of his car
And who's the man that calls mama everytime that daddy's out
Now do you still wonder why we still have the generation gap
The generation gap is a mighty...
Now do you still wonder that we got the generation gap
Wa wa wa wa wa wa a wa wa wa wa wa

Stumbled across an old green box in my granddaddy's house
Inside was a cross, some old dog tags, and a picture of when he was shipping out
So I showed it to him, said, "tell me about those days."
When he looked inside, he closed his eyes all he could say was

"I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, Omaha Beach and her crashing waves
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who were willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they brought us boys back home."

Those were words to a boy that became a man, now I'm ankle deep in this Persian sand
And every day I'm giving all I can because I'm damn proud to be American
Yeah, I made some friends, and I've lost some too
When I think about what they gave for me and you

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who are willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they bring us boys back home

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who are willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep you safe from harm, until they bring you boys back home
Till they bring you boys back home, till they bring you boys back home

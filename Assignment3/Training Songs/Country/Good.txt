I was a waitress in a barroom no future in sight
And he was just lonely when he came there that night
Then someone played the jukebox and he asked me to dance
And when he softly held me I thought he's my chance

To be good like I want to be that's what is all in me
Not just a girl from the wrong side of town
Good like I used to be he brought it out in me
And that's when I promised that I'd never let him down

Now I'm back here in a barroom a waitress again
The good world I've lived in just came to an end
For temptation comes easy to a woman like me
And regardless of my chances I know that I'll never be

Good like I used to be I guess it's just not in me
With all my heart how I wish I could have been
Good like he wanted me but good is what I'll never be
And now I know that he's gone for good

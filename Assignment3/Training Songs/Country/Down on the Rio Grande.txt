I remember the palm trees swaying
Cross the river the sweet music playing
Down on the Rio Grande

Out on the levee with the full moon above me
A Mexican lady, Lord how she loved me
Down on the Rio Grande

Laugh and singing in the warm night air
Loving that woman with the raven hair
We were down on the Rio Grande

Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be
Down on the Rio Grande

Endless highways and wide-open spaces
Children smile with their sun burned faces
Down on the Rio Grande

All the love that my lady was giving
Was the sweetest part of living
Down on the Rio Grande

And if these memories could take me there
I'd be loving my woman with the raven hair
I'd be down on the Rio Grande

Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be
Down on the Rio Grande
Down on the Rio Grande

Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be
Down on the Rio Grande

Down on the Rio Grande
Down on the Rio Grande

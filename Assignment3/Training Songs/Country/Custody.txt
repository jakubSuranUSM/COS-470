Today dear you've heard a real grown up word
When you've heard the judge say custody
So little darling how I'd try before saying goodbye
To explain what that word means to me

(Custody) custody means coming home at night
To the emptiest house in this lonely world
(Custody) and custody is just a picture in my valise
And it's all that I've got left to my little girl
(Custody) and custody means no more carryin' a sleepin' princess
To her bed at the end of the day
(Custody) and custody means that no more little girl
With this great ? will ask me to kiss her tears away
Little angel don't cry now you can smile if you try
You're going with mama so kiss daddy goodbye

(Custody) and custody means no more pretty little helper in blue jeans
Follow me around when I cut along
(Custody) and custody means no more frightenin' little girl in my arms
Durin' a thunder and a lightnin' storm
(Custody) and custody means that this day ends just before it really begins

(Custody) and custody means a fight between grownups that little girl never wins
Little angel don't cry you can smile if you try
You're goin' with mama so kiss daddy goodbye

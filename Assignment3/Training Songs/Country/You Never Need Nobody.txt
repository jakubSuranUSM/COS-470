You never need nobody
You never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You could break a heart, in your sleep
Yeah the way you move, makes a grown man weak
They all knock at your door
Saying please, please, I can’t take no more

You never need nobody
You never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You could calm a storm with your tone
And the way you sing, makes the mocking bird h'
The grass you walk on, gives way
Saying please, please, come back this way

You never need nobody
You never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

Give me your hardest fever
Loudest scream in the crowd
Darling these good times
Can’t change, the way I feel bout you now
Give me your hardest fever
Loudest scream in the crowd
And all of these good times can’t change
The way I feel bout you now

Now I know you got that smile
And the way you can drive a man half wild
I won’t dance around this no more
I’m the only one you should smile for, yeah

You never need nobody
You never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

You never need nobody
You never been alone
And I try to get your affection
And all I ever do is wrong

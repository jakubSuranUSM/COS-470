Well listen dear I think it's clear we need to sit and talk
Seems you've got this notion I've been having second thoughts
Well I must confess in a way I guess that silly notion's true
Cause every second you're not here with me I think of you
Every second every minute every hour of every day
Every second there's a thought of you that comes my way
So if you ask if I have second thoughts I guess I'd have to say
Every second every minute every hour of every day

Now I propose we drink a toast and turn the lights down low
Put our favorite music on and hold each other close
Don't worry dear you'll always be here in my heart to stay
Every second every minute every hour of every day
Every second every minute,
Every second every minute I love you more and more each day

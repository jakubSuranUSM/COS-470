The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
The sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you?
Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me?
Always to sail

The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Oh, come to my rescue
Oh, come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

The sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish
You were mine again, my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
The sea of heartbreak

The sea of heartbreak
Yeah, the sea of heartbreak
Mm, sea of heartbreak

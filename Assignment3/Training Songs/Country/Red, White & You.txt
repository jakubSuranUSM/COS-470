I ran out, nothing else matters
You and me and the Georgia natives
Look around 'cause it don’t get any better
Have you ever felt so alright
Let's dance, take it slow, Tom Petty on the radio
When we're singing about Aamerican girls like you
When I look in your eyes, all I wanna do is

Bang bang, baby, like the Fourth of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don’t give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red white and you
Peel off those colors, babe
Tell me you’re gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red white and

You pulling me a little bit closer
Heart beating like a big bass drum
We spinning on a roller coaster
A free fallin' into your yum yum 
All the bad girls rockin' those cut off jeans
And good old boys driving big machines
And you can kiss my ass, can’t help but say
It’s good to be “born in the USA”

Bang bang, baby, like the Fourth of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don’t give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red white and you
Peel off those colors babe
Tell me you’re gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red white and you

Maybe, sweet potato pie
All I need is red white and
Baby, what we're gonna do
Honey, I don’t give a damn about the summer time blues
All I need is

Bang bang, baby, like the Fourth of July
A lightning strike in the midnight sky
Don’t give a damn about the summertime blues
All I need is red white and you
Peel off those colors babe
Tell me you’re gonna stay
American girls making dreams come true
All I need is red white and you

Baby, baby
All I need is red white and
You
Don’t give a damn about the summer time blues
All I need is red white and you

I wonder why so many times that made my teardrops fall
Made up my mind to try to find the answer to it all
I learned that love is fickle and it mostly turns out wrong
Love isn't worth a nickel till the right one comes along
That's love away and fickle fortune's spreadin' round and round
One day you're way up on top and next you're on the ground
Oh love will find your ups and downs and this one's happyend
I'll pick me up I'll trust me off and bounce right back again
I'll pick me up I'll trust me off and bounce right back again
[ steel ]
And now you're gone and I'm alone and somehow the way I feel
It's hard for me to realize our love was never real
But I'll give love another chance like someone said to do
I'll try again and maybe then my next love will be true
That's love away...
That's love away...

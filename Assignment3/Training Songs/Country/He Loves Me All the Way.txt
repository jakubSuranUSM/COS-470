Sometimes when he comes home I'm cookin' breakfast
I haven't slept a wink all night long
I've been layin' in bed thinkin' like a woman
Wonderin' if my man's been doin' me wrong

To think he might be out with another woman
Makes my temper rise with jealousy
But all these years I've never caught him cheatin'
I guess he needs some time away from me

But when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me
There's nothin' left for me to say-ay
Oh when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me
He loved me all the way-ay

I'm not ever gonna worry about tomorrow
As long as he makes everything alright today-ay
I'd rather wonder a little and have his lovin'
'Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way

When he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me
There's nothin' left for me to say-ay
Oh when he lo-oves me, he really lo-oves me
He loved me all the way-ay

I'm not ever gonna worry about tomorrow
As long as he makes everything alright today-ay
I'd rather wonder a little and have his lovin'
'Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way
'Cause when he loves me he loves me a-all the way

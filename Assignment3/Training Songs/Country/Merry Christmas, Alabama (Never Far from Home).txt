Merry Christmas, Alabama
Merry Christmas, Tennessee
Merry Christmas, Louisiana
To St. Barth's and the Florida Keys

Merry Christmas, Mississippi
Where I started this wild and crazy run
Such a long way from that first birthday
Merry Christmas, Everyone

And Merry Christmas, Colorado
Though far from you all I have roamed
"Tis the season to remember
All the faces and the places that were home

"Tis the season to remember
And to count up all the ports of call I've known
And to thank his mercies tender
For I'm never far from home

Merry Christmas to my saints and guardian angels
Who protect me as I roam
All the faces and the places that were home

Guess my life's moved at near light speed
Since I started this wild and crazy run
Such a long way from that first birthday
Merry Christmas, Everyone

"Tis the season to remember
That we're never far from home

Merry Christmas, Everyone

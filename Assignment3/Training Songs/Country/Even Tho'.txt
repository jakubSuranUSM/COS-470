Even tho' you took the sunshine out of my heaven
Even tho' you took the twinkle out of my eye
I will always be in love with you my darling
Even tho' I sit and wonder if I'm wise

Since the day that you first told me that you love me
I have been head over heels in love with you
Now you say our little romance has to end dear
Now I walk the floor and wonder what I'll do

Even tho' you took the sunshine out of my heaven
Even tho' you took the twinkle out of my eye
I will always be in love with you my darling
Even tho' I sit and wonder if I'm wise

There was a time when in my heart I didn't doubt you
Now I'm never sure of what you say or do
For every time, I try to put my arms about you
Something tells me that you're not the same old you

Even tho' you took the sunshine out of my heaven
Even tho' you took the twinkle out of my eye
I will always be in love with you my darling
Even tho' I sit and wonder if I'm wise

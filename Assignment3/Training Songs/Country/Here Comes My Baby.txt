In the midnight moonlight hour
He's walking along that lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you
Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try
You'll never walk alone
And you're forever talkin' on the phone
And I try to call your name
But every time it comes out the same
Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try
Here comes my baby
Here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my baby
Here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love
That's oh so fine
Never to be mine no matter how I try

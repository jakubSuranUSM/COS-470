Been one tough week
Dead on my feet
But I've made plans for tonight
When I'm feeling blue
Know just what to do
And how to make it right
Seems like this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember

Dim the lights
Lock the door
Spread your pictures on the floor
Blow the dust off of our past
Let it all come flooding back
Cause it ain't easy being strong
And when I can't forget your gone
I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

Sad ain't my style
But once awhile
I just have to give in
Cause a women like you
Is so hard to lose
You just don't want it to end
I know this can't go on forever
So tonight Ill have a night to remember

Dim the lights
Lock the door
Spread your pictures on the floor
Blow the dust off of our past
Let it all come flooding back
Cause it ain't easy being strong
And when I can't forget your gone
I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

Oh it ain't easy being strong
And when I can't forget your gone
I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

Here comes more tears to cry
Here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby, back again
Here comes more misery

Here comes old memory
Here comes my baby, back again
My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby, back again

She's sorry once again once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby, back again
My arms are open wide
Here comes my baby, back again

Low down leaving sun, I've done
Did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see
I'D best be leaving well enough alone
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Them keep a-haunting me in memories
There's one in every crowd, for crying out loud
Why was it always turning out to be me

[Chorus: x2]
Where does it go,the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For loveable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

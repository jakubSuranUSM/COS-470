I guess we've walked a million miles together hand in hand
We'd climb steep Rocky Mountains a happy woman a happy man
We'd thought our love would go on forever side by side
But here we stand like strangers at the great divide
We've loved our way to the top of life the rest was all down hill
The rough times seem behind us and our dreams were all fulfilled
But we found out sometimes love grows old and I think our love just died
But here we stand like strangers at the great divide
Now you'll take a high road I will take the low
But who'll take the baby cause we both love her so
Divorce is not the answer now but we've got too much pride
So here we stand like strangers at the great divide
So here we stand like strangers at the great divide

Burgers and fires and cherry pies it was simple and good back then
Walkin' in the sand hand in hand never thinkin' that it could end
Makin' our love with the moon above at the drive-in picture show
And it was burgers and fires and cherry pies in a world we used to know

Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
Oh the things we used to say little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before
Well it was burgers and fires

Well I'm still the same ole me that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same ole you
We lost something down the line and I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do
It was burgers and fires

Oh it was so simple back then

Start at my toes, 
For this is where the evil grows
My legs are sharp, might split your skin
And spill the juice that feeds your grin.

Take to walking up my spine,
See my love drip down like spit wine
And then I'll take your jewels in my bag 
And take 'em home to mama.

I'll put your jewels in my bag 
And take 'em home to mama.
Take the slaughter to the lamb
Take the hung to the ham and back

Take the neck to the crack and pow
How does it feel, 
Whatever you get you steal
And I'm bored here, rooted to the floor

And what I want you just can't buy anymore
So I'll collect your jewels in my bag 
And take 'em home to mama.
I'll put your jewels in my bag 

And take 'em home to mama.
I want some push to my shove, 
But your hand is in my glove
And I'm mad, bad, ripped raw and bleeding

Swinging like a beef hook on the hips of hell,
And the stains on my boots say my life is going well
To snap your skinny neck in two
Would be the least that I could do

So I'll collect your jewels in my bag
And take 'em back to mama.
I'll put your jewels in my bag
And take 'em home to mama.
Stop at my bones, 

For here my evil made its home
For this is where the evil grows [Repeat: x8]

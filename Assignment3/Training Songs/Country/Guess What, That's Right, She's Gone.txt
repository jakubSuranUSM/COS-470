My blood pressure worked no normal my temperature started to rise
A cold chill's a comin' all over and tears are fillin' my eyes
Guess what that's right she's gone
The days will turn into weeks the weeks will turn into years
And I'm turnin' into a block of stone I can't see for my tears
Guess what that's right she's gone

The train left town this morning guess who waved goodbye
A cute little trig in a bridal red dress and a man with a little bowtie
My mind is spinnin' in circles I'm about to go insane
Like a fool I'm a runnin' down the railroad track I'm tryin' to stop that train
Guess what that's right she's gone

The train left town this morning
Guess what you're right she's gone guess what that's right she's gone

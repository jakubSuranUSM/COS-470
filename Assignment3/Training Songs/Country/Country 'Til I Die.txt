I got an invite to a Saturday night
Shindig way up town
You know old John likes to have his fun
I couldn't turn a party down

The band was playing some highfalutin music
I'd never heard before
Everybody there seemed to like it a lot
But I was headed for the door

Then somebody had the nerve, to call in orderves
Like something from a real bad dream
On my dish was a little piece of fish
Some rice and three green peas

I've never had a taste for the social graces
The way some folks do
I've got problems, doctor can you solve 'em
Would you give me a clue

He said I can't treat a man in your condition
As he looked me in the eye
All I see, is John you'll be
Country 'til you die

[Chorus:]

Country 'til you die
Every bone in your body is countrified
It runs in the family, and you can say that with pride
It's in the way you look, the way you walk and talk
Down to the truck you drive
You're just gonna be country 'til you die

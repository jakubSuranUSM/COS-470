Darlin' you're tired 
I can see in your eyes 
I know how you feel 
We've been together 
Too long to conceal 
What's in our hearts 
Maybe we should part 
But after so many years 
That would only bring loneliness 
Sorrow and tears 
And anyway... 

I never would 
Never could 
Never will ever kill what's between us 
So let's try again 
We'll start a brand new dance 
Between old friends 
 
There will always be days 
When it don't seem to pay 
When it just doesn't rhyme 
Well, that's bound to happen 
Some of the time 
Our best days aren't gone 
We don't need to move on 
Well, maybe we should try 
But I don't think you could take it 
And neither could I 
And anyway... 

I never would 
Never could 
Never will ever kill what's between us 
So let's try again 
We'll start a brand new dance 
Between old friends 
 
Darlin' come here 
Love's not disappeared 
You're just feelin' low 
Well, let me tell you my darlin' 
That's a feelin' I know 
It don't mean too much 
We just got out of touch 
Well, it's easy to change 
'Cause lovin' you's not too hard to arrange 
And anyway... 

I never would 
Never could 
Never will ever kill what's between us 
So let's try again 
We'll start a brand new dance 
Between old friends 
 
We'll start a brand new dance 
Between old friends 
Yes, we'll start a brand new dance 
Between old friends

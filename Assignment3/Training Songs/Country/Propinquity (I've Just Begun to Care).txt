I've known for a long time
The kind of girl you are
Of a smile that covers tear drops
The way your head yields to your heart
Of things you've kept inside
That most girls couldn't bear
I've known you for a long time
But I've just begun to care

I've known of all the heartache
And I've known of all the pain
I've seen you when the sun shines
And I've seen you when it rains
I've seen you make a look of love
From just an icy stare
I've known you for a long time
But I've just begun to care

I know I've been blind 
To not have loved you all this time
But the image of you wasn't clear
I guess I've been standing too near

Oh, it's taken me a while
But I have finally found
What you are to me
And that's what really counts
And what you are to me
Is something we can share
I've known you for a long time
But I've just begun to care

Oh, it's taken me a while
But I have finally found
What you are to me
And that's what really counts
And what you are to me
Is something we can share
I've known you for a long time
But I've just begun to care

Yes, I've known you for a long time
But I've just begun to care

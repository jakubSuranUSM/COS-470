I'm a pretty big man around this town
I got me the hottest little Chevy around
Sweet little '66

She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back
But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black
Sweet little '66

She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66

Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79
Then he went into the army so now she's all mine
Sweet little '66

I used to run her down on river road, make a little dough
Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low
Oh, me and my '66

She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66

Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil
But she was built by union labor on American soil
Sweet little '66

Oh, when your Subaru is over and your Honda's history
I'll be blastin' down on back road with my baby next to me
In my sweet little '66

She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66

She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
And those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66

My sweet little '66
My sweet little '66
My sweet little '66

This is where the summer ends
In a flash of pure destruction,
No-one wins

Goin' nuclear
Nuclear

Violets in my eyelids goin' red
Sentimental geek
Shut up and go to sleep, oh

The calm, the beach and the remains
Of the bathing suit and Porsches all in flames

Goin' Nuclear
Nuclear

And when I saw her, the Yankees lost to Braves
Sentimental geek
Sentimental geek
Sentimental geek
Shut up and go to sleep

Give me an answer
Give me an answer
Give me an answer
Give me an answer
Give me an answer
Give me an answer

Way up in the sky, moon and planets fly
Comets streak and shooting stars fall down
I'm just sitting here sipping on my second beer
And doing my star gazing on the ground
Where all those heavenly bodies come out at night to play
Heavenly bodies that just take my breath away, yeah baby
I'm gonna sit here from now until closing time
Just working on making your heavenly body all mine
Pretty blondes walk by, sexy smiles say hi
But how's a man to choose the one that's right
Then my eyes saw you and my body knew
That I just found my angel for tonight
Where all those heavenly bodies come out at night to play
Heavenly bodies that just take my breath away, yeah baby
I'm gonna sit here from now until closing time
Just working on making your heavenly body all mine
Just working on making your heavenly bodies all mine

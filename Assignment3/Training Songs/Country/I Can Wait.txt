In the blink of an eye 
Stars'll fall from the sky 
No one even notices 
If you think it'll help 
I can walk out myself 
And we won't have to go through this 
If I pretend to hold you tight 
And out on the highway late some night 
That's all right 
If that's all that it takes 
Even if my heart breaks 
Darlin' I can wait 

I have nothin' but time 
And this poor heart of mine 
Probably could use some rest 
When the ghosts are all gone 
You can leave your light on 
Shinin' through the loneliness 
Just like a beacon in the night 
Brighter than any star in sight 
But that's all right 
For as long as it takes 
For that mornin' to break 
Darlin' I can wait 
 
Out where the mountains meet the sky 
Feelin' so lonesome I could cry 
But that's all right 
Cause all the signs say 
You'll call me someday 
Darlin' I can wait

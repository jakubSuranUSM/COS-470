She's been here working all summer long
Pumpin' gas for the boats on the cote blanche
She's so brown, from being in the sun all day
The boys from town, hang around her pa-paw's place
And they all say

Hey you can see her down at the boat dock
Walking up the pier in her flip-flops
Tying up the lines in her tank top
Dipping out the bait at the bait shop
Every boy around would love to say, "That girl's mine"
Summer's gonna end I know
Oh, we gonna miss you so
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline

Won't be long, she'll be going back to school
Going home, all the way to Baton Rouge
Her pa-paw says he'll get along the best he can
And all the boys will be so brokenhearted then
'Til it's summer again

Then you can see her down at the boat dock
Walking up the pier in her flip-flops
Tying up the lines in her tank top
Dipping out the bait at the bait shop
Every boy around would love to say, "That girl's mine"
Summer's gonna end I know
Oh, we gonna miss you so
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline

Hey you can see her down at the boat dock
Walking up the pier in her flip-flops
Tying up the lines in her tank top
Dipping out the bait at the bait shop
Every boy around would love to say, "That girl's mine"
Summer's gonna end I know
Oh, we gonna miss you so
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline
Wish you didn't have to go, Evangeline

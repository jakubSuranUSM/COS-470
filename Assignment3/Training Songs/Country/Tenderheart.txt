There's a tenderheart beating for you
And a worn out man living on an old barstool
He lost everything, but he ain't no fool
'Cause he's got a tender heart beating for you

There's a failed dream and he can't let go
There's a love that haunts him like the holy ghost
He can tune it out, but it still comes through
'Cause he's got a tenderheart beating for you
There's a tenderheart beating for you

There's a tenderheart beating for you
Never loved another, never was untrue
So do you stay in place?
Do you let it move you to a tenderheart beating for you?
There's a tenderheart beating for you

There's a tenderheart and it's beating for you
And a worn out man living on an old barstool
He gave up everything, but he ain't no fool
'Cause he kept a tenderheart beating for you
There's a tenderheart beating for you

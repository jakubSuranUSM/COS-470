I heard about her from a friend of mine 
He said she lived across the county line 
The sweetest grape that ever grew on the vine 
And now that's where I'm spending all my time 
Her Daddy, Robert and her Mama, Ruth 
They had a daughter they named Bobbie Sue 
And now she's eighteen and she knows the truth 
Nobody's gonna tell her what to do

Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bobbie Sue 
Can't, can't you see my love is true 
I want to ma-ma-ma-ma-marry you 
Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bobbie Sue

I'll take her driving on a Friday night 
Straight down the highway in the clear moonlight 
My Chevy's humming as she holds me tight 
We'll find a preacher and we'll do it right 
Her Daddy told her that she'd have to wait 
Her Mama said don't make a big mistake, 
But we'll keep driving till we're out of state 
And when they find us it'll be too late.

Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bobbie Sue 
Can't, can't you see my love is true 
I want to ma-ma-ma-ma-marry you 
Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bobbie Sue (Repeat)

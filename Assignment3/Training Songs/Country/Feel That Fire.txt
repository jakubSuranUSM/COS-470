She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the crackerjack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo

She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
'N drive around in my truck with no place to go

But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
And someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
And someday's she only wants a break
Hey but she wants what she wants, but man I know I know I know

She needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
Yeah, feel that fire

So as long as there's a breath to take
A smile to share, a prayer to pray
A chance to hold her hand to fan the flame

She's gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
A real desire, does she know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
Oh feel that fire
She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the crackerjack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo

I remember when I was a little girl
Growin' up livin' in my own little world, so it seemed
I had my dolls and dreams
Momma was always there to comfort me and give me love
And there wasn't nothin' quite like it in the world that I knew of

Before I knew it I was standin' in my teens
Sweet little boy with his strong young arms holdin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
"I never felt nothin' like this"

So I went and asked momma, "Can you tell me what it means?"
She said, "You're in love and that's every little girl's dream?
"Baby, what you found is every little girl's dream"

So I said, "Momma, does love ever last?"
She said, "Worry about now and let the future come to pass
Just understand and enjoy what you've found
And listen to it as long as your heart hears the sound of love?

?There ain't nothin' quite like it in the world anybody knows of"
So there I was, all through my teens
Same little boy with his strong young arms lovin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Ooh, it like to drove me crazy and I remember sayin'
"I never felt nothin' like this"

And I remember sayin' to momma, "I know just what you mean
I'm in love and that's every little girl's dream
What I found is every little girl's dream"

And I found mine and momma said
"Me too, baby, once upon a time
Lifts you up, it lets you down
There'll be another dream to bring you back around

There's somethin' about the first time
That keeps you rememberin'
You found every little girl's dream
Every little girl's dream

Found every little girl's dream
(I remember the first time I felt his kiss)
I found every little girl's dream
(I remember sayin', "Nothin' ever felt like this")

I found every little girl's dream
(I found someone and I fell in love)
I found every little girl's dream
(Nothin' in the world quite like it anybody knows of)
I found every little girl's dream

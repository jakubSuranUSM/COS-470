Well I used to be the kind of guy that didn't love a lot
I took all the love they offered me with ease
And it didn't make much difference if they loved me or not
'Cause I'd love them for a while then I'd leave

Yeah and I can't believe it's really me, hurting like I do
Just because you've left me all alone
I've seen it happen many times 
To other guys I knew
Surely I must be somebody else you've known

Well when I first met you, darling 
You impressed me more than some
I should have take the warning way back then
But I never stopped to think that, 
That even my day had to come
And like the other guys 
That I'd want you back again

Yeah and I can't believe

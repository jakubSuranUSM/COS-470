Blacktop's burning, heat waves rise
Pick up my shove, l put my back to the grind
Got another job in Flagstaff and this one's paid

I work the freeway, the pays all right
But I can't get you off my mind
'Cause every stretch of highway ends the same

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go, whatever I do
All road lead to you

The boss said one more mile to go
The last one always goes so slow
If I could just turn off my mind I'd be all right

But I keep wondering what went wrong
Whose holding you now that I'm gone
There's not a minute that goes by you don't cross my mind

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go, whatever I do
All road lead to you

The sun's getting to me
I think I see you in every car that passes by
No way around it I'll always love you
Any fool can read the signs

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go, whatever I do
All road lead to you

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go whatever I do
All road lead to you

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go whatever I do
All road lead to you

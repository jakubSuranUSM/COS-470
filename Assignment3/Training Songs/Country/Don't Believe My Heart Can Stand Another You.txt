Don't believe my heart can stand another you
I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true.
So go your way I've had enough 
The game you play is just to rough.
I don't believe my heart can stand another you.

Of all the people in the world to be standing at my door
Telling me she left me, you know the one I left you for
I sat down and thought it over now I've come to this conclusion
Don't believe my heart can stand another you

I've tried every way I know to put you out of myself
I've been as far down as my knees 
But so far it has been no help
And with you already here what I must say get complicated
I don't believe my heart can stand another you.

Don't believe my heart can stand another you
I need someone who'll be gentle, kind and true.
So go your way I've had enough 
The game you play is just to rough.
I don't believe my heart can stand another you.

I don't believe my heart can stand another you.

I'm dirty as a man hole cover
I'm lookin for my long lost lover
She turned me out and now I'm sinkin'
I'm just so easily led when the little head does the thinkin' 

I'm talking with a tight red sweater
I'm feelin' like Eddie Vedder
Only twice as cool when she starts winkin'
I'm just so easily led when the little head does the thinkin' 

I'm loyal as a dog but I'm a hog for that sexual attraction
It starts up in my mind and makes a bee line below the belt
No consequences just satisfaction 

Baby in my heart I'm faithful
This two headed monster is so distasteful
Forgive me when my instincts start stinkin'
I'm just so easily led when the little head does the thinkin'
I'm just so easily led when the little head does the thinkin'
Think about it... 

Forgive me if my instincts start stinkin'
I'm just so easily led when the little head does the thinkin'

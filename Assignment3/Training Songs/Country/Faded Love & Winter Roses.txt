Faded love and winter roses
Always bloom in memory
Faded love and winter roses
Yearning hearts that used to be

Will they meet again tomorrow
Where we parted yesterday
Give me back the winter roses
And the love you took away

Faded love and winter roses
Sprinkled with a lonely tear
Faded love and winter roses
Still recall each yesteryear

Will I always be a dreamer
Dreaming of the used to be
Faded love and winter roses
Live and die in memory

Your pretty brown eyes your wavy hair
I look for you, you're not there
I got it bad like I told you be fore
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet
I got it bad like I told you be fore
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
Won't you come on home
Just come on home
I'm so crazy about you, I can't live without you
Baby won't you come on home
Your pretty brown eyes your wavy hair
I look for you, you're not there
I got it bad like I told you be fore
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet
I got it bad like I told you be fore
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more

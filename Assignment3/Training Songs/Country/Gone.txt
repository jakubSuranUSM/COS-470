That'll be me you'll see walking away
That'll be me you'll see for the last time today
That'll be me you'll see for not very long
'Cause that'll be me you'll see 
That'll be gone

Remember how you warned me
'Bout all your leavin' plans
Well I know this might seem unexpected
So prepare yourself
The best you can

That'll be me you'll see walking away
That'll be me you'll see for the last time today
That'll be me you'll see for not very long
'Cause that'll be me you'll see 
That'll be gone

Think back on when you threatened
And never left no doubt
Although this could be kinda sudden
I'm sure you can figure it all out

That'll be me you'll see walking away
That'll be me you'll see for the last time today
That'll be me you'll see for not very long
'Cause that'll be me you'll see 
That'll be gone

Yeah, that'll be me you'll see 
That'll be gone

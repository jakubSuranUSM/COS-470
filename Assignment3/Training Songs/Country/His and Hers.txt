They’ve got two golden bands
On their left hands
His and hers
And two ropes by the bed
Hand-stitched in red
His and hers
And in the room by the hall
There’s a crib by the wall
Their dreams are about to come true
And two blankets brand new
One pink and one blue
His and hers

They’ve got two sets of friends
They see on weekends
His and hers
Between the work and the kids
Two lives that they live
His and hers
When they lay down at night
They just turn out the light
And they sleep without touching at all
And they stare at the wall
While two sets of tears fall
His and hers

Now they sit in a courtroom
With two sets of lawyers
His and hers
With two stories they tell
Of how it all went to hell
His and hers
And all that husband and wife
Have lived off a lie
That had such a beautiful start
Are two kids torn it apart
And two broken hearts
His and hers

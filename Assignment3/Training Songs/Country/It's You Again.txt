It's you again 
Walkin' through my mind again
In my dreams it never ends
It's always you again

They say all good things must come to an end
Nothin's forever, so they say
But it looks like they left one question unanswered
How can you go and yet still remain?

It's you again 
Walkin' through my mind again
Takin' all my time again
You just won't let go

It's you again 
Always you I'm seein'
In my dreams it never ends
It's always you again

Time after time, I've tried somebody new
Still there's this emptiness inside
I can't find a way to get over losing you
My heart won't let go those memories you left behind

It's you again 
Walkin' through my mind again
Takin' all my time again
You just won't let go

It's you again 
Always you I'm seein'
In my dreams it never ends
It's always you again

It's you again
You just won't let go

It's you again
Always you again

I've traveled this whole world over and now I'm going down to the rainbow's end
No friends no home I'm just a traveling alone on my way to the rainbow's end
I'm weary and tired but I don't care I'm going down to the rainbow's end
From twilight till dawn I'm trudging on and on, on my way to the rainbow's end
They say there are treasures of silver and gold
That's buried down by the rainbow's end
But the treasure I find will bring me real peace of mind
When I come to the rainbow's end
For someone is waiting there all alone so I will know at the rainbow's end
How it feels to be pressed to an angel's breast when I come to the rainbow's end

Lover please, please come back
Don't take that train goin' down the track.
Don't please don't, don't leave me
Don't you leave me here in misery.

You would never hold me so near
You would never call me dear.
Don't you know I'd die for you
Now you're gone and that's what I'll do.

Lover please, please come back
Don't take that train goin' down the track.
Don't please don't, don't leave me
Don't you leave me here in misery.

Well, it's an old, old story, not too long,
About a love that went all wrong.
Girl left the boy, oh so bad
Now she gone and she oh so sad.

Lover please, please come back
Don't take that train goin' down the track
Don't please don't, don't leave me
Don't you leave me here in misery.

Oh, lover please, please come back
Don't take that train goin' down on the track
Don't please don't, no don't leave me
Don't you leave me here in misery.

Lover please, please come back
Don't take that train goin' down the track
Don't please don't, don't leave me
Don't you leave me here in misery.

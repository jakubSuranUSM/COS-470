I was born to a family of jokers
Gamblers and smokers living on the line
I was raised by strong-headed women
Men who tested limits and did a little time

And it ain't a mystery you fell for me
We're just two lost souls trying to find our peace
Love like ours ain't a masterpiece
It's a good day in the sun

I was born to love you
Out where the water is wide
Make me your country bride
You'll be my prince of tides
You were born to heal me
Under a velvet sky
Cattails dancing in the light
We were born to live a long and happy life
A happy life

Yeah, folks like us
We may lie down in darkness
But we don't lose our sparks we bring back a good story to tell
'Cause we grew up around beauty
Sunsets better than a movie
We knew it was our appointed duty to love like the world might end
And to toast to good nights with friends

I was born to love you
Out where the water is wide
Make me your country bride
You'll be my prince of tides
You were born to heal me
Under a velvet sky
Cattails dancing in the light
We were born to live a long and happy life
A happy life
Hey, a happy life

And it comes to me in waves
Like the shores of Palmetto Bay
Knowing I'm so lucky
Your broken heart could love me

I was born to love you
Out where the water is wide
Make me your country bride
You'll be my prince of tides
You were born to heal me
Under a velvet sky
Cattails dancing in the light
We were born to live a long and happy life
A happy life
Hey, a happy life
Happy life

Walkin' off the highway I'd been tryin' to catch a ride hungry and thirsty as a bear
Not a penny in my pockets and I'd ran out of pride
So I thought I'd try to bum myself a beer
When up stopped a wellknown posse starin' down at me
A big old shiny badge pinned on his vest
He said if you ain't got no money and you ain't got no job
Boy I'm placing you under arrest
Or you can get out of town before sundown and don't you never come back
Take your tambourine and your guitar string and move on down the track
Don't like the way that you comb your hair the way you drawl you all
And if you're not out of town before sundown you won't get out of town at all
Well I hitchhiked down to Phoenix I was following the sun
Prettiest place I think I've ever seen I met a sweet young lady but how was I to know
That pretty thing was only seventeen
Then I saw the red lights gleamin' and I heard the sirenes screamin'
A sound that fills the bravest hearts with fear
And that old sheriff didn't stutter when to me those words he uttered
Boy don't let the sun set on you here
You better get out of town before sundown...

It all started at a corner table
Sippin' on a Jack and Coke
When the sun found us the next mornin'

We were actin' like married folk
The weekend, it weakened me
And drained me of my will, you got me

Goin' down hill, you got me goin' down hill
And still I can't get my fill of you

I've spent all my money
I've lost my respect
You got me walkin' in circles, honey

And I'm a nervous wreck
I stay just one step
Ahead of a welfare dollar bill, you got me

Goin' down hill, you got me goin' down hill
And still I can't get my fill of you

And I was voted most likely back in '79
I was headed right to the top
Honey, all I needed was time
But you put some lovin' on me
I swear was so unreal, you got me

Goin' down hill, you got me goin' down hill
And still I can't get my fill of you

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I think about you
From daylight to dawn
I bet I won't weigh fifteen pounds

When they drag my body home
Just like a junkie hooked on dope
I'm hooked on your thrill

Goin' down hill, you got me goin' down hill
And still I can't get my fill of you

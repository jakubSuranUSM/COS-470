Past the Gulf Of Mexico is an island where
I lived and loved a long time ago
Disappointed in love I decided to roam
Sad was the day that I sailed far away from my home

Every dream I dream takes me again
To the island down in the Caribbean
Back to happiness and my Spanish Town home
To the brown skinned girl that's causin' me
To be filled with grief and misery
If she takes me back I will never more roam
Brown skinned girl from Spanish town lives in my heart

I've tried to forget her but how do I start
Constantly she's on my mind both night and day
I've known only sorrow since I sailed away
Let the tide and trade winds carry me
To the girl I want to marry me

I can't live alone just on mem'ries I've known
I'm just like a bird that dosen't sing
Like a seagull with a broken wing
Take me off of this ship let me go home
Brown skinned girl from Spanish town lives in my heart

All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind 
From time to time
I can never be more 
Than a knock on your door
Just a shadow that's gone 
With the sunshine
For you know I'm not free 
And I never can be 
And you're bound 
To get restless in time
All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind

Tonight I shed 
A silent tear 
While lyin' here with you
The sands of time 
Have trickled down 
To just a precious few
You're young and so beautiful 
And I'm so glad I'm here
But the ending is painfully clear

All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
Of someone you had 
To leave behind
Who loves you and needs you 
But never could give you
The ring for your finger so fine
So tonight we'll just borrow 
Each other tomorrow 
We'll find that we've run out of time
And all I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind

For you know I'm not free
All I can be 
Is a sweet memory 
That drifts through your mind

I can see your eyes, staring into mine
But it's a battlefield and you're on the other side
You can throw you words
Sharper than a knife,
And leave me cold in another house on fire,

I, lay low, lay low,
And watch the bridges burn,
I lay low, lay low,
What more could I have done?

Now you only bring me black roses,
And they crumble into dust when they're held
Now you only bring me black roses,
Under your spell

She told me twice,
All her good advice,
But I couldn't see
I was clouded by your lies,
Up in smoke,
A vision she foretold,
She said stay away cause that boy's a warning sign
I, lay low, lay low,
And watch the bridges burn,
Now you only bring me black roses,
And they crumble into dust when they're held
Now you only bring me black roses,
Under your spell.

And I'm done tryin'a be the one,
Picking up the broken pieces
And I'm done tryin'a be the one,
Who says "I love you dear"
But I'm leaving

Now you only bring me black roses
And the crumble into dust when they're held,
Now you only bring me black roses,

But I'm not under your spell,
I'm not under your spell,
I'm not under your spell,
I'm not under your spell,
I'm not under your spell

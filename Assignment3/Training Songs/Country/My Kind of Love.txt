There you go, again and again, baby, startin' with the things that just wouldn't end it
I don't know why we can't get along; when we first started out nothin' ever went wrong

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'

You say you want my love and then you're willing to return it and what you're doin' now ain't about to earn it
'Cause you're driving me mad with your nagging ways and in my kind of love that ain't what pays

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'

It was on my mind both night and day and you better listen now to what I got to say
'Cause I know our love is much too good to be broke up by something misunderstood

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'

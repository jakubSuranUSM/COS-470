Oh my mother
She is a mountain
And her breast
It touch the sky
And my father
He is a river
Running through her
Sweet bye and bye
And my sister
She is a songbird
And she's singing in her flight
And my brother
He is a moonbeam
Failing on her in the night
There is a river
Run through the mountains
Under moonlight
Hear the song
Of the bloodlines
Gone long before me
And ever after… Moving on
Ever after…moving on

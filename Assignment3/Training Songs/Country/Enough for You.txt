I've lived enough to know that love's not everything you need
God knows I know, there are still so many things you want to be
I've seen enough to understand the pain your going though
It's just a shame to know,

I'm not enough for you
It hurts to see the hurt the need,
Your laughter and your light
And try in vain to free the painful secret locked behind your eyes

And I can't even blame for the things, your turning to
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
I've given you the best of everything I had to give

And now there's nothing left for me to leave you,
But my will to live
I hope someday, somebody, somewhere will love you like I do
It's just a shame to know,

I'm not enough for you
Oh, It's just a shame to know
I'm not enough for you

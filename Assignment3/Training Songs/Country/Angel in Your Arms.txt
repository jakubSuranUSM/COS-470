Do you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true?
That just goes to show that you really don't know
While you out beating the town, do you think I'm home just sitting around?
Waiting on you, now who's really the fool?

When I first found out, I heard all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I tried to wait till you got over
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight

I'll just slip around secretly if you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holding on when love was already gone?
The times you said you weren't feeling well, did you think I couldn't tell
You've been with somebody else you were only kidding yourself

When I first found out, I heard all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I tried to wait till you got over
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight

The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in some else's arms tonight

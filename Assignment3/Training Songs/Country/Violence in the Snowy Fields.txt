I'm quittin' and giving up on bein good enough 
My body is bones and blood my heart is pure 
And when the rider comes and tells what I have done 
I'll gladly sing along won't change my tune 
And in the end St. Johns says all things shall be revealed 
Like violence like violence like violence in the snowy fields 
And on a night like this when nothing stirs about
If I hear the hoof beat pounds I will not turn 
I will not be afraid of how I spent my days 
I may go down in flames but I shall not burn 
And in the end St. Johns says all things shall be revealed 
Like violence like violence like violence in the snowy fields
And in the end St. Johns says all things shall be revealed 
Like violence like violence like violence in the snowy fields

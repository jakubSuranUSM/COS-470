She was there when I was nothing
But a young and foolish man;
The clothes the children were
She made with love and just two hands;
She went through hell to have the kids
Because she wanted to;
You can make a fool of a man like me,
If anybody can;
But she did more than you;
She made a fool into a man;
And now you'd take the spice of life;
that's all you want to do;
And I'm so ashamed of how close I came to giving
All she made of me to you.
And, after what she sacrificed
And all that she's endured,
Her hands could hardly look as nice
Or feel as soft as yours;
Her face is lined with loving signs
That I don't find on you;
And I'm ashamed of how close I came to giving
All she made of me to you.

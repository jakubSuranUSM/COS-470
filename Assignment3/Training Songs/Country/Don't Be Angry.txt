Don't be angry with me, you darling
If I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time

Just remember, I'm kind of dumb
I guess like any foolish girl
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine

Now I recall the first time
That you flirted with me, dear
And you jokingly said, "Come and be my bride"

But now the time has turned the pages
Why, it's the sweetest joke on earth
But I have you here forever by my side

And maybe someday you're gonna hurt me
Well, I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell

But in the mean time, well, I'll be loving you
With all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will

So don't be angry with me, you darling
If I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time

Just remember, I'm kind of dumb
I guess like any foolish girl
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine
Yes, my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine

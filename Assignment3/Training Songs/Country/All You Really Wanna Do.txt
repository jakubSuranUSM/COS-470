Take heart
Little sister
You can't wait till you're all grown up
Mama's always sayin' you're not old enough
And all you really want to do is to fall in love.

Take hope
Will you mister
You didn't know it could hurt so much
When a man gets fooled by a tender touch.
All you really want to do is to fall in love

Don't want to feel so blue
Or live in a world so cruel
You don't want to cry 'cause you got a heart so true

All you really want to to is to give it
Find yourself that one in a million
All you really want to do is to fall in love.

The right words
In a whisper
Draw emotion like a knife draws blood
In the arms of the one you're dreaming of
All you really want to do is to fall in love.

Don't want to feel so blue

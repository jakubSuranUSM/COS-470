Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be

I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me

Days and nights go crawling by
Where is the love that I knew?
Everything is wrong
Nothing seems right
Except this longing for you

I've cried and I've tried
What more than this poor fool do?
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me

Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses
Oh, how I'm missing
The things that used to be

I love you, I want you
I need you constantly
If you'll just come back home
I'm begging please
Bring back your love to me

Bring back, bring back
Bring back your love to me
I need your kisses

Well, me and my baby, we're goin' steady
We ain't married, but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot and I'm gonna make her my own
Now that I've found her, I'm gonna keep her
Finder's keepers, loser's weepers
She's my baby, she's goin' steady with me

Well, I've been honkin' tonkin' 'round
Near by all of my life
Now I've got a steady babe
And I'm gonna make her my wife
All you ropin' round her can leave her alone
Don't even try to date her on the phone
'Cause she's my baby, she's goin' steady with me

Well now sweet baby that we're goin' steady
I'll go up and ask your Daddy
What do you think if you and I are wed
'Cause I love you and you love me
We're both as happy as we can be
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me

Well, we'll get the rings and be on our way
To see the preacher man
And when you say, "I do sweetheart"
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand
Everything's gonna turn out fine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
'Cause your my baby, you're goin' steady with me

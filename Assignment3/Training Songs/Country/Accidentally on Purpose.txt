I know this me and you thing
Is a new thing
And I'd be lying if I said this is what I was looking for
I kinda can't stop thinking
That leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now for sure

Maybe I'll oversleep
And miss my flight
My alarm went off at 6:05
But I never heard it
Accidentally on purpose

Maybe I'd lay you with just like this
And give you one more goodbye kiss
And slip those three little words in
Accidentally on purpose

I never thought you'd call
So, I guess it's your fault
I wasn't trying to fall
But you and my heart were making other plans
But here I am crazy about you
Not ready for a day without you
Here I am saying 'what the hell?'
Wide awake telling myself

Maybe I'll oversleep
And miss my flight
My alarm went off at 6:05
But I never heard it
Accidentally on purpose

Maybe I'd lay you with just like this
And give you one more goodbye kiss
And slip those three little words in
Accidentally on purpose

What if I stay?
What would you say?

I know this me and you thing
Is a new thing
But leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now

Maybe I'll oversleep
And miss my flight
My alarm went off at 6:05
But I never heard it
Accidentally on purpose

Maybe I'll lay you with just like this
And give you one more goodbye kiss
And slip those three little words in
Accidentally on purpose

What if I stay?
Accidentally on purpose

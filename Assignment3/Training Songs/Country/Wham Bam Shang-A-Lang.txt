Starry nights and sunny days 
I always thought that love should be that way
But then comes a time when you're ridden with doubt 
You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out
Oh Oh Baby we've been a long long way
And who's to say where we'll be tomorrow
Well my heart says no but my mind says it's so
That we got a love that isn't a love to stay 

We've got a wham, bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe
 
Lookin' at you I wanted to say 
I think a little emotion goes a long long way
But careful now don't get caught in your dreams
Look out baby this is not what it seems
Oh Oh Baby you've been so good to me
But please Don't make it what it's not
Well I thought we agreed on what we need
So listen to me I'll tell you what we've got 
 
We've got a wham, bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe

I think you're seein' what I've been sayin' 
'Cause I hear you singin' to the tune I'm playin'
And now that it's said and we both understand
Let's say our goodbye's before it gets out of hand so
Bye Bye Baby I'd really like to stay
But we'll remember the best time in our life 

We had a wham, bam shang-a-lang 
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe

Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la babe

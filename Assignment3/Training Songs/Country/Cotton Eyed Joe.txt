Do you remember Long time ago
Daddy worked a man called Cotton Eyed Joe
Daddy worked a man called Cotton Eyed Joe

I could have been married long time ago
If it hadn't 'a been for Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn't 'a been for Cotton Eyed Joe

Old bull fiddle and a shoe-string bow
Wouldn't play nothin' but Cotton Eyed Joe
Wouldn't play nothin' but Cotton Eyed Joe

Play it fast or play it slow
Didn't play nothing but Cotton Eyed Joe
Didn't play nothing but Cotton Eyed Joe

Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe

Come for to see you come for to sing
Come for to show you my diamond ring
Come for to show you my diamond ring

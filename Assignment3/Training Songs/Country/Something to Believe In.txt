Something to Believe In
(Andrews/ Neuhauser)

Did you come here for the show
Or to meet someone you might or might not know
It doesn't matter to me
Did you smile your way in through the back door
With a stamp on your hand from the night before?
It doesn't matter to me

'Cause when I open up my eyes
And you're looking at me
I get the feeling that I
Know just what you need
Somewhere to Belong
Something to Believe in

Every day we get up and go
Pack our things in a different town
And head on down the road
We got somewhere to be
People follow as far as they can
I don't pretend that I understand
When they tell me I'm changing their lives
With the songs I sing

'Cause when I open up my eyes
And you're looking at me
I get the feeling that I
Know just what you need
Somewhere to Belong
Something to Believe in

I wish that I could be the one they needed
Every night I pray, asking what to say
To give them
Somewhere to Belong
Something to Believe In

'Cause when I open up my eyes
And you're looking at me
I get the feeling that I
Know just what you need
Somewhere to Belong
Something to Believe in
Somewhere to belong
Something to believe in!

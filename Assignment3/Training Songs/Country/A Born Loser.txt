Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
I find a new love yes I think true love then I find out that she's not mine
I couldn't be so lucky this next time as to find me a love so true
I guess I'll keep on taking chances making love right out of the blue
Well I'm a loser yes a loser born loser every time
Well I'm a loser yes a loser

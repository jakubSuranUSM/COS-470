If you're weary from climbin' mountains and you've been troubled with heavy rain
If you're drinkin' from a fountain that never cleanses your thirsty dream
Then come along and walk with me let's find a keeper of heaven's keys
And when we find him he'll set us free oh come along and walk with me

For every question and every wonder oh there's an answer that satisfies
When your wisdom grows weak from hunger
That's when your soul needs a bread of life
Oh come along and walk with me

All you sisters and all you brothers if we're the children of Abraham
Then let us prove it by telling others about the shepherd who loves his lamb
And come along and walk with me
Oh come along and walk with me

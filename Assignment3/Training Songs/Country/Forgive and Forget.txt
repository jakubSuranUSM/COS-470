When a man cheats on a woman it's understood he's just a man
But when a woman cheats on her man no one forgives
I drove her out into the night with teardrops in her eyes
And only now I realize the fool I've been

Why couldn't I love her and try to understand her
Instead I said things that I regret
Why couldn't I just hold her and say it didn't matter
Why couldn't I forgive and forget

It's not her fault she slipped one time she never was the cheating kind
But when a woman's unsatisfied she's bound to roam
But I got mad I just saw red I never heard a word she said
And what I'd give to have her back here in my arms

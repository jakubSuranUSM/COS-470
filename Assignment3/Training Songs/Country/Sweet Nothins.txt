My baby whispers in my ear
Sweet nothings
He knows the things I like to hear
Sweet nothings

Things he wouldn't tell
Nobody else
Secret baby
I keep  them to myself

Sweet nothings
Sweet nothings

We walk along hand in hand
Sweet nothings
Yeah we both understand
Sweet nothings

Sitting in classroom trying to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet nothings
Sweet nothings

Ah sitting on my front porch
Sweet nothings
Well do I love you, of course
Sweet nothings

Mama turned on the front porch light
Saying come here darling that enough for tonight
Sweet nothings
Sweet nothings
Sweet nothings

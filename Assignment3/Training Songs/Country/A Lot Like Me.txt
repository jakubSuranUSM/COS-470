He was a long, tall stranger from way down south 
Where he'd left his life behind 
He had a big, old Gibson and a pickup truck 
And Shenandoah eyes 
And I remember him sitting in that local bar 
Where I earned my pay each night 
Singing my songs to empty chairs and going home half tight

So the nights rolled by like headlights shining on a lonesome strip of tar 
I kept his word of kindness close to me like a pick on my guitar 
And we talked about the singers and the songs we loved 
And the songs we'd most forgot 
In that run-down bar they'd make last call 
And I'd never want to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I was living on nothing but a young girl's dreams 
With my cowboy boots and my old six-string 
Hitching my wagon to a star
Dreaming of leaving those local bars 
When I'd get him up at closing time 
For a couple of songs and a chance to shine 
Like the star that he longed to be 
He looked a hell of a lot like me

Well, he'd played a lot of places where the only wages were food and beer for free 
No fancy licks, but he had him a gift for the kinds of songs he'd sing 
But you do what you can to be a satisfied man 
Just to have your peace of mind 
So he gave it all up for a government job where the paychecks come on time

So now he comes to the bar to hear me play guitar 
And to share a drink or two 
And we sit swapping tales of where we've been and what we'd rather do 
There's a wealth of dangers when you're talking to strangers 
And I meet them all the time 
But my heart knew better than my head when I looked into those eyes

[Chorus]

Well, maybe I'll quit when I've got me a kid and a place to call my own 
But tonight there ain't nobody there waiting up for me at home 
It's a helluva way to live from day to day 
Not knowing where you're bound 
But the look in his eyes made me realize 
I was glad for the life I'd found

[Chorus]

All your life you've waited for love to come and stay
And now that I have found you, you must not slip away
I know it's hard believin' the words you've heard before
But darlin' you must trust them just once more

'Cause baby goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away
'Cause the things you do my goodbye girl
Will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken, afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me instead of givin' in
But I can wait forever, helpin' you to see
That I was meant for you and you for me 

'Cause goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart you still will have my heart
So forget your past my goodbye girl
'Cause now you're home at last

Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean forever

If there was something I could do
To capture you
I'd do it in a heartbeat
Some little trick that I could try
To catch your eye
I'd do it in a heartbeat
If I had to jump through a hoop of fire
Even that would be as easy as pie
If to fly like a Superman
Would win your hand
I'd do it in a heartbeat

You got a tedious task,
All you gotta do is ask
I wouldn't need a second bidding
If I was printed in the press
As saying "yes" I would not be kidding
If the only thing to keep you from me
Was a slam bam thing with Ali
I'd get pushed around and knocked
Down fifteen rounds
But I'd do it in a heartbeat

If looks could kill
You surely will
Do a hundred and three
If you'd just look at me
And if they locked you up
All the girlies in town
Would be tryin' to tear that
Jailhouse down
But I'd do it in a heartbeat

If you thought I was cute
In a parachute
I'd freefall forty thousand
And if you thought I'd be nice
Hangin' on ice
I'd climb the highest mountain
If I had to jump through a hoop of fire
Even that would be as easy as pie
If to fly like Superman
Would win your hand
I'd do it in a heartbeat
Do it in a heartbeat
Do it in a heartbeat
Do it in a heartbeat

Way down in Sad Town, in the valley of broken dreams
We're both prisoners of past loves and things that'll never be
Somethin' tells me if you held me, the clouds would disappear
We could leave our troubles all behind and nothin' could keep us here

We could soar like an eagle, touch the sky like a dove
We could fly to the top of the world, fly into love
Fly into love

Sunshine all the time is just beyond the hill
True love is waiting there and we can find it still
Your blue eyes are my blue skies, forever is in sight
Let's put our dreams together now and fly away tonight

We could soar like an eagle, touch the sky like a dove
We could fly to the top of the world, fly into love
Fly into love

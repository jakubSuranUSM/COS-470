Feelins' just lead us on till
We know where we're goin' mhmm

If I told you that I loved you
Could we slip away where the lights're low
And if I put my arms around you
And held you close could you tell me no

Well you know that I'd be lyin' if I said
I was a tryin' to let you know I'd go
Let love take me where we've never been before

Feelins' just lead us on till
We know where we're goin' mhmm

You don't know how long
I wanted to have you where you are right now
With you looking soft and pretty
Ain't no telling where we've found

Now here we are together too close
With talkin' I can't tell you no
Yes love take us where we've never been before

Feelins' just lead us on
Till we know where we're goin' mhmm
Feelins' mhmm feelins'

Some people go through life
Never knowing why they're here
They never find someone like you
The moment I touched your hand
And looked into your eyes
I knew what I was meant to do

(Chorus)
I was born to love you
I was born to love you
I was born to love you -

Till the day I die
Sometimes when I'm holding you
It feels just like a dream
And fear cuts through me
Like a night
If I should wake up
What would I do
If you weren't laying by my side

(Repeat Chorus)
I was born to love you
Till the day I die

(Repeat Chorus)

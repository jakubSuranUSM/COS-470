In the mist of all the laughter stop and face yourself
See that mirror on the wall oh foolish one
Tell the image in the glass top do you kidding now
With your life of sin and shame and fickle fun
Fun tonight but in the morning you'll hate yourself for all the wrong you've done
Put down that glass bid goodbye and come on home right now
Don't become a hopeless laid to fickle fun

Out to parties every night a new girl by your side
Can't you see your very life has come undone
You're playing songs upon the strings that lead to loneliness
Countless kisses happy pleasures fickle fun
Fun tonight but in the morning...

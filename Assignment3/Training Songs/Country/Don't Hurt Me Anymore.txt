(Please don't hurt me anymore)
I've walked the streets of loneliness a long long time I know
I've prayed to die a million times because you hurt me so
I didn't think we'd love again the way we did before please don't hurt me anymore
Please don't hurt me anymore don't make me go through what I went through before
Don't make me wonder why I keep knocking on your door
Please don't hurt me anymore
[ dobro - steel ]
Please don't hurt me...
Please don't hurt me anymore

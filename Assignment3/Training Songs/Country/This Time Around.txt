She says I look like a Jimmy Cagney
She makes me feel like cherry wine
I'm gonna take down to the valley 
This time around I'm gonna make her mine 

Theres a place down by the river
Where we go to spend the night
She bites my toes and makes me shiver
This time around I'm gonna do it right
This time around we're gonna do it right 

We took a ride on up to the city
She pulled off an ole dirt track 
I said a-honey now take it easy 
This time around we're gonna take it slow
This time around we're gonna do it it slow 

We came up snake-eyes in our young days
This time around our love can't fade 

She helps me kick when I been a-ridin'
That crazy horse for much too long
She holds me tight when I start to shiver 
This time around I can't go wrong
This time around I can't go wrong 

This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around

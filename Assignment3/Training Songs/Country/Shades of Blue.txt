I know that sometimes I'm difficult
Sometimes I'm crazy
I'm like a storm that keeps blowing your way
And I know it's not fair
I can't think of a reason to hurt you this way

Words I don't mean cause you sadness
Things that I've done to encourage this madness
Made a fool of myself
Love's not supposed to happen this way

Shades of blue covering you
And turning your sunshine to rain
I keep depending on you
To carry me through
And color my shades of blue

How many times will you forgive me
How many storms still lie within me
Say you'll always be there
To pick up the pieces of this broken man

When it's all over the air is so still
I'm left all by myself and this chill that I feel
When I look in your eyes
Love's not supposed to happen this way

Shades of blue covering you
And turning your sunshine to rain
I keep depending on you
To carry me through
And color my shades of blue

I keep depending on you
To carry me through
And color my shades of blue

I, always do what I gotta do
Yeah, every day like a deja vu
Monday, Monday

It's no fun,
There's something that's gotta be done
Can't you see, I just wanna feel
Young, young again

So give me that
One day, one day

Well if you wanna say, hey, take a shot
1, 2, 3, 4, line them up
Well, it's alright, on a Friday night
You don't wanna go home
No, no, no
It's not too late to rock and roll
No, it's alright
You can, get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)
Get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)

So hey, tell me what you're drinking
And I, I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Now, now

It wouldn't be wrong
If you stayed here all night long
Forget about all your 'should do', 'have to's'
Leave them till tomorrow

Well if you wanna say, hey, take a shot
1, 2, 3, 4, line them up
Well, it's alright, on a Friday night
You don't wanna go home
No, no, no
It's not too late to rock and roll
No, it's alright
You can, get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)
Get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)

(Put those glasses in the air!)
(Put those glasses in the air!)

So hey, tell me what you're drinking
And I, I'll tell you what I'm thinking
Now, now.

Well if you wanna say, hey, take a shot
1, 2, 3, 4, line them up
Well, it's alright, on a Friday night
You don't wanna go home
No, no, no
It's not too late to rock and roll
No, it's alright
You can, get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)
Get a little drunk on a Friday night
(Night, night)

(Put those glasses in the air)
(Night, night, night)
Hey, you can, get a little drunk on a Friday night

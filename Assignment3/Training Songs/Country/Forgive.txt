I always said that that'd be it
That I wouldn't stick around
If it ever came to this
Yet here I am, so confused
How am I supposed to leave
When I can't even move
In the time it would've took to say
?Honey I'm home, how was your day'
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And expected me to just forgive?

Well, that's a mighty big word
For such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
?Cause I don't even know now who I am
And it's too soon for me to say forgive

I guess I should ask but I won't
Was it love of just her touch
?Cause I don't think I want to know
So get you some things and get out
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out
Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me right here tonight
When through the fallin' tears you said
?Can you ever just forgive?'

Well, that's a mighty big word
For such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
?Cause I don't even know now who I am
And it's too soon for me to say forgive

Well you know what they say
Forgive and forget, relive and regret

Well, that's a mighty big word
For such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
?Cause I don't even know now who I am
And it's too soon for me to say forgive

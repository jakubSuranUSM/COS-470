I know I promised months ago that I divorce my wife
And you say you're tired of living in this sin
But please be patient and don't leave I'm just too ashamed to face it
For you she stood by me through thick and thin
Just give me one more day and then I'll tell her
That the home she helped me built I tear apart
Just give me one more day and then I'll tell her cause today I haven't got a heart

She should have been the first to know about our love affair
But I just couldn't bear to see her tears
Her love's been built around me and my happiness
Now a fool like me will make it wasted years
Just give me one more day
No today I haven't got a heart

Break my hear-ear-eart - heart's dead broken
Steel me bli-i-ind - money's just a token
The stranger that I loved
Was even stranger than he seemed
The honesty I thought we had
Was some crazy thing I dreamed
Another b-grade movie for life's big silver screen
But the king of hearts, he always takes a queen

Hooh-hooh baby
Hooh-hooh baby
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody takes and takes

Take my love - love's for takin'
Break my hear-ear-eart - a heart's for breakin'
Strangers that we love
Are often stranger than they seem
The honesty we talk about
Is someone's crazy dream
Another b-grade movie for life's big silver screen
But the king of hearts, he always takes a queen

Hooh-hooh baby
Hooh-hooh baby
Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes (every body makes mistakes)
Everybody takes and takes

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes

Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody takes and takes (everybody makes mistakes)
Everybody makes mistakes (everybody makes mistakes)

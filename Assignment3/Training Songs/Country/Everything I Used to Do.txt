Smoked my first cigarette after being quit for years
I waited long enough and they taste so good with beer
Yes, I'm drinkin' again just a little weekend booze
I'm doin' everything I used to do but lovin' you

I've been down to the factory, even got my old job back
Workin' under Junior Moore again, he won't cut us any slack
But it's better than nothing, and it always gets me through
Yes, I'm doin' everything I used to do but lovin' you

Then running into you, seems like old times again
Let's have a drink or two, and you can tell me how you've been
It all seems so familiar that it must be déjà vu
'Cause I'm doin' everything I used to do but lovin' you
Yes, I'm doin' everything I used to do but lovin' you

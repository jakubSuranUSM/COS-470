[Chorus]
His spirit joined and so was formed
Ten thousand years ago
Between the swan and Hercules
Where even dark clouds glow

To live with grace, to ride the swell
To yet be strong of will
To love the wind, to learn it's song
And empty space to fill

Apollo taught me to rhyme
Orpheus taught me to play
Andromeda cast down her sign
And Vega lights my way

Smoke rings in a galaxy
An endless flight through time
Lyra gave her harp to him
And left him free to climb

A winter's journey from the moon
To reach the summer sun
To rise again, to sing for you
A song that's yet unsung

Apollo taught me to rhyme
Orpheus taught me to play
Andromeda cast down her sign
And Vega lights my way

[Chorus]

To live with grace, to ride the swell
To yet be strong of will
To love the wind, to learn her song
And empty space to fill

You and I were lovers all along
We had a good thing going strong and never doubted
Lately, I feel changes comin' on
I know that I will soon be gone and you don't even want to talk about it
Ooh, and it makes me stop and wonder why
People give their hearts and turn around and say goodbye
If there's something on your mind you better say it while there's time
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that morning sky
Ooh, how did we ever come to this
There's nothing for me in your kisses anymore
Late nights in the kitchen I'm pretending I still care
But we both know there's nothing there
And you just keep on starin' at the door
Ooh, and it makes me stop and wonder why
People give their hearts and turn around and say goodbye
If there's something on your mind you better say it while there's time
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that morning sky
Ooh, and it makes me stop and wonder why
People give their hearts and turn around and say goodbye
If there's something on your mind you better say it while there's time
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that morning sky
You and I were lovers all along
We had a good thing going strong and never doubted
Lately, I feel changes comin' on
I know that I will soon be gone and you don't even want to talk about it
Ooh, and it makes me stop and wonder why
People give their hearts and turn around and say goodbye
If there's something on your mind you better say it while there's time
'Cause I'm leavin' when I see that morning sky
See that morning sky

Found myself in a barroom, 
Doin' things I ought not to, 
Watching life as it slowly passed me by, I was holding on to lovers, 
And disregarding others with my lies, 
Living my whole life like this, 
I guess is risky business, 
Some folks say that I won't last too long, 
And I can't say I blame them, 
For saying what they're saying, 
'cause right now I'm just holding on.

I'm just an old dancehall dreamer,
Living my life in the past,
I keep holding on to dreams and them slow moving trains,
And I don't know how long I can last.

So I called out to Jesus, 
Said Lord I really need you, 
You've got to carry me for a while, 
I've been running too long, 
Singing these old tired songs, 
As the wheels keep pourin out the miles, 
Like I said I'm just a dreamer, But I've gotta' keep believing, 
Someday things will go my way, I'm just running from the devil, 
I've got one foot on the pedal, 
The other one's  laid up in the grave.

[Repeat: x2]
I'm just an old dancehall dreamer,
Living my life in the past,
I keep holding on to dreams and them slow moving trains,
And I don't know how long I can last

Keep holdin onto dreams and them slow movin trains..
And I don't know how long I can last
Hey I'm just an old dancehall dreamer

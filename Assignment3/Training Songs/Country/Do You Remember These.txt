Saturday morning serials 
Chapters one through fifteen 
Fly paper, penny loafers, and lucky strike green 
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, "Pepsi, please"

Ah, do you remember these? 

Cigar bands on your hands 
Your daddy's socks rolled down
Sticks, no plugs and aviator caps, with flaps that button down 
Movie stars on Dixie cup tops and knickers to your knees

Ah, do you remember these? 

The hit parade, grape truaide, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Peddle pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy doody
Tootie fruitie
The seam up the back of her hose

Ah, do you remember those? 

James dean, he was "keen", Sunday movies were taboo 
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock 'n roll was new
Cracker jack prize
Stars in your eyes
"ask daddy for the keys" 

Ah, do you remember these? 

The boogie man, lemonade stand and taking your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls
You're out! 
Cigarette loads and secret codes and saving lucky stars 

Can you remember back that far? 

To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats 
Mums the word and dirty bird and double root beer float
Moon hubcaps and loud heel taps and "he's a real gone cat" 

Ah, do you remember that? 

Dancing close, little moron jokes and "cooties" in her hair 
Captain midnight, ovaltine, and the whip at the county fair 
Charles atlas course, Roy Rogers horse, and "only the shadow 
Knows"

Ah, do you remember those? 

Gables charms, "froggin" your arm, loud mufflers, pitching woo 
Going steady, veronica and betty, white bucks and blue suede shoes 
Knock, knock jokes 
Who's there? 
Dewey 
Dewey who? 
Dewey
Remember these
Yes we do! 

Oh do we?
Do we remember these!

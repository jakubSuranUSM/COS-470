We were barely seventeen
Two kids with the grown up dream
Of a perfect love 
Foolin' round in my first car
Careful not to go too far
That's how it was.

We had a simple wedding
You looked beautiful in white
And I recall your mother's blessing
On our wedding night.
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

We moved into a commission house
It wasn't much and it wasn't ours
But we had plans
I worked nights and you worked days
And twelve months seemed to slip away
Like an avalanche

I came home one morning
Found your note pinned to the door
Saying if this is a perfect love
I don't want it any more
But I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

I was back in town just passing through
Catching up with friends we knew for old times sake 
In a crowded lunch time bar
I turn around and there you are
Face to face

And for the sweetest moment
A smile came to your eyes
So I whispered as you walked away
With the new man at your side
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.

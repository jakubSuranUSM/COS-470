I've been telling you, so you ought to know
What will happen unless you forgo

The pulsing sun reverses the propellers
On the Cessna plane
It falls into the jungle and is swallowed by the rain

Week after week, the monkeys watch the fallen sons decay
Trying to get through the windows to the
Chocolate on their face

When psychologists write a book on this
And sell it, it becomes
A cartoon animated broken wire model
Of pterodactyl bones

But I've already seen the picture; it filled me with belief
So I head into town with my sack full of silver
Which is gonna buy me grief

I've been telling you, so you ought to know
What will happen unless you forgo

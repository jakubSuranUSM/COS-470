Wait'll I get you down on the farm?
For a little fresh air and these lovin' arms
City lights made your heart so tough
You just haven't been loved enough

Country girls got a way of their own
Know how to love till the cows come home and then some

And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before

And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then some

When I get you way out here
We'll take a little ride on the old John Deere
Stop by the creek where the corn grows tall
You won't wanna go back at all

Country girls got a mind of their own
Wanna be loved till the cows come home and then some

And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before

And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then some

And then some

And then some moon will shine
And then some stars will find you
Feelin' like you never felt before

And then city boy, you'll see
How sweet love is gonna be
'Cause you'll be in some and then some

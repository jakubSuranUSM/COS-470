[Jim:]
Fools
Never learn
You play with fire
You're gonna get burned.

[Helen:]
You
And I are fools
We play with love
We're gonna get burned.

[Both:]
Fools
That's what we are
Fools
We've gone too far, I know but then.

Love
You come to me
Your eyes on fire
You're tempting me
Love
Knows no bounds
Beggar or King
It'll bring you down.

Fools
Find out some how
Fools
We get stung now I know but then
Love
This I know
Fool I may be
I can't let you go.

Love
This I know
Fool I may be
I can't let go
Fools.
Fools.
Fools.
Fools...

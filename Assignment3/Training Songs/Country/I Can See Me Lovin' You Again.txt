I can see me lovin' you again
And payin' any price to get back in
And even though you'll hurt me now and then
I can see me lovin' you again

I remember all we had together
And all the love we had before the fall
And even if I live with pain forever
Lovin' you just once was worth it all

For even once is one more time than never
And even if this hurting never ends
There'll always be the chance to make it better
For I can see me lovin' you again
I can see me lovin' you again

Billy's standing out by a west Texas highway
With his thumb in the morning air
He's spent 18 summers in the dust of Odessa
Never getting nowhere
But he got him a misspelled cardboard
Of Albuquerque standin' in the breakdown lane
He ain't lookin' for a ride so much as he's looking for a

Yeah a change
Even for the worse, it would be better somehow

Looking for a change, yeah

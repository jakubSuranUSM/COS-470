Activity killed you
When are you gonna burn
Half of the things that you knew
In your body were wrong?

I wanted to be friends with you
Now I have come to find
It was mistaken in passion.
Nobody was wrong

And I believe you

They said down in London
Had to be hard to keep hating yourself
When these people are
So well behaved

You did time in Duncanville
Part of you's living there still
In a hole where the souls
Of the lost kids are saved.

And I believe you

When you said happiness is all you wanted
You said this is all you wanted
How I miss
You almost made it
Happiness

All of your good friends
All of the people I'd meet
Keep a list of the things
In this world that we trust

You are here and after
Referred to as someone who
Gave it a shot, gave it up
Left a cruel world to us

And I believe you

When you said happiness is all you wanted
You said this is all you wanted
How I miss
You almost made it
Happiness

You won't get nervous
You won't come down
You won't feel helpless
You won't be around anymore

You won't be around anymore [Repeat: x6]

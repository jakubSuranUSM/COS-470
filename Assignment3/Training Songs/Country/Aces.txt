Well my old friend said to me
That I ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well I don't know it could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me can't you see
I would never want to do what it
Seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I 
Wouldn't play

Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away
The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel underminded and hurt again

Now don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything
You start
You can't deal me the aces and think I
Wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away

And I guess I said I couldn't see
How thing's could turn out like they've
Come to be
And if I lied and if I knew
Well I was only trying to think of you

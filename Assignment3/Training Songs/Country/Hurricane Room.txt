Oh, angel baby
I tell you what is on your mind
A dealer running down the coast
Now it’s coming on to leaving time

Unload in Alabama
And we’re sailing on to St. Giles
I’m hitching on a wave
On the weather on a seabird’s smile

Bad August on the moon
Kicking up the wind and rain
The swells hit thirty feet
Steal the balance from my brain

The captain and his crew
Are cut-throats down in the Port of Spain
White-knuckled at the rains
His timbers wail in shame

See me wistful in some harbor bar
I tend the warm glass and the duelling scar
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

Oh, angel baby
I lapping on a blue romance
For cargo and by compass
With a serpent’s tail in chance

Through the forties and the trades
And a cutlass raised in rage
Just for cotton and tobacco
For whiskey and for gage

Take the whip to drive the sugar train
A scent plantation and banana rain
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Angel baby, you’re my hurricane room

Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Angel baby, you’re my hurricane room, love it

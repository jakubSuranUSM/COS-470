I recall the night, That you came into this world.
I couldn't believe the doctor,
When he said "It's a little girl".
Well I said " Now doc, You must be wrong.
You see I want a boy"
Then he laid you in my arms,
And my heart sang with joy.

[Chorus]
Daddys girl, Daddy's girl.
I'm the center, of Daddy's world.
I know I'm Daddy's number one,
For he loves me like I was his son.
Daddy's girl.

I recall the day, I took you to a baseball game.
You brought along your baby doll,
And half its baby things.
We sat there a playing house,
While the Dodgers played the Braves
And everyone in the bleachers, looked at us as if to say.

[Chorus]

I recall the day, I took you on a fishing trip.
You said "Daddy, won't that hook, hurt the fishes lip?"
And you said "If they don't get air,
Those things in the can will die"
So we turned the worms all loose.
And chased some butterflies.

[Chorus]

I recall the day, That your young man come to call.
Seems like only yesterday,
When you swam and played football.
But I know the time has come,
That I must set you free.
But no matter where you are,
You know what you are to me!

Daddy's girl, Daddy's girl.
I'm the center, of Daddys world.
I know I'm Daddy's number one,
For he loves me like I was his son.
Daddy's girl.
Daddy's girl, Daddy's girl.
I'm the center

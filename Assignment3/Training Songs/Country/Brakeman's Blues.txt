Any old place I hang my hat is, home sweet home to me

Hey, hey

I went to the depot and I looked up on the board
I went to the depot and I looked up on the board
It read it's good times here, but better on down the road

Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
Eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm going to get me a momma, Lord, I ain't never seen

Where was you momma, when the train left the shed?
Where was you momma, when the train left the shed?
Standin' in my front door, wishin' to God, I was dead

If your house catcha fire, there ain't no one around

Just put my son out the window, let the house burn down

If that's your momma, you'd better tie her to your side
If that's your momma, you'd better tie her to your side
'Cause if she flash my train, I'll sure let her ride

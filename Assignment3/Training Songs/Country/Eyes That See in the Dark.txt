You're not meant to be alone I'll share your dream
I'll show you love you've never know-ow-own
Two flames together in the deep of the ni-i-ight
Up in your lo-ove -

Close by you, when you call, I'll take my stand
One chance to make or lose it a-a-all
This time my journey to wherever you are-are-are
I sail on your river, so far my love we'll never be fou-ound

If you believe we got eyes, that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mi-ine
And in the light of close investiga-ation
Is it only my imagina-ation, I go-ot you, I got you

Moonlight shining on your face. my bridges burned
With all my tears that you repla-a-aced
Two hearts together is a beautiful si-i-ight
I'll take you to heaven, so far my love will follow you there-ere

If we believe we got eye-eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mi-ine
Am I the light of someone you need mor-ore of
Let me be that love you can be sur-ure of
Is it only my imagina-ation, I go-ot you

Like the eagle that flies in the su-you-un
I'll be lost in your fire before we are do-o-one
And the view from my window is brighter
Born to be all you nee-eed

We got eye-eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for makin' you mi-ine
Am I the light of someone you need mor-ore of
Let me be that love you can be sur-ure of
Is it only my imagina-ation, I got you

We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives (fade)

Yeah, a lot people think
She's a little out of my league
Maybe I'm aiming too high, but that's okay
I'm chippin' away

Well, this morning, at the feed store
Walking in, I held the door
Saw the sweetest little smile sneak across her face
Oh, I'm chippin' away

Yeah, chippin' away, chippin' away
Gonna break through to her one of these days
That wall's high, but I know I'm
Chippin' away

Oh, chippin' away, chippin' away
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
Making her mine one swing at a time
Chippin' away

Oh, I'm chippin', chippin' away

It's kinda like a miner
Digging for a diamond
I know it's gonna take awhile, but it's worth the wait
I'm chippin' away

Yeah, chippin' away, chippin' away
Gonna break through to her one of these days
That wall's high, but I know I'm
Chippin' away

Oh, chippin' away, chippin' away
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
Making her mine one swing at a time
Chippin' away

Bought her a dozen red roses
Bet that'll do the trick
If that don't win her over
I'll be right back at it again
Yeah, right back it again

Yeah, chippin' away, chippin' away
Gonna break through to her one of these days
That wall's high, but I know I'm
Chippin' away

Oh, chippin' away, chippin' away
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
Making her mine one swing at a time
Chippin' away

That wall's high, but I know I'm
Chippin' away

I could call her up again tonight
And chances are she'll see me
She'd be ready like she was the other time
She was willing with her warm red lips
And she kept nothing from me
But her body couldn't keep you off my mind

Her body couldn't drive my love for you out of my sight
Her kisses weren't enough to make me wanna spend the night
It's been two long years since I came home
And found your goodbye letter
Still I can't get over what you left behind
I tried turning to a woman who was burning up with passion
But her body couldn't keep you off my mind
But her body couldn't keep you off my mind

Dawn breaks on the battlefield
While the mornin' mist lays heavy on the ground
And the silence is like thunder
As the enemy prepares another round

And her soft satin armor
Lying on the far side of the bed
Wounded and heart broken
And scared by the killin' words I said

I have no rules in battle
So I fire the guns of anger once again
Oh, she's such a little thing
And there's no doubt about it I can win

But with teardrops as her weapon
She easily destroys my battle plan
And in shamefully retreatin', I smile at her
And then she takes command

Oh, what a sweet surrender
I'm captured by two lips so warm and tender
She completely surrounds me with her lovin' arms again
It was love that brought the battle to an end

Now the enemies are lovers once again

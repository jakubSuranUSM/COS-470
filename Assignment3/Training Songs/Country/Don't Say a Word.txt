Don't say a word just kiss me kiss me kiss me (for soon we must part)
We only have a little time you're feeling sad I can tell
I know my love what's on your mind my heart is breaking as well
But darling don't say a word just give me give me give me all the love you can give
And let your heart be with me with me with me as long as you live

Don't say a word just kiss me kiss me kiss me for soon we must part
And when you're gone please miss me miss me miss me with all of your heart

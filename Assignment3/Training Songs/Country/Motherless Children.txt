Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone
Motherless children have a hard time
There's all that weeping and all that crying
Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone

Father will do the best he can
When the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can
When the mother is gone
Father will do the best he can
But there's so many things he just don't understand
Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone

People say a sister will do
When the mother is gone
People say a sister will do
When the mother is gone
People say a sister will do
But she'll get married and turn her back to you
Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone

Friends will treat you like your mother will
When the mother is gone
Friends will treat you like your mother will
When the mother is gone
Friends will tell you what to do
Then they'll turn their back on you
Motherless children have a hard time
When the mother is gone

Hey mister, what time does the next bus leave
I'm a party of one out of Tennessee
I won't be back for a long, long while
Give you eighty-five dollars to the highway mile
I ain't got no luggage as you can see
Just a whole lot of heavy memories
I was finally up for just a-settling down
When I found out she'd been a-fooling around

(Chorus): Ah, you can send me north, you can send me south
Just don't send me past my house
Don't ask me where I'm going, cause I don't care
I want a ticket that'll take me anywhere but here
A ticket that'll take me anywhere but here

Well, I hear it's cold up in Saskatoon
But it couldn't be colder than our bedroom
The skies are blue down in Alabam'
But they won't be any bluer than I am

[Chorus]
Ah, you can send me north and you can send me south
But just don't send me past my house
Don't ask me where I'm going, cause I don't care
I want a ticket that'll take me anywhere but here
A ticket that'll take me anywhere but here

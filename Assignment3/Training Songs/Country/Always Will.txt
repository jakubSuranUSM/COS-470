If time is a train rollin' down the tracks
Every minute is a box car that don't come back
Take a look around you it's all gonna change
Whatever you see ain't never gonna stay the same
Except for the rain and the wind in the trees
And the way I feel about you and me

And the way I feel when I'm with you
It's like the roll of the ocean
And the calm quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and it always will

Out on the horizon the sun is goin' down
But it ain't gone it's just on it's way around
Just like your love I see it every day
In the things you do and the things you say
You touch my hand and I feel the thrill
I always have and always will

And the way I feel when I'm with you
It's like the roll of the ocean
And the calm quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and it always will

If time is a train rollin' down the tracks
Every minute is a box car that don't ever come back
But when you hold me time stands still
It always has and it always will
It always will
It always will

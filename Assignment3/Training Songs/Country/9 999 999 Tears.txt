Got nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine tears to go
And then I don't know if I'll be over you

The sun didn't shine this morning it's been raining the whole day through
Suddenly without warning you found somebody new
That's when the first tear came falling from my eyes
I'm beginning to feel the pain seeing nothing but cloudy skies
Got nine million nine hundred
Well I'll be over you

You're out tonight with your new love I'm far far from your mind
Trying to get over you love could take a whole lifetime
I can't believe you could want anybody else so no one could take my place
At least that's what I keep telling myself as the tears fall down my face
Got nine million nine hundred
I'll be over you
Got nine million nine hundred
Got nine million nine hundred

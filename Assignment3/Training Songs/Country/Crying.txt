I was all right for a while I could smile for a while
I was all right for a while I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night you held my hand
So tight as you stopped to say hello
You wished me well you couldn't tell that I'd been

Crying over you, crying over you
Then you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling what can I do
You don't love me and I'll always be crying

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yes crying, crying over you

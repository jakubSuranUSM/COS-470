Eyes be careful how you look at her don't be blinded by her charms
Ears don't cling to every little word she'll talk you back into her arms
Lips be careful how you long for her you know her kiss can bring the sweetest pain
Heart be careful please don't fall for her cause if you fall you break again

Arms be careful how you reach for her there's magic in her slightest touch
Feet be careful how you follow her don't let her know we care too much
Mind be careful how you think of her she's much too smart don't let her out her way
Heart you fool you've gone and fell for her I guess you know you'll have to pay

Can't stand the sight of myself
Lying in bed all day with the curtains drawn
Staring at the clock on the window ledge
The angry words you said come back so strong

Sometimes love quits
Oh when the pieces don't fit
And suddenly all your world
Falls to the floor
And all your wild days

Oh fall away
Can't see much point in them anymore
I let you walk like a ghost unseen
In this house of dreams
Girl on the day you left
Out walked my everything

Must have thought you'd always be there
I never even noticed when the changes came one day
Seems one minute you were standing close
I turned around again
And girl you were far away

And every plan we made
Oh I just let them fade
And pile up on the floor
Beside the bed
Now you're gone away
Oh but your memory stays
I sit here thinking of the things I never said

In this house of dreams
I let you walk like a ghost unseen
Out walked my everything
Girl on the day you left

Sometimes love quits
Oh when the pieces don't fit
Falls to the floor
And suddenly all your world
Oh but your memory stays
In this house of dreams
I hear your voice behind every single door
I let you walk like a ghost unseen
Now you're gone away

Girl on the day you left
Out walked my everything

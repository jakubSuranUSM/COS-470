Things are getting crazy, I beg to understand
The more I think I know, the more I know I can't
So tell me what the point is with everything you say
Nowhere near the truth almighty a bunch of nothing said

Do you want to get mean?
Do you want to get cruel?
Do you think it's wise
To play the fool?

Take a look around you, it's easy not to see
Building walls between us doesn't fix a thing
Ignorance is blinding, they tell you that it's bliss
They've been saying that for ages, so will you answer this

So do you want to get mean?
Do you want to get cruel?
Do you think it's wise
To play the fool?

Do you want to get real?
Do you want to have dreams?
Nothing more than this
Easy as it seems

Do you want to get mean?
Do you want to get cruel?
Do you think it's wise
To play the fool?

Do you want to get real?
Do you want to have dreams?
Nothing more than this
Easy as it seems

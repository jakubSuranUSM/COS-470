I keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the swallows get back from Texarkana
I keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the swallows get back from Louisiana
Well, I used to chew 'em off
I was nervous over you
I missed that clickin', tickin' sound
Honey, what I'm gonna do
Is keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I keep my fingernails long
So they click when I play the piano
I'm gonna keep 'em that way
Till the swallows get back from Alabama

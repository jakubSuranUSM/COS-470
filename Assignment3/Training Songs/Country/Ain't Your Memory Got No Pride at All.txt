I woke up with her in my arms this morning
And God knows I love her over all
As she whispered she loved me, your memory appeared
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?

Tonight as I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
As I closed my eyes to kiss her, your memory appeared
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?

You were here; we loved; now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones be bygones and stay gone?
You always find the wrong time to come around and call
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?

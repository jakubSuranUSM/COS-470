Well, up in the backwoods, down in the holler
Old boy feeling like a dog on a collar
Keepin' that chain hold tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell good
Put on Skynyrd
Head into town like a Nascar winner
Cruisin' back and forth to the Tasty Freeze
Everywhere you look all you see is

Hillbilly deluxe, slick pick up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome to the bone
With a little homegrown
Country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

Couple kids, sweet thing driving a fast back
Shoot 'em a coon smile
Hoping that they smile back
Hey, baby, what's your name?
Burn a little rubber when the red light change
Here come the blue light
Here come Barney
Hide all the beer y'all
Let's move the party
Gotta go but that's alright
Do it all again next Friday night

Hillbilly deluxe, slick pick up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome to the bone
With a little homegrown
Country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

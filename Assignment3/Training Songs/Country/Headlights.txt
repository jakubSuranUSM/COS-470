Everybody knows when the summer gets hotter
Everybody goin' on down by the water, chillin'
Nothin' gets rocking 'til the clock says midnight
Catch a buzz on a honeysuckle moonlight

Shotguns, girlfriends, coolers full of cold cans

Follow those headlights
Down a broken fence line
Take it to the riverside
Point 'em through the red dust
Keep it in the tire ruts
If you wanna find us
Wanna go all night, hell yeah that's right
Follow those headlights

Got a girl in a tee and cut-offs shakin'
Around here we call that summertime naked
Yeah, shake it
Got bottoms up boys, hats on backwards
Hittin' it hard, says to park them tractors

Got Hank up on 10, if you can't hear him
If you can't hear him

Follow those headlights
Down a broken fence line
Take it to the riverside
Point 'em through the red dust
Keep it in the tire ruts
If you wanna find us
Wanna go all night, hell yeah that's right
Follow those headlights

Follow those headlights, yeah

Follow those headlights
Down a broken fence line
Take it to the riverside
Point 'em through the red dust
Keep 'em in the tire ruts
If you wanna find us
Wanna go all night, hell yeah that's right
Follow those headlights
Follow those headlights, yeah

I was feeling so sad and alone
But I found a friend in the song that I'm singing
I was feeling like a nothing inside
Then I found it all in the song
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh
It's coming straight from my heart
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh
I gotta let it go
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh

Man I felt like I was going nowhere
Then I found my way in the song I was singing
Man I felt like I could lay down and die
Then I found my life in the song
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh
It's coming straight from my heart
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh
I gotta let it go
And yeah yeah yeah uh-huh

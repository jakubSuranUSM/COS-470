At times when it's snowin'
At times when the wind is blowin'
At times when the night is still
At times when the moon has climbed the hill
I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

At times when it's sunny
At times I can hear you call me honey
At times when the sun is overhead
Or at times when I'm cryin' in my bed
I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

At times I can hear you callin'
In the fallin' of the rain
At times in a rainbow
I can see you and hear you
Call my name

At times I can take it
At times I think I'm gonna make it
Oh, at times when I'm feelin' blue
I pretend the angels didn't send for you
And I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

My world is make believe

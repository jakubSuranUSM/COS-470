Late light of the desert made the mountains a silhouette
It?s curved as woman's side as far off as I feel inside
Gravity, it?s heavier than my fear, it pulls me to a new conclusion
The light of you is the weight that keeps me here

I wake up with my soul on fire
I'm swimming in my heart's desire
Not drowning in somebody's wake
Not smiling for somebody's sake

Why don't you just stay here in the sun?
It beats me why you disappear, honey
Ain't I your beloved one

My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one
My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one

I see you blue eyed old and gray
Still up all night 'til break of day
You dance me across the kitchen floor
You still got one eye on the door

How you love me with them halfway eyes
And when I think there's nothing left
I think of love and all the time it buys

My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one
My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one

Late light of the desert made the mountains a silhouette
It?s curved as a woman's side as far off as I feel inside
The battle was hard fought but nobody won
I'll be your magnetic north, baby, you be my beloved one

My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one
My beloved, my beloved, my beloved one

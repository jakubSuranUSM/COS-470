You say I'm too fat, you say I'm too skinny
You say I'm not cool, you say I'm not pretty
Then you spread it all around
And post it online for the whole world to see

Why, why you wanna make me cry
And laugh at me like that
Does it make you feel good making me feel so bad
Hey, bully

Did someone hurt you
Make you feel small
You take it out on me
'Cause it makes you feel tall
I bet you're scared and alone
If you looked in my eyes, you'd see
Hey, bully, you're a lot like me

In the back of the bus, you're a big star
But you took a little joke a little too far
And the headline news says
The kids aren't always playing so nice
Out in the schoolyard

Why, why you wanna make me cry
You don't even know who I am
If you gave me half a chance, we just might have been friends
Hey, bully

Did someone hurt you
Make you feel small
You take it out on me
'Cause it makes you feel tall
I bet you're scared and alone
If you looked in my eyes, you'd see
Hey, bully, you're a lot like me

It would be so easy to hit back at you
Use my pain to hurt you too
Oh, but if I do, nothing would change
I won't be a link in your chain

Did someone hurt you
Make you feel small
You take it out on me
'Cause it makes you feel tall
I bet you're scared and alone
If you looked in my eyes, you'd see
Hey, bully, you're a lot like me

Yeah, bully, you're a lot like me
Ooh, you're a lot like me
Hey, bully, you're a lot like me

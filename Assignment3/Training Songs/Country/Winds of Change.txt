Well, I've seen my chances come and go
And come back round again
But every time they took me by surprise

And there was a day I used to want
The things I did not have
But it's never better on the other side

Well, I've never gone so far
That I've forgotten my way home
The best things always bring you back
Again over and over

The hands of time go round and round
They don't slow down when you lose your way
At every turn, the things you learn
You wear them proud like you wear your name

And as you go on down that road
Don't let the dust get in your eyes
It blows in the winds of change, yeah

The hunger is no stranger
Oh, I've sat with him before
Everything I've done has not been good

And as I've tried to make my stand
Oh, I've had to learn to fall
Maybe I have seen more than I should

But I've never gone so far
That I've forgotten my way home
The best things always bring you back
Again over and over

The hands of time go round and round
They don't slow down when you lose your way
At every turn, the things you learn
You wear them proud like you wear your name

And as you go on down that road
Don't let the dust get in your eyes
It blows in the winds of change, yeah, oh, oh

And I held on to my life
I kept my dream alive
And the dream ain't over and over, over and over

The hands of time go round and round
They don't slow down when you lose your way
At every turn, the things you learn
You wear them proud like you wear your name

And as you go on down that road
Don't let the dust get in your eyes
It blows in the winds of change
It blows in the winds of change, yeah

The winds of change

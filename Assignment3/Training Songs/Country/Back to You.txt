I've been torn between
Of what you want and what I need
Though I think it's the same thing

And if you look in my eyes
There's a burning fire inside
And I know you feel it too

But there's a road I'm on
I've been waiting for so long
But I'll be like the morning dew, back to you

When I reach my destiny
I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you

So if I take my time
And if I spread my wings to fly
Oh, the wind will carry me through
Back to you

When I reach my destiny
I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you

Don't worry about them distance
That's keeping us apart
The candle keeps on burning
Trust me with your heart

And when I reach my destiny
You know I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you

Well, back to you, oh
All those years, back to you
All those years, back to you
All those years

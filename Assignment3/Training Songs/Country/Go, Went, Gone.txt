I think that I love you
This is my song to you
You say that it will never be the same
But that's ok
As long as we're together
You say you don't need me
And that you never really did
But I knew it the first time that I saw you
That I wanted you to be mine
For the rest of my time

But you're gone now
I'll be gone soon
I won't stay here
It reminds me of you
But I'll miss you
I hope you'll think of me sometimes
Hope you'll feel real bad sometimes

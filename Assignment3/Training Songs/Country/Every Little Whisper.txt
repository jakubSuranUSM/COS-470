It's an old-fashioned feeling
In a world that's gone wild
It's a walk by the river
On a slow summer night
It's the rhythm of love
Everywhere I go
It's the sound of her voice here in my soul

[Chorus:]
Every little whisper, every little sigh
Every time I hold her I think I'm gonna die
Every time her heart beats I know that I'm alive
With ever little whisper, every little sigh

There's this thing that she does and she don't even know
I don't say a word, man I just let her go
There's a smile that she saves when she lets her hair down
Deep in the night there is only one sound

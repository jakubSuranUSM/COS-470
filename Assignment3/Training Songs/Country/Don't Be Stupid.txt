Cool

You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys, you think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated
When I get off the phone and get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me and you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid, you know I love ya
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need ya
Don't be absurd, you know I want ya
Don't be impossible, oh oh oh

I'm mad about you
(I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you
(I can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you
(I'm crazy about you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love ya

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax Max

Don't be stupid, you know I love ya
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need ya
Don't be absurd, you know I want ya
Don't be impossible, oh no no

I'm mad about you
(I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you
(I can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you
(I'm crazy about you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love you

Don't be stupid
You're my baby

Ohh I'm mad about you
(I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you
(I can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you
(I'm crazy about you)

Don't be stupid, you know I love ya
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need ya
Don't be absurd, you know I want ya
Don't be impossible, impossible oh, no, no, no
Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby
Don't be, ridiculous no no
Oh, don't be stupid

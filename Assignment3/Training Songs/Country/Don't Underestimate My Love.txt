If I never say the words you wanna hear
When I hold you near
Maybe they get said another way
A kiss can mean as much to me as words could ever do
You know I live for you
You shouldn't ever doubt how I feel about you

Don't underestimate my love for you, darlin'
It's always there, it's just the way I care
If you believe in me, then show more faith in us
Don't underestimate my love

When you have a need for me and I'm not there
You wonder if I'm where
I could meet someone who'd take me from you
In you heart and soul you know I'm the one thing you can't lose
You know I live for you
You shouldn't ever doubt how I feel about you

Don't underestimate my love for you, darlin'
It's always there, it's just the way I care
If you believe in me, then show more faith in us
Don't underestimate my love

Darlin' just imagine how much stronger we become
When you see you'll always be the only one
It's always there, it's just the way I care
If you believe in me, then show more faith in us
Don't underestimate my love

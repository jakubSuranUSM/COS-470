If you ever live in a ghetto
Maybe at the close of your day
On your front porch you'll hear the sound of a jukebox
From a neighbourhood cafe

Well at noon you may hear the neighbours fussin'
When a kid breaks a window pane
And at night - and at night you may be wakened
By the sound of the out- outbound train

The rich folks they own the big city
And they down us for living the way we do
But when you're born the child of a poor man
You know the ghetto is the only place for you

Well if there's such a thing as revolution
And there will be if we rise to the call
When we build we build we build we build the New Jerusalem
There won't be no more ghetto - ghetto at all
No there won't be no more ghetto - ghetto at all

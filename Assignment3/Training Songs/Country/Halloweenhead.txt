Here comes that shit again
I got a Halloween head
Head full of tricks and treats
It leads me through the nighttime streets
Black cats and fallen trees
Under ladders, always walkin'
Salt shaker spills, just throw it over your shoulder, babe

I got a bad idea again
I got a Halloweenhead
Halloweenhead

Head full of candy bags
costume shops and punks in drag
Head full of tricks and treats
Places where junkies meet
And it leads me through the streets at night
That's alright I just watch, I don't go inside
It's all the same old shit again
I got a Halloweenhead
I got a Halloweenhead
Lord, I got a Halloween head

Guitar solo!

I got a Halloweenhead
Lord, I got a Halloweenhead
I got a Halloweenhead
Oh Lord, I got a Halloweenhead

Here comes that shit again
I got a Halloweenhead
Head full of tricks and treats
It leads me through the nighttime streets
Downtown, downtown, downtown

I got a Halloweenhead
I got a Halloweenhead
Lord, I got a Halloweenhead
What the f*ck's wrong with me?
God, I'm a Halloween head

I've heard everybody talkin' 
And the word is in the air 
That you made plans to say goodbye 
And leave me standing here
Well, you say that you don't love me 
But I can't believe that's true
Baby let me know if it's really so 
And tell me what are you gonna do
And tell me 

Do you really want my lovin'
Do you really want my huggin'
Do you really want someone that's true
Do you really want my love

Well how can you be so heartless, 
How can you be so cold 
I should have sent you on your way 
A long, long time ago
Ah but I don't want to lose you 
'Cause I still love you so
So if you don't feel the way I feel, 
Well it's time you let me know
And baby

Do you really want my lovin'
Do you really want my huggin'
Do you really want someone that's true
Do you really want my love

Do you need someone to hold you 
Do you need someone who cares
Do you need someone to keep you warm at night
When no one else is there

I've heard everybody talking 
And the word is in the air 
That you've made plans to say good bye 
And leave me standing here
Well, you say that you don't love me 
But I can't believe it's true
Baby let me know if it's really so 
And tell me 
What are you gonna do
And tell me

Do you really want my lovin'
Do you really want my huggin'
Do you really want someone that's true
Do you really want my love

Tell me do you really want my lovin'
Do you really want my huggin'
Do you really want someone that's true
Do you really want my love

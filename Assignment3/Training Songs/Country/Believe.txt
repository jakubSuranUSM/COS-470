Five-year-old Superman got a beach towel cape 
And he thinks he can 
So he takes a dive off the chicken coop 
Red behind and broken foot 
Daddy said I hope you learned your lesson good 
Yes sir, next time I'm gonna wear the Superman boots 

Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 

Red rhinestones and a Silvertone 
Opry playing on the radio 
He says one day I'm gonna be on that stage 
Spends all his time practicing 
Gets a big break and it all begins 
Now he waiting in the wings and Porters calling out his name 

Believe 
You can fly you can sing 
Take a leap spread your wings 
Believe 
Have a little faith little trust 
Little luck little love and dream 
Whatever you want 
But you've gotta believe 

Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 

Her mom says its wasting tips in an all-night diner 
Babies, boys and black eye liner 
Its a woman's life it ain't rocket science 
She set her site on the Ivy League 
Got a full free ride and her PhD 
Now shes down in Houston and shes one of NASA's finest 

Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 

Hes 91 shes 85 
Said by God were still alive 
Lets go stepping out before cashing in 
Take the Cadillac down to the Broken Spoke 
Do the ole two-step or cotton-eyed Joe 
Just like the south they're gonna rise again 

Believe 
You can fly you can dance 
Take a leap take a chance 
Believe 
Have a little faith little trust 
Little luck little love and dream 
Whatever you want 
But you've gotta believe 

Good things come to those who will believe 
So believe 

You can fly 
Give it a try 
You're gonna see 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you dream 
If you believe 

Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 
Go on, give it a try 

You can fly you can sing 
Take a leap spread your wings 
Believe 

Go on, give it a try 

You can fly you can dance 
Take a leap take a chance 
Believe 

Go on, give it a try 

You can fly you can sing 
Take a leap spread your wings 
Believe 

Go on, give it a try 

You can fly you can dance 
Take a leap take a chance 
Believe

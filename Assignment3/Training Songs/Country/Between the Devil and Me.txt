This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
You can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one is wrong
The flesh is weak
But love is strong
She's all I see between the Devil and me

The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me

I hold her in my arms at night
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows 'cross our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know the fire burns
She's all I see between the Devil and me

The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me

The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
She's all I see between the Devil and me

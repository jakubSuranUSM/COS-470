Well, I tried my best to be at rest
When the moon and the wind both died
You locked me in with your best friend
Oh, your window was open wide

I escaped in time to see your man
Truckin' in the bar again

He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin
He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin

I said I'd see you at half past nine
You said you'd see me at ten
But you lied to me, honey, I lied to you
And we both lied to your man

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him
Truckin' in the bar again

He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin
He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin

Well, I headed for the door and you hit the floor
Then your man hit me in my head
I hit the windows and I hit the walls
And it hit me, I must be dead

I was thinkin' slow, I was sinkin' low
I saw him truckin' out again

He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin
He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin

He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin
He was fondlin' Lucy, singin' to Suzy
Suckin' a big bottle of gin

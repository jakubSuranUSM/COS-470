I called her up to say I'm sorry
I just can't have lunch today
'Cause the boss just called
And he's flying in from L.A.
And as the phone rang
I remembered the time
How simple things used to be
Then her voice came on the line 
Not her, but the answer machine

She said I'm sorry, I can't take your call
'Cause I'm packing up to away
And John, if that's you
You're just cancel the lunch anyway
Oh you used to find the time
But now you don't even try
So at the sound of the tone 
You're on your own...goodbye

I ran down to the street and I caught a cab
God I had to get back home
But the house was empty
Except for the code-a-phone
And as the tears came I remembered the time
How happy we used to be
And I'll never forget the 
Last words she ever said to me

She said I'm sorry, I can't take your call
'Cause I'm packing up to away
And John, if that's you
You're just cancel the lunch anyway
Oh you used to find the time
But now you don't even try
So at the sound of the tone 
You're on your own...goodbye

She said you used to find the time
But now you don't even try
So at the sound of the tone
You're on your own....goodbye

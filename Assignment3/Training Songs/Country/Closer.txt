It's just me and you and the man in the moon shinin' down
A blanket of stars up above and a quilt on the ground
I've waited so long to get you all alone in the dark
I just want to hold you till I feel the beat of your heart

I wanna get closer, closer
Closer than moonlight that your body's wrapped in tonight, yeah
Closer to heaven than I've ever been in my life
Before the night's over I wanna get closer

My two aching arms have been longing to hold you this way
These lips have been praying that I'd find the right words to say
I don't want to own you or try to control how you feel
I want you to need me, believe me this feeling is real

I wanna get closer, closer
Closer than moonlight that your body's wrapped in tonight, yeah
Closer to heaven than I've ever been in my life
Before the night's over I wanna get closer

Closer than moonlight that your body's wrapped in tonight, yeah
Closer to heaven than I've ever been in my life
Before the night's over I wanna get closer
Before the night's over I wanna get closer

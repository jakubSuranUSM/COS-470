They're working while I'm missing you 
Those healing hands of time
And soon soon they'll be dismissing you 
From this heart of mine
They'll lead me safely through the night 
And I'll follow as though blind
My future tightly clutched within 
Those healing hands of time
They let me close my eyes just then 
Those healing hands of time
And soon they'll let me sleep again 
Those healing hands of time
So already I've reached mountain peaks 
And I've just begun to climb
I'll get over you by clinging to 
Those healing hands of time
Yes I'll get over you by clinging to 
Those healing hands of time

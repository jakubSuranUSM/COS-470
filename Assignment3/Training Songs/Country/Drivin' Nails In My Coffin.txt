My sweetheart has gone 
And I'm so lonely 
She said that she and I were through
So I started out drinkin' for past time 
Drivin' nails in my coffin over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin 
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin, Lord 
I'm drivin' those nails over you

Now ever since the day 
That we've parted 
I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you love 
And I just can't quit 
Drinking that old booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...

Now you've turned me down 
You don't want me 
There's nothing now I can lose
I'm just drivin' those nails in my coffin 
And worryin' my darlin' over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...

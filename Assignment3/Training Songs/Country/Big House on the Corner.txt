You can see the ad in the morning paper this house for sale the owener's leaving town
He won't need it any longer he'll like the price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
She was all I had all I ever wanted but now she's gone so I can't stay in town
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
This happy couple used to live there until the winds of sorrow left it alone and bare
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live

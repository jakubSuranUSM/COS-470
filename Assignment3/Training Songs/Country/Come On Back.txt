You been out there layin' low
In every dive from here to memphis
Lookin' for something to fill the hole
In your poor little heart

And keep out the cold
Why does love have to hurt so bad
To drive a man downtown every night
I tell ya something ain't right

Something's real wrong
In the morning when i wake up
You'll still be gone

[Chorus]
Come on back to the one who really loves you
Baby come on back to me
Come on back to the one who really cares
Baby come on back to me

Out chasing shadows on the dark side of town
You can't hold what you can't catch
It's a bitter business this running around
When the penny drops it's a lonely sound

Women are fools when it comes to you
They gotcha doin' things you can't undo
Like a chain of heartaches around your neck
Give 'em enough rope and they'll hang you yet

[Chorus: x2]

Why does love have to hurt so bad
To drive a man downtown every night
I tell ya something ain't right
Something's real wrong
In the morning when i wake up
You'll still be gone

[Chorus: x2]

I look at your picture too often
It helps keep your memory alive
It's not healthy, they say to relive yesterday
But for me it's the way to survive

I must cling to what's gone if I'm to go on
I can't face the future I've tried
Perhaps for the rest looking back isn't best
But for me it's the way to survive

When my heart aches, I read all your letters
And the word makes our love seem alive
They say I can't last if I live in the past
But for me it's the way to survive

I must cling to what's gone if I'm to go on
I can't face the future I've tried
Perhaps for the rest looking back isn't best
But for me it's the way to survive

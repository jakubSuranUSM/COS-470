All by myself
I was fine
No one else to remind me
Of all my pain inside
You looked at me
And I knew
You would be
The last thing I needed in my life

Oh, I need you
Girl I need you
But I know it's gonna hurt
?Cause your love is gonna tear me apart
Oh I need you
Girl I need you
But I know we shouldn't start
?Cause I need you
Like a hole in my heart

Don't smile that smile
Say those words
Knowing I'll wanna touch you
Then it will be too late
Just walk away
Don't look back
Let's just say that we're so much 
Better off not temptin' fate

I been in and out of love
And I thought I had enough
But there's nothin' in this world
I can do ?cause

Oh I need you
Girl I need you
But I know it's gonna hurt
?Cause your love is gonna tear me apart
Oh I need you
Girl I need you
But I know we shouldn't start
?Cause I need you
Like a hole
Like a bullet through my soul

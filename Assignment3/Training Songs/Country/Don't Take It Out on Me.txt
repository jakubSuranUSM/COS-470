Just because you were hurt by someone
Don't take it out on me
Although I know you love that someone
More than you ever loved me

You always will remember
The day he went away
Our love has left an ember
That burns your heart away

The love you thought would last forever
Is now just a memory
And just because you were hurt by someone
Don't take it out on me

You always will remember
The day he went away
Our love has left an ember
That burns your heart away

The love you thought would last forever
Is now just a memory
And just because you were hurt by someone
Don't take it out on me

Pretty little hair-do don't do what it used to
Can't disguise the living
All the miles that we've been through

Looking like a train wreck
Wearing too much makeup
The burden that you carry
Is more than one soul could ever bare

[Chorus]
Don't look so sad, Marina
There's another part to play
Don't look so sad, Marina
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

You never make your mind up
Like driving with your eyes shut
Rough around the edges 
Won't someone come and take you home

Waiting for a breakthrough
What will you set your mind to?
We stood outside the Chinese restaurant in the rain

[Chorus]

It was on one Monday morning
About one o'clock
When that great Titanic
Began to reel and rock

People began to scream and cry
Saying, oh, Lord, we're going to die
It was sad when that great ship went down

It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and their wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down

When building that great ship
They said what they would do
They said that they could build a ship
That water would not go through

God with power in his hand
Showed the world it could not stand
It was sad when that great ship went down

When that great ship left England
She was making for the shores
When the rich declared
They would not ride with the poor

So they put the poor below
And they were the first to go
It was sad when that great ship went down

It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and their wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down

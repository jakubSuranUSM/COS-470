If you were the sun 
And one day you lost all your light 
And you disappeared 
I'd stand in the dark all alone 
And wait through the night 
And I'd feel no fear 
I might not know what to do 
But you'd shine again like brand new 
I've got that much faith in you

[Chorus:]
If ever the lights were to go out between us 
If ever the raindrops should start to fall 
Should the winds of distrust ever rock our foundation 
I know we could weather it all 
I might not know what to do 
But I do know we'd make it through 
I've got that much faith in you

And if you were the moon 
And one night a big black cloud 
Came and covered your face 
I'd stand in the rain 
Like a statue tall and proud 
Till the clouds blew away 
I might not know what to do 
But you'd make the rain roll on through 
I've got that much faith in you 

[Chorus]

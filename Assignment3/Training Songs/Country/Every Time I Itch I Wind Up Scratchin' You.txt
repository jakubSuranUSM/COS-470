You know, my love, my only wish is happiness for you
So I work real hard to strike it rich but every time I do
I blow it all on some old witch I hardly ever knew
How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you

When everything's ain't going right, I hurry home to you
You kiss my lips and you comfort me as only you can do
But the eagle flies on Friday night and my senses fly off too
How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you

I dream of coming home to you; a knight in shining armor
'Cause it seems to me that you rate much more
Than a broken down, busted farmer

Every time I get ahead, I act like someone new
I waste the whole night talking big and spending money too
Then I sneak in bed beside you; broke and blue
How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you, ah

How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you

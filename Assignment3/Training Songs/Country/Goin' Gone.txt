There's a lighthouse in the harbor

   Giving guidance with its light

      But I had no one to return to

   As I wandered through the night

   From the first time that I saw you

   Standing silent by the shore

      I knew my search was over

   And I would look for love no   more
Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'

Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
    
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
   There's a ship on the horizon

   Makin' its way against the wind
                             
      From the place where I stand watching

   I swear my ship is coming in.

Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'
   
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
               
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'
      
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
                  
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone

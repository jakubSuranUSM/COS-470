Hey, hey I’m lookin’ at you
Boy I gotta tell you I’m liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C’mon
Hey, hey I’m talking to you
With your tight t-shirt and something to prove
Step up, show me your moves
C’mon

Worked hard all week
Gotta whole lotta girls in a little backseat
Touch up my face
It’s ladies night and we get in free
Boys are gonna hunt
Girls are gonna play and say

Hey, hey I’m lookin’ at you
Boy I gotta tell you I’m liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C’mon
Hey, hey I’m talking to you
With your tight t-shirt and something to prove
Step up, show me your moves
C’mon

One more two step
Slide a little closer we ain’t done yet
Rock on all night
Take a trip to the country with me and my friends
Boys are gonna hunt
Girls are gonna play and say

Hey, hey I’m lookin’ at you
Boy I gotta tell you I’m liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C’mon
Hey, hey I’m talking to you
With your tight t-shirt and something to prove
Step up, show me your moves
C’mon

Don’t you be sitting at home alone
C’mon
Time to throw down, get up and go
C’mon, c’mon, why don’t you c’mon

Hey, hey I’m lookin’ at you
Boy I gotta tell you I’m liking the view
Scuff up those shiny boots
C’mon
Hey, hey I’m talking to you
With your tight t-shirt and something to prove
Step up, show me your moves
C’mon

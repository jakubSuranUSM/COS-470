I'm traveling the highway to nowhere cause I can't find the road to your heart
This old road is so rough and so rocky I get lost on the highway to your heart
This highway to nowhere keeps calling your heart's at the end of the line
But I always get lost on a detour I guess I don't understand the signs
[ steel - fiddle ]
I've travelled this highway so long now but I know I'm no closer to your heart
Down this long lonesome road I'll keep traveling
Though I know I've been lost from the start
This highway to nowhere I'll follow the road's dark but I keep trudging on
And tomorrow I'll be back where I started it's the highway to nowhere that I'm on

Darling,
I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime
Darling
You're so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line
Taking me some paper
Pencil in my hand
I'm gonna write
Darling
You know I feel are cold nights
Thinking 'bout the old nights
Spent along with you
Oh, oh, darling
Tears are in my eyes now
Knowing I should try now
To make it back to you

Darling
I love you more than ever
I wish we were together
Darling mine
Darling 
I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone some
But I don't have a dime
Mmh darling 
You're so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line
Darling, oh darling
I'm feeling pretty lonesome (I'm feeling pretty lonesome)
I'd call you on the phone some (I'd call you on the phone some)
But I don't have a dime (but I don't have one single time)
Darling (oh my darling)
You're so far behind me (you're so far behind me)
Tomorrow's gonna find me (tomorrow's gonna find me)
Further down the line
Come on now
Darling (oh my little darling)
I'm feeling pretty lonesome (I am feeling pretty lonesome)
I'd call you on the phone some

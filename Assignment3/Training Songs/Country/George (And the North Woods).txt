George I was just a layin' here thinking I'm blind for that I was all alone
Old timer if you weren't here to guide me I'd be lost and they'd never find my bones
I just came here to the North Woods for some thinking
A man's just gotta rest once in a while
And I'm really glad you're still around to guide me
It seems to me we walked a hundred miles

You know how much I've always liked this cabin it's quiet and I get a chance to think
I just can't figure things out in that city the bars are there and you know how I drink
You know George I made a fortune in the big town my name is on the city limit sign
And then fate laid her heavy hand upon me
And brought the accident that left me blind
Old buddy you know how that woman did me I guess you knew her better than I did

George I guess you knew how much it hurt me
The day the judge gave her our little kids
She said she wouldn't care if I should drop dead
With all that insurance I don't guess she would
Most people think the wilderness is quiet

But just listen to the wolves out in the woods
Well tomorrow when I'll leave here I'll be different
I'll ride the train when they say all aboard
You've spent a lotta time here in the North Woods
You are still goin' with me aren't you George
George George where are you George
George no kiddin' now George George don't foolin' where are you George

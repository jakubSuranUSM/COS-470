You can't turn your back and walk away
Until the cards are stacked against us
And you thought it through
But you're gonna lose when it crosses over
Then life turns defenseless and it'll turn on you
Oh if you've loved before don't try to deny it
You can't ignore the way you feel inside

[Chorus]
Don't cross your heart
It's a fight you can't win
You lose your mind
Don't cross you heart
Your heart gonna break you every time
What you do is up to you
If you wanna play it smart
Honey don't cross your heart

You don't dispatch a perfect love
It takes time to make it
You gotta start somewhere
If the truth be known
A (diamond ring) is just a piece of stone
Until it shapes it with tender love and care
Chip away until you get to the truth
Oh I can't make you stay
But whatever you do

[Chorus]

What you do is up to you
If you wanna play it smart
Honey don't cross your heart

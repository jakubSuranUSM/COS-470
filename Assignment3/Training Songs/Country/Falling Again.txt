(Falling falling falling out of love)
Darling we're falling in and out of love but each time we're falling back again
We have a fight and then we make back up now here we go falling again
Falling again falling again falling again out of love
Each time this happens when we make a vow to keep our love grew thick or thin
But then we disagree as we're doin' now and here we go falling again
Falling again falling again falling again out of love
Darling someday I hope we'll settle down this falling back and forth the sin
Not knowing which sweet kiss will be the last or when we're falling out again 
Falling again falling again falling again out of love (falling falling falling out of love)

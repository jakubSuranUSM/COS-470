I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

[ steel ]

I'll have a blue Christmas I know dear
I hope your white Christmas brings you cheer
And when you say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
Will you feel the same dear as when you prayed with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue mem'ries start calling
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

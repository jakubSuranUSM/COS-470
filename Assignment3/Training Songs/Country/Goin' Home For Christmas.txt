My family called me on the phone and said
"Grandpa would you come home?"
We'd love to have you here on Christmas day
We know you won't get on a plane
But grandpa you can ride a train
You can see the scenery along way"

Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Got my big red knapsack loaded down
Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Soon, I'll be rolling into town

I know everybody there will be happy
And they'd be down to meet me
When they hear the whistle sound
I know my one-horse stage will be waiting
On the choo-choo bringing Santa Claus to town

Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Got my big red knapsack loaded down
Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Soon, I'll be rolling into town

Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Got my big red knapsack loaded down
Going home for Christmas
Coming on a train
Soon, I'll be rolling into town

Going home for Christmas
Hey, so good to see you all

All of me belongs to you all the time
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's not one way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you

Eyes are worthless cause you're not here to see
Lips are so forgotten since you forgotten me
My arms ached from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me that don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you

Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
Not one single part of me that my heart don't inclue
All of me belongs to you all of me belongs to you

I guess there's not much I can do or say
Saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I try to tell her so
It's hello blues and down the road I go

Well I've never seen that guy before today
He held my baby in close this way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know
It's hello blues and down the road I go

Well it seemed our thoughts were much alike,
Our likes were much the same
We even had our future planned
'Til in the town he came

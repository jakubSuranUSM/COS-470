Could you love me one more time
With a love that really is mine
I've waited so long they say you've gone wrong
Have I lost you forever this time.

We'll go down by the river
I'll ask you one last time
As the night breezes blow I'll whisper so low
Could you love me one more time.

Do you think that I'd believe
This talk that's going around
I've heard lots of things that somehow seem strange
But darling I wouldn't throw you down.

I know that you're my weakness
I know you'll be my downfall
I'm not sorry we met and I'll never forget
That I gave you my heart soul and all...

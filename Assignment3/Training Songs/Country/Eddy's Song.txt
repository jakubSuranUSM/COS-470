I just caught the love bug itch Molly darlin'
And I wanna play house with you
Take me in your arms and hold me and be mine
I'll send you a big bouquet of roses anytime
I know there's no wings on my angel
But how easy on the eyes you've been
There's been a change in me it's true
I wanna full time job with you
And if that's how much I love you it's a sin

What is life without just a little lovin'
So it's older and molder we'll be
Don't you ever take the ribbons from your hair
Or you'll be rockin' all alone in your easy rockin' chair
I won't rob another man's castle
I'll be chained to a memory
You're just a great big bundle of
That southern sunshine that I love
And my cuddle buggin' baby you will be

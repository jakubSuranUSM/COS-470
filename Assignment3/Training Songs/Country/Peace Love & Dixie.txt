Guess we was born
Years too late
Willie and Shine knew the old school kind
Kick it like they kicked it back in '69
Get out that vinyl
Drop a needle down
We're out in the field, just straight chillin'
Party at the leanin' tower cold beer killin'

If you smoke funny cigarettes, you get whiskey
You shakin' hips like a hip-hip-hippy
Don't like 'em if you gotta tip back that bottle 
Little sip-sip-sippy
Peace, love and Dixie
Holla if you're with me
Peace, love and Dixie

They call it what you want
Say what you wanna say
If you want sticks and stones, country Rock and Roll
Born in the USA 
Well, then I suppose
And drop a tailgate down
With hotties in tow, speakers bout to blow
Pour some TC3 at your radio

If you smoke funny cigarettes, you get whiskey
You shakin' hips like a hip-hip-hippy
Don't like 'em if you gotta tip back that bottle 
Little sip-sip-sippy
Peace, love and Dixie 

If you smoke funny cigarettes, you get whiskey
You shakin' hips like a hip-hip-hippy
Don't like 'em if you gotta tip back that bottle 
Little sip-sip-sippy (Peace, love and Dixie)
If you smoke funny cigarettes, you get whiskey
You shakin' hips like a hip-hip-hippy
Don't like 'em if you gotta tip back that bottle 
Little sip-sip-sippy
Peace, love and Dixie
Holla if you're with me
Peace, love and Dixie

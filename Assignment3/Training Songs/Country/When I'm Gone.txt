Well, it seems you thought it over
And you feel I'm not the one
And you think you might do better on your own.
You say lover's vows only hold you down
So I guess I'm moving on,
But what'll you think about me when I'm gone?

What will you think about me when I'm gone, said and done,
When old memories fall like footsteps.
Will you think it's me coming home?
Well, I thought your eyes could see compromise,
But that's one thing you've never done.
What'll you think about me when I'm gone?

Will some other's kiss taste sweeter
Or will my pictures haunt your room?
Will it make your nights pass easier
Or will you think you were a fool
When my pillow's bare and you're lying there,
Will a heartache linger on?
What'll you think about me when I'm gone?
What'll you think about me when I'm gone?

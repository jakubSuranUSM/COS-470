We're just a pair of old sneakers
Stringin' each other along
Sometimes i feel just like a heel
'cause i know in my soul, that it's wrong

We're just a pair of old sneakers
Kickin' each other around
Eight times a week, we play 'hide an' cheat'
'Til we've run that game in the ground

We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long

We're just a pair of old sneakers
Worn out an' comin' unglued
Both wearin' rings, feelin' ashamed
Tryin' to run from the truth

We're just a pair of old sneakers
And nothin' can tear us apart
Living the lie and lord knows we've tried
To stop walking on each other's heart

We're just a pair of old sneakers
We know that cheatin' is wrong
We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long

We're just a pair of old sneakers
And we've been in the closet too long

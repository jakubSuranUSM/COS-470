Bandwagon rides for free
Satisfaction guaranteed
Fall in line and let it take you farther
Hurry up they?re going fast
This special offer will not last
All aboard yells the main street barker

All aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard

Sign up and get a flag
Wear it proudly you can brag
To the fools who didn?t volunteer
Some restrictions do apply
Watch your mouth and close you eyes
And we allow no yellow foreign queers

All aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard

A team of old white studs
Pulls this rolling country club
Climb right on in and take a seat
Down the beaten path we?ll run
High stepping to the drummer?s drum
And if you don?t love it you can leave

All aboard all aboard
All aboard all aboard

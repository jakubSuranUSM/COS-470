There wasn't much love on the day you came
I was feeling my way with a heart gone lame
Life was so cold right then
I thought I'd never love again
Though my dreams of romance blew away with the wind
Oh my heart beat slow

Heart of mine
Can we try it one more time?
Can you help but love a girl so free, so kind?
Lonely tears 
Helped me waiting all these years
For the day I felt the joy of love inside
When my heart's alive

Believe me I know that the truth sounds strange, oh yer
How an innocent smile made my whole life change
You call it coincidence
But I knew she was heaven sent
When I felt that my heart was beginning to mend
Now my heart beats fast

Heart of mine
I think we made it just in time
We can't help but love a girl so free, so kind
Lonely tears 
Helped me looking all those years
And today I felt the joy of love inside
Yes, my heart's alive

And growing stronger all the time

Heart of mine
Think we made it just in time
You can't help but love a girl so free, so kind
Lonely tears 
Helped me looking all those years
And today I felt the joy of love inside

Heart of mine
I think we made it just in time
We can't help but love a girl so free, so kind
Lonely tears

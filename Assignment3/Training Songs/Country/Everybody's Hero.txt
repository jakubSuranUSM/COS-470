They're building him up
You see his face on TV
He's turning up
In every magazine

Got his sights set on you
He's a man of renown
But you're nobody's fool
Cause you've been around

Now he's everybody's hero
The talk of the town
Everybody's hero let you down
Just another hero on the ground

You knew him when
he was nothing at all
You remember a friend
Who never thought he could fall

And the world looked so dim
When you opened your eyes
You watched his will to win
Cut him down to size

Now he's everybody's...

Too late to worry
When you're standing tall
Too soon to cry
When you lose it all

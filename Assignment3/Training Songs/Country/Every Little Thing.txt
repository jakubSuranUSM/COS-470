You really don't know Exactly what you're doin to me, do you?
I try to play it cool but I'm a fool 
Each time you look at me that way
Your way, what can I say
Boy you turn me on

Whoo
Smile
You got the kind of smile that's so perfectly indescribable
Eyes bluer than the bluest bluebird flying up in the bluest sky
No lie, that I am falling for 

[Chorus]
Every little thing about you 
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to 
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just want to celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you 
Every little thing

Yeah
Touch me and suddenly 
I'm on a roller coaster ride a thrill a minute
Hang on to every word that ever rolls
So soft and sweetly from your lips
That kiss Your tenderness

[Chorus]
Every little thing about you 
Every little thing that you do
Feels the way its supposed to 
When you la-la-la love someone
Just the way that heaven made it
I just want to celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing about you 
Every little thing

Its just like someone looked down at me, and they
Knew every little thing about me
Needed every little thing about you 

Just the way that heaven made it 
I just want to celebrate it
From the gold in the sun to the silver in the moon
And every little thing

Every little thing about you 
Every little thing that you do 
Feels the way its supposed to 
When you la-la-la Love someone
Just the way that heaven made it (Oh)
I just want to celebrate it (Yeah I do)
From the gold in the sun to the silve in the moon

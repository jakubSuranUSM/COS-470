I like to speak my mind
Say grace at supper time
I'm just a dot on the map

ain't scared to take a stand
For this little piece of land
Don't make me take you out back

Tattoos, sweet tea, NASCAR Sunday
Hard hat, head back to work on Monday

My kind of country
Little league, bass boats and good clean fun
That's my kind of country
Roots run deep as they come
In my kind of country

I'm from the old school
Live by the golden rule
Ain't no strangers around here

I like the simple life
Sit a spell, have a bite
Honey, get that man a beer

Cornbread, collard greens, mama?s fried chicken
Blue jeans, work boots, I'm still kicking

My kind of country
Football, four-wheeling, good clean fun
That's my kind of country
Roots run deep as they come
In my kind of country, yeah, that's my kind of country

We got Johnny Cash, Back in Black, Southern rock 'n' roll
.38, Skynyrd, turn up that radio

My kind of country
Camouflage, hunting dogs, good clean fun
That's my kind of country
Roots run deep as they come

My kind of country
Backyard barbecue, get you some
That's my kind of country
Roots run deep as they come
In my kind of country

Pick up trucks and dirt roads
Ah, the fourth of July, salute the flag
Yeah, my kind of country
That, that, that's my kind of country

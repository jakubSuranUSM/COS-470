It's so hard to fight a memory
Only time can be a healer of the past
And the thorns of love are many
When they're clingin' to a love that didn't last
Yesterday is over and his memory
Will fade away with time
So I'll accept a rose and just be patient
Till all your love is mine

I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose
I can bear the pain for a while
Even though my heart knows
You'll be thinkin' of him when
We're makin' love, it always shows
I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose

The road of love is rocky and
Behind the blue sky there's a thousand storms
But a smile or a touch or a love word's
Like a rose among the thorns
When you say you love me
It erases all the worries on my mind
'Cause you'll be with me tonight
For a little while his memory's left behind

I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose
I can bear the pain for a while
Even though my heart knows
You'll be thinkin' of him when
We're makin' love, it always shows
I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose

I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose

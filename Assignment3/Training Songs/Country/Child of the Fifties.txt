I grew up a child of the fifties
Learned to dance to the beat of rock and roll
Television was my friend, I Love Lucy, Rin Tin Tin
Kissed my first girl when I was 10 years old

Took a turn for the worse in the sixties
Saw some real people die on TV
I learned love's hard cold facts, paid my first income tax
One small step for the man I'm gonna be

And I'll never feel bad 'bout the times that we had
I'll never look back in regret
The heaven you gave, I will treasure and save
Cause it might be as close as I get

The seventies were ten years of re-runs
News of Watergate was nothin' new
The democrats got it, we fell in love again
When Elvis died, we all knew that we could too

Now I'm facin' the most of the eighties
Old enough to run for President
It's hard to think it's me, the father of three
Oh America, I don't know where it went

And I'll never feel bad 'bout the times that we had
I'll never look back in regret
The heaven you gave, I will treasure and save
Cause it might be as close as I get

The heaven you gave, I will treasure and save
Cause it might be as close as I get

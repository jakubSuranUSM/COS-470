I'm a bit run down, but I'm okay
Just feel like callin' it a day
But you send me back to the start
You drive a hard bargain

Each time I'm headin' for nowhere
Doomed and determined to go there
It seems I never get far
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain

How's a girl supposed to fail
With someone like you around them?
I've tried and tried to no avail
You just can't seem to let me down
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain

How's a girl supposed to fail
With someone like you around them?
I've tried and tried to no avail
You just can't seem to let me down
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain

So I'll keep on playin' that old song
'Cause for all I know it's where I belong
When the world is breaking my heart
You drive a hard bargain

You send me back to the start
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain

I'm a bit run down, but I'm okay

I've finally found a place where I can take it
All this loneliness you left behind.
On a mountain that's no hill for a climber.
Just one step up, sit back and pour the wine.

CHORUS

I climb up on barstool mountain.
High above your world where there's no pain.
And I'm the king of barstool mountain.
Pretending I don't love you once again.

At closing time I step down off the mountain.
I'm strong enough to make it without you.
I know that I'll be right back here tomorrow.
Too weak to sober up and face the truth
And...

(chorus)

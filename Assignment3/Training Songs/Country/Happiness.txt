Happiness happiness the greatest gift that I posses
I thank the Lord I've been blessed with more than my share of happiness
To me this old world is a wonderful place
And I'm just about the luckiest human in the whole human race
I've got no silver and I've got no gold just a whole lot of happiness in my soul
Happiness happiness...
Happiness to me is an ocean tide or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love
Happiness is a field of grain lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine I breathe it in the rain happiness everywhere
Happiness happiness...
A wise old man told me one time that happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
That you don't count my money count my happiness
Happiness happiness...
Happiness happiness...

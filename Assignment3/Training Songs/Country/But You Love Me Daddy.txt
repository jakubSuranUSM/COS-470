Your five year old face
Is a dirty disgrace
But you love me, daddy

You scatter your toys
And you make too much noise
But you love me, daddy

You know little lad
You can be pretty bad
But you love me, daddy

You wake me at dawn
When I want to sleep on
But you love me, daddy

Now you eat the cookies
When I tell you, no
But you love me, daddy
'Cause you tell me so

And you're so hard to scold
'Cause your my five year old
Because you love me, daddy

When I dress you up
You go play with the pup
But you love me, daddy

When I use the phone
You won't leave me alone
But you love me, daddy

You make sister wail
Pulling her pony tail
But you love me, daddy

You scratch up the floor
And you write on the door
But you love me, daddy

You ask foolish questions
Now, you know that true
But you love me, daddy
Now you know that you do

You're so hard to scold
'Cause you're my five year old
Because you love me, daddy

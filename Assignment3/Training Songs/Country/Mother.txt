Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb

Mother do you think they'll like the song

Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
Ooh ah, mother should I build a wall
Mother should I run for president
Mother should I trust the government
Mama will they put me in the firing line
Ooh ah, is it it just a waste of time
Hush now baby baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama will keep baby cozy and warm
Ooh babe
Ooh babe
Ooh babe of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother do think she's good enough
For me
Mother do think she's dangerous
To me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Ooh ah, mother will she break my heart
Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up till you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Ooh baby
Ooh baby
Ooh baby
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high

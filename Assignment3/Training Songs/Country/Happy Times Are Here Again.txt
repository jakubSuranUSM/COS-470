Happy times are here again ain't felt like this since I don't know when
Baby's comin' in on the 12-0-10 happy times are here again
Well now I'm like a bird in the morning sun I'm like a bee in the honey comb
I'm like a child on Christmas morn happy times are here again

No more sleepless nights so long no more walking the floor till dawn
Hugs and kisses from now on hey happy times are here again
Happy times are here again...
Oh baby happy times are here again

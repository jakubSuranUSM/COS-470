Well, there he goes he hardly knows the heart he's breaking
I talked to him but I don't think he understood
So just forget about the plans that you were making
Heart we did all that we could

Don't blame these lips these hungry lips were pleading for you
They used all the tender words that they should
And if you break and fall apart I couldn't blame you
Heart we did all that we could

These misty eyes these tear filled eyes were picture taken
Grading all the memories that they could
They're the only thing you'll have when you're through breakin'
Heart we did all that we could heart we did all that we could

Let's have a hand for that young cowboy 
And wish him better luck next time 
And hope we see him up in Fargo 
Or somewhere farther down the line 
This time he sure drew a bad one 
One that nobody could ride 
But by the way he pulled his hat on 
You knew he'd be there for the fight 

And it's the classic contradiction 
The unavoidable affliction 
Well it don't take much to predict son 
The way it always goes 
One day she'll say she loves you 
And the next she'll be tired of you 
And push'll always come to shove you 
On that midnight rodeo 

He almost made it to the buzzer 
Somehow he gave up in the end 
He put one hand around the other 
And let that pickup man on in 
And it was his last chance to ride it 
And now he'll have to move along 
But he knows back in his mind that 
He won't be away for long 

And it's the classic contradiction 
It's the unavoidable affliction 
It don't take much to predict son 
The way it always goes 
Because one day she'll say she loves you 
And the next she'll be tired of you 
And push'll always come to shove you 
On that midnight rodeo 

So let's have a hand for that young cowboy 
And wish him better luck next time 
And hope we see him up in Fargo 
Or somewhere farther down the line

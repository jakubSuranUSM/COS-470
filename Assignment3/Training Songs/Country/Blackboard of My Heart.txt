When I was young and went to school 
 They taught me how to write 
 To take the chalk and make a mark 
 And hope it turns out right 
 Well that's the way it is with love 
 And what you did to me 
 I wrote it so you'd know 
 That I was yours eternally 
 
(Chorus) 
 But my tears have washed I love you 
 From the blackboard of my heart 
 It's too late to clean the slate 
 And make another start 
 I'm satisfied the way things are 
 Although we're far apart 
 My tears have washed I love you from 
 The blackboard of my heart 
 If you'd been true the way you should 
 And not have gone astray 
 These tears would not have fallen down 
 And washed the words away 
 No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk 
 Should write those words again It will be for someone else 
 Not things that might have been 
 (Chorus

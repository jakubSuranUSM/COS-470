I stopped by to look around
For things I left behind
With the years we spent together
There's no telling what I'll find
Not the keys or the records
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I had it
I was walking out your door

And I came by to get some things
I used to call my own
I didn't think that I'd need them
When I started out alone
It's not the books or the records
But my heart I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I felt it
I was walking out your door

But I don't know where to start
Looking for the lonely heart
Oh I could tear this place apart if you won't mind it
On a shelf behind the booze
In the closer on a roof
If you'd only help me look I know I'll find it

I stopped in to tell you
That there isn't any doubt
That the things I left here with you
Are the things I can't live without
You can keep all that I've ever owned
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the the last time I felt it
I was walking out your door

But I don't know where to start
Looking for the lonely heart
Oh I could tear this place apart if you won't mind it
Is it on a shelf behind the booze
On a closet on the roof
If you'd only help me look, I know we'll find it

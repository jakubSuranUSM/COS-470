Momma said don't go near that river
Don't be hangin' 'round old Catfish John
Come the mornin' I'd always be there
Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

Let me dream of another mor-ornin'
And a ti-ime so long ago
When the sweet magnolia blossom
Cotton fields were white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Livin' by the river bed
Thinkin' back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Momma said don't go near that river
Don't be hangin' 'round old Catfish John
Come the mornin' I'd always be there
Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
But still he never spo-oke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

Momma said don't go near that river
Don't be hangin' 'round old Catfish John
Come the mornin' I'd always be there
Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

Momma said don't go near that river
Don't be hangin' 'round old Catfish John
Come the mornin' I'd always be there [fade]

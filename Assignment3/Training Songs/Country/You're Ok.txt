I am wrought with paranoia
For I have brought myself before you
Nakedly awaiting you're okay
Now could I be that I annoy you
Flaunting ways that I adore you
I have no control here either way

I awake at night with it
And in spite of it
It unravels me
It's begun to frighten me

Is it so that my persistence
Blocks the path of least resistance?
Maybe I'm just getting in your way

But I'm alright
If you're okay
I'm alright
If you're okay

Can you offer some assistance?
Let me in on how for instance
I should be convincing you to sway

I awake at night with it
And in spite of it, it unravels me
It's begun to frighten me

But I'm alright
If you're okay
Yeah, I'm alright

I didn't say we wouldn't hurt anymore
That's how you learn you just get burned
We don't have to feel like dirt anymore
Though love's not learned baby it's our turn
We were always looking for true love
With our heads in the clouds
Just a little off course
But I left that motor running
Now if you're feeling down and out

Come on baby drive south
With the one you love
Come on baby drive south

I'm not talking about retreating no sir
Gonna take our stand in this chevy van
Windows open on the rest of the world
Holding hands all the way to dixie land
We've been trying to turn our lives around
Since we were little kids
It's been wearing us down
Don't turn away now darling
Lets fire it up and wind it out

Come on baby drive south
With the one you love
Come on baby drive south

I heard your momma calling
I think she was only stalling
Don't know who she's talking to
Baby me or you
We can go south with a smile on
Ain't going to pack my nylons
Just leave these legs showing
It gets hot down where were going

We were always looking for true love
With our heads in the clouds
Just a little off course
But I left that motor running
Now if you're feeling down and out

Come on baby drive south
With the one you love
Come on baby drive south

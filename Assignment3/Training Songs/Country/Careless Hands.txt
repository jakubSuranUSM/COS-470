I let my heart fall into careless hands
Careless hands that broke my heart in two
You held my dreams like worthless strings of sand
Careless hands don't care when dreams secure

You've brought me joy and oh, I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make roses grow
If you don't change someday, you'll know the sorrow
Careless hands that can't hold on to love

You've brought me joy and oh, I loved you so
But all that sunshine didn't make roses grow
If you don't change someday, you'll know the sorrow
Careless hands that can't hold on to love

She has got the swing, alike in my backyard
She has got the move but she don't go too far
Shock and shiver, quake and quiver
She'll deliver when you're with her, yeah, uh huh

Spinning like a top, rolling with a rock
Start her up and she don't stop
She's shakin', she's shakin'

She's shakin', shakin in her shoes
And breakin', breakin' hearts to it
Makin' all the news tonight

And she's wakin', wakin' out the town
And I'm achin', achin' up and down
'Cause she's shakin'
With her shoes tonight

When she's on the street
Heads are turnin' 'round
The girls don't ever speak
But the boys all gather 'round

When she's hoppin'
She keeps poppin'
Can't quit rockin'
Ain't no stoppin' now, uh huh

Up and down the block, keepin' hearts a pop
Makes us crazy round the clock
She's shakin', she's shakin'

She's shakin' shakin' in her shoes
And breakin', breakin' hearts to it
And makin' out the news tonight

She's wakin', wakin' out the town
And I'm achin', achin' up and down
'Cause she's shakin', shakin'
With her shoes tonight

Oh, up and down the block
Keepin' hearts a pop
Makes us crazy round the clock
She's shakin', she's shakin'

She's shakin', shakin' in her shoes
And breakin', breakin' hearts to it
And makin' all the news tonight

She's wakin', wakin' up the town
And I'm achin', achin' up and down
'Cause she's shakin', shakin'
In her shoes tonight

Ooh she's shakin', oh she's shakin'
Ooh she's shakin', shakin' in her shoes
Ooh she's shakin', ooh she's shakin'

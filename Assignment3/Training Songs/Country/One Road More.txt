Well my old shoes are layin' on the floor 'cause I ain't a-gonna wear 'em no more
They took me many miles down many hard roads but that's what shoes are for
The time has flown and I've outgrown every shoe I ever wore
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more

Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more

Well I never could move my feet too fast in a pair of rich man's shoes
And a rain shoe's life can last as long as a woman's blues
Well I told the line this one last time, now I got something else in store
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more

Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more

OK, let's go Joey

Well I've walked through the city streets in the sun and the rain and the wind and the snow
And I've walked through the mountains and the valleys when there was nowhere else to go
This time I'll just follow the wind and it can blow and the rain can pour
And my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road more

Lord I ain't got a lick of sense, I got a crazy mind
'Cause I don't wanna leave and I don't wanna stay behind
Well at the end of this one last road they say there's always an open door
And I guess my bare feet will have to carry me one road more

Yeah my bare feet are gonna have to carry me one road more

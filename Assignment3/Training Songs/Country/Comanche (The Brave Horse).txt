The battle was over at Custers Last Stand
And taps were sounding for all the brave men
While one survivor, wounded and weak
Comanche, the brave horse, lay at the General's feet

Comache, you fought hard, Comanche, you tried
You were a good soldier so hold your head up high
For even the bravest sometimes must fall
Comanche, the brave horse, you gave your all

Though you are silent, our deeds did speak loud
If your buddies could see you, I know they'd be proud
The symbol of bravery at the Little Big Horn
Poor old Comanche, you're battle scarred and torn

Comanche, you fought hard, Comanche, you tried
You were a good soldier so hold your head up high
For even the bravest sometimes must fall
Comanche, the brave horse, you gave your all

Comanche, you fought hard, Comanche, you tried
You were a good soldier so hold your head up high
For even the bravest sometimes must fall
Comanche, the brave horse, you gave your all

I remember you back in nineteen-fifty-six
You had all the moves and you knew all the tricks
You left all the ladies in a hell of a fix
When your voice took wings

Then you'd shake around and oh, how'd you sing
Just an old boy from Memphis with a big diamond ring
A country girl's prayer and a city girls dream, hail the King

But it's alright now, keep on singin' loud
It's alright now, heaven should be proud

The fifties left town on a crowded dance floor
The sixties came in with a bang and a roar
The world heard a knock
It was Janis at the door, they let her in

And when it seemed this whole world was falling apart
The houselights would fall and the music would start
She'd be givin' us all the little piece of her heart once again

But it's alright now, keep on singin' loud
It's alright now, heaven should be proud

It was October in St. Louis town
When we heard that the Free Bird had fell to the ground
We all said a prayer before we went down to play

And Ronnie, my buddy, above all the rest
I miss you the most and I loved you the best
And now that you're gone I thank God
I was blessed just to know you

But it's alright now, keep on singin' loud
It's alright now, heaven should be proud

Frosty breath on the hillside, see that sun goin' down
Tracks in the snow to the city below
The lone wolf now he's coming to town
Lone wolf, he's lonesome and looking tonight
Oh you lone wolf, lock up your women and hide
Sneakin' down the back streets of town, he lives on the lam
Takes what he can, not giving a damn
You know how he is, he just do what he can
Lone wolf, he's lonesome and looking tonight
Oh you lone wolf, lock up your women and hide
Any fool can look in his eyes see that he's been around
Any movement better not make a sound
You know it's cold just livin' on the ground
Like a lone wolf, lockin' up the women tonight
Oh, lone wolf, lonesome and lookin' tonight

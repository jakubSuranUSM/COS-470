Chrome, she can see herself in the shiny grill and the
Wire wheels of a red Chevelle with four on the floor and the top down
Chrome, zippin' by on an Electra Glide
With dual tail pipes doin' 105 in the broad daylight
On the two-lane headin' outta town

Forget Pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome

Yeah, chrome baby

Chrome, she got her leg up high
On the bumper of my big black Mack truck
With a smoke stack pointed towards the sky
And mud flaps, you know the kind
Chrome, I said hey little girl you sure look nice
Do you want to ride, I won't bite, she climbs inside
Says hell no, I wanna drive

Forget Pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome

It's chrome alright,
Shiny, nice, polished
Chrome, chrome

Forget Pink and purple paisleys
Little mellow-yellow daisies
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow
Her favorite color is chrome

Her favorite color is, chrome
That girl is all about chrome
She sure loves chrome

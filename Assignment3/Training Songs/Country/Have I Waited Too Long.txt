Have I waited too long to say that I love you
Have I waited too long for my dreams to come true
Each day here I pray that you will forgive me
I know I was wrong have I waited too long
It seems that all started the day that we parted
I love you much more now than ever before
If you'll only forgive you'll never be sorry
I'll right every wrong have I waited too long
Have I waited too long to beg you forgiveness
Down hearted and blue always thinking of you
Each night in my dreams your memories haunt me
I just can't go on have I waited too long
It seems that all started the day that we parted

New York is a long way from Texas Vegas is a long way from Abilene
I spend lots of my time flying out to LA
If you've never been there you don't know how lonesome big towns can be
Oh what I'd give to be a country girl again to be with my people my man and my kids
To live in a house about a mile down the road from mama
Oh Lord what I'd give to be a country girl again

To go walking down a country road at sunset
And see colors you can almost touch right over head
To hear the gentle breeze of peace blowing at the treetops
No out in the country there is no talk that God is dead
Oh what I'd give to be...
Oh what I'd give to be a country girl again

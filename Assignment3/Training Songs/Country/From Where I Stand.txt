Funny,we should meet 
The three of us here on the street
You know I've wondered what I'd say
Now the moment's here
And suddenly it's crystal clear
Some things are never gonna change

From where I stand I see an old familiar story
Only the last time I was in your shoes
Now it's looking like it's my turn to be lonely
And I tell you I don't like the view

I was just like you
For me he left somebody too
And I didn't care if that was wrong
Oh but now I've found
The tears you cause come back around
And they're coming your way before too long

From where I stand we've got a lot in common and
There's a good chance you'll be standing one day
right here
Chorus

Today you wed a new love
And leave behind your blue love
I guess I've known it all along
I hear the organ playing
I know you'll soon be saying
The words that would make you his alone

Once I shared your love dear
Your dreams of happiness
What was in the future my heart just couldn't guess
That someday you'd find a new love
And leave behind your blue love
My life was only meant for misery

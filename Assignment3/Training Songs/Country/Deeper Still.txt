In the tears you gave to me
I found a river to an ocean
Concrete sky and a stone cold sea
I came to where the emptiness cracked open

All my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow
But I found my strength in forgiving you
I never even dreamed how far my heart could go

To give my life beyond each death
From a deeper well of trust
To know that when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love

In this life the love you give
Comes back around to be your treasure
What you lose will be what you win
A well that echoes down too deep to measure

A silver coin rings down that well
You can never spend too much
A diamond echoes deeper still
And you'll always have what you gave to love

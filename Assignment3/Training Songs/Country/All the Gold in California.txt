All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California,
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brand-new game.

Tryin' to be a hero, winding up a zero,
Can scar a man forever right down to your soul.
Living on the spotlight can kill a man outright
'Cause everything that glitters is not gold.

All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California,
It don't matter at all where you've played before.

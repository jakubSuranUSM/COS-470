Well these Highway 40 blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home

Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above I've paid my dues
Got the Highway 40 blues

The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead!
That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams my mind is numb
My money's gone stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway 40 blues

You know I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone from town to town
Met pretty girls I have to say
But none of them could make me stay

Well I've played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things a country boy can't use 
Dixieland, I sure miss you
Got the Highway 40 blues

You say I need a rest
Why don't I go and see my sister way out west
That's very thoughtful of you dear
And I'm really touched with all this tenderness

But us women are suspicious things
We know that men aren't born with wings
What's making you so kind? Now, I'm not smart
But I'm not blind and I think that you've got evil on your mind

You think that you've been good about as long
As most red blooded human could
We've been together for so long
I know another pasture's looking good

But don't think that other men don't look at me
That certain way from time to time
Don't think that you're the only one
That must contend with evil on your mind

Your mind is in a harem
And surrounded by exotic dancing girls
You're hearing pretty music
As they run their slender fingers through your curls

Ah, dream on baby

I thank you for the flowers and the candy
Honey, that was very kind
For that's your way of telling me
You're sorry for the evil on your mind

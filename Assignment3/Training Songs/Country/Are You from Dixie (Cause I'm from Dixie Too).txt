Hello, there, stranger! how do you do? 
There's something I'd like to say to you 
Don't be surprised 
You're recognized! 
I'm no detective but I've just surmised. 
You're from the place where I long to be, 
Your smiling face seems to say to me, 
You're from my own land, 
My sunny homeland, 
Tell me can it be?

It was a way back in eighty nine, 
I crossed the old Mason Dixon line 
Gee! but I've yearned, 
Longed to return 
To all the good old pals I left behind. 
My home is way down in Alabam' 
On a plantation near Birmingham, 
And one thing's certain, 
I'm surely flirtin' 
With those southbound trains:

Are you from Dixie? 
I said from Dixie! 
Where the fields of cotton beckon to me. 
I'm glad to see you, 
Tell me how be you 
And the friends I'm longing to see. 
If you're from Alabama, Tennessee or Caroline 
Any place below the Mason Dixon line
Then you're from Dixie, 
Hurrary for Dixie! 
'Cause I'm from Dixie too!

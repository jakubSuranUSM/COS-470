Till the rivers all run dry 
Till the sun falls from the sky 
Till life on earth is through 
I'll be needing you 

I know sometimes you may wonder 
From little things I say and do 
But there's no need for you to wonder 
If I need you cause I'll need you 

Till the rivers all run dry 
Till the sun falls from the sky 
Till life on earth is through 
I'll be needing you 

Too many times I don't tell you 
Too many things get in the way 
And even though sometimes I hurt you 
Still you show me in every way 

Till the rivers all run dry 
Till the sun falls from the sky 
Till life on earth is through 
I'll be needing you

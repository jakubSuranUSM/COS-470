I saw this boy and girl tonight
Reminded me of you and I in better days
Then I saw him steal a kiss
I realize you're all I miss and that's all it takes

I get that heart achin' on the edge of breakin'
Never ending road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome, low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

It's been forever since I've seen ya
The grass still isn't any greener on the other side
Someone told me, "Live and learn, play with fire and you'll get burned"
And I did, now I'm paying the price, when

I get that heart achin' on the edge of breakin'
Never ending road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome, low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

I tell myself I'm over you
Then I wake up to the cold, hard truth again and again

I get that heart achin' on the edge of breakin'
Never ending road that's twistin'
Takin' me back to where we were back then
I get that high lonesome, low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

I get that high lonesome, low down and then some
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin again
Whiskey drinkin', what was I thinkin'
Why I ever left you feelin' again

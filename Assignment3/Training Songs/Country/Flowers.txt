I should've took you dancin'
A little candle light romancin', with roses
But I was high upon a bar stool
I was such a blind fool, now I know it
You won't believe how much I've changed since you left
It took loosin' you, for me to find myself 

Oh, I wish that you could see me
Steady hands without the whiskey, you'd be so proud
Got that job down at the factory 
A brand new suit for Sunday, I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junk-yard, they've still got our car

I still see you on your knees
Beggin' me not to drive
But I took away the keys
And made you climb inside
An' I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had the power
Look what it took 
For me to finally bring you flowers

Oh, I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had the power
Look what it took 
For me to finally bring you flowers
Just look what it took 
For me to finally bring you flowers

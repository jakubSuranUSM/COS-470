(Steve Wilkinson/Amanda Wilkinson)

Boy oh boy looked at me
Boy oh boy smiled that way
Boy oh boy this heart of mine stood still
Thought my world was unaffected
'Til the moment I least expect it
Boy oh boy love's moving in for the kill

And I'm fallin' this spell I'm under
I don't know what's up or down
I'm fallin it makes me wonder
Why I've spent time foolin' 'round with boys
Boy oh boy this must be love

Boy oh boy I feel so shaken
Boy oh boy can't be mistaken
This is more than passion at first sight
His brown eyes tell the truth
I'm sure he feels the way I do
'Cause boy oh boy I'm certain
That it's right, right, right

And I'm fallin' this spell I'm under
I don't know what's up or down
I'm fallin it makes me wonder
Why I've spent time foolin' 'round with boys
Boy oh boy this must be love

I'll be sweet and charmin'
I'll be coy, oh yeah
But when I'm in his arms
Boy oh boy

And I'm fallin' this spell I'm under
I don't know what's up or down
I'm fallin it makes me wonder
Why I've spent time foolin' 'round with boys
Boy oh boy this must be love

Must be love 
It must be love 
Boy oh boy this is love 
It must be love 
It must be love 
It must be love

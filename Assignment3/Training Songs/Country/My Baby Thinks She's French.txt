My baby thinks she's French
My baby thinks she's French
She plays a Spanish guitar
At the coffee bar
She's takin' self-defense
My baby thinks she's French

She like the rose perfume
In the afternoon with her chocolate mints
She thinks she's French, she likes to kiss and kiss
Her flame is hard to quench

My baby thinks she's French
My baby thinks she's French
She drive a Citroen car
She sings me "Ooh-Wa-Wa"
She's prone to accidents
My baby thinks she's French

Well, it's Paris this
And it's Paris that, it makes me cringe
She thinks she's French, she likes to kiss and kiss
Her flame is hard to quench

My baby thinks she's French
My baby thinks she's French
She reads Mademoiselle
And when the clock strikes twelve
She wants to give me a pinch
My baby thinks she's French

She's a Texas doll
She likes shopping malls where the mood is French
With a southern drawl
They say "Come back, y'all"
And they never even flinch

My baby thinks she's French
My baby thinks she's French
She wants to start a fire
In the Eiffel Tower
She's lost all common sense
My baby thinks she's French

She likes the Moulin Rouge
When the sun shines through
She seldom squints
She breeds magnificence

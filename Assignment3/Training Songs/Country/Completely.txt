Completely, want to give my love completely
I'd rather be alone than 
Be in love just half the way
I want to find someone that I can trust
Completely, want to give my heart completely
To someone who'll completely 
Give their heart to only me
And when I find that one
That's when I'll fall in love

Completely
Not half but whole
With heart and soul
Completely
Not in between
But everything
Completely
That's the way it's gotta be
The way I want someone 
To fall in love with me

Forever want to feel the word forever
And know there'll be somebody 
There forever by my side
And when that feeling comes
That's when I'll give my love

Completely
Not half but whole
With heart and soul
Completely
Not in between
But everything
Completely
That's the way it's gotta be
The way I want someone 
To fall in love with me

It's all or nothing at all 
For this heart of mine
And I won't give up this heart 
Till the day I find
Someone who needs me

Completely
Not half but whole
With heart and soul
Completely
Not in between
But everything
Completely
That's the way it's gotta be
The way I want someone 
To fall in love with me

The way I need someone 
To fall in love with me

Miracles appear in the strangest of places 
Fancy me finding you here
The last time I saw you was just out of Houston 
Let me sit down and buy you a beer
Your presence is welcome with me and my friend here
'Cause this is a hangout of mine
We come here quite often to listen to music 
And to taste yesterday's wine

Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
Agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine

You give the appearance of one widely traveled 
But lord, I'll bet you've seen things in your time
Come sit down here with us and tell us your story 
If it's true you like yesterday's wine

Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine
Yesterday's wine, yesterday's wine
We're agin' with time like yesterday's wine

I can tell by looking you've got fears in your heart
You're hoping no one else can see
But you can't hide feelings from someone who cares
Open up and let it out and count on me

Count on me
(For doing my share)
Count on me
(You know that I care)
Count on me
(I'll always be there)
Count on me

Count on me
(When others won't hear)
Count on me
(When there's no one else near)
Count on me
(I'll be right here)
Count on me

I hear the sounds you're making but the words don't ring true
There's something here that didn't used to be
If there's something wrong inside you, tell me now what you need
And together we can heal it, count on me

Count on me
(When others leave you)
Count on me
(When they don't believe you)
Count on me
(I'll always be true)
Count on me

Count on me
(For doing my share)
Count on me
(You know that I care)
Count on me
(I'll always be there)
Count on me

Count on me
(When others leave you)
Count on me
(When they don't believe you)
Count on me
(I'll always be true)
Count on me

Count on me
(For doing my share)
Count on me
(You know that I care)
Count on me
(I'll always be there)
Count on me

You can count on me

Together we stand, divided we fall
Come on now people, let's get on the ball and work together
Come on, come on let's work together, now now people
Because together we will stand, every boy every girl and a man 

Before when things go wrong, as they sometimes will
And the road you travel, it stays all uphill
Let's work together, come on, come on, let's work together
You know together we will stand, every boy, girl, woman and a man 
 
Oh well now, two or three minutes, two or three hours
What does it matter now, in this life of ours
Let's work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now now people
Because together we will stand, every boy, every woman and a man 

Oh come on, let's work together

Oh well now, make someone happy, make someone smile,
Let's all work together and make life worthwhile
Let's work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now now people
Because together we will we stand, every boy, girl, woman and a man
 
Well now, together we will stand,
Every boy, girl, woman and a man

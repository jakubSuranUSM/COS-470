Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a'breaking
In my soul

Oh where are our dear fathers?
Oh where are our dear fathers?
They are down in the valley a'praying
Day is a'breaking

In my soul

Oh where are our dear mothers?
Oh where are our dear mothers?
They are gone to heaven a'shouting
Day is a'breaking
In my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a'breaking
In my soul

I stood close enough to hear you say
"Do as the beautiful ones do"
Tore up my picture from it's frame
I just wanted to be one of you 

I'm standing on the outside
Looking in
Funny how you see the truth
But the feeling does come back
To you 

She's crazy as anyone can be
that's what they say
They say of me
Wanting love, can make one do
It isn't my fault, heredity 

I'm standing on the outside
Looking, looking
State of grace, state of sin.
I'm standing on the outside,
Looking, looking
Cannot feel a single thing
But the feeling does come back, again 

This morning feels like yesterday
Yesterday follows me around
Where do you go when no one cares
Six-feet under, under ground 

I'm standing on the outside
Looking, looking
State of grace, state of sin
I'm standing on the outside
Looking, looking
Cannot feel a single thing
But the feeling will come back, again
Again

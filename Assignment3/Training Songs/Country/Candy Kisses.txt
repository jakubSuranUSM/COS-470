Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper you'd rather have them any old time
You don't mean it when you whisper those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear

I build a castle out of dreams dear I thought that you were building one too
Now my castles all have fallen and I am left alone and blue
Once my heart was filled with gladness now there's sadness only tears
Candy kisses wrapped in paper mean more to you than mine do dear

Someone wave goodbye, come and wave goodbye
I'll be leaving, won't you hold the door?
Well, if I said I love you
Well, I don't love you anymore

I know it's gonna hurt but you treated me like dirt
I always replay every day at home
Well, if you think you're lucky
Well, you're not lucky anymore

Well, we burn like a rocket
You said you loved me just like I loved you
But find a dime in your pocket
And you're on the phone to someone new

Well, we burn like a rocket
You said you loved me just like I loved you
But find a dime in your pocket
And you're on the phone to someone new

Someone had to pray
One of us had to pray
Now I do without
All the things I need you for

Well, if I said I loved you
Well, I don't love you anymore
Oh, yes, if I said I love you
Well, I don't love you anymore

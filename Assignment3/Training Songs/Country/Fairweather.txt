Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever

I should of seen it coming from a mile away
I guess I wasn't counting on a rainy day
Soon as I could swear the sky was falling down
You were out of ever falling head to ground
Get out of town

Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye, so long, Fairweather

I'm really like a flower in a hurricane
But sending us a shower wash away my pain
Clouds are blowing over everything is fine
Rainbow on my shoulder in a sweet sunshine
It is all mine

Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye, so long, Fairweather

Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
I'm lighter than a feather
Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
Goodbye, so long, Fairweather
Be gone
Goodbye, so long, Fairweather

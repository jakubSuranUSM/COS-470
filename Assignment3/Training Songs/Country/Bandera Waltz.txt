I danced with an a-a-ange-el
On a night 'neath the stars
Cowboys were singin'
And playin' guitars

The song they were play-ay-ayin'
Was a beautiful waltz
They called it Bander-er-er-era
The Bandera Waltz

The music so sweet
Seemed to whisper to me
She loves me, she loves me
What else could it be

She's gone and left me-ee
With a love that was fa-alse
I'll remember Bander-er-er-era-a-a-a-a
And the Bandera Waltz

The music so sweet
Seemed to whisper to me
She loves me, she loves me
What else could it be

She's gone and left me-ee
With a love that was fa-alse
I'll remember Bander-er-er-era-a-a-a-a
And the Bandera Waltz

I've been sitting here alone all night
Thinking 'bout things that I'm gonna write
When you read this goodbye note you'll know I've had enough
But it should come at no surprise to you
Knowing you treat me the way you do
You've made lovin' too hard and living too rough
I just need a good place to start
To say what I really feel in my heart
And what I'm gonna write to you is long overdue
And don't expect me to change my mind
Or try to read something between the lines
Make no mistake about it baby, we're through
But every word I write comes out I love you
I just want to say it's over no matter how I try
Every word I write comes out I love you
Guess I've loved you much too long to say goodbye

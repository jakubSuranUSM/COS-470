How many times have you let me down
You never stay when you come around
I see no reason why you have to slip away

Come on in while I pour the wine
We'll drink it slow and take our time
No need to hurry
You don't have to slip away

I like the drawn out test to test
I like my feet right on the ground
I take a long time getting on
To matters close at hand
Why don't you stick around?

Why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?
I said, now why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?
I see no reason why should have to slip away

The time is ours so we'll raise a glass
Here we are alone at last
Don't have to worry
I won't let you get away

I like the drawn out test to test
I like my feet right on the ground
I take a long time getting on
To matters close at hand
Why don't you stick around?

Why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?
I said, now why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?

Why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?
I said now why don't you?
Why don't you stick around?
Oh, hoo, hoo
I see no reason why you have to slip away

Why don't you
Why don't you stick around?
I said, now why don't you
Why don't you stick around?
Oh, hoo, hoo
I see no reason why you have to slip away

Why don't you
Why don't you stick around?
I said now why don't you, why don't you?

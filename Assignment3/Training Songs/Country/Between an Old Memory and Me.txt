I was sittin' at a table
In a little club downtown
Playin' songs on the jukebox
And pourin' whiskey down

When I heard a sweet voice sayin'
"Would you like some company?"
And I had to tell her
This is just between
an old memory and me

All my friends tell me
That I'm a fool for holding on
I know their trying to help me
But I've been a fool too long

And I don't want to talk about it
So why can't they just let me be?
'Cause this is just between
An old memory and me

And I'm not hurtin' anybody
As far as I can see
I just need to be alone sometimes
While she goes walkin' through my mind

Oh, I'm not hurtin' anybody, yeah
As far as I can see
I just need to be alone sometimes
While she goes walkin' through my mind

And I don't want to talk about it
So why can't everybody see?
This is just between
An old memory and me

Oh, Yeah, Yeah!

This is just between
Her memory and me

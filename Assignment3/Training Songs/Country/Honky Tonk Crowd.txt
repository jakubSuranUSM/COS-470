When I was a baby, my sweet momma told me
Go around this world and see all that you can see
Find a good woman, get a job and settle down
But I could not stay away from the lights of town
I had to go where the music is loud
I fell in with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd

There's was debutante in Dallas, that nearly blew my mind
She was raised on caviar and real fine wine
She didn't like hillbilly music and that was more than I could take
I left that lovely little cowgirl waiting in the Lonestar state
'Cause I had to go where the music is loud
I'm right at home with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
'Cause I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd

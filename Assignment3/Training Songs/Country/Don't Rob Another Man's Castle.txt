They say a man's home is his castle and he's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside of track but everything in it's his own
So don't think of taking his loved one it's written Thou shall not steal
So don't rob another man's castle no matter how lonesome you feel

Now don't rob another man's castle don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know how much you'll pay
So don't rob a man of his loved ones you'll break his heart don't you see
I robbed another man's castle now someone just took her from me

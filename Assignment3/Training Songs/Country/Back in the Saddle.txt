(Matraca Berg/Stan Lynch)

I came down from the Cadillac dude ranch, health spa
Nestled on the edge of town
For fourteen days I've been herbal wrapped, mud packed
Now I'm bustin' out
Well, I thought the wild west wasn't for me
You walked up like a bow-legged dream
When you said yes ma'am I thought I'd scream

Oh, put me in your big ol' pick up truck
Take me to the rodeo
I don't know a thing about broncin' bucks
And I can't do-si-do
But I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Yeah, stand you up tall
I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Yeah, and that ain't all

Well, it must've been the burned out new age coffee house
So called sensitive guys
I never thought a leatherneck suckin' on a long neck
Could make my temperature rise
But you're so sweet, baby, you're so fine
You bring the barbecue and I'll bring the wine
We'll dance all night Ã”til your belt buckle shines

Oh, put me in your big ol' pick up truck
Take me to the rodeo
I don't know a thing about broncin' bucks
And I can't do-si-do
But I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Yeah, stand you up tall
I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Every time you fall

Well, I might be in a yuppie funk
You might think I'm a little bit drunk
But all I know is a hunk is a hunk

Oh, put me in your big ol' pick up truck
Take me to the rodeo
I don't know a thing about broncin' bucks
And I can't do-si-do
But I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Yeah, stand you up tall
I can put you back in the saddle, baby
Yeah, and that ain't all

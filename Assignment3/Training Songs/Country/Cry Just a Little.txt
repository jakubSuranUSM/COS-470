Do your dreams ever take you back when love was new
Does your heart ever long for those days when love was true
Seems like that magic of yesterday has just slipped away
So, my darlin', before you go
Oh, I hope you know

[Chorus]
I'm gonna cry just a little, I'll die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you
Cry just a little, I'll die just a little
'Cause I still love you and I'll always love you
I still remember when

we used to laugh at the silly things that we used to say
Now the song that I sing to you just turns you away
I never knew lovers could turn into strangers over night
How could I be so blind to the danger
Oh, it's just not right

[Chorus]

Going crazy outta my mind these days
So much shit I gotta decide these days
Listenin' to all the lies they say (say)
Starting up my car, I'm trying to get away
Seems like I've been driving all day
Smoking and drinking all by myself
Hoping they're wishing I find myself

Lost and alone
Come find me
I just wanna feel loved
Come try me
Lost and alone

I've been looking but I haven't found nothing yet
She been trying to kick it all the time but I am just
Posted, chilling all by myself, weed crumbs on my thumbs getting high as hell
Kush smoke, chase it down with a little liquor
Then I hop off the freeway just to swerve through the city
Got cop lights behind me, damn, I hope they don't kill me like whoosh ahh
Calm down, rubbin' on my temples

I'm smoking and drinking all by myself
Hoping and wishing I find myself
In the late night catching a vibe by myself
Lord willing we don't die tonight we gon' fly tonight
And I fly by myself
Realizing that I can't hide from myself
Close my eyes just to see what's inside of myself
I cry by myself

Lost and alone
Come find me
I just wanna feel loved
Come try me
Lost and alone

My sister say I'm changing a lot
Someone by the water finally made it straight outta Compton
Father calling me, like, "Son we hardly see you at all
Yeah, I know you out here shining but you can't do it all by yourself"
And I can hear the voice of my mom, telling me to pray for understanding, wisdom and knowledge
Wish I knew what I know now back when I dropped out of college
Sometimes I feel like I can have way more shit accomplished
It don't matter 'cause

I'm smoking and drinking all by myself
Hoping and wishing I find myself
In the late night catching a vibe by myself
Lord willing we don't die tonight we gon' fly tonight
And I fly by myself
Realizing that I can't hide from myself
Close my eyes just to see what's inside of myself
I cry by myself

Lost and alone
Come find me
I just wanna feel loved
Come try me
Lost and alone

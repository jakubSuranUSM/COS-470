First time I saw her in them cut off jeans
I knew that I'd be in for a treat
Next thing I knew she had me tongue-tied
She had me shakin' from my head to my feet
Never should'a underestimated her eyes
Her smile or them long, long legs
Now she's got me down on my hands and knees
And all I can is beg

Haywire
She's got me goin' haywire
I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired
She's got my soul feeling inspired
And full o' desire
She's hotter than fire
She's got me going haywire
Haywire

Every time we take a little ride in my truck
She likes the country turned way up
Do a little dancin' on a long dirt road
She likes to show me the definition of love
Take a little dip in the river at night
Way out under the stars
Fresh air is good for a country girl
And that country girl is good for my heart

Haywire
She's got me goin' haywire
I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired
She's got my soul feeling inspired
And full o' desire
She's hotter than fire
She's got me going haywire
Haywire

Haywire
She's got me goin' haywire
I'll never get tired
Never seen a woman do what she can do
Inspired
She's got my soul feeling inspired
And full o' desire
She's hotter than fire
She's got me going haywire
Haywire

She's hotter than fire
She's got me going haywire
Haywire

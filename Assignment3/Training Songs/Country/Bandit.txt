(Ole, a cangacheiro, you bandit from Brazil) 
(Ole, he is the bandit, the bandit from Brazil) 

I'm the quickest on the trigger
When I shoot I shoot to kill 
I'm a hero down in Rio
Where they talk about me still

Once I robbed a big ranchero
Who was rich beyond compare 
And to ransom held his daughter
She was young and she was fair 

(Ole, a cangacheiro, you bandit from Brazil) 
(Ole, he is the bandit, the bandit from Brazil) 

She was sweet and she was tender
There was lovelight in her eyes 
In my arms she soon surrendered
Very much to my surprise

I refused her father's ransom
And I kept the greater prize 
Now at night we ride together 
'Neath the blue Brazilian sky 

Adios to you, Amigo, Adios to you, my friend 
Ole, O Cangacheiro, the Bandit of Brazil

I dip my toe in the water
Before I know it I'm in over my head
I try and warm my self by the fire
But I end up getting burned instead
I sold my soul for a little bit of heaven
Put my heart in the wrong hands 
I've gone places where 
I swore I would never go again
See I've never had any trouble falling
I'm just trying to find a place to land

I drew me a line in the crossing
Speed up when I should slow down
Well dang if I don't stay up in it
When I probably should go around
Always thinking that's its gonna be forever
Always thinking it's a good thing
All I know is that I'm giving everything I can
See I've never had any trouble falling
I'm still trying to find a place to land

Still tryin' to find a place to land
Still tryin' to find a place to land
Still tryin' to find a place to land

I told myself that I had it
I told myself I was through
Said I'm leaving love for the fool hearted
But that was before I found you
I'm on the edge baby I'm looking over
All my love here I go again
If I seem a little bit afraid
Baby try to understand
See I never had any trouble falling
I'm just trying to find a place to land

Still trying to find a place to land
Still trying to find a place to land
Still trying to find a place to land
Still trying to find a place to land

Going through the change, when it rains it pours these days
Nothing stays the same, you gotta find new ways
To swim upstream, while you chase your dreams
And in between you keep your sanity

Chorus:
Waiting on life to Level
Waiting on something stable
Maybe soon I'll be able
To rest my head again

Never thought I'd see the day, I'd hear the old man say
It could end this way, why did it end this way
And the young kids know, they'll be on their own
And you can't go home; no you can't go home

Waiting on life to Level
Waiting on something stable
Maybe soon I'll be able
To rest my head again

Ups and Downs, what goes around comes around
They don't get the hint downtown; they try to hold you down

Waiting on life to Level
Waiting on something stable
Maybe soon I'll be able
To rest my head again

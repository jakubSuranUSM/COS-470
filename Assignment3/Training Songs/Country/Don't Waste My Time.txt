I've been here before
It only made me cry
I felt so sure
I never questioned why
Till I woke up alone
That's why I have to ask you
Baby what's behind your kiss
I need to know your heart's in this

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the kind of love
That is strong enough
To walk through anything
So don't waste my time
So don't waste my time
I only want to play for keeps
want to fall in deep
If you don't just say goodbye
Don't waste my time

The words you say
Are what I want to hear
Promises you make
Are music to my ears
Is it the heat of the moment talking
Promises come easily
Give me something to believe

[Chorus]

Time, time, time, time

[Chorus: x2]

Don't waste my time

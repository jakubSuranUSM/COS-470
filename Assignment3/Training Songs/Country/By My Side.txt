There's so much breakin' up
Folks who won't fall in love
Put up shelves, guard themselves
Build walls

And it makes me cry sometimes
'Cause people live lonely lives
They don't want to try
They don't want to live at all

But I'm not gonna be afraid
To give up my heart that way
'Cause I need you
I need you by my side

And I'm not gonna say I'm strong
Out here in this world alone
'Cause I need you
I need you by my side

And when you find someone
Someone you really love
It makes life easier to bear

But some folks live on their own
Shut themselves in at home
They never find out what love's all about
'Cause they're scared

But I'm not gonna be afraid
To give up my heart that way
'Cause I need you
I need you by my side

I'm not gonna say I'm strong
Out here in this world alone
'Cause I need you
I need you by my side

'Cause I need you
I need you by my side

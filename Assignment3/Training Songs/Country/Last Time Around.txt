Well, a vial of love you used to save
but even that's distilled away
locked inside a closet made of sand.
Well, the silver anesthetized your veins
like the chilling damp December rain.
How can you look at me as if you still don't see?
 The last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
Well, I watched the storm engulf you in
like the death cries of a wounded friend
just beyond the reach of Satan's grasp.
And now I feel it in your baby's breath.
You'll never find your hero's death
to ease the pain of always being sane.
 'Cause it's the last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
 And like the snows of May
 will your spirit fade away,
 like a spent gold mine is it gone.
 Time will tell, we all will see
 the Wrath of Judgement dancing free
 down the one way corridor of fame.
But a question still can answer why
like a baby's first baptism cry.
Still do you bear, still do you hear?
 The last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
 'Cause it's the last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
 The last time around,
 I'm the final survivor in your heart's ghost town.
 It's the last time around.
 Last time around
 last time around
 last time around
 last time around

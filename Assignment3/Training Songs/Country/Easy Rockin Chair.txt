Rock away my troubles rock away my cares
I rock my way to heaven in that easy rockin' chair
I feel just as wealthy as a millionaire
When I get back to Dixie in that easy rockin' chair

Everyone your neighbor welcome on the mat
Just sittin', doin', nothin' and not too much of that
Thumbing through the good book thinking of a prayer
Oh, I can get the liftin' in that easy rockin' chair

Rockin' free and easy time a going by
And neath that evening paper till I swat this pesty fly
There I go a dozin' guess it's in the air
I gotta do some dreaming in that easy rockin' chair

Rock away my trouble

You know she likes to take me dancin' on the outskirts of town
Where the music's turned up and the lights are turned down
Shakin'--shakin'--shakin' on the dance-- dance floor
Crowd--crowd--screamin'--screamin'--more--more--more
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

Johnny's in the back room suckin' on his gin
Police are at the front door screamin' let me in
Go--go--go--go dancer's busy showin' off her chest
She don't know what she's doin' but she tries to do her best
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

Baby likes to rock it - Baby likes a rocket
Baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

She said her name was 'emergency' and asked to see my gun
Said her telephone number was 911
Got brother Jimmy on the T.V.--killer on the stereo
She said if you want to get it...you got to let it go
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

Baby likes to rock it - Baby likes a rocket
Baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

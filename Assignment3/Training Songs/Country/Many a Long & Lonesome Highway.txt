Yes, I had a woman love me
I gave her what there was there of me
And it was good as it could be

Then I heard a wild world callin'
I saw a lone star fallin'
I caught a song and set it free

And many a long and lonesome highway
Lies before us as we go
And in the end, I'll do it my way
Look for me where the fore winds blow

I believe in love and danger
I believe the truth is stranger
I believe that fear is much too strong

I believe the best will find me
When I leave the rest behind me
Out on the highway I'm my own

And many a long and lonesome highway
Lies before us as we go
And in the end I'll do it my way
Look for me where the fore winds blow

And every night's a new beginning
Everyday the world keeps spinning
Sometimes it's hard to stand upon, I know

And to the east, the moon comes showin'
To the west, there's storm clouds growin'
Though by myself, I'm not alone no more

My father, on his death bed told me
"There's really nothin' left to hold me"
Though I was there, he died alone

It's gonna take a fast train leavin'
To shake my world of grievin'
I guess, I'll go until it's gone

And many a long and lonesome highway
Lies before us as we go
And in the end, I'll do it my way
Look for me where the fore winds blow

And many a long and lonesome highway
Lies before us as we go
And in the end, I'll do it my way
Look for me where the fore winds blow

And many a long and lonesome highway
Lies before us as we go
And in the end, I'll do it my way
Look for me where the fore winds blow

All my love
Baby, turn the key
All my love
Say you'll stay by me
All my love
Close your eyes and yawn
Well, I been lookin' at you
For an hour or two
But I can't stay up 'till dawn

All my love
Comb your shiny hair
All my love
Lay away your cares
All my love
Close your eyes and yawn
Well, I been lookin' at you
For an hour or two
But I can't stay up 'till dawn

Well, now that we're together
What more can I say?
Now that we're together, honey
Lay your blues away

All my love
Turn your light down low
All my love
Tell me you won't go
All my love
Close your eyes and yawn
Well, I been lookin' at you
For an hour or two
But I can't stay up 'till dawn

I been lookin' at you
For an hour or two
But I can't stay up 'till dawn

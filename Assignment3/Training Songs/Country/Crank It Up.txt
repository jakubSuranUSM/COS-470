Country girl shaking hips
DJ make that record skip,
It's a straight up red neck rager
Doing body shots of Jager,
Let 'er rip

We own that moonshine and we're sippin' on Bacardi
We showin' Vegas how we country folk party
What happens in the backwoods
Stays in the backwoods
We go in ham y'all as hard as a mutha

So crank it up, put some of that party in my cup
Y'all I'm dancing with a girl up on my flatbed
She's hotter than a cherry on a Marlboro Red
Wild weekends come and we can't get enough

So crank it up, crank it up

Man crank up the beat
Put AC/DC on repeat
We shake it all night long
To the powel, powel, come
You know me, I roll deep

Its three am you know we only getting started
We showin' Vegas how us country folk party
What happens in the backwoods
Stays in the backwoods
We go in ham y'all as hard as a mutha

Crank it up, put some of that party in my cup
Y'all I'm dancing with a girl up on my flatbed
She's hotter than a cherry on a Marlboro Red
Wild weekends come and we can't get enough

So crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up,

So crank it up, put some of that party in my cup
Bust out the JD, Hank III,
Scoot a little closer right next to me
'Cause we're about to turn this cornfield to a club

And crank it up, put some of that party in my cup
Y'all I'm dancing with a girl up on my flatbed
She's hotter than a cherry on a Marlboro Red
Wild weekends come and we can't get enough

So crank it up
Crank it up
Crank it up
Crank it up
Crank it up

You sit there a crying cry in your beer
You say you got troubles my friend listen here
If you'd look around you I'm sure you would find
There's folks who got troubles worst that yours and mine
I'm fresh out of prison six years in the pen
Lost my wife and family no one to call friend
Don't tell me your troubles cause you're not alone
Be thankful you're living drink up and go home

Now there stands a blind man a man who can't see
Yet he's not complaining why should you or me
Don't tell me your troubles got enough of my own
Be thankful you're living drink up and go home
I'm fresh out of prison

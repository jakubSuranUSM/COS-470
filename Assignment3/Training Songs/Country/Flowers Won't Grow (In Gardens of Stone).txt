Could it be our love wasn't planted deep enough
Or could it be we just didn't try
Looking back we see so much that we left undone
We should have known it would wither and die
Flowers won't grow in gardens of stone
The ground must be tended but we left it alone
The seeds that we scattered are all parched and blown
Flowers won't grow in gardens of stone
Thinking bout it now it was only pride I know
There was so much that we wouldn't give
Both of us in time took what might have been a home
And made it a place where nothing could live
Flowers won't grow...

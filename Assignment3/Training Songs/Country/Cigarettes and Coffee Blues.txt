I guess I'll take a walk tonight, I know that I can't sleep
And I don't go to bed at all, I just lay there and weep
Instead I'll make our favorite spot, that's what I think I'll do
I've got those smokin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee blues

Smokin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee all night long
Wonderin' how a love so right could suddenly go wrong
I'd take the next bus out of town but I gotta be near you
I've got those smokin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee blues

Sittin' at the table where I call my baby's name

Wonderin' where our love went wrong, wonderin' who's to blame
Listenin' while the jukebox plays the songs that make me blue
Another cup of coffee and a cigarette or two

Smokin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee all night long
Wonderin' how a love so right could suddenly go wrong
There's a lot of other people know the misery I go through
I got those smokin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee blues

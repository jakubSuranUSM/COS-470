Here it comes now
We'll stand and face each other somehow

Blue eyes don't cry
Hold on until the last goodbye

You know it's all
Part of the feeling that goes with the fall

Looks like you win
And I lose but then love will come again

Send me no invitation
To your farewell
Don't need no inspiration
No wishin' well

Don't hang your head
Try to remember it's all been said
Turn and go on,
Leave all the tears till after you've gone

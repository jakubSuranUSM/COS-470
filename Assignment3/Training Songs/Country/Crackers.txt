Hello baby, I'm sorry I said
The things I did, it was a silly fight
I was wrong you were right
What I really mean to say is

You can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

I should be happy, no dishes to wash now
But my own, no clothes to pick up
A double bed to myself now that your gone
Oh but it's lonely, I'm sorry I ever let you go
It's a matter of fact I've got to have you back
I just want you to know

You can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

Whoa, you can eat crackers in my bed anytime, baby
You can kick off all the covers in the middle of the night
You can sleep with the window open wide
Do anything as long as your by my side
You can eat crackers in my bed anytime

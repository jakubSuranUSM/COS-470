The wind and I have a lot in common it seems we're always in a race with time
We never know just where we're goin' or think about what we leave behind
Grass won't grow on a busy street you can't take bitter and make it sweet
You can't draw water from a well that's dry rainbow fall from a clear blue sky
Grass won't grow on a busy street

Love will bloom in any season but I found out some time ago
My heart just beats in one direction I won't give a true love time to grow
Grass won't grow on a busy street

I never was a little baby if you don't believe me just ask my dad haha
Anything I do I do it big boys when I'm good I'm good and when I'm bad I'm bad
Grass won't grow on a busy street

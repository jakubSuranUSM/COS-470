Tennessee bootleg moonshine whiskey
Sure do make a man feel 
Mighty frisky ...
An' I love my whiskey ... ( love my whiskey )
I drink it all the time ..(drink it all the time )
Long as I got my whiskey I'm gonna 
Stay stoned ... Runnin Blind.

Some people say it's a sin for a man to get get high
But they drink that whiskey like it's 
Goin outta style ...
An' I love my whiskey ( repeat )
Lord, I drink it all the time ( all the time )
Long as I got my juice I'm gonna 
Stay Stoned ..Runnin blind

Sunshine, freezin rain, and snow 
Lord I take my bottle everywhere I go
I just love my whiskey ( love my whiskey )
I drink it all the time ( all the time )
Long as I got my sauce I'm gonna 
Stay stoned ... runnin blind.
 
Break
Best way I know how to spend my day , now then
Gimme a bottle of that sour mash 
An' I love my whiskey
I drink it all the time 
Long as I got my juice I'm gonna 
Stay stoned runnin blind

( Repeat First verse ) into guitar break.
Welllllllllllllllll .... 
I love my whiskey ( love my whiskey )
I love my whiskey ( love my whiskey )
I just love my whiskey ( love my whiskey )
I love my whiskey ( love my whiskey )
Long as I got my bottle I'm gonna 
Stay stoned runnin blind 
Long as I got my bottle I'm gonna
Stay stoned runnin blind 
Well I got my bottle I'm gonna
Stay cool ... all the time.
All the time woooooooooo

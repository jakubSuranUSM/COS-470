I wandered alone one night, 
till I heard and orchestra play 
I met you where lights were bright, 
and people were care-free and gay 
You were the beautiful lady in blue, 
I was in heaven just waltzing with you 
You thrilled me with strange delight, 
then softly you stole away 

I dream of that night with you, 
Lady when first we met We danced in a world of blue, 
How can my heart forget B
lue were the skies, and blue were your eyes, 
just like the blue skirt you wore 
Come back blue lady, come back, 
Don't be blue any more

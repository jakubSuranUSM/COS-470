Excuse me for living my whole life for you excuse me for grieving your name like I do
I'm sorry I love you when you don't love me too excuse me for living only for you

You once used to love me but lately I found I made you unhappy just being around
You once used to want me and my love to stay
Now all that you want me is out of your way
Excuse me for living

I used to be someone you're glad that you'd met
Now I'm only someone you'd like to forget
I don't want to love you for long I have known
That you would just love me to leave you alone
Excuse me for living

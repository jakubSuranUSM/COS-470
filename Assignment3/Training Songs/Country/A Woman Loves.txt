There's a suitcase, and a heartache,
She was thinkin' of leavin'
But she unpacks, and she goes back, to him.

So he gets by, with a bad lie,
Cause in her mind, it's the last time,
And she needs him, so she believes him, again.

A woman loves beyond her questions,
And dreams beyond her doubts,
Her heart will lead and she will follow,
Even when there's no way out.
Her eyes refuse to see the danger,
As she walks right through the fire.
A man may give himself to passion and desire.
But a woman loves.

In the morning, lyin' next to him,
She'll be weepin', while he's sleepin',
Goin' crazy, thinkin' maybe, it's her fault.

Maybe one night, In the moonlight,
She'll touch his hand, and he'll understand,
How it could be, How it should be, after all.

A woman loves beyond her questions,
And dreams beyond her doubts,
Her heart will lead and she will follow,
Even when there's no way out.
Her eyes refuse to see the danger,
As she walks right through the fire.
A man may give himself to passion and desire.
But a woman loves.

A woman loves beyond her questions,
And dreams beyond her doubts,
Her heart will lead and she will follow,
Even when there's no way out.
Her eyes refuse to see the danger,
As she walks right through the fire.
A man may give himself to passion and desire.
But a woman loves.

A woman Loves.

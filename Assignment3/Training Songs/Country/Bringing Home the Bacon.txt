I wanna bring home the bacon to you I wanna share what I'm makin' with you
I wanna put you in my budget I wanna keep you in my heart
Cause you're the only apple in my applecart
I'm all set to see the preacher and say I do I wanna spend my life makin' love to you
We'll build a cottage that's big enough for two
Then I'll be bringin' home the bacon to you
[ guitar - piano - steel ]
I wanna bring home the bacon...

Got an old slauch hat got my roll on my shoulder
I'm as free as the breeze and I'll do as I please just a bummin' around
Got a million friends don't feel any older
Got nothing to lose not even the blues just a bummin' around

Whenever worries start to botherin' me
Well I grab my coat my old slauch hat hit the trail again you see
I ain't got a dime don't care where I'm goin'
I Got nothing to lose not even the blues just a bummin' around
[ guitar ]
Whenever worries start to botherin' me...

I know you've heard
that worn out line
About love at first sight
Well, I never knew
those words were true
'Til you walked in tonight
All it took was just one look
To knock me off of my feet
I'm not a man of many words
So I'll make this short and sweet
Could you
Would you
Ain't you gonna
If I ask you you,
would you want to
Be my baby tonight
Yeah, take a chance,
slow dance
Make a little romance
Honey, it'll be alright
Girl, you got me wishin'
We were huggin' and kissin'
And holdin' each other tight
So, could you
Would you
Ain't you gonna
If I ask you,
would you want to
Be my baby tonight
I'm not trying to come on
like some rhinestone Romeo
I'm lookin' for a whole lot more
Than a one night rodeo
What can I do
To prove to you
I'm layin' it on the line
I'll even get down on my knees
Just to beg you one more time
Yeah, could you
Would you
Ain't you gonna
If I ask you, would you want to
Be my baby tonight

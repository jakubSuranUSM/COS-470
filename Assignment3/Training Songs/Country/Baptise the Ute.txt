I saw the ute
I heard the voice
I knew i had to make her mine
Shiny and red, on the show room floor
I scratched my name on the dotted line

I'm on a mission, the Grand Tradition
there's only one thing left to do
there's a clay pan, there's a big old mud hole
Gunna take my brand new baby right on through

Baptise the ute
Baptise the ute
You won't be satisfied until you do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
Take it to the edge and back again

When she's in my rig
She feels the rumble
She loves to ride in my machine
She runs her fingers, along the console
She says there's no where else she'd rather be

But I'm on a mission, Grand Tradition
And if i play my cards just right
The motors runnin
And things are hummin,
I reckon this could be my lucky night

Baptise the ute
Baptise the ute
You won't be satified until you do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
We'll take it to the edge and back again

Bugs on the bullbar
Fur on the side rails
Mud on the windscreen
Cause we'll baptise the ute

Well I'm on a mission, we have ignition
We gotta do what must be done
When the ceremony has been completed
We'll start her up and do it all again

Baptise the ute
Baptise the ute
You won't be satisfied until you do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
Take it to the edge and back again

Baptise the ute
Baptise the ute
Got to take her out and see what she can do
Leave ya mark
Break it in
Got to take it to the edge and back again

Yeah

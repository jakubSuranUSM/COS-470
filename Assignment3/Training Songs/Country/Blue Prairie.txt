Blue prairie,
Blue are the skies.
Blue are the sighs,
Of a night wind, callin'.

Blue prairie,
Blue are the hills.
Blue are the trills,
Of a nightbird, callin'.

Every beatin' heart
Beats a rhythm that is blue.
And the moon has cast
A blue reflection on the moon.

So the wind while on it's way,
Seems to cry and sigh and say
Blue, ooh, ooh.

Blue prairie, blue echoes ring
Blue as I sing of a longing
Blue as you.

Every beatin' heart
Beats a rhythm that is blue
And the moon has cast
A blue reflection on the moon.

So the wind while on it's way,
Seems to cry and sigh and say
Blue, ooh, ooh.

Blue prairie, blue echoes ring
Blue as I sing of a longing
Blue as you

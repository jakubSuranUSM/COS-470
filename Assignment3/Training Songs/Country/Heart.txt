You never listen to a word I say
You do what you want to anyway
You think you're so smart, heart

I give you reasons why you're gonna get broken
But it's as if my words never were spoken
You're the one in charge, heart

Well, I've got no choice but to follow you
That's a fact, I'd better face it
'Cause I can't beat how you make me feel
Oh, you know you're so persuasive

You showed me everything that love could be
Then turned your back and brought me to my knees
You can be so hard, heart

Oh, I say stop and you say go, it drives me crazy
We agree on anything, it drives me crazy
But that's the way you are, heart

Well, I've got no choice but to follow you
That's a fact, I'd better face it
'Cause I can't beat how you make me feel
Oh, you know you're so persuasive

Sometimes I wish that you'd just leave me alone
But there's some things I can't do on my own
So I'll take my chance, finish what you start, heart
Yeah, mm
Gonna finish what you start, heart
Yeah, you think that you're so smart
Don't you know, heart
This is the way you are
Mm, oh, heart

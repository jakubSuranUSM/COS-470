Blues go ahead and knock upon my door you can't hurt me anymore
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Rain go ahead and let it rain all night in the morning I'll be dry
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't it good to know love can take away the rain
And make the sunshine again

And ain't it good to know love can take a lonely dream
And turn it into a real thing
Um-um ain't love a good thing um-um ain't love a good thing
Pain find yourself another heart to ache and another mind to break
Um-um ain't love a good thing

Time find yourself another fool to waste and another place to stay
Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't it good to know

Um-um ain't love a good thing
Ain't love a good thing good thing
Ain't love a good thing

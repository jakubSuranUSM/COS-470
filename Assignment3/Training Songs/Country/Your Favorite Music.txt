Your favorite music
Well, it just makes you sad
Your favorite music
Well, it just makes you sad
But you like it
'cause you feel special that way
You feel special 
That you're like no one else
You feel special
That you're like no one else
But then you're lonely
And you need someone to help
But then you're lonely
And you need someone to help
And I can't teach you
To learn to love yourself
I can't teach you
To learn to love yourself
But here's a sad song
That I wrote for no one else
But here's a sad song 
That I wrote for no one else

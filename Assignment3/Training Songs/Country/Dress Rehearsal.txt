Days pass me by just like moments
They're here and then they're gone
For good, for good
I work so hard at where I'm going
I wonder what I've missed

I can't remember the last time
I picked up the phone just to talk
For hours on end
Or sent a birthday card un-belated
Maybe I should slow down

Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal

I've always got a big to-do list
Oh, but there's so much more to do
To see I want to
Know that I didn't leave 'I love you's'
Trapped within my heart

There won't always be another day to
Say all the things you want to say
So don't, don't wait
Wait for the perfect moment
It will never come around

Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal

When the show is over
And they lay me down
I wanna be remembered
For the love I spread around

Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal

This ain't no dress rehearsal

Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me
Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me

Of all the people that I meet
Faces passin' on the street
The terms of life so incomplete
And all the world lies at my feet alone

And every day remains the same
There's no one there to call my name
Who's to stand behind my fame
To me your eyes can show no pain anymore

Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me
Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me

Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me
Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me

I'm much too old to hesitate
To stand behind and decide to wait
Know you've seen your mind and it's great
Sorry girl, you're too damn late, you're alone

Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me
Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me

Time's so short
Please woman wear your hair down for me

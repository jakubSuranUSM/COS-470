When we're all alone, dear
And I'm in your arm
Are you teasing me?

When you're telling me
How you thrill to my charms
Are you teasing me?

Are you untrue when I'm not with you?
When we're apart are you free?
Tell me, darling, while our love is still young
Are you teasing me?

You say that my kiss
Sends your heart in up world
Are you teasing me?

And that you'll be mine
Till the end of the world
Are you teasing me?

You tell me my love makes my life complete
And tight in my arms you wanna be
Tell me, darling, while our love is still young
Are you teasing me?

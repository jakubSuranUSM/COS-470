Just one look and I fell so hard
In love with you, oh-oh, oh-oh
I found out how good it feels
To have your love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Say you will, will be mine
Forever and always, oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
Oh oh-oh oh

I thought I was dreamin' but I was wrong, oh yeah, yeah
Ah, but I'm gonna keep on schemin'
Till I can make you, make you my own

So you see, I really care
Without you, I'm nothin', oh-oh, oh-oh
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday, oh-oh, oh-oh

Just one look, that's all it took, hey
Just one look, that's all it took, well
Just one look, that's all it was, baby
(Just one look, that's all it took)
You know I love you, baby
(Just one look, that's all it took)
I built my world around you
C'mon, baby
(Just one look, that's all it took)

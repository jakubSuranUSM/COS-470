It's another night alone, I'm just a face in the crowd
I came here for the laughter and the music playing loud
We're all here for a good time, but they don't know what a good time is
I can't believe I traded, hello Daddy and good morning darling for this.

We're just a room full of strangers lookin' for some company
But who would wanna get acquainted with a fool like me
I had the love a lifetime, now it's the love I miss
I can't believe I traded, hello Daddy and good morning darling for this.

[Chorus]                                                         
Hello Daddy were the words my baby told me
and I still can hear 'em ringing in my heart                                                
Good morning darling were the words that used to wake me			 
And I'd be laying in her arms
And I still miss her kiss,
I can't believe I traded, hello Daddy and good morning darling for this.

Outside a brand new day is dawning, as the real world rolls around
We all sit beside the jukebox, watch our neon sun go down
I've got my mind on a memory, but I never will forget
I can't believe I traded, hello Daddy and good morning darling for this.

[Chorus]
                       
I can't believe I traded, hello Daddy and good morning darling for this.

Happy journey and auf wiederseh'n oh my darling till we meet again
Happy journey happy journey don't forget the one who love you so
I'll be lonely waiting just for you I'll be patient and forever true
Happy journey happy journey darling till that day
When you'll be coming back to stay

And once when I didn't know what to do and where to go
Then you came and love walked in with you
Now we have to say goodbye still I promise I won't cry
Though that something I won't have to do
[ accordion - sax]
I'll be lonely waiting just for you...

Everyday I read about these operations
That make a heart that's weak so strong again
I relate it to my own situation
And now I know just what to say to you. 

Please bypass this heart
Until I'm well again
Let's not even start to fall where we fell again
The cheating was sweet but my heart is beat
Don't tear it apart
Please bypass this heart
Please bypass this heart 

In simpler times I didn't need a lot of healing
My heart was young and strong and worked just fine
But now you've shown me there's a hurting side of feeling
There's just one cure and here's what you must do 

Please bypass this heart.

When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way

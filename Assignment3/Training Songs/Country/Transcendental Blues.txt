In the darkest hour of the longest night 
If it was in my power I'd step into the light 
Candles on the alter, penny in your shoe 
Walk upon the water transcendental blues 

Happy ever after 'til the day you die 
Careful what you ask for, you don't know 'til you try 
Hands are in your pockets, starin' at your shoes 
Wishin' you could stop it transcendental blues 

If I had it my way, everything would change 
Out here on this highway the rules are still the same 
Back roads never carry you where you want 'em to 
They leave you standin' there with them ol' transcendental blues

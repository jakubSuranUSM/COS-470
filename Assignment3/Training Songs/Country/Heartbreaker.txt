Here I sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what I should have known 
You made me think that I could need you 
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you 
Lookin back on you and me 
Promises that will never be 
I truly thought that we were lovers 
But now I find that I'm just like all the others 

Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker 
Takin my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me 
Played with fire, felt its burn 
I would have thought that I would have learned 
I melted every time you kissed me 
Each time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me
 
Heartbreaker, wish that I'd seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker 
Takin' my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
A little more kind to me

Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker 
Takin' my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me

Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen that love was blind 
Sweet little love maker 
Takin' my heart and leave me behind 
Heartbreaker couldn't you be 
Just a little more kind to me

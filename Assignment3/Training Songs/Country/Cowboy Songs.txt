Well I wake up in the mornin', I brew my coffee hot and strong.
I get out my ole guitar, and try to write a song.
An them larks are singin, oh lord, just outside.
And I'm stuck here in this kitchen tryin' to write.
And I'm writin' these cowboy songs. yodellehe, cowboy songs
Just me and my beat up ole guitar.
Cowboy songs, yodellehe, cowboy songs
Well maybe one of these cowboy songs is gonna make me a star.
Now Hank Williams Jr. writes 'em rough, and sings 'em tough.
And Charlie Daniels sings a song about the devil.
And Waylon and Willie sing about, whatever they like.
And I'll probably be sing these cowboy songs for the rest of my life.
And writin' these cowboy songs. yodellehe, cowboy songs
Just me and my beat up ole guitar.
Cowboy songs, yodellehe, cowboy songs
Well maybe one of these cowboy songs is gonna make me a star.
Well this don't sound like strawberry row, or that lonesome cattle
Call.
And you might think that it don't sound nothin' like a cowboy song at
All.
But it is, 'cause I wrote it, and I'm a real life buckaroo.
And I wrote this silly little cowboy song, especially for you.
Here it is, cowboy songs, yodellehe, cowboy songs.
Just me and my beat up ole guitar.
Just a cowboy song, yodellehe, cowboys songs.
Well maybe one of these cowboy songs is gonna make me a star.

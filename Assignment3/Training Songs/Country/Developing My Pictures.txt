DEVELOPING MY PICTURES
(Earl Montgomery)
Â« Â© '66 Altam Music Â»

I'm developing my pictures my mind's a dark room
The proofs I'm searching for will be made clear soon
I'm developing my pictures of the girl I admire
Soon I will see you know you as you really are
I'm told you wear two faces to hide things from me
I've heard you've spoken very unkind words of me
I don't believe hear say and take what I see
But I've got to believe you love me
I'm developing my pictures...
Yes I want to see you an' know you as you really are

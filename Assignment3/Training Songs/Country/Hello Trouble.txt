Woke up this mornin', happy as could  be
I looked out my window, what's that I  see
Coming' up the sidewalk, just as plain as day
Well here comes trouble that I never thought 
I'd see since you went away.

Hello  trouble come on in
Well you talk about heartaches 
Where in the world you been
Well, I ain't had the miseries 
Since you been gone
Well  hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home.

We'll make a pot of coffee 
And you can rest your shoes
And you can tell me them sweet lies 
And I'll listen to you
Well it's just a little part of, 
Part of the life we'd live
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble 
Than to never know the love you give.

Hello  trouble, come on in
Well you talk about heartaches, 
Where in the world you been
Ain't had the miseries since you been gone
Well  hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home.

Hello trouble, trouble,  trouble
Welcome home.

I'm just a woman
You are the only man

I need you always
You need me now and then
I'm just a woman
You are the only man

I'm just your puppet
You make me dance and sing
You know I love it
Letting you pull my string
I'm just a woman
You are the only man

And I know if you choose
Yon can throw me away
Like some old shoe
But as long as you're there
From the bottom or my heart
I don't care

I 'm just the lover
You want along the way
I try to do it
But you always start to play
I'm just a woman
You are the only man

And I know if you choose
Yon can throw me away
Like some old shoe
But as long as you're there
From the bottom or my heart
I don't care

I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman, ooh

And there are times you really show
What 's in your heart and then I know
No matter what yon do I can't let go
Of any part of your love

I'm just a woman
You are the only man

And I know if you choose
Yon can throw me away
Like some old shoe
But as long as you're there
From the bottom or my heart
I don't care

I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman, ooh
I'm just a woman
You are the only man
I'm just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman
You are the only man
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman just a woman
You are the only man
Just a woman, ooh
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman
You are the only man
I'm just a woman
I said I'm just a woman
And you are the only man
Yeah yeah
I'm just a woman
You are the only man
I'm just a woman
Said I'm just a woman
I'm just a woman
You're, you're the only man

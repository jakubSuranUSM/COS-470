Oh Carmen, I had too much tequila
Between you and this Mexican moon I'm gonna fall
El Paso lady, you're driving me crazy
In a language I don't understand, you said it all.

Dusty old Juarez on the old Rio Grande
It's sure is handy when you need a friend
I don't belong here, your dark eyes keep warning
I'll leave in the morning but for now please let me in.

Oh Carmen, I had too much tequila
Between you and this Mexican moon I'm gonna fall
El Paso lady, you're driving me crazy
In a language I don't understand, you said it all.

Crossing over the border, stepping over the line
Drunk on yesterdays wine and still feeling the flame
The guitars keep playing a song that I've never heard
Without saying a word, you keep calling out my name.

Oh Carmen, I had too much tequila
Between you and this Mexican moon I'm gonna fall
El Paso lady, you're driving me crazy
In a language I don't understand, you said it all.

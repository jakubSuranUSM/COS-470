Alabama on the boombox, baby
‘bout to get a little boondock crazy (let's go)

Big stars breaking out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin' in and stereo
Tail lights dissapear in bout a mile or so
Down a county road
Phone blowing up where you is
Baby sayin' baby, let's do this
Rocket in a bottle with a fuse lit
Bout to lift it off, I'm bout to twist it off

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret aint a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where eveybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Well baby you ain't nothin' but a masterpiece
Swayin' and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big loud beat, nothin' but heat (come on)
Somebody's rockin' that bang box
Everybody hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tic toc
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends

Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and you brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where eveybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

Alabama on the boombox baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night

Hey daddy I need a drink of water those are the sounds I'm living by
Not long ago my ears thought they were happy
When a jukebox in a bar was turned up high

But drinking there no children call me daddy now these are the sounds I'm living by
Hey daddy can we watch the movie hey daddy can I go outside
Hey daddy sister lost her broodie those are the sounds I'm living by
So now the bars and blonds are bitter history I wanna hear my babies when they cry
And why I left them once is still a mystery I almost lost the sounds I'm living by
Hey daddy you know that I love you hey daddy what's there in your eye
Yes daddy's crying but I'm happy for these are the sounds I'm living by

I write you letters, but I don't send ?em
I just can't figure out how to end them
I try to reach you, you're right beside me
There's something missing and we can't deny that

We live together separately
We don't want to fall apart
But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

We live together separately
We don't want to fall apart
But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

We live together separately
We don't want to fall apart
But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

The silence is unusually loud tonight 
The strange sound of nothing fills my ears
The night rushes in like a crowd of nights 
And the ghost of our old love goes away
This strange world of darkness 
That comes with the night
Grows darker when it walks my way
And it lasts while I listen 
For the breaking of day
And the ghost of our old love goes away

This strange world of darkness
And the ghost of our old love goes away

Here comes more tears to cry here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes more misery here comes old memory here comes my baby back again
My arms are open wide to let more hurt inside here comes my baby back again
She's sorry once again once more I'll understand here comes my baby back again

My arms are open wide...
Here comes my baby back again

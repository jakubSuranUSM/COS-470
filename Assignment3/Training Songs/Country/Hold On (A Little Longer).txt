The sun is sinking down in paradise tonight
But it's not paradise without you by my side
Because you're so far away
The wind keeps whispering
It softly calls your name to me

Hold on just a little longer
Our love will be much stronger
This time you'll see
Hold on baby it's been too long
You know that I still love you
Baby wait for me

I can't help but wondering if I ever cross your mind
You wander through my dreams time after time
The message that I can't help hearing
Keeps coming to me loud and clear
You should be lying here with me

Hold on just a little longer
Our love will be much stronger
This time you'll see
Hold on baby it's been too long
You know that I still love you
Baby wait for me

Hold on just a little longer
Our love will be much stronger
This time you'll see
Hold on baby it's been too long
You know that I still love you
Baby wait for me

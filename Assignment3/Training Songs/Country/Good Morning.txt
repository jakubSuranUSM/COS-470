Well, it's minus five outside your house
And ninety degrees in bed
Your wife says get up and go to work
You long-haired, lazy head
Now I know where you've been all night
And maybe what's wrong with you
You've been makin' love to the little woman
Or a midnight rendezvous
Good Mornin'

Now the young exec, he hits the deck
And oh, he's dressed to kill
Before he goes, oh yes, he knows
He's gotta have a wake-up pill
From nine to five he feels alive
Jumpin' to the speed of sound
But the young exec, he hit the deck
'Cause his little pill let him down

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin', so put a smile upon your face
Being alive is no disgrace
You can make it a better place,
By havin' yourself a good mornin'

So put a smile upon your face
Being alive is no disgrace
You can make it a better place
By havin' yourself a good mornin'

Well the sun is up, let's lift a cup
And do it all over again
A little blood and a lot of sweat
Hard workin' ain't no sin
Don't sit around wearin' a frown
Your life will slip away
Give a bump and a little hump
It's gonna be a beautiful day

Good mornin'
Good mornin'
Good mornin', so put a smile upon your face
Being alive is no disgrace
You can make it a better place,
By havin' yourself a good mornin'

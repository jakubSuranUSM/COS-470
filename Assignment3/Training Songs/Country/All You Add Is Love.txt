(All you add is love)
Take the cottage (take the cottage) any cottage by the side of the road
And you like it (yes you like it) so you buy it it's the house that you own
You can change it (rearrange it) you can change it from a house to a home
All you add is love
For love makes the difference from better to best (right sadder or less)
Love makes the difference some philosopher wrote and I quote
Take a baby (take a baby) any baby with the button down nose
Just a baby (stranger baby) any baby tiny fingers and toes
You can change it (you can change it) from a baby to the child of your own
All you add is love
(Take a neighbor) take a neighbor (any neighbor you see now and again
Any someone) smart or damn one (can he come on and he bother all land
You'll be neighbors) only neighbors (yes be neighbors) if we got to be friends
All you add is love
For love makes the difference from better to best (right sadder or less)
Love makes the difference (yes love makes the difference)
Love makes the difference all you add is love

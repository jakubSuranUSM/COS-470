Well you thought I'd be waitin' up when you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys and you ended up half tight
But liquor and love that just don't mix leave a bottle or me behind

And don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find
Cause if you want that kind of love well you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

You never take me anywhere because you're always gone
Many a night I've laid awake and cried dear all alone

And you come in a kissin' on me it happens every time
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

No don't come home a drinkin'
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

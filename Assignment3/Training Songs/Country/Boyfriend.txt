Let's be honest we don't got a lot in common when it comes down to it
You can take his breath away and light up every room when you walk through it
But I don't want you six foot legs and angel face and sophistication
Don't really want to causes scene but girl you got everything
And I want your boyfriend
I'm not gonna lie
I'll be his girl when he tells you good bye
Don't worry I won't take him cause I ain't that low
I want your boyfriend just thought you should know
That he and I go back so far oh my gosh we lived in his first truck
First time we heard Shania Twain I think we were on our way to Lubbcock
And I know you think he loves you now
Seen so many girls come in and out
It sounds a bit insensitive
But the truth is what it is
I want your boyfriend
I'm not gonna lie
I'll be his girl when he tells you good bye
Don't worry I won't take him cause I ain't that low
I want your boyfriend just thought you should know, yeah
Don't know why you act so surprised
Can't you see it in his eyes
You must have known it all this time
Yeah
That I want your boyfriend
To tell you the truth I'll be right there when he gets over you
What's meant to be will always find its way in the end
I want your boyfriend
I'm not gonna lie
I'll be his girl when he tells you good bye
Don't worry I won't take him cause I ain't that low
I want your boyfriend
I want your boyfriend
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know

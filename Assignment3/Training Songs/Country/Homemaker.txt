To me she is a beauty queen 
I love to watch her on the screen 
In our home movies 
And when she sings around the house 
She's got a voice that knocks me out 
She is my favorite singer 

But you won't see her on T.V. 
Or hear her on the radio 
Worldly fame is not her aim 
And she's the first to let you know 

CHORUS: She wants to be a homemaker 
It's her dream to raise a family 
And give her love to just one man 
And I thank God it's me 
I'll never underestimate her 
'Cause she could take this word and turn it on 
But she takes her love 
And makes our house of home 

She can't afford to spend her day 
In a old soap opera haze 
She's much too busy 
At night she puts the kids to bed 
She's makin' sure their prayers get said 
Before she lays down with me 

It's plain to see 
That she's not seeking glory on this earth 
'Cause she believes in honesty 
And the joy of giving birth 

(REPEAT CHORUS)

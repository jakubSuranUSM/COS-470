There's a for-sale sign on a big ol rusty tractor
You can't miss it it's the first thing that you see
Just up the road a pale blue water tower
With I love ginny painted in bright green
Hey that's my uncle bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down
And this is my town

Nah na nah nah nah

Yea this is my town

Nah na nah nah nah

Hey where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And I came to blows with my old man
Where I came back to settle down
This is where they'll put me in the ground
This is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
Yea this is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
This is my town

There ain't much going on here since they closed the mill
The whistle still blows everyday at noon
A bunch of us still go down to the diner
Wonder if that interstates still comin' through
Come the Sunday morning service at the church of christ
There ain't an empty seat to be found
And this is my town

Nah na nah nah nah

Yea this is my town

Nah na nah nah nah

Hey where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And I came to blows with my old man
Where I came back to settle down
This is where they'll put me in the ground
This is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
Yea this is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
This is my town

Well I bought and painted up that rusty tractor
You can't miss it its sitting right there in our yard
The county came and took that water tower
And that's Ginny with a baby in the car
We're off to Sunday service at the church of Christ
And if we want a seat we better leave right now
And maybe later me and ol t-roy will show you around
Our town

Nah na nah nah nah

Yea this is my town

Nah na nah nah nah

Hey where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And I came to blows with my old man
Where I came back to settle down
This is where they'll put me in the ground
This is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
Yea this is my town
Nah na nah nah nah
This is my town

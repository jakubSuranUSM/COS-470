In the evening, in the shadows,
I'll be waiting, in Louisi- an - a,
And when I hear your sweet voice,
I'll rejoice, I'll be happy,
And saving my kisses for you.

Jole Blon, Cajun Angel,
Let me tell you how I love you,
In the springtime you promised,
That we would be married,
And I'm waiting, still waiting for you.

Oh ho ho, ah ha ha.

When your hair turns to silver,
I'll still call you, Delta Flower,
Pretty Blond I still love you,
I love you I promise,
And I'm patiently waiting for you.

Oh ho ho, ah ha ha.

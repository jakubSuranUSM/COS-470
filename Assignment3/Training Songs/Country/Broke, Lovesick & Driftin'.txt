Well I'm broke, lovesick, and driftin' 
And I've done a lot of hard, hard livin'
Livin' on the road and seein' how it goes 
I grew up fast and it shows 

[Chorus]
Cause livin' the nightlife is where I belong 
And drinkin' with the drunks who don't want to go home 
And it's hard, it's rough but I can't quite get enough 
Oh I'm doin' the best that I can

Well I'm broke, lovesick, and driftin' 
And I've had my share of good women
I once had a good home, a wife to call my own
But now I'm here drunk and alone

[Chorus]

Oh I'm doin' the best that I can

Behind every good man stands a good woman
Though they might be looking a different way
While she's dealin' with one thing
I've got another thing comin'
If I'm lookin' at tomorrow, she'll be thinkin' 'bout yesterday

Back to back, we face each other
Still together all alone
We'd be the last to turn to one another
But I know we'll make it together on our own

Nobody could ever come between us
Or force our backs against the wall
Today we're tighter than I've ever seen us
Bending over backwards together, we could never fall

Back to back, we face each other
Still together all alone
We'd be the last to turn to one another
But I know we'll make it together on our own
Back to back we face each other
But I know we'll make it together on our own

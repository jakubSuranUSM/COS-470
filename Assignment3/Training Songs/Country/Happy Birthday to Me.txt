Today has been my birthday and tonight I should be glad
But you weren't here to share it and inside I've hurt so bad
I didn't want your presence just your kiss and company
And your lips to softly whisper happy birthday to me
But I came home all by myself and lit the candle
Made a wish for you and love that used to be
I unwrapped the tiny package that I bought myself
Then I sang happy birthday to me
[ piano ]
I thought for sure you sent me at least a birthday card
But the postman didn't even stop when he passed by my yard
You could have telephone and ease a lot of misery
Instead I called myself and said happy birthday to me
And I came home all by myself...

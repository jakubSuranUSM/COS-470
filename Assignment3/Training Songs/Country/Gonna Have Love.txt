My baby called me yesterday
Said she's coming back to stay
Without my baby I nearly lost my mind
But I'm gonna have love one more time
I'm a-gonna have love one more time
All of my blues I gonna leave behind
Baby's coming back and everything is fine
And I'm gonna have love, love, love one more time
Well I've been hurting since she's been gone
Well I'm through hurting from now on
I'm gonna hold to my baby like a clinging vine
And I'm gonna have love one more time
I'm a-gonna have love one more time
All of my blues I gonna leave behind
Baby's coming back and everything is fine
And I'm gonna have love, love, love one more time
And I'm gonna have love, love, love one more time

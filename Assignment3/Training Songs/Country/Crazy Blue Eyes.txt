Mama, I will always love losers 
Mama, I never will change 
These young desperados who can't be tied down 
Have driven me almost insane 

Mama, I never pick winners 
I've only myself to blame 
But I'd rather gamble on a young desperado 
Cause I've always loved a good game 

Why do I fall for those crazy blue eyes? 
Those mavericks who won't settle down 
But I never could stand the touch of a man 
Who'd brand me to keep me around 

Mama, please don't feel sorry 
I've known what I've done from the start 
Well I chose a man I could love with my body 
But none I could touch with my heart 

Why do I fall for those crazy blue eyes? 
Those mavericks who won't settle down 
But I never could stand the touch of a man 
Who'd brand me to keep me around 

Why do I fall for those crazy blue eyes? 
Those mavericks who won't settle down 
But I never could stand the touch of a man 
Who'd brand me to keep me around 

And I'll live till I die believing the lie 
Cause I love those crazy blue eyes 
Crazy blue eyes

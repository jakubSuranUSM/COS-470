If I had a girl that loved me
Just as much as she loves you
I'd stay in her arms every doggone day
And never would be untrue

You can't win
(You can't win)
Don't do it, my friend

Well, you told her lies and alibis
You tried to make her think you care
But when she wants the little bit of love you promised
She can't find it anywhere

You can't win
(You can't win)
Don't do it, my friend

One of these days you're gonna find yourself
All alone and, oh, so blue
Don't come to me for sympathy 'cause it'll be too late
There won't be a thing I can do for you

Well, you'd better take her in your lovin' arms
And tell her that you're so ashamed
Don't try to be smart and break her heart
'Cause you're gonna play a loser's game

You can't win
(You can't win)
Don't do it, my friend

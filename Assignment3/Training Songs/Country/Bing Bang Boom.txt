Gather 'round me and lend an ear 'cause I've got something you ought to hear 
I'm telling you that you ought to fear a certain kind of love. 
Now it can strike both day and night and just as quick as a rattler's bite 
You've got a case of love at first sight and it's what you're dying of. 

It's just bing bang boom one two three feeling as normal as you can be 
(I fell the 2nd he looked at me) 
It was bing bang boom lickety split it doesn't come on bit by bit 
It was instantly in full swing and it's bing bang boom 

Now I was foot loose and fancy free I had respect and I had dignity 
And then this thing got a hold of me and still would not let go 
I walk in and heart beat jumped by hair stood up and my skin goose bumped 
My mind went blank and my I.Q. slumped and my jaw just hit the floor 

It's just bing bang boom one two three feeling as normal as you can be 
(I fell the 2nd he looked at me) 
It was bing bang boom lickety split it doesn't come on bit by bit 
It was instantly in full swing and it's bing bang boom 

Now my obligations slide and I do not even care 
I spend all my waking hours walking on thin air so friends you best beware. 

That's exactly how you behave if you get hit by this tidal wave 
You won't even have time to save you sinking sanity. 
It's just bing bang boom 
bing bang boom 
bing bing boom 
It gets instantly in full swing and it's bing bang boom.

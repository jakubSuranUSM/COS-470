[Chorus:]
I've got a whole lot of things to sing about
I've gotta whole lotta things to say
Like I love you and I need you
Every night and day

I've gotta a whole lot of things I want to do
I've gotta a whole lotta dreams to dream
And I want you here beside me
Every step of the way
I was lonely as anyone could ever be
Til you came along and gave your love to me
Now that empty world that you just walked into
Is filled with sunshine and music and the song is you

[Chorus]

People wonder just what has happened to me
They say I'm not at all the way I used to be
They don't realize I've just begun to live
And I'm wrapped up completely in all the love you give

[Chorus]

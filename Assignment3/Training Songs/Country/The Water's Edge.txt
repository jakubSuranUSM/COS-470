Love was ours, it tasted sweet
Like cherries in the summer heat, love so sweet
You're the one that I adored
Yeah, you and I moving forward

A breeze then gently brushed my lips
I held my breath to capture it, then we kissed
With an angel by my side
I was sure I'd died and gone to heaven

Take me back to the water's edge
Lay me down on that riverbed
Take me down to the water's edge
Hold me under for the longest human breath

Never had I known a thrill
The world was simply standing still In your arms I'm born again
And we are floating down that River Jordan

Take me back to the water's edge
Lay me down on that riverbed
Take me down to the water's edge
Hold me under for the longest human breath

Take me back to the water's edge
Lay me down on that riverbed
Take me back to the water's edge
Hold me under for the longest human breath
Hold me under for the longest human breath

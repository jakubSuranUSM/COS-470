He knows I'm true
But what he don't know is I'm true to only you
Tell me where does it stop?
Does he know our married life is on the rocks?

Now, before you say you want me
For the rest of your life
Tell me, what are we gonna do about your husband?
And what're we gonna do about your wife?

Speak to your side
In the darkness where unfaithfulness must hide
Knowing I'll forever taste
All the tears I'll put upon my children's face

Now, before I say I want you
For the rest of my life
What're we gonna do about my husband?
And what're we gonna do about my wife?

Shouldn't we stop and look around?
Let's think about the hearts we'll be breaking
And though we want each other
Need each other and we love each other
Think about the move we are making

Oh baby, don't you cry
No matter what, we'll never ever say goodbye
And Bobby, I promise you this
Though I wear his ring, I'll always wear your kiss

But as for marriage, we can't pay the price
'Cause you don't really want to hurt your husband
And you don't really want to hurt your wife
So what're we gonna do about your husband?
What're we gonna do about your wife?

He asked her, what gifts can I bring you
To prove that my love for you is true
I want to make you mine forever
There's nothing on this earth I would not do
She said, anything I've wanted
You have given willingly
So now there's only one more thing I need

If you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
If you love me, give me wings

He walked over to the window
He silently stared into space
Then he said, well I just want to protect you
'Cause this world is a dangerous place
She put her arms around him
She said, I know you mean well
But there are lessons I must learn for myself

So if you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
And you can trust me, so give me wings

She said, up above the clouds, you can see forever
And I know you and I can learn to fly together

If you love me, give me wings
Don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
And you can trust me, so give me wings

If you really love me
Give me wings

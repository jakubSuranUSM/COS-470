In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
And when we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew that we'd never meet again

Love is like a dyin' ember
And only memories remain
and through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

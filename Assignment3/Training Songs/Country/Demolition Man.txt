Hey, girl I know it's late
But hey babe, I just couldn't wait
You say things and you take em back
If regrets were stones, I'd have a stack
But hey, I'm gonna knock em all away

I drank just enough tonight to break down these walls
I'm coming in swinging girl like a wrecking ball
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

Let me be your demolition man
I'm on fire burning bricks to sand
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

Hey girl, well can't you hear that sound?
Well that's me babe pulling all that wreckage down
That's me yeah, I'm coming for you now

I drank just enough tonight to break down these walls
I'm coming in swinging girl like a wrecking ball
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

Let me be your demolition man
I'm on fire burning bricks to sand
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

I drank just enough tonight to break down these walls
I'm coming in swinging girl like a wrecking ball
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

Let me be your demolition man
I'm on fire burning bricks to sand
Yeah this heavy heart is pounding like a hammer in my hand
Aw come on baby let me be your demolition man

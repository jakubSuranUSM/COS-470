Demon man with your hell on my neck
Preachin' to me I'm not worthy of amnesty
You're no testimony to my final fate
Unlike you I'm not drunk on my reverie

I will build a kingdom from my remnants
I will build a kingdom from my remnants
I'm nobody's leftovers
You will not use me up
Done drained my blood bone dry
Still will not use me up
My flesh to ashes burned
Take to the wind like dust
When will you ever learn
You will not use me up
And I will build a kingdom from my remnants, from my remnants

See it now sure as the sun will rise
I won't hide my eyes from its majesty
With my war worn heart
With my battered hands
From a single thread I'll weave my tapestry
And I know the love will resurrect me

Oh I will build a kingdom from my remnants
I will build a kingdom from my remnants
I'm nobody's leftovers
You will not use me up
Done drained my blood bone dry
Still will not use me up
My flesh to ashes burned
Take to the wind like dust
When will you ever learn
You will not use me up
And I will build a kingdom from my remnants
And I will build a kingdom from my remnants

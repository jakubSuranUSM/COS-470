Just look at you sittin' there
You never looked better than tonight
And it'd be so easy
To tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

I was so sure
This would be the night
You'd close the door
And want to stay with me 
And it'd be so easy 
To tell you I'd wait 
Like I've done so many times

Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Cause he'll always take you in 
Just when you think
You've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll break you every time
So put out the light
And just hold on 
Before we say goodbye

Now it's morning
And the phone rings
And you say you've gotta
Get your things together
You've gotta leave 
Before you change your mind
And if you knew what 
I was thinkin' I'd turn around 
If you'd just ask me one more time

Don't fall in love with a dreamer 
Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think
You've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll break you every time
So put out the light
And just hold on
Before we say goodbye

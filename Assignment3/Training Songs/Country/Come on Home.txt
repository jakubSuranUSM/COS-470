Go on with your new love have a good good time
Take her out and show her off fill her tall glass with wine
Live all you can I'll forgive you when the last thrill is gone
Just remember your sweet love is waiting at home
Bright lights had you blinded for a long long time
Your rose colored world is a long way from mine
I'm just a teardrop from a breakdown and so all alone
Take your time when you wake up won't you please come on home
Come on home come on home never more to roam
I'll open wide my arms of love it's all right so come on home
I'll open wide my arms of love it's all right so come on home

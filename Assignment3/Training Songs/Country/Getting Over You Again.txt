Here you are again just when your memory
Was only sleeping with me now and then
Please don't look at me or say you love me
I don't think I can go through getting over you again
Here you are again when I was ready
To make it without leaning on a friend
Don't play games with me 'cause I can't take it
I don't think I can go through getting over you again
Cause I already know you just come and go
You're just passing through like the wind
Here you are again and I still love you
I hope I don't go through getting over you again
Cause I already know you just come and go
You're just passing through like the wind
Here you are again and I still love you
I hope I don't go through getting over you again

Well, the first time that I saw her
She somehow knew my name
And I knew that she was trouble
But she had me just the same

And it was bad, bad, bad, bad
It was bad, bad, bad, bad

Well my mama, bless my mama
She saw the devil in her eyes
And she said, ?Son, my only son
You better run for your life?

'Cause she?s bad, bad, bad, bad

Forbidden fruit it tastes so sweet
I had so much it made me weak
And all the good times that we had
Were just bad, bad, bad, bad

Now the trouble, Lord the trouble
That, that girl she got me in
And I?m prayin', Lord I?m prayin?
That I never see her again

'Cause she?s bad, bad, bad, bad

Forbidden fruit it tastes so sweet
I had so much it made me weak
And all the good times that we had
Were just bad, bad, bad, bad

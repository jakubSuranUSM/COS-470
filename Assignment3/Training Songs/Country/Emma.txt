The first time I saw Emma
She was above me in a dream
And she throwed her arms around me
And off we flew it seemed
Like an airplane
Moving up and down
Through the country town
Passing oe'are the cities so slow
Slowly

But Emma comes to see me
About 8 o'clock each night
And she throws her arms around me
And off we go in flight
Like an airplane
Moving up and down
Through the country town
Passing over the cites so slow
Slowly

but Emma's late 
Emma's late 
Oh and I 
I can't wait 
My dinners served by half past eight and I 
Can't wait
I can't wait til 9

The last time I saw my Emma
She made me love her til I died
And we walked through clouds together
Searching open skies
For air plane
Moving up and down though the country town
Passing over the cites so slow
Slowly

But Emma's late, Emma's late, Emma's late 
And I 
I can't wait
My dinners served by half past 8 and I 
Can't wait
I can't wait til 9 oh no no no

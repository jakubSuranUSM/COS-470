It's a town just outside of nowhere
With a general store and one lamp pole
We got wheat fields, saw mills, and coal mines
Down home country folks

Raised on 4H and dance hall auctions
Spaghetti dinners and parkin' lot fights
How it might be a little backwoods
Around here, that's alright

People know you by your first name
What kind of truck you drive
How your team did back in high school
So you can't lie

Better watch out who you take home
'Cause around here, it's a fact of life
People know you by your first name
And what you did last night

C'mon down to our fund raiser dinner
It'll be a high school reunion, I swear
Another family fallin' on hard times
So there won't be an empty chair

Listen close, and you'll hear a local legend
Of Billy Crockett and that twelve point rack
And you thought you were alone
Skinny dippin' the springs last night
But word here travels fast

People know you by your first name
What kind of truck you drive
How your team did back in high school
So you can't lie

Better watch out who you take home
'Cause around here, it's a fact of life
People know you by your first name
And what you did last night

Here I go

People know you by your first name
What kind of truck you drive
How your team did back in high school
So you can't lie

Better watch out who you take home
'Cause around here, it's a fact of life
People know you by your first name
And what you did last night

People know you by your first name

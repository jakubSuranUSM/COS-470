What you want I do not have
And what you fear nevertheless
You're now way in too deep
What is true I make believe, and then I'm blind to see
You're falling to your knees
You try to run
You try to hide
But you can't get enough
You need another high
You try to escape the light that shines, and you know you will not go
So now you turn your face away
To all you could have been
Instead of resisting, you give in

CHORUS
You can't go on burning life away
I will hold on, for better, brighter days
Heard you left and saw yourself
Looking back at you
You saw yourself walking out the door
You know the lies, the other side
But you can't get enough
You need another high
You try to escape the light that shines
And you know you will not go
So now you turn your face away
To all you could have been
Instead of resisting, you give in

CHORUS
Gentle like the waves you roll on by
The full moon's pulling shattered souls will rise

CHORUS

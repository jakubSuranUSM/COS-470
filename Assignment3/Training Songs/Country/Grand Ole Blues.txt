I sure am gonna miss them old twin fiddle
I love to sing them good ole country songs
But my whole world's a blue eyed girl in Memphis
And I'd be down there with her for too long

Midnight train to Memphis take me easy
Let me look back on the things I'm gonna lose
Nashville will never know I'm leaving
And it gives a country boy them grand ole blues

I wish I had my old guitar to play
I feel some good ole mem'ry fade away

Oh Lord, I see the main street lights of Memphis
And that woman leaves me shaking in my shoes
Oh woman's lips will kiss me her loving arms will hold me
And help me make it through these grand ole blues

But Lord I'm gonna miss them old twin fiddle
And it gives a country boy the grand ole blues
Her love is waitin' there in Memphis
And don't you it leaves me shaking in my shoes

Oh, woman's lips will kiss me her loving arms will hold me
And help me make it through these grand ole blues

Oh Lord, I see the main street lights of Memphis
And that woman leaves me shaking in my shoes
Oh woman's lips will kiss me her loving arms will hold me
And help me make it through these grand ole blues

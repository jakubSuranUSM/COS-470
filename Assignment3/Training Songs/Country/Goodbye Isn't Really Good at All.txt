It seems you've gone, without leaving
All the doors, are closed at night
Though I've tried ,to think of leaving
Goodbye isn't really good at all

If there were really something good to it
And I knew it wouldn't get me down
I could leave in the morning
But goodbye isn't really good at all

Here we are, alone together
That's the truth, and that's the lie
Though I try, I can't get over
Goodbye isn't really good at all

If goodbye were like it sometimes seems
If it could be like it's been in some of my dreams
I could leave in the morning
But goodbye isn't really good at all

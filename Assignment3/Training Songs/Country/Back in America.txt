I first saw the world in black and white
Grew up with the Beaver and Mayberry life
Things sure have changed
From how they were then
I want to turn it around and go there again

´Cause back in America cars had fins
Loser shakes hands with the one who wins
People take pride in the work they turn in
Nobody´s out for all they can get
At least that´s the way I remember it
Back in America
Back in America

You pick up the paper on every page
The victim´s of life their eyes full of rage
Now nothing is sacred and anything goes
And our values are set
By the way the wind blows

´Cause back in America cars had fins
Loser shakes hands with the one who wins
People take pride in the work they turn in
Nobody´s out for all they can get
At least that´s the way I remember it
Back in America
Back in America

No this world ain´t perfect it never has been
But it seems like times were simpler then
Like a ´57 Chevy and a Hank Williams song
The flag still waves and the spirit lives on

´Cause back in America cars had fins
Loser shakes hands with the one who wins
People take pride in the work they turn in
Nobody´s out for all they can get
At least that´s the way I remember it
Back in America
Back in America
Oh yeah back in America
Back in America yeah...

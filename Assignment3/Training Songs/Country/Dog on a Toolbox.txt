Baby I ain't complainin' so please don't get me wrong 
Sometimes you're like a puzzle with a couple of pieces gone 
It's a mighty wild ride that you've been takin' me on 

Sometimes I feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox 
In the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner 
Just tryin' to hang on for dear life 
 
When you had to have a little pink house I said OK 
When you pulled your Harley up to a church I just prayed 
My life is like a mobile home in a hurricane 

Sometimes I feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox 
In the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner 
Just tryin' to hang on for dear life 

Hangin' on it's what I live to do 
You know I love this crazy life with you 
Remember when you quit your job to rodeo 
Or the time you jumped on stage to sing with the Rolling Stones 
When you start rockin' I get ready to roll 

Sometimes I feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox 
In the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner 
Just tryin' to hang on for dear life 

Sometimes I feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox 
In the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner 
Just tryin' to hang on for dear life

Break these chains around my heart
Cut me loose and set me free
I can't stand to live my life
Bound to your memory

The phone rings, it's three in the mornin'
Who else could it be
You're gone but you try to keep it goin'
That's the last thing I need
Forever is over - now it's up to me

To (I gotta) break these chains
If I'm ever gonna love again
I gotta say goodbye and let it end
My heart is tellin' me if I'm gonna be free
I gotta break these chains

It's time to put away your picture
Take your pillow from my bed
I'm still bound to you, baby
But with every step
I'm gettin' stronger - and I won't bend

To (I gotta) break these chains
If I'm ever gonna love again
I gotta say goodbye and let it end
My heart is tellin' me if I'm gonna be free
I gotta break these chains

Chains, chains, everybody changes
Gonna have to be the one to break these chains
Chains everybody changes
Gonna have to walk away and break these chains

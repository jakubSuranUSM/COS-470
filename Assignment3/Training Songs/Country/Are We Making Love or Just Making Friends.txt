It's not working the way that I planned it
We're no closer than we were at the start
I can find my way to your body
But I can't find my way to your heart

Are we making love or just making friends
Are we holding each other or just holding hands
Is this the beginning or is this how it ends
Are we making love to just making friends

It's not easy when I'm laying beside you
Never knowing if you really care
Do you love me or do you just need me
Are we growing or going nowhere

Are we making love
Are we making love or just making friends

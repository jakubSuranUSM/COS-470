Beatin' on the ding dong all day long
I go around just singing this song
I got a gal, maybe two or three
Beatin' on the ding dong don't bother me

Most folks worry when they have no dough
Which can't feel good 'cause of feeling low
I don't worry if I'm broke no more
I ain't rich so I must be poor

Beatin' on the ding dong don't mean a thing
Just some words that you can sing
Makes no difference if they're right or wrong
Beating on the ding dong all day long

Some are happy when they have big cars
To ride around and they puff cigars
Give me a rattle trap model T
I'm as happy as a kid could be

A house and a flea and a bunch of mice
Out in the barnyard shootin' dice
The house grows cold and steps on a flea
The flea yells fellas there's a house on me

Beating on the ding dong all day long
I go around just singing this song
I got a gal, maybe two or three
Beatin' on the ding dong don't bother me

I stood with my gal on the porch last night
A huggin' and a kissin' till it got daylight
Her pa said get him and I had to dance
A bull dog had me by the seat of the pants

I don't have nothin' to bother me
As happy as a possum in a lemon tree
If I had a wife that'd work at all
I wouldn't have work this coming fall

Beating on the ding dong all day long
I go around just singing this song
I got a gal, maybe two or three
Beatin' on the ding dong don't bother me

Beatin' on the ding dong don't bother me

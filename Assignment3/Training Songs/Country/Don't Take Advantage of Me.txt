Don't make me a promise and then make me blue
Don't say you love me if that isn't true
Don't make me cry so much I can't see please don't take advantage of me
You might be the kind who'll just lead me on
Then when I need you most that's when you'll be gone
Don't tell me those sweet lies you know I'll believe please don't take advantage of me

Ever since I first met you I've been so in love
Day and night it's you that I'm thinking of
So before you hurt me I'm begging you please please don't take advantage of me
You might be the kind

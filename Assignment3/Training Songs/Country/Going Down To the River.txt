I'm going down to the river to wash my soul again 
I've been runnin with the Devil, and I know he's not my Friend
I've been falling by this wayside, livin in this world of sin 
I'm going down to the river, gonna wash my soul again 

I'm going out to the country, to bury my head in a creek 
I'm gonna jump into that water, baptize both my feet 
Cause everywhere I've been walking 
I've been getting in trouble deep
Going down to the river, gonna wash my soul again 

Well this whole world is going to Hell in a hand basket 
If I don't get some resurrection soon
I 'm going to end up in a Casket 
Well Whoo

I'm going down to the river to wash my soul again
I've been runnin with the Devil, and I know he's not my Friend
I've been falling by this wayside, livin in this world of sin 
I'm going down to the river, gonna wash my soul again 
I'm going down to the river, gonna wash my soul again
I'm going down to the river, gonna wash my soul again

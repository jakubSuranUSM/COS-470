Strange and beautiful are the stars tonight
That dance around your head
In your eyes I see that perfect world
I hope that doesn't sound too weird

And I want all the world to know
That your love's all I need
All that I need

And if we're lost
Then we are lost together
Yeah, if we're lost
We are lost together

Stand before this faceless crowd
I wonder why I bother
So much controlled by so few
Stumbling from one disaster to another

I've heard it all so many times before
It's all a dream to me now, a dream to me now

And if we're lost
Then we are lost together
Yeah, if we're lost
We are lost together

In the silence of this whispered night
I listen only to your breath
And in that second of a shooting star
Somehow it all makes sense

And I want all the world to know
That your love's all I need
All that I need

And if we're lost
Then we are lost together
Yeah, if we're lost
We are lost together

And if we're lost
Then we are lost together
Yeah, if we're lost
Then we are lost together
Together, together

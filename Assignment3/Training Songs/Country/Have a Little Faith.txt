Your best friend, your best girl just made a big messy world
'Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap, you got caught
You should've took her with a grain of salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you

So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin' there's nothin' you can do
But brush that teardrop off your face
And put a smile back in its place
Just have a little faith and love will come to you

Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue
Have a little faith and love will come to you

So don't be lonely and don't be blue
Your one and only is somewhere waiting just for you
Two lovin' arms to hug your neck
Right around the corner where you least expect
She'll be there with love to pull you through
Just have a little faith and love will come to you

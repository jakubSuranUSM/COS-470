That psycho, that psychologist
Asked me about my drinking ways
Every question that he asked me
All related back on to my childhood days

But if the truth was known
I never took the drinking long, long as she was mine
But when she left me I went to hell
Heaven was a drink of wine

That good doctor said, "Look at all
These ink spots and tell me what you see
Could I help it if they all look like
Big ol' broken hearts to me?"

Ah, my friends in Cane'll tell you
Ol' Haggard ain't a drinking kind
But when she left me I went to hell
And heaven was a drink of wine

Get back, get back
Get on back and leave me alone
Can't you see that you can't help
A man that's just for gone

Hey, good doctor, I've got something
You can't find in my mind
When she left me I went to hell
Heaven was a drink of wine

Hey, good doctor
Heaven was a drink of wine

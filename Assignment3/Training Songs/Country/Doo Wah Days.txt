Back in the doo-wah days
We had a ball
Nights on the boardwalk
We had it all

Time just skipped away
Back in our doo-wah days

Back in the doo-wah days
When we were young
Life was a carousel
We fell in love

Time just skipped away
Back in our doo-wah days

Be bop a lu, Peggy Sue
Those songs bring back old memories
Shupbop, shoowah, shananana
Those words mean so much to me

Back in the doo-wah days
You held me tight
You never let me go
It still feels so right

It's just as good today
Back in our doo-wah days

Back in our doo-wah days
We had a ball
Nights on the boardwalk
We had it all

Time just skipped away
Back in our doo-wah days

Back, back in our doo-wah days
We had a ball
Nights on the boardwalk
Honey, we had it all

Time just skipped away
Back in our doo-wah days

Back in our doo-wah days
Back in our doo-wah days
Doo-wah days

There's a full moon in the sky
It's got a hold on me, I'm hypnotized
Like your love it's getting stronger
Please keep my heart a little longer

Indian summer is on it's way
It's cool at night and hot all day
Ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa and wind blew them all to Maine

Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows this love is real

I'm a wide open spaced cowboy
I got lazy ways, I got some hidden joy
Motorcycle and tons of R.P.M
Ain't gonna wait around till it's here again

Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows my love is real

And Indian summer is on it's way
It's cool at night and hot all day
There ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa and wind blew them all to Maine
Blew them all to Maine

[Chorus]
Oh it tears me up when you go all to pieces
Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough
Tryin' hard don't always make it easy
Cause hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

Lately all I do is think about you
It's weighin' like a stone inside my mind
I know I've taken you for granted
And left your heart hangin' on the line

[Chorus]

Your love is finally gettin' to me
I can't believe the things I've done
And still you're standin' here beside me
The fool and the faithful one

[Chorus]

Oh hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

I don't love you like I used to do 
But I'm afraid to tell you so
I've got half a mind to leave you 
But only half the heart to go
Words to tell you just don't come to me 
Guess my courage is too slow
I've got half a mind to leave you 
But only half the heart to go

Now time may prove that you're not to blame 
But now's the time I need to know
I've got half a mind to leave you 
But only half the heart to go

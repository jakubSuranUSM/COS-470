Why's that old jukebox keep playin'
That sad country song all night long
So pour me a lone star
Tonight I'll be drinkin' alone, all alone
She said we'd never part, she never broke my heart

And there ain't a cow in Texas
And Wheaties ain't for breakfast
Late at night she'll never cross my mind
There ain't no rose of San Antone
And I can make it on my own
These can't be tears in my eyes
'Cause cowboys don't cry

Why's that old radio playin'
That same country song as I drive along
Guess by now she knows that she
Was the one who was wrong, all along
Bet she's missing me tonight
Bet she'd like to make things right

And there ain't a cow in Texas
And Wheaties ain't for breakfast
Late at night she'll never cross my mind
There ain't no rose of San Antone
And I can make it on my own
These can't be tears in my eyes
'Cause cowboys don't cry

I said there ain't a cow in Texas
And Wheaties ain't for breakfast
Late at night she'll never cross my mind
There ain't no rose of San Antone
I can make it on my own
These can't be tears in my eyes
'Cause cowboys don't cry

Because cowboys don't cry

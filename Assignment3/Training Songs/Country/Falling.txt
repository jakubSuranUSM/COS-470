Falling for you just like raindrops from an April sky
Calling for you like a hungry baby when it cries
I never thought that love could make me do
The crazy things I do
Just for you
Darling I'm not fooling
I'm really falling for you

Falling for you just like Romeo for Juliet
Calling for you like old memories you can forget
I never thought that love could make me do
The crazy things I do
Just for you
Darling I'm not fooling,
I'm really falling for you

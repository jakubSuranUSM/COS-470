White lines on the table between us,
Caught in the blur between the black and the gray
It's been a hard day for the homecoming queen, yeah
Turn on the lights, you know it's all right, it's all
Right
Yeah, all right

And it's all up between us
Man on a broken raft
Yeah, it's all up between us
Man on a broken raft

White lines on the foreign postcard,
Written in jest to the boy with the Vespa
Well, you don't go with the weekend doubles
You know they don't like puzzles like you
Not like you

Is it all up between us?
Felt the sun up between us
And it's all a parade,
Lost in dark and daze

Don't go with the weekend doubles
You know they don't like puzzles like you
Not like you
Not like you

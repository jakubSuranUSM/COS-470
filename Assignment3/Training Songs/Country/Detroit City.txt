I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
'Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I just think I'll take ol' Charley Pride put him on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones the ones that I left waiting so far behind
I want to go home I want to go home oh Lord I want to go home

I want to go home I want to go home I want to go gome

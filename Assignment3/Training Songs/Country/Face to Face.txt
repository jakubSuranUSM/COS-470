Run your fingers through my hair
And softly kiss my lips
And hold me close in your embrace
And love me face to face

Face to face, heart to heart
Body to body
Tingling tangle feelings
And lovers face to face

I'll caress your body
And hold you close to me
I'll slide my hands around your waist
And love you face to face

Face to face, heart to heart
Body to body
Lips on lips, arm and arm
Body to body
Tingling tangle feelings
And lovers face to face

Softly say you love me > female
As you make love to me > female
No one else can take your place
We happen face to face

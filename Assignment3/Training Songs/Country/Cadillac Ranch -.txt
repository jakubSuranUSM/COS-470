Well the well went dry and the cow did too
And daddy didn't know what to do 
The banker came by the house one day
He said he's gonna take the farm away
Then mama came up with a plan
My brother and me started up a band
My sister put a sign on the roof
And daddy bought a case of 90 proof

There we called it the Cadillac Ranch
They're parking cars in the old bean patch
There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
'Til the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch

Now the only thing that we raise is cane
You don't need the sun or rain
Just some neon lights saying some ice cold beer
Keeps everything green around here
Mama takes the cash at the door
My brother and me keep them out on the floor
My sister sets them up at the bar
And daddy kicks back with a big cigar

There we called it the Cadillac Ranch
They're parking cars in the old bean patch
There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
'Til the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch

Well we gave all the cows away
Now the only horns around here today
Are the ones up on the grill
Of a genuine '59 Coupe Deville

There we called it the Cadillac Ranch
They're parking cars in the old bean patch
There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
'Til the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch

There we called it the Cadillac Ranch
They're parking cars in the old bean patch

'Til the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good to sit around and cry
That's just wasted time

Cause I know it ain't right
Yeah I know it ain't right
To sit around all night and let your memory
Get the best of me

I could dig a hole and crawl inside
Where the hurt won't show and the sun won't shine

But that won't help my heart to heal
Or take away this pain I feel
Lord knows I'd keep digging if it would
But it

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Well I'm thinking I might
Yeah you know I just might
Get out tonight and tear up this old town
Burn Mr.A down
I could drown myself in misery
Swallow all that's left of you and me

But that won't help me say goodbye
To all these long and lonely nights
Wash 'em down with whiskey if it would
But it

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Oh I could roll I know
Tryin' to let you go
Come on

Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no good at all 

Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no don't don't don't
Don't do me no good at all

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good
Don't do me no good at all

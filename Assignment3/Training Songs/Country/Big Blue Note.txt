[Chorus:]
See that big blue note
Over there on the counter
You don't want to read that thing, man
It's a real 'get you down'er
But don't you dare say
Nothin' else bad about her
She's gone

No no no, no, no, don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
And I have to reread it
Besides, you show it to the boys downtown
They won't believe that
She's gone

[Chorus]

There used to be a time
I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find
Just like that, she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me

Is this big blue note
Folded up in my pocket
Yeah, don't laugh
It's been two months
I still got it
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

You know, my psychiatrist said
'Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots
Of reds and yellows and greens
You know, I looked at 'em all
But they all looked to me like
Big blue notes

[Chorus]

Stand high on this cliff
Overlookin' the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane
That I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
And if it don't come back to me, huh
You guessed it
She's gone

Crash landin'
Bye bye, baby

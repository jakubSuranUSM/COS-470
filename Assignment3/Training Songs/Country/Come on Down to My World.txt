Yesterday I finally found out where you are,
but I don't think that I should look around.
With you out there and me down here,
there's just no in between.
So I'll just wait for you to come on down.

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
The door is open you know where I'll be.
Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world.
My heart is closed and you have got the key.

The plans we made, began to fade, you changed your mind,
and left me for the new love you have found.
The only thing now I have left to do is cry.
So I'll just wait for you to come on down.          

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
The door is open you know where I'll be.

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
My heart is closed and you have got the key.

Baby, close that suitcase you've been packin'
Just sit down and talk to me awhile
I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'
But I guess I must have missed it by a mile

Well, this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
Help me understand where I went wrong
It's hard to find myself in this position
Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

What have I got to do to make it better
What have I got to do to make you see
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

I realize I took your love for granted
But I've learned that love worth having don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you
Satisfied and staying here with me

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on
You were right all along, so help me hold on

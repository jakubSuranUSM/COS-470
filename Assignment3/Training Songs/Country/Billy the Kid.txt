IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF TEXAS, EAST AND WEST OF EL PASO
WHERE THE MIGHTY FRANKLIN MOUNTAINS GUARD THE TRAIL TO MEXICO
THERE'S A NEW-MADE WIDOW CRYING AND A HEARSE A ROLLIN SLOW
I GUESS THE DEVILS PASSED THIS WAY AGAIN

THERE'S A LATHERED SORREL STALLION RUNNING THRU THE JOSHUA TREES
AND A YOUNG MAN IN THE SADDLE WITH HIS COAT TAILS IN THE BREEZE
HE'S GOT A SIX GUN ON HIS RIGHT HIP AND A RIFLE AT HIS KNEES
AND HE'S DEALING IN A GAME THAT HE CAN'T WIN

CHORUS
POOR BILLY BONNEY, YOU'RE ONLY 21,
PAT GARRETT'S GOT YOUR NAME ON EVERY BULLET IN HIS GUN
EVERY NOTCH YOU CARVE ON YOUR SIX GUN
HAS A BLOODY TALE TO TELL
YOU'RE A MILE AHEAD OF GARRETT AND A STEP OUTSIDE OF HELL

THOSE FANCY CLOTHES YOUR WEARIN AND THE WOMEN IN YOUR BED
CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE TRACES OF THE MEN THAT YOU'VE LEFT DEAD
AS YOU RIDE ACROSS THE BAD LANDS WITH A PRICE UPON YOUR HEAD
AND NOW THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE STARTS TO Turn

YOU'RE REPUTATION'S GROWN TILL IT'S THE BIGGEST IN THE LAND
AND THERE AIN'T ALOT OF PEOPLE LEFT WHO WANT TO CALL YOUR HAND
AND I GUESS YOU'LL GO DOWN SHOOTIN AND LIKE ALL BRANDED MEN
WHEN YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL YOU GET BURNED

CHORUS

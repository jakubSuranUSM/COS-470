I'm alone in a house made of sorrow
And each room is haunted with you
Should the end of the world come tomorrow
I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue

I scattered all our promises behind me
There's no use to hope that they'll come true
But if you change your mind you can find me
I'll be waiting on Heartbreak Avenue

I was warned that some day you'd desert me
I'd wake up and find that we were through
They all told me that you'd only hurt me
And I'd end up on Heartbreak Avenue

Someday you may understand this yearning
When somebody does the same to you
Then when deep in your heart there's a burning
We'll be neighbors on Heartbreak Avenue

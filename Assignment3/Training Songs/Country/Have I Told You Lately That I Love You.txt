Have I told you lately that I love you could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you well darling I'm telling you now
This hear would break in two if you refuse me I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you well darling I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately how I miss you when the stars are shining in the skies
Have I told why the nights are long when you're not with me
Well darling I'm telling you now
This hear would break...
Well darling I'm telling you now

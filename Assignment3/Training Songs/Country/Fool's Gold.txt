(Timmy Tappan/Don Roth)

If I only knew then what I know now
You wouldn't be sayin' goodbye
But I let you down, I was never around
When you needed me there by your side
I took a perfect love & gave you a perfect heartache
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

CHORUS:
Fool's gold, and I was a fool 'cause I let you go
Fool's gold, yes I was a fool 'cause I didn't know
Too many times I just didn't try
Now all I hear is you sayin' goodbye
Starin' at an empty hand full of fool's gold

If I'd spent the time just holdin' you tight
& sharin' my feelings with you
Then you'd understand what's inside of this man
& you'd know what I'm goin' through
I know that I was wrong now that it's too late
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

(chorus)

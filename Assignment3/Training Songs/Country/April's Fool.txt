April's Fool 
April doesn't shower her sweet love on me
What someone gets in one day may take me two or three
Yes, it's true, she leads me like a puppet on a string
But my life without April is like next year without spring
People say that April treats me cruel
But I just smile when they say
There goes April's fool
The first time I met April was the middle of December
And she's taught me so many things I'd rather not remember
In winter time she has me wearing summer clothes
In summer she has Jack Frost nipping at my nose
People say that April treats me cruel
But I just smile when they say
There goes April's fool

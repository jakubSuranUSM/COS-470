The night is early and the sky's still blue
Ain't even got to where we're going to
And you're nibblin' and whisperin' in my ear
What you wanna do?
Baby I do too
Well I don't wanna take this night too fast
It's just beginning, wait a minute, lets make it last

Easy does it
We're gonna take our time
Girl we got all night
No need to rush it
Let's just kick back and relax
Slow it on down, soak up this moment
Easy does it

The summer sun is finally going down
Parked on this back road not a soul around
And we're kissing and listening to the radio
When "Let's Get It On," just had to come on
Well all day long I've been playin' it cool
You say boy I wanna, when you gonna, make your move?

Easy does it
We're gonna take our time
Girl we got all night
No need to rush it
Let's just kick back and relax
Slow it on down, soak up this moment
Easy does it

Easy does it
We're gonna take our time
Girl we got all night
No need to rush it
Let's just kick on back and relax
Slow it on down, soak up this moment
Easy does it

Ah easy does it

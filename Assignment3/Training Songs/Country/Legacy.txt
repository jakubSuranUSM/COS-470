How did I catch your brown eyes?
How did I get your heart beating with mine?
It's something I never quite understood
Well I guess I must've tricked you good
Well must've done something in another life, right

When I'm gone, my name carved in stone
And that dash between the years, is all I left here
It won't be songs and stages I sang on
Girl, as hall of fame as I wanna be
A lifetime you loving me, hell that's a legacy

You're in everything coming off these strings
Baby you're the lead, I'm just the harmony
Behind every great man they say
There's a woman that made him that way
Looking at you girl it ain't hard to see, that

When I'm gone, my name carved in stone
And that dash between the years, is all I left here
It won't be songs and stages I sang on
Girl, as hall of fame as I wanna be
A lifetime you loving me, hell that's a legacy

When I'm gone, my name carved in stone
Over husband, friend and father
Survived by son, wife and daughter
It won't be songs that keep me living on
Girl, as hall of fame as I wanna be
It's a lot of love and a little family tree
Hell that's, a legacy

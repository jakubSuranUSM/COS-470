Someone and someone
Were down by the pond
Looking for something
To plant in the lawn
Out in the fields 
They were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping
This water will boil
When I look through the windows
And out on the road
They're bringing me presents
And saying hello

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

If I was a junkman
Selling you cars
Washing your windows
And shining your stars
Thinking your mind
Was my own in a dream
What would you wonder
And how would it seem?
Living in castles
A bit at a time
The king started laughing
And talking in rhyme

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age

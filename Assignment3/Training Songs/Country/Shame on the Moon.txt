TILL YOU'VE BEEN BESIDE A MAN
YOU DON'T KNOWWHAT HE WANTS
YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE CRIES AT NIGHT 
YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE DON'T
WHEN NOTHIN' COMES EASY
OLD NIGHTMARES ARE REAL
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN BESIDE A MAN
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HE FEELS

ONCE INSIDE A WOMAN'S HEART
A MAN MUST KEEP HIS HEAD
HEAVEN OPENS UP A DOOR
WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD
SOME MEN GO CRAZY
SOME MEN GO SLOW
SOME MEN GO JUST WHERE THEY WANT
SOME MEN NEVER GO

OOH BLAME IT ON MIDNIGHT
UUH SHAME ON THE MOON

EVERYWHERE IT'S ALL AROUND 
COMFORT IN A CROWD
STRANGERS FACES ALL ABOUT
LAUGHIN' RIGHT OUT LOUD
HEY WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'
STEP LIGHT ON YOUR TOES
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN BESIDE A MAN 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE KNOWS

OOH BLAME IT ON MIDNIGHT 
UUH SHAME ON THE MOON

OOH BLAME IT ON MIDNIGHT 
UUH SHAME ON THE MOON

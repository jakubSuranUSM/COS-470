I hear tell it's far away
And no one goes there now
But if we set our sights you know
We'll get there somehow

Come on darlin' let's
Take our chances we'll
Take them all the way and ...
 
Shoot for the moon
We'll Shoot for the moon

Remember nights you blinked your eyes
And the moon winked back at you
Now it was not so distant then
If your aim was true

So come on darlin' let's
Take our chances we'll
Take them all the way and ...
 
Shoot for the moon
We'll Shoot for the moon
Let's Shoot for the moon

Let's throw our dreams together
And seal 'em with a kiss
There is no way we can miss...

We'll shoot for the moon
Shoot for the moon
Let's Shoot for the moon
We'll Shoot for the moon

I hear tell it's far away
And no one goes there now

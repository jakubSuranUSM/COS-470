Well I knew at the moment when I saw you
I could feel you close to me across the room
Last night, oh all right
I found you
What went down there I knew could never leave me
It was that feeling, girl, I got from you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

It's been much too easy to remember sometimes
How empty handed loneliness can be
But when you were there to ease my mind
There was so much of something that I need
All the changes in the places at the time when
You were there and then at once I was with you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

Last night, I said, all right
I found you

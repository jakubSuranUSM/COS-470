Give me a little old fashioned love the kind that lingers through the years
The kind that's made by God up above give me a little old fashioned love
Now you can have the girls with rosy cheeks the ones that coo like turtle dove
I just want a simple girl that's sweet so give me a little old fashioned love
[ guitar ]
Now you can have the girls that's dressed so nice
From their head down to their little feet
But if you want some real good advice the old fashioned girls just can't be beat
So give me a little old fashioned love...
[ steel ]
Now you can have the girls with wordly ways that's had a dozen so called love affair
But they'll never make me their slave I want a simple girl that's on the square
So give me a little old fashioned love...

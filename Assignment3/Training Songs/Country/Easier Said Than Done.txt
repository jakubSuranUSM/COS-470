You put together all the pieces of the puzzle
So one more lie would be a waste of my breath
It's too late now for me to start being truthful
No amount of regret could win back your love
You see it's easier said than done
Words can't rebuild
All the trust my lies killed
Resurrect some old feeling
That's already gone
You see I can't make I love you
Mean what it used to
It's easier said than done
You've got every right girl to hate me
For betraying any real love we've known
Only a fool could break something so sacred
And begging forgiveness won't right the wrong
You see it's easier said than done
Words can't rebuild
All the trust my lies killed
Resurrect some old feeling
That's already gone
You see I can't make I love you
Mean what it used to
It's easier said than done
You see I can't make I love you
Mean what it used to
It's easier said than done

Put on your Bobbi-sox baby
Roll up your old blue jeans
There's a band playin down at the armory
Know's what rock and roll really means
I want to ride in your '55 T-bird
Drive through some old memories
I ain't after your body baby
I just want you to dance with me

[Chorus]
I want to bop with you baby, all night long
I want to bop the night away
I want to make it night like it used to be
When our hearts were young and our souls were free
I want to bop with you baby, all night long
I want to be-bop with you baby till the break of dawn
I want to bop with you baby all night long

I got an old photograph in my pocket
We were still in our teens
Lord knows I feel a lot older now
But you still look the same to me
Honey, you don't ever laugh like you used to
And I don't want to see you blue
If you ain't busy tonight and you think it's alright
This is what I want to do

[Chorus]

Let's twist and shout
Oh, just like in the good old days
Baby, watch out
You know I just can't stand it when you look at me that way

I want to bop with you baby, all night long
I want to be-bop with you baby till the break of dawn
I want to bop with you baby all night
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to be-bop with you baby till the break of dawn
I want to make it a night like it used to be
When our hearts were young and our souls were free
I want to bop with you baby all night long
I want to be-bop with you baby till the break of dawn
I want to make it night like it used to be,
When our hearts were young and free

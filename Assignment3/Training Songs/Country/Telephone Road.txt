My brother Jimmy, my other brother Jack
Went off down to Houston and they never come back
Mama wasn't gonna let her baby go yet
But there ain't nobody hirin' back in Lafeyette

I'm workin' all week for the Texaco check
Sun beatin' down on the back of my neck
Tried to save my money but Jimmy says no
Says he's got a little honey on Telephone Road

Come on, come on, come on, let's go
This ain't Louisiana
Your Mama won't know
Come on, come on, come on, let's go
Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road

Telephone Road's ten miles long
Fifty car lots and a hundred honky-tonks
Jukebox blastin' and the beer bottles ring
Jimmy banging on a pinball machine

Come on, come on, come on, let's go
This ain't Louisiana
Your Mama won't know
Come on, come on, come on, let's go
Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road

Mama never told me about nothin' like this
I guess Houston's 'bout as big as a city can get
Sometimes I get lonesome for Lafeyette
Someday I'm goin' home but I ain't ready yet

Come on, come on, come on, let's go
This ain't Louisiana
Your Mama won't know
Come on come on come on let's go
Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road

Come on, come on, come on, let's go
This ain't Louisiana
Your Mama won't know
Come on, come on, come on, let's go
Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road

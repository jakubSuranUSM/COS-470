Daybreak pressing on the windowpane
No music playing no morning rain
Nothing but feelings leading me on
I'm just talking to you while you sleep in my arms
As long as I'm here on earth
Baby you'll be my baby
All of my love's in these simple words
Baby you'll be my baby
As long as I'm here on earth

Life isn't perfect and never will be
It doesn't matter 'cause you're perfect for me
Through heartaches and mistakes, passion and pain
Down to my last breath I'll call your name

As long as I'm here on earth
Baby you'll be my baby
All of my love's in these simple words
Baby you'll be my baby
As long as I'm here on earth

Oh, baby you'll be my baby
As long as I'm here on earth

Oh yes, listen to me now
Just as long as I'm living
Just as long as I'm living baby
Are you listening to me now?
Oh yeah, just as long as I'm with you
Just as long, just as long oh oh, oh oh
Oh as I'm here on Earth, oh, oh, oh
Just as long as I'm with you
Just as long, just as long oh oh, oh oh
Oh as I'm here on Earth
Just as long as I'm with you
Just as long as I'm with you baby
Oh listen to me when I'm saying something
Just as long as I'm with you
Just as long, just as long oh oh, oh oh
Oh yeah, just as long as I'm with you
Just as long, just as long

It's been so long, so very long
I wonder what did I do wrong
I've been so sad and blue
Since you said "Baby, we're all through"

If you leave me in this mood
I fear I'm bound to come unglued
Oh to hold you in my arms again
I'll be so lonely untill then

Well maybe I've been a bad boy baby
Yes and I've told my share of lies
But baby please forgive me
'Cause it's so hard to realise

You may be gone, never to return
Oh what a bitter lesson to learn
There's only one thing left to do
Baby say so long to you
Baby say so long to you
So long

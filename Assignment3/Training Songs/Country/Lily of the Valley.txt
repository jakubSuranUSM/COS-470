I grew up in Alabama in a valley I called home
And I learned to love sweet lily from the start
But I had to do my duty yes I had to do my part
But the thought of leaving really breaks my heart
If this war could just be over and I could go back home
If I could hold and kiss her once again
Then if I should die tomorrow after loving her tonight
Then I would not feel my life had been in vain
Cause she's my lily of the valley and I want her for my wife
She's my lily of the valley I guess I've loved lily almost all my life all my life

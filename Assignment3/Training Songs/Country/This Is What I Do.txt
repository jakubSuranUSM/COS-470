This is what I do this is what I do
Jennifer 1 was a racehorse-rider Heidi was a house on fire
Bernadette kept a distance we got tangled up in telephone wire
I'm gonna sing this song forever about a girl that I once knew

And how she is always leaving this is what I do
This is what I do for a living this is what I do
In another life I was a holy roller in another lifetime I flew
I have always kept a distance this is what I do

This is what I do for a living this is what I do
This is what I do this is what I do
Every one of us has a secret rhythm beating like a drum
All of us have a albatross and this is my one

This is what I do for a living this is what I do
I could hide it in the attic I could bury it in static
I could only put it out in Japan
I could tape my mouth closed I could take another dose

I am dancing as fast as I can
This is what I do for a living this is what I do
This is what I do this is what I do

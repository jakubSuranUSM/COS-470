Every which-a-way I go and every which-a-way I turn I seem to be
Looking for a love I never never find, fighting back pain and misery,

One day my love run away now everything I touch just seems to turn
To more heartache and misery, making my poor heart burn, burn

I found the thrill of love
Then felt the chill of love
Funny I'm still in love
Even though she let me down
And then gave me the run-around

Every which-a-way I go and every which-a-way I turn I seem to be
Looking for a love I never never find, fighting back pain and misery,

I found the thrill of love
Then felt the chill of love
Funny I'm still in love
Even though she let me down
And then gave me the run-around

Oh, every which-a-way I go and every which-a-way I turn I seem to be
Looking for a love I never never find, fighting back pain and misery,

Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, at all

Thought I heard a young girl cry 'Mama'
Thought I heard a young girl cry today
I didn't hear no young girl crying 'Mama, mama, mama'
I didn't hear no young girl cry at all

Thought I heard a young boy cry
I thought I heard a young man cry today
I didn't hear no young boy cry
You didn't hear no young man cry

Now, there is no more morning dew
Now, there is no more morning dew
What they've been saying all these years was not true
Now, there's no more morning dew

No, no, no, no more
No, no, no, no more
No more morning dew
No more morning dew

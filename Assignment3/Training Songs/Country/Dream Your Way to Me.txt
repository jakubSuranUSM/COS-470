I can't be with you now
But I know how you are
You're starin' up at the sky
Wishin' on a star
That I was still there
But I'm closer than I seem
Baby just close your eyes
And dream your way to me

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me
We don't ever have to be apart
As long as you can dream your way to me

I'll hold your hand
We'll fly through the clouds
When you wake up tomorrow
There won't be a doubt
We were together
All you have to do is believe
Is this where you want to be
Dream your way to me

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me
We don't ever have to be apart
As long as you can dream your way to me

Soon we'll be together to stay
When your wish comes true
But until that day

Dream your way to me
Dream your way to me
We don't ever have to be apart
As long as you can dream your way to me

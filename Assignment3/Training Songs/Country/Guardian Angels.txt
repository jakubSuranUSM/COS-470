A hundred year old photograph
Stares out from a frame
And if you look real close you'll see
Our eyes are just the same
I never met them face to face
But I still know them well
From the stories
My dear grandma would tell

Elijah was a farmer
He knew how to make things grow
Fannie vowed she'd follow him
Wherever he would go
As things turned out they never left
Their small Kentucky farm
But he kept her fed
She kept him warm

They're my guardian angels
And I know they can see
Every step I take
They are watching over me
I might not know where I'm goin'
But I'm sure where I come from
They're my guardian angels
And I'm their special one

Sometimes when I'm tired
I feel Elijah take my arm
He says,

It's late at night
You're all alone
Pale moonlight
Cold as stone
Heart beats fast
Time moves slow
Strangers glance
Does he know

Where you gonna run to
Where you gonna hide
Where you gonna run to
Where you gonna hide
Where you gonna run to
Where you gonna hide
When the people find out

That you lied
They took you in, made you well
They told you things, they never tell
To pay the debt, you made em fools
That's what you get, they trusted you
When they run to the temple and find
That the treasure's gone
Do you think it's gonna be a cross
They're gonna nail you on

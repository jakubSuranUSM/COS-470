She, she, came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
And she, she worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, when she sure could sing
Then he looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He'd help her some
And he didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one

Oh, yes, she sure could sing
My, my she sure could sing
She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah

They used to walk singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she never knew what her life was to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day

Oh, yes, she sure could sing
Yeah yeah she sure could sing
She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah

She she came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She, she worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun
My, my, my she sure could sing
Oh, yes and she sure could sing
Ooh, yes, yes she sure could sing
Oh and she sure could sing

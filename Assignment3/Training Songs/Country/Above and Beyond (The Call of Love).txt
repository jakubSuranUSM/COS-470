A poor boy's chances for pretty girl's glances're sometimes very few
But I have no money if you'll be my honey here's what I'll offer you

Well I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Well I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

We met by chance and I knew at a glance I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you if you just agree

And I'll give you love
Yes love's something that money can't buy
Oh love's something that money can't buy

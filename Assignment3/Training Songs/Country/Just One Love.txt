Just one love that shines for me 
Shines a light that I can see
Just one love shines for me tonight 
Just one love shines for me tonight
Just look at all those stars up in the sky

The wind is blowing through the trees 
Weather that's inside of me
Makes a sound that follows me around
It makes a sound haunting me to hear
It blows me round and round when you are near
Just one love...

[ guitar ]

Well, babe, as far as I can see 
Stars are what they want to be
They want to be the one to make you smile
Just a little love of your heart is all they need
Just a little of your love could be for me
Just one love...
Just look at all those stars up in the sky

Don't you ever get tired of the noise
Don't you ever get bored with the crowd
If they have so much to say
Would they have to talk so loud
Why don't we get out of here
'Cause I want to whisper in your ear

[Chorus]
Hey you
Are you listening to me
I've got to tell you what you mean to me
You're the one I want to tell my secrets to
Hey you

There's some things I need to say
There's some things we've got to talk about
I've got to have your full attention
I don't want to have to shout
Even though you're right here near me
Well I wonder if you ever hear me

[Chorus]

Hey you
Hey you

Everybody's just dyin' to be heard
Everybody they want to know why
Everybody's got to have the last word
And it's always got to be goodbye
Why don't we get out of here
'Cause I want to whisper in your ear

[Chorus: x2]

Hey you
Hey you

Tonight is like to work late and I just can't stay home
A few dreams with an old friend somehow don't seem so wrong
But a dream or two a friendly kiss just wets my appetite
Oh conscience keep an eye on me tonight
I can't be true to someone who thinks the world of me
And what the girl he thinks I am is all I'd like to be
But when temptations beckon I can't tell wrong from right
Oh conscience keep an eye on me tonight
[ steel ]
It's hard to face the man I love with a heart so full of shame
If and when I lose him well I know who's to blame
I don't know why I'm not like this it's something I must hide
Oh conscience keep an eye on me tonight

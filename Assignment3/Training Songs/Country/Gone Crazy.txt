Here I am all alone again tonight
In this old empty house
It's hard to learn what you don't think you need
You can't live without
Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've been gone

[Chorus]
Gone crazy, goin' out of my mind
I've asked myself the reason, 
At least a thousand times
Goin' up and down this hallway
Tryin' to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left, 
I've been gone

I never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
The things you said I never understood
Are now crystal clear
I never spent this much time at home
But ever since you left,
I've been gone

[Chorus: x2]

I've been gone
I've been gone
I've been gone
(Gone)
Gone (gone)
I've gone (gone)
I've been gone.

I came here because I knew I'd be welcome
And because somehow you always understand
You seem to have a way with lonely people
And you always were my greatest helping hand

[Chorus:]
Now once again I'm here to take advantage
Though I don't deserve the arms I left alone
I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on 

I over looked the love you tried so hard to give
The love I never seem to understand
I always stay just long enough to hurt you
And what little love I gave was second hand

[Chorus:]

Now once again I'm here to take advantage
Cause once again the one I love is gone
I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on
Yes I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on

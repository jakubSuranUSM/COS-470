It was a teenage wedding 
And the old folks wished them well 
You could see that Pierre 
Did truly love the mademoiselle 
And now the young monsieur and madame 
Have rung the chapel bell 
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to slow you never can tell 

They furnished off an apartment 
With a two room Roebuck sale 
The coolerator was crammed 
With T.V. Dinners and ginger ale 
But when Pierre found work 
The little money comin' worked out well 
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell 

They had a hi-fi phono 
Boy did they let it blast 
Seven hundred little records 
All rockin' rhythm and jazz 
But when the sun went down 
The rapid tempo of the music fell 
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell 

They bought a souped-up Jimmy 
T'was a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans 
To celebrate their anniversary 
It was there that Pierre 
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle 
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell

It was a teenage wedding 
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre 
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame 
Have rung the chapel bell 
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell
"C'est la vie", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell

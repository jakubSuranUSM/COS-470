Honey you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
I wanna be right here where you are
Till my dying day, oh baby

So many have tried, tried to find
A love like yours and mine, oh baby
Don't you realize how you hypnotise me
Make me love you more each time, oh baby

Honey, I'll never leave you lonely
I'll give my love to you only, to you only
To you only

Honey you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
I wanna be right here where you are
Till my dying day, oh baby

Feel so good when we're lying here next to each other
Lost in love, oh baby
Honey when we touch, I love you so much
You're all I ever dreamed of, oh baby

Honey, I'll never leave you lonely
I'll give my love to you only, to you only
To you only

Honey you are my shining star, don't you go away

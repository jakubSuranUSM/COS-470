(You were born to sing)
There's only one thing to do when you find out that you were born to sing
No matter what your age you gotta get on the stage cause you were born to sing
You gotta open up your heart let the music start it's a feeling you just can't explain
It's the kind of thing that makes a bird want to sing or a spark burst into a flame
It's the hard life they say but you want it anyway cause you were born to sing
Call it vanity your pride but there's a message deep inside
That you've just gotta bring

In a schoolhouse hall or a president's ball before beggar or a king
You've got no choice you've gotta raise your voice cause you were born to sing
You gotta open up your heart

You've got no choice you've gotta raise your voice cause you were born to sing

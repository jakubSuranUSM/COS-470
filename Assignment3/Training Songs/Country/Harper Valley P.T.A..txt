I want to tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.

The note said Misses Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a runnin' round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A. 

Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Misses Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room 
And as she walked up to the blackboard I still recall the words she had to say
She said, I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A. 

Well there's Bobby Taylor, sitting there and seven times he's asked me for a date
Misses Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mister Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well Mister Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed to long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Tompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did , it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

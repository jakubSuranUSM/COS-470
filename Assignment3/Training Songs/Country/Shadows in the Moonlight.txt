We'll be shadows in the moonlight, darlin' I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hide a way where we can love the whole night away
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day

Ooh the night is young and baby, so are we
Glad, I'm gonna make you glad you came
You won't need a thing
Just bring your love for me
And darlin' I will do the same

We'll be shadows in the moonlight, darlin' I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way

Do you want me to think
Just bring your love for me
You'll be glad you came
Just wait and see

We'll be shadows in the moonlight, darlin' I'll meet you at midnight
Hand and hand we'll go, dancin' through the Milky Way
And we'll find a little hide a way where we can love the whole night away
We'll be shadows in the moonlight right up 'til the light of day

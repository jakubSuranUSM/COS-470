Whiskey river, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey river, don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

Whiskey river, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey river, don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathin' my memory in mind in the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current flowing from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey river, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey river, don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathin' my memory in mind in the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current flowing from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey river, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey river, don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

Whiskey river, take my mind
Whiskey river, take my mind

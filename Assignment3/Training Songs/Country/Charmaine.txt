I wonder why you keep me waiting 
Charmaine, my Charmaine
I wonder when bluebirds are mating 
Will you come back again

I wonder if I keep on praying 
Will our dreams be the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too 
Charmaine, my Charmaine

Charmaine, my Charmaine
Will you come back again
I wonder if I keep on praying

Will our dreams be the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too 
Charmaine, my Charmaine

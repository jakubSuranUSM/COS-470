I don't know what it is about this city
Every road I walk down I discover
Little pieces I thought I never had in me
I never had in me
I guess you knew it all along

That somewhere down the darkest alley is a heartbeat
Is a heartbeat
You remind me
And I swear that I am walking through a daydream
Hear your heartbeat
That's where you're gonna find me

Every shape and transatlantic color wrap around me, I've discovered 
That I just want to get as far as I can run to from the sun in California
I don't know how the west is ever gonna win me
Once I'm breathing in the water
I'm gonna drown out every sentimental memory
Find the courage to start over

Oh I know there's got to be a reason
'Cause I'm always running from my life
They say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions"
But I don't know what it is about this city

Miles away someone I know is sleeping
In a bedroom by the window
I guess I've always been afraid that I would miss out
And get blown out like a candle
And I don't know what it is about this city
Every road I walk down, I discover
Little pieces I thought I never had in me
I never had in me
And it's raining here in London

Oh I know there's got to be a reason
'Cause I'm always running from my life
They say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions"
But I don't know what it is about this city

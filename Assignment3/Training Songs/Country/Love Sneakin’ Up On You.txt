Rainy night, I'm all alone
Sittin' here, waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold, cold sweat
Thinkin' about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Hey, hey yeah

Nowhere on Earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin' up on your blind side
You might as well try to stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be, yeah
Come on, let's finish what you started with me
Yeah

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Hey, yeah

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
And if your whole world is shakin', feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Excuse me for living
Don't mind if I do
I hope all is forgiven
You know I'd do the same for you

Chorus:
But if it's true what they say
Someone must pay
I'll bear my share of pain but I won't take all the blame
If it's all the same to you

I used to like to choose my poison
But now I wouldn't dare
Make a choice between the water 
And whatever's in the air.

Chorus

I'd like to buy the world an aspirin
And slip it in their coke
If it'd do any good 
I'd tell the world a joke

Chorus

Bridge:
Well now they tearing down the wall
Saving every brick
Just in case they wanna build a new one
Hit me with a stick 
But If I had my pick I guess I'd wanna take the blue one

Jesus Jesus
Won't you tell me how to do it
You know I wouldn't trust the world
Half as far as you threw it

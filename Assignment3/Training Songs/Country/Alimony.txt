Alimony alimony work till my fingers are bloody and boney
Me oh my oh goodness sake I'm paying for my mistake
Ali-money I call it ali-money you married men may think it's funny
Till one fine day you'll wake and find you're paying for your mistake
Every Friday when I get my pay I put it in an envelope and mail it away
Same old song with a little more blues in it
I'm paying for it while someone else's usin' it
Alimony alimony I thought I bought steak and it was all baloney
Me oh my oh goodness sake I'm paying for my mistake
[ guitar ]
Alimony alimony...
Every payday paying for my mistake yes I am friends

D                                                     
Who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes 
       A                        D
Or the bitter directions of impending goodbyes 

I'm fallen and folded I'm wilted in place 
        A                                  D
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face 
             Em             A                                         
You got your heartbroke     running from the reason 
Em               A                                   
Heartbroke don't give up on believing in me 
Em         A                                D
Heartbroke who kept me from leaving with my heartbroke
D                                      
Pride is a bitch and a bore when you're lonely 
      A                      D
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield 
                                         
But all is not lost it is only mistaken  
       A                       D
That's small consolation but I know just how you feel  
             Em             A                                         
You got your heartbroke     running from the reason 
Em               A                                   
Heartbroke don't give up on believing in me 
Em         A                                D
Heartbroke who kept me from leaving with my heartbroke

Well nobody said it was going to be easy 
    A                          D
We all have our weak side that need a softer  touch 
     D                                                               
But nobody said that it wouldn't be worth it 
    A                     D
The human condition continues as such
             Em             A                                         
You got your heartbroke     running from the reason 
Em                A                                   
Heartbroke don't give up on believing in me 
Em         A                                    D
Heartbroke who kept me from leaving with my heartbroke

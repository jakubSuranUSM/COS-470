Ashes of love, cold as ice                    
You made the debt and I'll pay the price   
Our love is gone, there's no doubt                 
Ashes of love, the flame burned out

A love light that gleams in your eyes
Has gone out to my surprise             
Now we said goodbye. 
My heart bled
I can't revive a love that's dead

Ashes of love, cold as ice
You made the debt and I'll pay the price
Our love is gone, there's no doubt
Ashes of love, the flame burned out

Now I trusted you, our love would stay
Your every wish was my command                            
And my heart tells me 
I must forget                
I loved you then. 
I'll love you yet

Ashes of love, cold as ice
You made the debt and I'll pay the price          
Our love is gone, there's no doubt                                 
Ashes of love, the flame burned out
Ashes of love, cold as ice                         
You made the debt and I'll pay the price          
Our love is gone, there's no doubt                                 
Ashes of love, the flame burned out
Ashes of love, the flame burned out

Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu
Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu
Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu
Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu

Another day it's the same old grind
A tired body and a tired mind, yeah
The whistle blows and then I'm free
It's like an angel's a-callin' me

I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound

Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu
Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu

Well, I swear that this old truck
It's like a golden chariot-it's got a
A short bed and a long loan
But it's surely gonna take me home, and

I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound

Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu
Aluma luma hu, aluma luma hu

Its been a long day, Lord, and I've worked hard
But now I'm goin' to my final reward
It's your love and I just can't wait
To be standin' at the pearly gates, and

I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound

Well, I'm gonna leave this weary work-day
world behind
When I look in your eyes, that heavenly
light gonna shine

Oh yeah

I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound, yeah
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound, yeah
I'm ready, yeah, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound
I'm ready, I'm ready
It's five o'clock and I'm heaven bound

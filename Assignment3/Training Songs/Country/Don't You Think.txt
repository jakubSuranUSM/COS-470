She's been gone away too long in fact eight weeks tonight
Don't you think I've got a right to cry
She just walked right out the door she didn't say goodbye
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

Loving her gives me the right to miss her like I do
And it gives me a right to be as blue as I want to
I don't want too much of this my heart's about to die
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

She walked off and left me with a great big bunch of hurt
And don't you know she walked on me like I was so much dirt
What a lousy way to thank me after how I've tried
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

I don't own a brand new Benz
I drive an old pick up with rust and dents
I can't afford to live with the upper class
I got a three room, one bath fixer up
But all I got, is all I need

A fishing hole and a summer breeze
My best girl by my side
Lost in love on a starry night
And all I want are the simple things
And all I've got, is everything

There's a little spot down by the lake
We pack a lunch and spend the day
Spread the blanket on the ground
Be the only ones for miles around
But all I got, is all I need

A fishing hole and a summer breeze
My best girl by my side
Lost in love on a starry night
But all I want are the simple things
And All I've got, is everything

There's no better place that can be found
Than to be with her and watch the sun go down
But all I got, is all I need

A fishing hole and a summer breeze
My best girl by my side
Lost in love on a starry night
When all I want are the simple things
And all I've got, is everything

Well I've got everything!!!

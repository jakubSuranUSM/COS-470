Off somewhere the music's playing soft and low.
And another holds the one that I love so.
I was blind I could not see
That you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go.

Now, I'm crying my heart out over you.
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new.
Ever since you went away
I die a little more each day
'Cause I'm crying my heart out over you.

Each night I climb the stairs up to my room.
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom.
I miss your picture on the wall
And your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over you.

Now, I'm crying my heart out over you.
Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new.
Ever since you went away
I die a little more each day
'Cause I'm crying my heart out over you

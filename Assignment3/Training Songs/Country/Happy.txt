Well, I never kept a dollar past sunset
Always burned a hole in my pants
Never get to school mama happy baby
But always blew a second chance

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I never took candy from strangers
Never wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss every night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me
Happy, happy

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, me, me happy
Come on baby, keep me happy

Never got a flash out of cocktails
Never had a flesh off the bone
I never got a lift out of Lear Jets baby
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me, keep me happy
Won't you keep me happy

Happy
Ooh, happy baby

I kept waitin' on a reason
In a call that never came
No I never, saw it comin'
Somethin' in you must have changed

All the words unspoken, promises broken
I cried for so long, wasted too much time
Should have seen the signs
Now I know, just what went wrong

I guess I wanted you more
And lookin' back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

All the nights we spend just talkin'
Of the things we wanted out of life (out of life)
Makin' plans and dreams together
I wish I'd seen, I was just too blind

My heart was open, exposed and hopin'
For you, to lay it on the line
In the end, it seemed
There was no room for me
Still I tried, to change your mind

I guess I wanted you more
And lookin' back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

Oh, I don't need you
I don't need you anymore

I guess I wanted you more
And lookin' back now I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

I don't need you,
I don't need you anymore

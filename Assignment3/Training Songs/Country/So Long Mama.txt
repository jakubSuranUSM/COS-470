What do you want from me now, mama?
I picked you up when you were down
All of the time I thought you loved me
You were runnin' all around

You got the wrong information
'Cause it's a bad situation
So you just walk yourself right out that door, mama
I don't want you anymore

If I said that you've grown cold lately
That'd be an understated fact
I'd get more lovin' from an iceberg baby
So before you melt, get off my back

There's gonna be a slight correction
You'd better find a new connection
Get out your spring-a-later shoes
Start payin' your own dues
I don't want you anymore

You strut around town with your nose up in the air
I'll bet you've never seen the ground
You'd better learn how to breath through your ears, mama
'Cause if it rained right now you'd drown

To avoid a misinterpretation
It's time you took a long vacation forever
You just walk yourself right out that door, mama
I don't want you anymore

What do you want from me now, mama?
I picked you up when you were down
All of the time I thought you loved me
You were runnin' all around

You got the wrong information
'Cause it's a bad situation
So you just walk yourself right out that door, mama
I don't want you anymore

So long, mama

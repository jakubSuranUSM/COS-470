To me twelve months is a long, long time
For someone to suddenly change their mind
He was in and out, now it's just too late
But I won't lose one night of sleep
Worryin' about what was meant to be
His leavin' is just a reason to celebrate

[Chorus]

I'm on a mission, I got a cause
I'm gonna hit every rockin' little honky-tonk bar
And the way I'm thinkin', it ought to be against the law
Gonna see what kind of trouble I can find
I'm on a head-on collision with a real good time
I'm on a mission, and it's all about forgettin' tonight

Forty-hour week and I'm out the door'Seems like all I'm workin' for
Is that time when I can finally just cut loose
I got a few good friends and they're waitin' to go
Just gimme some time to change my clothes
'Til Monday mornin', there ain't nothin' I gotta do

[Chorus]

Ain't worried 'bout a five-day no-sleep business-week
No-escape workin'-girl blues
Yeah, I'm just doin' what any other
Modern day American woman might do

[Chorus]

I'm on a mission and it's all about forgettin' tonight
I'm on a mission

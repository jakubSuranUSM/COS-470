Come on dad get with the jive
Lets let em` know that we`re alive
Until the break of dawn
We`ll yell for more, more, more
Gonna live it up an tear it down
Get in the groove and paint the town
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

[Chorus:]
Well now, baby baby let`s go tonight
Together you and me
Baby baby when ya hold me tight
Oo wee whatcha do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it`s time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Big Bad Pete with a crazy bop
When the lights are low an the musics hot
Dance from two to three and then a half past four
When that sun peeks over the hill
I won`t stop I`ll be rockin' still
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

[Chorus x2]
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way 
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots  
Not play connect the dots 
I just want to disappear

Up, up, up 
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up, 
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up,  
There's no way but up from here

Even something as simple as 
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why 
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh

And up, up, up 
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up, 
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, 
There's no way but up from here

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way 
It just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily, oh, oh, oh

And up, up, up 
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up,
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, 
There's no way but up from here
Up, up, up

Oh I'm going up 
Oh I'm going up 
Oh I'm going up, up, up
I'm going up 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

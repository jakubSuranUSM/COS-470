You've been sittin' here 
For quite some time
Puttin' down a lot of scotch
One eye is winkin' at me
And another's lookin' at your watch
Well I don't want to hear about 
No headache, baby
As strong as you've been comin' on
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

Well, baby well, maybe
I shouldn't call you baby no more
You say business like this
You don't want to sell me no bacon
Don't you haul it out the door
Cause I want you, I need you
Baby, don't you read me wrong
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

Well I learned my lesson a long time ago
When I was back in school
I treat you like the Queen of Sheba
But, baby, don't you play me no fool
'Cause I want you, I need you
Baby, don't you string me along
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

Oh
You're lookin' real good tonight, mama
You've got all your green lights on
Well, every time I try to talk to you
It's just like talkin' on the phone
Well, I need some lovin' from your soul
It ain't enough that your legs are long
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

Well, I learned my lesson a long time ago
When I was just back in school
I treat you like the Queen of Sheba
Oh but, baby, don't you play me no fool
'Cause I want you, I need you
Baby, don't you read me wrong
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

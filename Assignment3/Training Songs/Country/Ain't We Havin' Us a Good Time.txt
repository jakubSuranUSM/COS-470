Two little honey bees a livin' in an apple tree
They got together and made a little honey now 
They're as happy as honey bees can be
Baby like you and me
Ain't we havin' us a good time a walkin' in the sunshine
Baby don't you think that we've done found us a gold mine
Ain't we havin' us a good time takin' in a good life
Baby don't you think that lovin' each other is so fine

Love was a hopeless thing nothin' but a foolish dream
But all of a sudden we found each other we got the feelin' 
And then we fell in love
Baby ain't love too much
Ain't we havin' us a good time

Oh baby don't you think that lovin' each other is so fine

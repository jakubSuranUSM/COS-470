The painter stood before her work;
She looked around everywhere.
She saw the pictures and she painted them
She picked the colors from the air

Green to green
Red to red
Yellow to yellow in the light.
Black to black when the evening comes.
Blue to blue in the night.

It's a long road behind me.
It's a long road ahead.
If you follow every dream,
You might get lost.
If you follow every dream,
You might get lost.

She towed the line.
She held her end up.
She did the work of too many.
But in the end, she fell down
Before she got up again.

I keep my friends eternally.
We leave our tracks in the sound.
Some of them are with me now.
Some of them can't be found.

It's a long road behind me,
And I miss you now.

If you follow every dream,
You might get lost.

Now it's back to the barrooms
Right back to drinkin' again
Someday you'll love me enough to stay with me
And whiskey won't be my best friend
But now it's back to the barrooms again

The bartender knows me, he knows how you do me
And he knows why I'm back here again
He should be given a prize for his patience
'Cause bartenders do understand
So it's back to the barrooms again

With the loud music roaring and the bartender pouring
And my shaky legs trying to stand
It's over and over I've tried to stay sober
But look what a failure I've been
And so it's back to the barrooms again

Oh yes it's back to the barrooms
Right back to drinking again
Maybe someday you'll love me enough to stay with me
And whiskey won't be my best friend
So it's back to the barrooms again
Oh yes it's back to the barrooms again

Look at me I'm gorgeous in my housecoat with my coffee cup
I bend to get the paper
Every neighbor's trying to check me out
Look at me I'm lovely as I wave beside my mini van
Look at how my diamonds seem to sparkle on the garbage can

God bless the American housewife
How she does it all I'll never know
God bless the American housewife
She could use a miracle for sure
God bless the American housewife
Cleaning up the world for you and me
God bless the American housewife

Look at how my children play Commando in the cul-de-sac
Look at how my husband has survived another heart attack
Look at all the other mothers, envious of all my things
Had to call the plumber
'Cause my daughter flushed by wedding ring

God bless the American housewife
How she does it all I'll never know
God bless the American housewife
She could use a miracle for sure
God bless the American housewife
Cleaning up the world for you and me
God bless the American housewife

Look at me I'm beautiful and glamorous in rubber gloves
Look how my tiara can be bent back to the shape it was
I can do the laundry and make dinner while I'm on the phone
Look at me I'm sexy as the devil when I mow the lawn

God bless the American housewife
How she does it all I'll never know
God bless the American housewife
She could use a miracle for sure
God bless the American housewife
Cleaning up the world for you and me
God bless the American housewife

God bless the American housewife

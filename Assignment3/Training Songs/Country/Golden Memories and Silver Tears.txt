I dream of a golden moon and silver stars
When first we met and danced to sweet guitars
Music that breaks my heart bringing me dear golden memories and silver tears
Golden memories and silver tears are my lonely heart's souvenirs
All that you've left me are memories dear golden memories and silver tears

And now dear my golden moon pass and turn to blue
And all those silver stars are gone with you
Old memory of love bringing me pain oh how sad to love and love all in vain
Golden memories and silver tears

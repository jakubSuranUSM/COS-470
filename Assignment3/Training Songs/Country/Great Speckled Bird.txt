1.What a beautiful thought I am thinking 
Concerning a great speckled bird 
Remember her name is recorded 
On the pages of God's Holy Word. 
2. All the other birds are flocking 'round her 
She is despised by the squad 
But the great speckled bird in the Bible 
Representing the great church of God. 
3. All the other churches are against her 
They envy her glory and fame 
They hate her because she is chosen 
And has not denied Jesus' name. 
4. Desiring to lower her standard 
They watch every move that she makes 
They long to find fault with her teachings 
But really they find no mistake. 
5. She is spreading her wings for a journey 
She's going to leave by and by 
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning 
She'll rise and go up in the sky. 
6. In the presence of all her despisers 
With a song never uttered before 
She will rise and be gone in a moment 
Till the great tribulation is o'er. 
7. I am glad I have learned of her meekness 
I am proud that my name is on her book 
For I want to be one never fearing 
The face of my Savior true love. 
8. When He cometh descending from heaven 
On the cloud that He writes in His Word 
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him 
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

Heroes and heroines are scarcer than they've ever been 
So much more to lose than win 
The distance never greater 
Way back when you made history 
By flying planes across the sea 
Embarking on your odyssey 
You put away the danger

Heaven bless the one who flies 
A pioneer on frontier skies 
The world was dark and your only mark 
Was the light of the northern star 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The seeds of rust and days gone by 
Your wings hang in a gallery sky 
I wonder how you're flying

Way out on the western plains 
The snow drifts high and the dust wind burns 
The Chinooks blow their winds across the mountains 
A life that's never safe and dry 
Rodeos and riding high 
Ladies and their men get by 
On six-guns and white lightning 

Heaven bless them on the road 
Those drifters and their dreams of gold 
The world was wide and cowboy's soul 
Could span the whole horizon 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The dust and the dirt under outlaw skies 
A piece of land and a stubborn mind 
Were the only things worth having

Now they say the moon is dust and ash 
California's made of cash 
We're waiting for those hills to crash 
Into the sparkling waters 
Rain and snow and sun and wind 
You roamed the earth and you spread your wings 
And long ago, my heroes' dreams 
Belonged to all God's creatures

Heaven bless the ones who sleep 
The ones who laugh and the ones who weep 
Heaven bless the ones who keep 
Their bearings strong and certain 
And Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven 
Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven

Darling will your love be mine forever always always
Will you keep those vows we made together always always
Will your love be as strong if my dreams should all go wrong always always
Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always
Will your love be strong enough
To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return of your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always

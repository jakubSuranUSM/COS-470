What do you say when it's over?
I don't know if I should say anything at all
One day we're rollin' in the clover
Next thing, you know, we take the fall

Still, I think about the years since I first met you
And the way it might have been without you here
I don't know if words from me can still upset you
But I've just gotta make this memory stand clear

I know I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

I guess, I always knew I couldn't hold you
But I'd never be the one to set you free
Just like some old nursery rhyme your Mama told you
You still believe in some old, 'Meant to be'

Still, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I think I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man

Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man
For knowin' you this way
Things I couldn't do before now I know I can
And I'm leavin' here a better man
(Ooo ooo ooo)
Yes, I'm leavin' here a better man

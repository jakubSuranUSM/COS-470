I didn't sleep last night
I didn't sleep the night before
I'm pretty wound tight
I couldn't empty out my head
All the serious questions
Seem to eat my time away

We were a marked type
We found a penthouse in the woods
The garbage bag airtight
I only wish I could forget

The glossy imperfection
Seemed to take my grip away
Why'd you still watch yourself
Why'd you still watch yourself

Found my glove that I can't the remove the stains
We took a look there was no one around
But it never took long
We found a penthouse in the woods
Tell me that I am wrong
Tell me that I should just forget

All the serious questions 
Seem to eat my time away
Why'd you still watch yourself
Why'd you still watch yourself
The glossy imperfection
Just seemd to take my grip away
Why'd you still watch yourself
Why'd you still watch yourself

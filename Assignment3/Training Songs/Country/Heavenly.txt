I didn't think you were but now I know you are
A sunshine of my world my bright and morning star
You changed me in the twinkling of an eye to what I am
A man who's life you filled with love as if by heaven's planned

And you're heavenly so heavenly
Being loved by you makes this world heaven to me
And I hear church bells ring I hear angels sing
When you're with me cause you're so heavenly

I didn't think I could but now I know I can
Forget the loneliness that I knew and be a happy man
The heaven blessed me with your love and made my life complete
The world is better place to live when true love is so sweet

And you're so heavenly heavenly...
Being loved by you is so heavenly

She's just a fallen angel and I'm the fool who made her fall
Last night I saw an angel the one I once called mine
The hand that wore my wedding band held a glass of wine
I took her love for granted I wronged her night and day
I drove my angel from me and now she's gone astray
She's just a fallen angel but I don't blame her for it all
She's just a fallen angel and I'm the fool who made her fall
[ steel ]
So many times she told me she couldn't take me much more
So many times I laughed at her and walked right out the door
I wasn't worthy of her and now my angel's gone
The devil took her from me and claimed her for his own
She's just a fallen angel...

I've been out on this highway now five days in a row
My words all run together and my feet are movin' slow
I've got to stop and eat while it's still light
There's a local angel sittin' on my right
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Well I'm ordinarily very shy
And I'd be polite if I had the time
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Tomorrow I'll be good and gone
Please don't make me wait that long
Baby, you look good to me tonight
"I get off at eleven," she said and walked away
She poured a cup of coffee and she brought it on a tray
She said, "It would be nice if you could stay,
You're the best idea I've had all day,
Usually I put up a fight
But baby, you look good to me tonight"

Well I'm ordinarily very shy
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie
Said, baby, you look good to me tonight

I thought I must be in a dream
When she asked me if I wanted cream
Baby, you look good to me tonight
All in all you know it's not a bad life on the road
If you've got wheels to roll and lucky stars above
Your destiny's your own, you go as far as you can go
And if there's time to sleep
There's time to make love
I came I saw I conquered and I rode off in the sun
But I know the look she left me with keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering these words of prophecy:
"Well, I may come easy but I don't come free
You're never gonna see the last of me"

Baby, you look good to me
I was born to love you now can't you see
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Well, I'm ordinarily very shy
But I take the time to satisfy
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Baby, you look good to me tonight

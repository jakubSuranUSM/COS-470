I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be a little rain sometime

When you take you gotta give
So love and let live and let go
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things
Like big diamond rings
But you don't find rose growin'
On stalks of clover
Well, you better think it over

Well, if sweet talkin' you
Could make it come true
I would hand you the world right now
On a silver platter
But what would it matter

So smile for a while
And let's be jolly
Life shouldn't be so melancholy
Come and let's share the good times
While we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be a little rain sometime

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

Well, I could sing you a tune
Or promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know

You better look before you leap
Still waters run deep
There won't always be someone there
To pull you out
That's just what I'm talkin' about

So smile for a while
And let's be jolly
Life shouldn't be so melancholy
Come and let's share the good times
While we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be a little rain sometime

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be a little rain sometime

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

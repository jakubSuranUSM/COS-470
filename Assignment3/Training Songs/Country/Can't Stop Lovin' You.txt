Well I tried my best but that ain't enough
I'm tryin' to forget you and it's gettin' mighty tough
The blues just follow me around the whole day through

No matter where I go honey I still find
You're right there bearin' on my mind
I've tried so hard but I can't stop loving you

I can't forget about the many good times, we used to have
You and I
I think about how you found somebody new, and ever since I just
Sit and cry

Somebody tell me what am I gonna do
Feelin' like this I can't live my life through
I've tried so hard but I can't stop loving you

I can't forget about the many good times, we used to have
You and I
I think about how you found somebody new, and ever since I just
Sit and cry

Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raisin' children
It's a job - meant for two
Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together 
With you gone.

Today was Angie's birthday
I guess it slipped your mind
I tried twice to call you
But no answer either time
But the postman brought a present
I mailed some days ago
I just signed it love from mama
So Angie wouldn't know.

Holding things together
Ain't no easy thing to do
When it comes to raisin' children
It's a job - meant for two
Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together 
With you gone.

Alice please believe me
I can't go on and on
Holding things together
With you gone.

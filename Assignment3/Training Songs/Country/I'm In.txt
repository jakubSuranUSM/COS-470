Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tougue tied
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth 
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in
Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here
You take your time
Just let me hold you
And we'll both take that leep of fait
It's like I told you there's no guarantee when you feel this way
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth 
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in 
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am 
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth 
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in

I'm in I'm in
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am 
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am 
Baby come here next to me
Baby come here baby

Don't walk away from me darling is that the way it has to be darling
Can't we start our love anew don't tell me our love is through
Oh darling please don't walk away
Now that you want to go darling I realize I love you so darling
Don't turn your back on me I don't want to be set free
Oh darling please don't walk away

I know now I put everything above you so how were you to really know I love you
Yes I was blind but now I see that you say you still love me
And darling please don't walk away
Don't walk away from me darling is that the way it has to be darling
Can't we start our love anew don't tell me our love is through
Oh darling please don't walk away my darling tell me that you'll stay

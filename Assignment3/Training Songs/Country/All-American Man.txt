Shall we walk?
Shall we run?
Through my head
You understand
Does the body you conceal
Need the touch of someone's hand?
Ashes, violations--
Who would they burn for?
In your isolation...
Why can't you see?
I wonder if the lights out
I wonder if they're listening
Hold me
Lay your shame away
Show me
Where your lovers stay
Hold me
Lay your ghosts away
Show me
For yourself
You are lost
And alone
But a prisoner of your pride
When the passions you ignore
You can never hide
One of these days
You're going to find out
'Cause one of these days
You're going to try
And what did I say
To make you wind up
With this spear of guilt inside
I wonder if the lights out
I wonder if they're listening
Hold me
Lay your shame away
Show me
Where your lovers stay
Hold me
Lay your ghosts away
Show me
For yourself

You're so sophisticated
Your mind's been liberated
You're the first to notice when a movement's come and gone

Just as the curtain closes
I strike authentic poses 
Now that we know all the words to history's sad songs

So don't be apocalyptic
There's still time to get your last licks
But very soon the glory will make shameful what is true

And don't be apologetic 
So what if it is genetic?
The cowards still breathe easy as their secret's safe with you

Are you still feeling bad
That your mother left your dad?
Are you so sure that everybody lies?

Guess what your pains been done
Took perfection by everyone
And the first thing every killer reads is
Catcher in the Rye

You're so sophisticated
Your mind's been liberated
You're the first to notice when a movement's come and gone

So maybe you should just release the doves
'Cause no one will survive the end of love

Maybe you should just release the doves
'Cause no one will survive the end of love

No one will survive the end of love
No one will survive

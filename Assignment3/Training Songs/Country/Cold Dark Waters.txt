In tomorrow's newspaper you'll read about me but they won't tell the story I know
For they'll only say he plunged yesterday to the cold dark waters below
I guess it all started the day we first met you promised that you'd love me so
And I never thought it would end in regret in the cold dark waters below
[ piano ]
In a moment I'll ride on the drift of the tide and I hope your conscience hurts so
All the tears that I've cried will be easy to hide in the cold dark waters below
Now I hear them running to try and stop me they're shouting oh don't let him go
But it's far too late and I'll soon meet my fate in the cold dark waters below
In the cold dark waters below

(Alright)

Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown
Tonight I think I'm gonna look around
For something I could not see
When this world was more real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

My love, my love has gone away
My love, my love, what can I say?
My love would never see 
That this world's just not real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

I told my love a thousand times
That I can't say what's on my mind
But we would never see
That this world's not real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown
Tonight I think I'm gonna look around
For something I could not see
When this world was more real to me
Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

Tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown

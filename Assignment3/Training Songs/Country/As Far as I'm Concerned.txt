As far as I'm concerned 
That amber moon that can make the tides return 
Won't match the light within my eyes 
The night I learned that I'm the one you'll always love

As far as I'm concerned 
The mid day sun that can make the planets turn 
Is cold as ice compared with how your kisses burn 
And show my heart the warmth of love

Long, long ago days were empty life was oh such a slow caravan 
But now that you're here how the hours tumble by and the days disappear
They say we live and learn but what care I 
If I never ever learn why robins fly away 
As long as they return and I love you and you love me 
For that's as far as I'm concerned. 

They say we live and learn but what care I 
If I never ever learn why robins fly away 
As long as they return and I love you and you love me 
For that's as far as I'm concerned

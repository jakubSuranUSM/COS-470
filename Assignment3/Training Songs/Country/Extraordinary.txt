I was a daydream
Quiet and unseen
I lived in stories 
But inside I kept a mystery
I was a starling
Nobody's darling
Flying in perfect circles
Just for company

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

A midnight airplane
A window glowing
I know I am another sparkle in the sky
I shine uncovered
Still undiscovered
But you must see me 
In the corner of your eye

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

Waking up to week of sundays
I am my own parade
Stopping off at a sidewalk cafe
The wind is playing up in the trees
Kicking up confetti leaves
Seems as if it's all to say

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready
And now I'm ready to be
Extraordinary

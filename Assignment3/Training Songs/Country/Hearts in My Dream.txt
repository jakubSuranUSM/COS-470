HEARTS IN MY DREAM
Writers George Jones, Roger Miller

I dreamed that all the hearts I've broken came to visit me
And in my sleep they came to pay me for their misery
They were all so torn and shattered, Oh such tales of woe
It was I who caused them all and my conscience hurts me so
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see
Hearts in my dream
Each one of them true
Each one loved me so
Each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see

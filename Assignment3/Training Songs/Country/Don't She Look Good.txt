She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She'd forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn

You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
Or anything crampin' your style
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?

Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own?
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
And that's why she kept hangin' on?

She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscience
She did all she could for a while
Then she picked up the pieces and she started livin'
Now don't she look good when she smiles?

Don't she look good in the new dress I bought her?
And the new way that she wears her hair?
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares

You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?

Oh, don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?

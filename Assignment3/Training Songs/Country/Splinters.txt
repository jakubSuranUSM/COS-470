Self sent a twister
A tearin' after me
Gonna bust my house to splinters
An take all that's dear to me

You say you saw it comin' yeah
But still you did not flee
I was too weak I couldn't move
Held by growth of a tree

An yes I fell upon that rock
I did not die just badly broken
An in time my healing it will come
By the words that He has spoken
Oh yeah
I fell upon that rock

Who is it now that loves you
Strait in the front door
An crooked out the back
What is it now you're a slave to
On your knees out in your shack
Oh yeah
I fell upon that rock

He is beyond the shadow
Of your doubt and mine
He is no man's opinion
He is truth divine

Self sent a twister
A tearin' after me
Done bust my house to splinters yeah
An took all that's dear to me yeah
Come on

Who is it now that loves you
Strait in the front door
An crooked out the back
What is it now that you pray to
As your world begins to crack
Yeah, oh yeah
I fell upon that rock
Yeah

He's beyond the shadow
Of your doubt and mine
He is no man's opinion
He is truth divine

An yes I fell upon that rock
I did not die just badly broken
An in time my healing came yeah
By the words that He has spoken

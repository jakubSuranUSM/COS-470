I've got this sensitive condition
It's aggrivated by, bars and neon lights
And bedroom eyes all painted up
Fast ladies and slow songs
I feel a cheatin' heart attack, comin' on

I feel, a cheatin' heart attack, comin' on
I think it's best I get myself on home
'cause if I stay for one more drink
I won't leave here alone
I feel a, cheatin' heart attack comin' on

I had a real close call with a sweet young thing
She hit me hard took me right off guard
Handed me a drink
I heard the golden band on my hand
Ring against the glass and that
Cheatin' heart attack was gone at last

I felt, a cheatin' heart attack comin' on
And I think it's best I get myself on home
'cause if I stay for one more drink
I won't leave hear alone
I can feel a, cheatin' heart attack comin' on

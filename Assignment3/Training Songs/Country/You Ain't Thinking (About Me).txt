Newspapers lying by the door
I don't miss you anymore
I took the elevator down from the thirteenth floor
And you ain't thinking about me

I read a paper, I played the old Strats
I spent eighteen dollars at the local laundromat
And northbound train rolled over my very best hat
And you ain't thinking about me
No, you ain't thinking about me, anymore

Ground started to shake and the light turned to black
I lost one hundred dollars at the dog track
And some long-legged Madonna keeps calling me Shadrak
And you ain't thinkin' about me

The sky is heavy and the road is wet
It glistens in the night like a lit cigarette
I got a dollar in my pocket and how much you wanna bet
That you ain't thinking about me
No, you ain't thinking about me anymore

Since you been gone, I just haven't been the same
You had to leave because you said you never came

Well, there's good times and bad times
And something in between
And for a while you were the best thing that I had ever seen
And then one day, don't know why, you up and turned mean
And you ain't thinking about me

I wish I had a headache, I wish I had a flu
Or somebody or something else or something else to do
Because the last thing I wanted to be is thinking about you
When you ain't thinking about me
No, you ain't thinking about me anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore

You ain't thinking about me
I ain't thinking about you
You ain't thinking about me

You ain't thinking about me
I ain't thinking about you
You ain't thinking about me

You ain't thinking about me
I ain't thinking about you
You ain't thinking about me

You ain't thinking about me
I ain't thinking about you
You ain't thinking about me

You ain't thinking about me
I ain't thinking about you
You ain't thinking about me

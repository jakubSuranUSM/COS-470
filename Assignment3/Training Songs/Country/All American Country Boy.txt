I work a forty hour week and I earn my keep
And I try to walk proud and tall
I keep my nose to the grind, I don't get behind
And I don't back up at all
Well my neck's a little red, my collar's blue
I sip a little coffee and I drink a little booze

[Chorus]
Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
Cause I'm an all American country boy

I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
I'm hooked on TV, Rolaids and B.C.'s
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change

[Chorus]

Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father time can slow you down
I'm still doin' all I used to do
It just takes a little longer now

[Chorus]

I'm just a country boy
A good ol' country boy

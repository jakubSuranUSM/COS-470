Scarlet O'Hara
Henna ma honey
You are the one
Ma silver moon lady
She like a choir boy
Hair all a-cloudy
And flying and real

A halo a sky gold
A moon on the water
A scuddy go cloud
Aroundy the sky bowl
Henna ma honey
You are the one

My copper go-go-girl
She like a show girl
Delightful Dolores
Ma Anna Belinda
Maggie yer reggae
You move me along

My copper go-go-girl

Maggie yer reggae
You move me along

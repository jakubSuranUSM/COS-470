Now I'm a pretty big man around this town 
I got me the hottest little Chevy around 
My sweet little '66 
She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back 
But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black 
Sweet little '66 

She got the three ninety-six, she got the four on the floor 
And those stickers in the window ain't just for show 
My sweet little '66 

Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79 
Then he went into the army so now she's all mine 
Sweet little '66 
I used to run her down on River Road and make a little dough 
Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low 
Me and my '66 

Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil 
But she was built by union labor on American soil 
Sweet little '66 
So when your Subaru is over and your Honda's history 
I'll be blastin' down some back road with my baby next to me 
In my sweet little 66

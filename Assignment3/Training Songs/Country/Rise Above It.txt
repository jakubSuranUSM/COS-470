Life can be so hard to understand,
Things don't always go the way we plan.
Right out of the blue can come a change.
And that old sunny sky just turns to rain.

But we can rise above it.
Long as we got love,
Baby, we can rise above it.
That's what we're made of.
Hand in hand, side by side,
Baby, don't you know that you and I,
Can rise, rise above it.

This old world don't give no guarantees.
Everyday is another mystery.
Just when we think we're on solid ground,
Around the bend come a flood to pull us down.

But we can rise above it.
Long as we got love,
Baby, we can rise above it.
That's what we're made of.
Hand in hand, side by side,
Baby, don't you know that you and I,
Can rise, rise above it.

Honey, I know we've had our share of trouble,
But the good Lord don't send nothin' we can't handle.

We can rise above it.
Long as we got love,
Baby, we can rise above it.
That's what we're made of.
Hand in hand, side by side,
Baby, don't you know that you and I,
Can rise, rise above it.

Rise, rise above it.

Rise above it.

Rise above it.

We can rise above it.

Cry, baby, no, I don't mind
You can be a baby, that's alright
Go on and cry, baby, cry

We both know how love could be
Anything but easy
There's bound to be some tears

Through all those ups and downs
Falling in love and out
Baby, if you are hurting now, I'm here

And you can cry, baby
Go on and cry
You can use my shoulder anytime
You wanna cry, baby, cry

Cry, baby, no, I don't mind
You can be a baby, that's alright
Go on and cry, baby, cry

We all get down and sometimes we feel alone
Needing someone to hold
And it's more than we can take it

If that's how you feel now
It's alright to let it out
'Cause I'm right here to wipe your tears away

So go on and cry, baby
Go on and cry
You can use my shoulder anytime
You wanna cry, baby, cry

Cry, baby, no, I don't mind
You can be a baby, that's alright
Go on and cry, baby, cry

Cry, baby, go on cry
You can use my shoulder anytime
You wanna cry, baby, cry

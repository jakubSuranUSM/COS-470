Hold tight with a leather fist
Watch out when he starts to twist
That's what their daddies' used to tell them boys

How to ride them bulls
I got a jingle in my jeans
Sore places in between
And I'm leavin' on a saw blade
With a push and a pull

10-4 buddy, come on back
A horse trailer on a Cadillac
Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy
In the coupe de ville
Chug-a-luggin' up one side
Slidin' down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill

Turn up that radio
Don't wanna think about a rodeo
Don't wanna think about a round-up
Up in old cheyenne
It's a crazy circuit
But still you work it
Turn down that sound, boys
Let's get up and check the scan

10-4 buddy, come on back
A horse trailer on a Cadillac
Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy
In the coupe de ville
Chug-a-luggin' up one side
Slidin' down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill

Bandana hangin' mirror
Still wet from ear to ear
We'll, I guess it's true then
What the wise men say
When you ride your last one
Make sure he's the best one
Jump while he's movin'
Tip your hat boys and walk away

I'm a lover of the other
Side of the hill

I'm a lover of the other
Side of the hill

My heart is out of control 
This ole love struck soul
Just lives for the moment you're around
When I hold on to you 

It is all I can do
Just to keep my feet on the ground
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me 
I get a little bit crazy

Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me 
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately

Will I laugh will I cry 
Will I live will I die 
It all depends upon you
And it is dangerous I know 

To be lost in you so 
But I am and there's nothing I can do
Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me 

I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly
Look at what you've done to me 
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately

Desperately loving you desperately
When you're not here with me 
I get a little bit crazy
Constantly I think about you constantly

Look at what you've done to me 
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately

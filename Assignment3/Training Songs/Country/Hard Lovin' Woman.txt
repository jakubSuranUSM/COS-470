Everybody said Bobby was a little hard-headed.
If there ever was a book on love, Bobby never read it.
Suzy was a poor boy's dream in a high school sweater.
She was ready to run but her Daddy wouldn't let her.
She told her Momma how she loved her man,
She said: "Daddy don't understand."
While she was cryin', Momma shook her head.
She took her by the hand and said:

"It takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman,
"To love a hard-headed man."

Bobby got a job at the west end fillin' station.
He was savin' for a diamond ring after graduation.
Suzy's old man came by for some gas and water.
He said: "Boy, stay away from my daughter."
That night, by the light of the moon,
Bobby climbed up to Suzy's room.
Momma saw 'em pullin' out of the drive,
But she didn't wake up Daddy this time.

It takes a hard lovin' woman;
Takes a hard lovin' woman;
Takes a hard lovin' woman,
To love a hard-headed man.

The June weddin' was a big affair.
Daddy even bought a tux to wear.
The preacher told 'em, as he joined their hands:
"Love when you hurt; laugh when you can;
"Keep hangin' on till you understand:

"It takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman,
"To love a hard-headed man.

"Takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman;
"Takes a hard lovin' woman,
"To love a hard-headed man."

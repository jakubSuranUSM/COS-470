Disappointments weigh so heavy
Leave it's wreckage all around
Once a good man, once respected
Sorrow breaks a good man down

Had a good love, had a good life
Now the sadness all around
Dread the darkness, hate the daylight
Sorrow breaks a good man down

I remember all the good times
When the world was ours to claim
Then she left me, took the sunshine
Every night wind speaks her name

Can't stop loving, can't stop living
There's no answer to be found
No ambition, just existing
Sorrow breaks a good man down

I remember all the good times
When the world was ours to claim
Then she left me, took the sunshine
Every night wind speaks her name

Can't stop loving, can't stop living
There's no answer to be found
No ambition, just existing
Sorrow breaks a good man down

Sorrow breaks a good man down

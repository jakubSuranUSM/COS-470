Oh Elizabeth I long to see your pretty face
I long to touch your lips, I long to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth I'm sure missing you

I remember when we shared a life together
You gave me strength and love, and life that felt brand new
You so far away I have to say I'm feeling blue
Oh Elizabeth I'm sure missing you

Oh Elizabeth I long to see your pretty face
I long to touch your lips, I long to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth I'm sure missing you

Well it's been said before that I've caused many heartaches
And I wonder if that parts really true
Be it right or wrong it feels my heart will surely break
Oh Elizabeth I hope you understand

Oh Elizabeth I long to see your pretty face
I long to touch your lips, I long to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth I'm sure missing you

Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth I'm sure missing you
Oh Elizabeth

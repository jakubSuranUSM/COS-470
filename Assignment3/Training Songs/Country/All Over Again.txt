Back when you were younger and the summer would last forever
Looking at you and loving you, that's the way you made me feel
Whoa oh oh, we've been too caught up in all that stuff we call life
It's just you and me right now

I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again

When you look in my eyes and it's like the first time
You gave me your heart, and you just keep giving me more
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again

Hmm, back when I didn't know every little thing about you
And I was figuring out, finding out what I'd do to make you smile, yeah
Whoa oh oh, we've been too caught up in all that stuff we call life
It's just you and me right now

I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again

When you look in my eyes and it's like the first time
You gave me your heart, and you just keep giving me more
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again

You know you're my my my my my baby
I know I've not not not not told you lately
But there's something about the way you look tonight
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again
I think I'm falling in love with you

I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again

When you look in my eyes and it's like the first time
You gave me your heart, and you just keep giving me more
I think I'm falling in love with you
I think I'm falling in love with you
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over again
All over again
All over again

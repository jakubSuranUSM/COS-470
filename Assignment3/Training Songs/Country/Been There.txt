Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
And wonder where you were
You need the one and only that can hold you tight
And reach for her, but she's not with you
You just wish this trip would end
You know I've been there and I don't want to go back again

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
And wonder who you are
You suddenly discover there's a price you pay
For gettin' this far, it's the part of you
That you really didn't have to spend
You know I've been there and I don't want to go back again

So many moments I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat

Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream
That didn't come true
You think you've gotta give up on on makin' that scene
And seeing it through, you feel like breaking
When you really just need to bend
You know I've been there and I don't want to go back again

There's so many moments I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the night
Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream

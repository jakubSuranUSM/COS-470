Hey
The furnace burns in steel town
Big business came and tried to shut em down
Workers got together and they bought that mill
They're making steel in Pittsburgh still

The family farm down in Indiana
The bank's foreclosin' just because they can
The farmer can't do nothin' 'bout another drought
But John, Waylon & Willie came and helped 'em out

These are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
These are the days of America
Walking together in the promise land

The wheels in Detroit keep on turnin'
A blue collar lesson there for the learnin'
The throttle drives you anywhere no matter how far
Just never give up on who you are

These are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
These are the days of America
Walking together through the promise land

Right down the middle of America
Where her heart beats strong and true
Look up and just open your eyes
The flag still waves and the eagle still flies.

These are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
These are the days of America
Walking together in the promise land

These are the days
These are the days of America
These are the days
These are the days of America

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me

Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E

Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek

Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E

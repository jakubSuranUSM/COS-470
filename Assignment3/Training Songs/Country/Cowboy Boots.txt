Well all of my life I been a tryin' to save to get a pair of cowboy boots
Sixteen years of my life I gave to get a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the money's free Hollywood is a callin' me
Oh what a great big star I'll be in a pair of cowboy boots

I'm gonna get on a TV show in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna ride in a rodeo in a pair of cowboy boots
I wanna go where the family lurk I'm gonna get a job and go to work
Givin' lessons to that Stony Burk in a pair of cowboy boots

Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roam
Where the money grows on trees
The gals all wanna be squeezed

Well I'm a gonna get there if I have to crawl in a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest a gun on my hip and a star on my chest
Well I'll be the terror of the Golden West in a pair of cowboy boots

Oh give me a home
Where the swimmin' pools roam
Where the money grows on trees
The gals all wanna be squeezed

Well I'm a gonna get there if I have to crawl in a pair of cowboy boots
Get in the movies and that ain't all in a pair of cowboy boots
I'm gonna get me a leather vest a gun on my hip and a star on my chest
Well I'll be the terror of the Golden West in a pair of cowboy boots

In a pair of cowboy boots
In a pair of cowboy boots
In a pair of cowboy boots

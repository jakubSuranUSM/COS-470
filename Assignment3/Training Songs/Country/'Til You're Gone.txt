How many days...
How many ways...
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
How many nights...
How many lonely nights...
Do I have to lose you darlin'
'Til you're gone?

It happens every time
I think I'm gettin' over you
Something 'bout somebody new
Gets me thinkin' about you
Chorus:
How many times...
How many times...
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?

I see you on the Late Show
I hear you on the radio
Darlin' everywhere I go
Your memory is there

(How many times?) I wanna know...
(How many times?) Do I have to lose you Darlin'... 'til you're gone?
(How many times?) How many days...how many nights...'til you're gone?
(How many times?) I wanna know...
(How many times?) I wanna know Darlin'...

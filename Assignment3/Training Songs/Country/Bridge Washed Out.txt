The bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
When I awoke this a mornin' the rain was a pouring down
I was gonna wed the little river girl just over the bridge across town
Now I'm a runnin' up and down the river and my nerves are driving me wild
Cause the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Oh rain oh rain stop fallin' dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride are waitin' and the weddin' bells are startin' to chime
I can't kiss and hold her and it's drivin' me out of my mind
Cause the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side

Yeah I got one foot in the river one foot solid on the ground
I try to swim that ragin' ol' river but I know if I try I'd drown
There's not a boat around me they walked on out with the tide
And the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Yeah rain oh rain stop fallin'...
I said the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side

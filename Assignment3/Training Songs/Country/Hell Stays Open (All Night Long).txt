She said hello
And I said hon', it's me
She said I might have known
And I said oh, listen please
Leaving you for her was wrong
Please let me come back home
This old town's closed down
And I have no place to go

[Chorus]
And she said
Hell stays open all night long
Hell never closes
It's open from dawn 'til dawn
When I slammed the door to heaven
I should have known
Hell stays open all night long

She said good-bye
Don't call me anymore
For the one that I love now
Is at my door
Some one has took your place
This is something you'll just have to face
As far as I'm concerned
When you have no place to go, remember

[Chorus]

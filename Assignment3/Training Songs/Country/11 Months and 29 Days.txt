A one, two, three, four

Busted in Austin 
Walkin' around in a daze
I'm sittin' in a slammer 
Lookin' out through these bars in a haze
But it'll all clear up 
11 months and 29 days

Keep the Lone Star cold 
The dance floor hot while I'm gone
Keep the Lone Star cold 
The dance floor hot while I'm gone, hey now
Keep your hands off my woman 
I ain't gonna be gone that long

Let me hear that harmonica over there, here it comes
A little steel guitar here
Yeah
All right, play it on that fiddle boy

That old judge put a sledgehammer in my hand when he said
I'm gonna send you to Huntsville 
Shave your face and your head
I'm doin' 11/29 boys 
With a cement floor for my bed

Busted in Austin walkin' around in a daze 
Yes, I was
Now I'm sittin' in a slammer 
Lookin' out the bars through a haze
But it'll all clear up 
11 months and 29 days 
Hey Lord

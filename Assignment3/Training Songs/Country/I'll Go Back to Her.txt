I'll go back to her where I'm wanted and maybe I can make up for the wrong
in spite of all I've done she still wants me so I'll go back to her where I belong
Walking out on her wasn't easy but without a second thought I left her there
I gave my all and did it all to please you but the more I seem to do the less you care
So I'll go back to her...

I'll go back to her...

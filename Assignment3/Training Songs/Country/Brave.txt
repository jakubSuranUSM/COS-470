I been down about as low as anyone can get
The whole world was closin' in
Couldn't find a friend
No one else could help me
Had to walk through the fire alone
Life has brought me to my knees
And faith had led me home

Let the storm rage around me
I will stand, I will fight
And when the darkness surrounds me
I will make my own light
I may not win every battle
But I'll get stronger with every fear I face
And I'll be brave

I can be courageous and still be so afraid
I've discovered pain is the beginning to a change
Somewhere deep inside us
There's a strength we don't know we have
Just when you think you can't go on
Suddenly there's a path

Let the storm rage around me
I will stand, I will fight
And when the darkness surrounds me
I will make my own light
I may not win every battle
But I'll get stronger with every fear I face
And I'll be brave

Every time I get back up it gets harder to knock me down
Cause my soul's on steady ground

Let the storm rage around me
I will stand, I will fight
And when the darkness surrounds me
I will make my own light
I may not win every battle
But I'll get stronger with every fear I face
And I'll be brave

I'll be brave

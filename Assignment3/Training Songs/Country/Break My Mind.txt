Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flyin'
'Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind
You know I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord
'Cause if you leave you're gonna leave a babblin' fool behind
Baby oh baby let me take your suitcases off of the scales in time
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flyin'
'Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind...
If you'll say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind break my mind

Standin' in the trees, I get
Lifted by the leaves
And carried away by the wind
Turning around I touch
Down on the ground
And then I'm drifted away again
 
You've got to fly away on home
Hallelujah,
Fly away
Fly away on home
And get carried away by the wind
 
Looking out my window
Reflections of a rainbow
As that evening rain comes down
Trumpets start to blowin'
When them stars start glowin'
And my head gets lost in the sound
 
And you've got fly away on home
Hallelujah,
Fly away
Fly away on home
When that evening rain comes down

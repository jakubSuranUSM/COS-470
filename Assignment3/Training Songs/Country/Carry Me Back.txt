Carry me back, Lord, while I still got the time

Is Jimmy through servin' his hitch with Uncle Sam?
Do the kids still spend Saturday nights drivin' 'round Hamburger Dan's?
Did Jackie ever make it to the streets of Hollywood?
And Bobby, I'd love to see him again, & I would if I could

Carry me back & make me feel at home
Let me cling to those mem'ries that won't let me alone
Where it was always summer and she was always mine
Carry me back, Lord, while I still got the time

Does the preacher still visit when sun or snow gets down?
Do the stores still stay open on Friday nights downtown?
Is JoAnn still as pretty as when she wore my high school ring?
When you see her, tell her I said July 1959; she'll know what I mean

Carry me back & make me feel at home
Let me cling to those mem'ries that won't let me alone
Where it was always summer and she was always mine
Carry me back, Lord, while I still got the time

Carry me back, Lord, while I still got the time

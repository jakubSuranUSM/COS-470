It's just a little creek now 
But when the rain comes down
It's gonna be a ragin' river
I just heard my baby say goodbye
He left me here holdin' back my tears now he's gone forever

The dam's gonna break and I'm a gonna cry, cry, cry
I'm a gonna cry and I don't care who sees
I wonder if he knows what he's done to me?
I'm gonna love that boy till the day I die
Till the day I do I'm gonna cry, cry, cry

Now he's gone the pain's comin' on
I can feel my whole body shaking
Looky here now what's this in my eyes?
All I hear ringing in my ear is the sound of my heart breakin'
Till the day I'm breaking I'm gonna cry, cry, cry

I'm a gonna cry and I don't care who sees...
I'm a gonna cry and I don't care who sees...
Till the day I do I'm gonna cry, cry, cry

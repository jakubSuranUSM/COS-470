Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darlin' and stay?
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh, why do you want to do me this way?

How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late?
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way?

Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darlin' and stay?
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh, why do you want to do me this way?

How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late?
Always late with your kisses
Why, why, why do you want to do me this way?

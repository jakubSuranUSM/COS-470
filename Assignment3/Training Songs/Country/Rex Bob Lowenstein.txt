There's a disc jockey in Hartlanberg 
Who works at W.A.N.T. 
He puts two or three eggs in him 
And he's in your car by 6.00 am 

He lives for his job and he accepts his pay 
You can call and request ‘Lay Lady Lay' 
He'll play Stanley Jordan, The ‘Dead and Little Feat 
And he'll even play the band from the college down the street 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open, but he'll tell you where to go 
If you're dumb enough to ask him why he plays Hank Snow 

Well, he tries to keep his talkin' to a minimum 
He's a Democrat, he's a Republican 
He's an ad man with a great voice, say some 
But when he spins those records he's neither one 

He'll talk to the truckers on the interstate strip 
The housewife and the car dealership 
And when his second wife left him for a paper millionaire 
He cried unashamedly right on the air 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's forty-seven, goin' on sixteen 
His request line's open but he makes no bones 
About why he plays Madonna after George Jones 

Now, one day a man in a pinstriped suit 
Took the owner of the station to a restaurant booth 
His pitch was simple, “you'll increase your sales 
“If you only play the song list we send in the mail.” 

He guaranteed a larger audience 
Less confusion and higher points 
“But your drive-time jock won't get to do his thing. 
“Hey he's not half bad, tell me, what's his name?” 

Well his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's frequently heard, but he's seldom seen 
His formula's simple and his format's big 
“I just play anything, you call and tell me what you dig.” 

Now Rex Bob David Saul Lowenstein 
Quit his job a week later, but before he'd leave 
He locked and bolted the control room door 
And played smash or trash till they cuffed him on the floor 

Well they drug him into court and the judge said, “Rex 
“I've got to lock you up, for what I'm not sure yet. 
“But your boss here says he thinks you're wrapped too tight. 
“But, by the way thanks for playing ‘Moon River' last night” 

And his name is Rex Bob Lowenstein 
He's a flaming bell inside a tambourine 
He could play it all if he was just set free 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT 
Just to find what the people WANT

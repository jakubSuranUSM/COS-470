As you walk away
As we say goodbye
What I wouldn't give
For a tender lie

[Chorus:] 
Say you'll never stop loving me 
Just as if it were true
How much damage now, honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 

When we fall so far
Are we wrong to try
To fight off the truth
With a tender lie 

Say you're gonna come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much damage now, honestly 
Could one tender lie do? 

When we loved before 
Do you still deny 
Keeping out the truth
With a tender lie? 

[Chorus:]

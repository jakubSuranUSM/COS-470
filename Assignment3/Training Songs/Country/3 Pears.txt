3 pears of glasses
3 pears of shades
3 pears of other things, all there in space
3 pears of shoe-less feet,
Dream mindless thoughts
3 pears of wishes for all that you want

That means where you are is where you at
When your head is cold, to ṗut on a hat
If you can’t recall, just remember that
To wear 3 pears of shades, and 3 pears of glasses

3 pears of shades
3 pears of other things, all there in space
3 pairs of shoe-less feet,
Dream mindless thoughts
3 pairs of wishes for all that you want

All I want for you is happiness
All I have to give is nothing less 
Than more than one or two more

3 pears of glasses
3 pears of shades
3 pears of other things, all there in space
3 pairs of shoe-less feet,
Dream mindless thoughts
3 pairs of wishes for all that you want
3 pairs of wishes for all that you want

Jump aboard that silver plane 
Wave to me through that window pane
Left me with my arms full of empty.

Well, I'm so sick and tired of gettin' up 
So sick and tired
Sick old dirty clothes and dirty dishes
I'm tired of all these sleepless nights 
That drive me up to walls
Tired of having arms full of empty.

Oh, you took my car and took my money 
Done me wrong and that ain't funny
Left me standing here a looking silly
Jump aboard that silver plane 
(Wave to me through the window pane)
Left me with my arms full of empty.

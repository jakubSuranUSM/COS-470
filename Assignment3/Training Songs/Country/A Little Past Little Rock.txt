I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner,
Every face I'd see you

So with nothing more than a tank of gas
I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind

I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels

It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do

I'm a little past Little Rock,
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark

And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down

Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone
But I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line

Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel

I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue

Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock,
But a long way from over you

I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

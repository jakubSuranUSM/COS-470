Time is going by so fast
And I can't do anything about it
IÃ¢??ve been holding on so long 
It's time that I can do without it

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day

You were looking for some fun
And I was asking for a heartache
I should turn my head and run
Or I could learn it all the hard way

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day

You should make up your mind
After all of this time, all this time

Everything comes and goes
I'm always the last to know
I can see the sun come up another day
I can see the sun come up another day

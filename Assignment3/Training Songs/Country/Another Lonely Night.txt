I wish I'd knew what made a love go wrong that seems so right
And took the sunshine from my heart left the lonely night
I've tried to get you off my mind but nothing turns out right
And blues and I have room to share another lonely night
And blues and I have room to share another lonely night
Another lonely night like the one before
Another lonely night I want you more and more
I've tried to get you off my mind but nothing turns out right
And blues and I have room to share another lonely night
And blues and I have room to share another lonely night

I've tried to get in touch with you I called you night and day
And if only I could hear your voice it would drive these blues away
And if only I could hear your voice it would drive these blues away
Another lonely night

I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm goin' to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lyin' here wide awake?
Waitin' for the breath you take to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacin' in my cage
Cocked like a twelve gage
Feelin' like a teenage crush, you're the rush
You're the habit I can never get enough of

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby, when I look in those eyes
I feel like goin' through stop lights
Lookin' at the cops like I got nothin' to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burnin' like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a tickin' time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeatin' like an echo
Baby, I can't let go, got me goin' klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feelin' what I feel

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby, when I look in those eyes
I feel like goin' through stop lights
Lookin' at the cops like I got nothin' to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burnin' like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

Oh, oh, don't try to save me
Oh, oh, you never gonna save me

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby, when I look in those eyes
I feel like goin' through stop lights
Lookin' at the cops like I got nothin' to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burnin' like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
What you do me is criminal, criminal

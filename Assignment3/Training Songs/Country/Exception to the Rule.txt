As a rule love has hurt you every time around
Every man that you've known has always let you down
I know you think I'll hurt you too
that's something I will never do
I'm the exception to the rule
No one's ever loved you like I'm loving you now
I'm gonna make you see
Even though no other lover ever worked out
I'd never leave
I'm not that kind of fool
I'm the exception to the rule
Up 'til now girl, you've lost when you trusted men
Oh, but rules are made to be broken now and then
Forget all the heartache you've been through
I'm here to change all that for you
I'm the exception to the rule
No one's ever loved you like I'm loving you now
I'm gonna make you see
Even though no other lover ever worked out
I'd never leave
I'm not that kind of fool
I come from a different school
I'm the exception to the rule
No one's ever loved you like I'm loving you now
I'm gonna make you see
Even though no other lover ever worked out
I'd never leave
I'm not that kind of fool
I come from a different school
I'm the exception to the rule
No one's ever loved you like I'm loving you now
I'm gonna make you see
Even though no other lover ever worked out
I'd never leave
No one's gonna love you like I'm loving you now

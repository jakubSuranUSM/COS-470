I called, collect on the phone
You say you're tired and alone
But it sounds like someone else is lying there

She said, "Don't call me no more"
Don't you knock on my door
Its too late now and I know you'll never change

She said, "You're just a Coca Cola cowboy"
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care

She said just leave me alone
And let me hang up this phone
'Cause he'll see me cry and think I still love you

Please don't call me no more
I changed the locks on my door
It's time you understood that we are through

She said, "You're just a Coca Cola cowboy"
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care

She said, "You're just a Coca Cola cowboy"
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care

Yes, she taught me how to say I just don't care

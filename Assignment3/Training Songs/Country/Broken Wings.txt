With Broken wings, no bird can fly 
And broken promises mean love must fade and die 
I trusted you, you can't be true 
My heart no longer sings 
It's wings are broken too 

Life was wonderful 
I flew as high as a bird in the sky 
Dreaming of you 
Dreams coming true 
Then in your eyes 
I saw lies in disguise 
You broke me heart in two 

With Broken wings, no bird can fly 
And broken promises mean love must fade and die 
With Broken wings, no bird can fly 
My heart no longer sings 
It's wings are broken too.

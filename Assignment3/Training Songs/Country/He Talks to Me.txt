He may not ever be a ladies man
Maybe his callous hands 
Have been too long in sun
But he will always be the to love

'Cause he still does
What no one has ever done
And it means more to me 
Than he will ever know

'Cause words could never say 
How much I love the way 
He talks to me
It does my heart good 

To hear him talk to me
The way a lover should
He can ease my furstration
With his soothing conversation 

And I love the way he's 
Not afraid to talk to me
Now you can talk about the finer things
Big cars and diamonds rings

That light up your life
But let me tell you
That the finest thing 
Is the joy he brings 

When we turns out the lights
And in those moments
After we make love
That's when he holds me close

Gives me what I need the most
He talks to me
It does my heart good 
To hear him talk to me

The way a lover should
He can ease my furstration
With his soothing conversation 
And I love the way he's 

Not afraid to talk to me
Woah, I love the way
He's not afraid to talk to me

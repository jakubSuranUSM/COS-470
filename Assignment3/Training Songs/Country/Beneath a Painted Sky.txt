There never was a little girl more wanted than me
I had all the love a child could ever want or need
Daddy gave me everything he could afford to buy
An' on the ceilin' in my room, he painted me a sky.

He told me not to be afraid, when it stormed outside
He said, 'In your room, sweetheart the sun will always shine'.
An' through the years of growin' up, if somethin' made me cry
It didn't seem to hurt so bad, beneath the painted sky.

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true
And no one ever says 'goodbye'
Oh, I wish that I could live again, beneath the painted sky.

Girls grow up and fall in love and that's how it is
Sometimes the men don't love 'em like their daddy's did
Sometimes the hurt's so bad, the way it is tonight
It makes me wanna be back home, beneath the painted sky.

Beneath the painted sky, that's where I want to be
A place to go when this old world gets the best of me
A place where dreams come true
And no one ever says 'goodbye'
Oh, I wish that I could live again, beneath the painted sky.

Oh, I wish I was a kid again, beneath the painted sky

Turn me round, turn me round

Last night I heard a ruckus down the road
No time to lose and so away I go
I saw the lights at the junction on the road
Pulled in my wheels and checked the show
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me round)
Square dancin' round, round, round and down and round
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)
They're dancin' round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)

I couldn't believe it so I circled back and then
Cooled up my engine and I walked right in
Allemande left and rip it on up and circle back and go
It was a square dance like a rockin' rodeo
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me round)
Square dancin' round, round, round and down and round
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)
They're dancin' round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)
Wait up, little boy

Take it home, partner tears it on up and do see do
Don't you let go just reel and reel and reel
And rock it all over and back
Now circle left, then circle right on back

Take it from the top
And tear it on up
And never let her go
Just dance a little longer

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

I danced and partied till my feet went through the floor
I swung my partner till I couldn't stand no more
Allemande left and circle back circle round and then
We rocked and rolled around and did it again
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me round)
Square dancin' round, round, round and down and round
(Turn me round)

They're dancin' round, round, round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)
They're dancin' round
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)

(Turn me round)
(Turn me round)
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)
(Turn me, turn me, turn me)

Let's dance in a circled square

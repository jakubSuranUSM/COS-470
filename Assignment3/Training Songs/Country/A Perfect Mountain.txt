Gonna find a perfect mountain gonna stay until I die
Drink of mother nature's fountain let my worries roll on by
Well the good times go easy and the bad times go slow
Even in the in-between times I can't let my worries go
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain

Well I can think of nothing better than a sweetheart for a friend
Before I find the two together I'm afraid my days shall end
Always wanting to go somewhere but I never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there long for things I left behind
Gonna find a perfect mountain
Let my worries roll on by

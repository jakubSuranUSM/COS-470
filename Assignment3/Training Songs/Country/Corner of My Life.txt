I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to when I need to now and then
When my head gets kinda tangled and my soul is layin' bare
I reach over in the corner of my life and I find you waiting there

You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty in the middle of the night
You're a warm and tender body you're a woman not a wife
And just knowing you has brightened the corner of my life

There's a special kind of feeling when we're simply touching hands
There's a special kind of comfort knowing someone understands
I'm no knight in shining armor I'll never carry you away
But you're filling up the corner of my life in the nicest kind of way

You're a number I can phone...
I can count the way you've brightened all the corners of my life hmm hmm

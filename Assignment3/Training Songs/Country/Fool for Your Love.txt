I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know that's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

You've got me wanting to be near you
You know I want this love to grow
You say you like to keep things simple
And you don't want any tides
But I see a different story in your eyes

I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

You try to act like it don't matter
You said you've felt this way before
Say you only want your freedom
And you don't need nothin' more
Here you are just knocking at my door

I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love

I'm just a fool for your love

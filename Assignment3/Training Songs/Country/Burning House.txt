I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside
I couldn't get you out
I lay beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke

Love isn't all that it seems
I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you
Until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wondering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

I see you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back
But people don't really change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find

Love isn't all that it seems
I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you
Till this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wondering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

Flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh and I don't wanna wake up
In this burning house

And I been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleep walking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

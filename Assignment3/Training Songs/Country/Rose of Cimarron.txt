Roll along, roll on rose of cimarron
Dusty days are gone rose of cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see who's standing
Waiting at your window
Watching will they ever show

Can you hear them calling
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark now
Never see a spark burn bright

Trails that got them home
Kept the names they've known
Four days high and lonely
Coming to you only

You're the one they turn to
The only one they knew
You're all the best to be around
When the chips were down

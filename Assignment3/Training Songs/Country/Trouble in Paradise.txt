Baby, I was talkin' all night long
Tryin' to take it home long distance
I guess I lost my connection
I heard you slip away

And then it came in loud and clear
You only hear what you want to hear
And everybody here says
Sonny boy, you're on your way

There's trouble in paradise
The story don't sound too nice
And you just can't sleep at night
In a solid gold room

Well, there's trouble in paradise
You never turn out those lights
You just can't close your eyes
In a solid gold room

Baby, you've been lookin' at the future
And I know you think you found it
But now you want to make me a hero
And put me in a shiny shoe

Now I don't know where to put the blame
I guess everybody needs to have a name
But you never get to count the loot

There's trouble in paradise
The story don't sound too nice
And you can't sleep sleep at night
In a solid gold room

Well, there's trouble in paradise
And too many sleepless nights
Ain't got half a pride
In a solid gold room
Well, there's trouble

Where the warm winds won't blow
And the stars don't seem to shine so bright
Nearly everybody knows
Nearly nobody minds

You've been outside hangin' at the stage door
Wavin' at the limousines
(Goodbye, goodbye)
It's the same Cadillac that they use
In a graveyard scene

Some other mornin' you go back to school
As if nothing has changed
Well, there's no use playin' if you're winning
At a losin' game

There's trouble in paradise
You're payin' for everything twice
Too much at half the price
A little too soon

Well, there's trouble in paradise
You never turn out those lights
And you just can't close your eyes
In a solid gold room

No, no you never can close your eyes
In a solid gold room ooh, no
No, no, no, there's trouble

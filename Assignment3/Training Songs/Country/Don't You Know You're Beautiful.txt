Hey little girl with your tangled hair, your tattered clothes
You're fifteen and you're about to bloom just like a rose
You're wishing that you had designer jeans
Like the ones you see in magazines

Now I know you'd give anything just to fit in
But your worth ain't on a price tag, it comes from within

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Just the way you are!

Hey there little homecoming queen in that back seat
I'll bet his brown eyes are promising you everything!
And I know you want to be just like your friends
But he'll still love you if you don't give in

But if those girls were being honest that have been where you're at
I'd bet they'd tell you they wish they had their innocence back

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Just the way you are!

So if he left you for a girl that could be your twin, if you were 28 again
Let him go, let him fly, keep your head up, get on with your life!

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Just the way you are!

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Just the way you are!

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful

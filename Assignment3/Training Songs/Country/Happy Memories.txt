Happy memories happy memories
Happy days when you love me can put my mind at ease
Happy memories sweet sweet memories heartaches can't erase my happy memories
Since you're gone as time goes by I seem to miss you more
And to me each day gets bluer than the day before
The only way that I can put my achin' heart at ease is living with my happy memories
Happy memories

Funny little things we did keep running through my mind
And instead of crying I'll keep smiling all the time
I found an easy way to make this happy feeling last
I'll spend my future living the past
Happy memories...

When I was old enough to drive
I packed my life in a case.
I might sink, I might survive
But at least I'm in the race.

Fark down flee (?) my younger years
Oh how good it feels
To hold a full life in my sights
And a road beneath my wheels,
The road beneath my wheels.

Busted and bruised
We tried our best to make one as two.
Oh of the sad and selfish soul
Of blind, romantic you.
If I could show this broken charm a clean set of heels
I've kept the tires and put my trust
In the road beneath my wheels,
The road beneath my wheels.

One Summer's day
We took a ride to clear the clouds away.
Out through the lanes and into the hills
Where the blue will cut through the grey.

Tired of burdens, tired of words
Oh so tired of deals (?)
Oh and I need to see a clearer way
I see the road beneath my wheels,
The road beneath my wheels.

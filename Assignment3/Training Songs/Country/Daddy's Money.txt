I'm a proud daughter of a blue collar, hard workin' father
Bills piled up at the end of the month took just about every dollar
No silver spoon but the right attitude for gettin' it on my own

I aint ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone, to the bone, to the bone
I ain't takin, I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey
But I ain't ever had daddy's money, no

Daddy said you're grown
So I left home the second I turned eighteen
Moved to the city
Livin' on pennies and the hope of the American dream
Now I ain't hatin' on a trust fund baby
I just wasn't that fortunate

I ain't ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone, to the bone, to the bone
I ain't takin, I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey
But I ain't ever had daddy's money, no

Whoa, this is for the girls, all over the town
Whose daddies don't have it to throw it around
Don't let it hold you up
Don't let it slow you down

I aint ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone, to the bone, to the bone bone bone
I ain't takin', I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey
But I ain't ever had daddy's money, no
Oh, I ain't ever had daddy's money
I ain't ever had daddy's money, no

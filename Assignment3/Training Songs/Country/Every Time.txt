Every time that you walk by
I can't believe that I have to live without you
Every time I hear your name
It hits me just the same
I wish that I knew how to

Make you notice, make you see
Turn your angel eyes to me
Let me show you all the love I'm hiding
Just when 
I think I've found the words
I go and lose my nerve
And I die a little every time

Every night I say this prayer
I say how much I care and how I want you near me
I tell the moon and stars above
I need your precious love
If only you could hear me, then I'd

Make you notice, make you see
Turn your angel eyes to me
Let me show you all the love I'm hiding
Just when 
I think I've found the words
I go and lose my nerve
And I die a little every time

Someday I'll tell you, someday you'll know
The way I feel for you
Someday you'll look into my eyes
The way that lovers do

Make you notice, make you see
Turn your angel eyes to me
Let me show you all the love I'm hiding
Just when 
I think I've found the words
I go and lose my nerve
And I die a little every time

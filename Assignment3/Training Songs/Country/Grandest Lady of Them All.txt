She's never in the spotlights
But everybody knows
That she's the star

And once she shines upon you
She'll make you truly proud
Of where you are

She'll wipe away the pain of all
The dues you had to pay
When the curtain to her world
Starts to unfold

With mother tender hand
She will applaud
And feed the hunger in your soul

And she's known as the Grand Ole Opry
Where the legend come to call
She's the queen of country music
She's the grandest lady of them all

She sings of desperado's
And lonesome whistle love
And midnight train

And the coal mines of Kentucky
And how it feels
To be out in the rain

She sings of Texas cowboys
Of hobos and of heroes
And the loneliness
Up where and prison blues

But most of all she sings about
The common people
Just like me and you

And she's known as the Grand Ole Opry
Where the legend come to call
She's the queen of country music
She's the grandest lady of them all

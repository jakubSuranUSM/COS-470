Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoon house is so quiet. 
I spent the morning looking for a job but the job markets pretty tight 
And I'm wondering just what I'm gonna do,
Someone to hold and the rent I owe are long overdue. 

Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. 
It seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. 
I'm used to having a woman around, cooking for me and when I lay down to love. 
I got used to having a woman around looking to me to rise above. 
I've got a lonely heart, two open arms, and a pillow I never use. 
I know it ain't much to offer but its the best I can do. 

Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. 
I've loved a lot of good women and I could sure love one now. 
I've had more then enough money in my bank account, 
But where they went and how it got spent isn't really clear. 
They just left me here and it all disappeared. 

Sitting in another office Tuesday morning, application filled. 
I doubt they'll ever call me but I can't keep from hoping that they will. 
I know I need to keep my chin up but I'm telling you the truth, 
If there's no one else to live for is there anything left to lose? 

It seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. 
Seems like everything comes down to money and love in my life. 
In my life.

Bottles flying, women crying
Ceiling sagging, 'bout to fall
Jason Fleming, chasing women
Pickin' fights with one and all

Now Jason Fleming's quite a man
He raises cain with who he can
He goes out nightly and has a ball
And whoops it up from wall to wall
Tells the band to play it slow

'Hey, are you playing slow?
You, out you go"
Jason Fleming, chasing women
He's a swinging daddy-o

Bottles flying, women crying
Ceiling sagging, 'bout to fall
Jason Fleming, chasing women
Pickin' fights with one and all
Now you know me, not you

Now he was raised in a Cajun swamp
Before he walked he learned to stomp
He stomped so loud that they run him off
Right in the middle of the whooping cough

Deal the cards and let 'em fall
This old boy he beats 'em all
Jason Fleming, chasing women
He's a swinging daddy-o

Bottles flying, women crying
Ceiling sagging, 'bout to fall
Jason Fleming, chasing women
Pickin' fights with one and all
Now you know me Jason, you cut that out
Wow!

I know there's nothing worse than a bad goodbye
And you think you'll feel better if you have a good cry
But save those tears for tomorrow when there's nothing better to do
It's a beautiful night, don't waste it on the blues

Time is all it takes for a broken heart to mend
And sooner or later you know you'll try to love again
So why not start tonight, you've only got the hurtin' to lose
There's a full moon out, don't waste it on the blues

Don't waste one more minute
Leavin' a bad break, to keep you home in the dark
There's nothin' like a walk in the moonlight
To let love run away with your heart

You could turn on your stereo and play your saddest songs
Sit by your window and stare out all night long
But if you look up you'll see the stars are just too bright to refuse
It's a beautiful night, don't waste it on the blues

If you look up you'll see the stars are just too bright to refuse
It's a good night for love, don't waste it on the blues

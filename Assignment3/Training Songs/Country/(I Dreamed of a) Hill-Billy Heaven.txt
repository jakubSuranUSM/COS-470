Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven. And you know who greeted me at the gate? The ole

He introduced me to Wiley Post, and he showed me the Hall of Fame with all the gold guitars and fiddles 
hanging on the walls. Then he said, "Tex, step over this way, there are two more of your friends I know

Hank Williams and Johnny Horton. 

I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven

Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Tennessee Ernie, Jimmy Dean, Andy Griffith, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter (Whaaaatttt???)

Gonna buy some wood every size and length
Gonna build it good using all my strength
Gonna clear the land where the house will be
And start another branch of the family tree

Gonna chalk a line and lay a walnut floor
Build the walls of pine and hang a cherry door
I'll cut the beams above from mahogany
And I'll get the love from the family tree

I've wandered far and I've walked alone
Till the morning star finally led me home
Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be
Living in the shade of the family tree

Gonna fill this place like my daddy did
With a friendly face and a bunch of kids
Even though he's gone he's a part of me
As I carry on this family tree

Girl, the wind may blow and the clouds may come
Bringing ice and snow, blocking out the sun
The earth may quake and the ground may freeze
They will never shake this family tree

I've wandered far and I've walked alone
Till the morning star finally led me home
Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be
Living in the shade of the family tree

Mama look at him, don't he look like me
He's the latest limb on the family tree

Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be
Living in the shade of the family tree
Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be
Living in the shade of the family tree

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day 

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
But since you came along
I can face the dawn
'Cause I know you'll be there

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I never worry
If it's raining outside
'Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
MIne was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

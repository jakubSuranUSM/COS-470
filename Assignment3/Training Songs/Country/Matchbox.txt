[Chorus]
Well, I'm sitting here wondering, would a matchbox hold my clothes?
Sitting here wondering, would a matchbox hold my clothes?
I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to go.

I'm an old, poor boy and I'm a long way from home
I'm an old, poor boy and I'm a long way from home
I won't ever be happy; everything I do is wrong.

[Chorus]

Let me be your little dog 'til your big dog come.
Let me be your little dog 'til your big dog come.
When your big dog gets here, show him what this little puppy's done.

[Chorus]

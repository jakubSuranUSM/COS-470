Goodbye Bunyip Bluegum, goodbye Blinky Bill
And beautiful little Nutsie, I can't believe it
Our koalas are all dying, can it really be
A national disaster, a world catastrophe

Shiny little black nose and fluffy little ears
Furry little bundle soaking up the tears
Snuggle pot and Cuddle pie are crying in the rain
And wombat's gone into his hole and won't come out

Oh pass the hat around between your friends
There's no time to contemplate
Maybe if we show some love
Maybe it's not too late

'Cause Blinky Bill is dying, cross him off the list
Knock on doors, ring the bell, save the eucalyptus
I don't think I could stand the shame, knowing that I could
Have saved the world from losing something beautiful and good

One doctor on the job is hardly enough
One little hospital, wake up Australia
It's our corner of the world, time to pull our weight
What would we tell our children about our little mate

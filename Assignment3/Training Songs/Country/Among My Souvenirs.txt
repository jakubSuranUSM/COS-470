There's nothing left for me
Of days that used to be
I live in memory, among my souvenirs 

Some letters tied in blue
A photograph or two
I find a rose for you 
Among my souvenirs 

A few more tokens rest
Down in my treasure chest
And though they do their best
To give me consolation 

I count them all apart
And as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart
Among my souvenirs 

I live in memories
Among my souvenirs

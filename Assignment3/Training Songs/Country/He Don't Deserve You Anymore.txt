When I found you darling then he saw his big mistake
Saw what he was losin' felt his heart begin to break
Please don't let him talk you bout the way he's done before
Why he's had a hundred chances he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying let his feet walk the floor
Let his heart do the breaking like he's let yours break before
Let his lips do the sighing let his heartaches start to sore
Let his arms do the aching he don't deserve you anymore
[ steel ]
He took you for granted and he only brought you shame
It was never his intention to let you share his name
The lonely hours you've waited now won't happen anymore
For it's his turn to feel the hurt he don't deserve you anymore
Let his eyes do the crying...

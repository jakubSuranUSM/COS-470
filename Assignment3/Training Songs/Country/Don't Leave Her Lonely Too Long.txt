Well my friend, you ask me what to do 
If I were you and feeling blue
I know inside that you still care 
You want her here but she's out there
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone

You still have time to change her mind
She needs to know the way you feel
And there could be no better time
You've got to show her your love is real
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone

There's strangers waiting in line
To take your place and leave you behind
And then too late you'll change your mind
Your heart will break a million times
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone
Don't leave her lonely too long
'Cause she'll be gone, gone gone
'Cause she'll be gone, gone, gone

I know you're not mine, only borrowed
Cause you already belong to her, at least you said so
But I'm starting to believe it ain't the whole truth
As we're lying side by side, I get the whole you

I Wanna hold out, but gotta hold on
Even though I know it's wrong
Cause I don't want to give you back
I don't want to give you back
You're the best I'll never have
So I don't want to give you back
But you're borrowed

Do you tell her that you love her
Like you do me
Do you make love to her
The way you make love to me
Well I keep myself alone in case you call tonight
It's pathetic how I lie around
And wait all the damn time
It's a short hide and long low
Every time you have to go

Cause I don't want to give you back
I don't want to give you back
You're the best I'll never have
So I don't want to give you back
But you're borrowed
Only borrowed

How much time is left and you don't return
And you don't return
How much time
Oh it's no return, no return, how much time

I know you're not mine, only borrowed
And I don't want to give you back
I don't want to give you back
You're the best I'll never have
So I don't want to give you back
No I don't want to give you back
No I don't want to give you back
You're the best I'll never have
So I don't want to give you back
But you're borrowed, only borrowed
Cause you're borrowed

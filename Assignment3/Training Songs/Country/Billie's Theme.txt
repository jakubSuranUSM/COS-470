I never dreamed 
You'd mean a thing to me, 
But when I needed your lovin', 
You gave me love 
The way it outta be. 

Sweet country babe, 
The memories are clear. 
And I remember the laughter 
Sure miss the laughter. 
Heaven, you were here. 

And when I feel 
The way I'm feeling 
Can't help believing you
Made it so easy. 
They can't take that away. 

The girl you were, 
The girl you used to be
And I have heard all the stories. 
You know the stories 
Don't mean a thing to me. 

I love your face, 
I love your quiet ways. 
If I could paint you a color 
You'd be a rainbow 
On a summer day. 

And when I feel 
The way I'm feeling 
Can't help believing you.
Made it so easy. 
They can't take that away. 
They can't take that away.

Mississippi,
You've been on my mind,
Like a mist in the morning,
From some dream I've left behind.

Mississippi,
I've been kinda down,
â€˜Cause it's been such a long time
Since I've seen old Jackson town.

I could be on the other side of the world,
But in my memory, all I can see
Is Spanish moss hangin' from a live oak tree.

Mississippi,
Save a place for me;
I'll be comin' home again [comin' home again],
Mississippi, until then [until then]
You'll be on my mind.
I'll be comin' home again,
Mississippi, until then,
You'll be on my mind.

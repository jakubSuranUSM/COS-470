Am I that easy to forget?

You say you've found somebody new, but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away, forget the love I had for you
Yes, I could find somebody too, but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret? Am I that easy to forget?
(Am I that easy to forget?)

Before you leave, be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met if I'm that easy to forget
(Am I that easy to forget?)

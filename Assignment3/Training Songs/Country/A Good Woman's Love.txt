I once was a rover.
On land and on sea.
Till a good woman's love.
Made a new man of me.

My life had no meaning.
It was so incomplete.
Till a good woman's love.
Put me back on my feet.

Now instead of roamin' I go home in the evening. 
And she's waiting there.
And I know that no matter what happens.
She'll always care.

And so, when the night fall's.
And the stars shine above.
Well I'm a man with a dream.
And a good woman's love.

No instead of roamin' I go home in the evening.

And I know that no matter what happens.

And so, when the night falls.
And the stars shine above.
Well I'm a man with a dream.
And a good woman's love.

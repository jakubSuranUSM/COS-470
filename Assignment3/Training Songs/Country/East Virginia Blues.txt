I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I met a fair, young maiden
And her name, I did not know

On her hair was dark and curly
Cheeks were roses red
Oh, her breast she wore my clear leaf
Where I longer to lay my head

I don't want your greenback dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is your heart, darling
Say you'll take ma back again

The oceans deep and I can't wade in
And I have no wings to fly
I'll escape, my blue-eyed, boat land
Float or roll me over time

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave them north Carolina alone

Oh, I thought that I'd been in love before
But that was in younger years
Now I know that you never been in love until
You've cried those big old grown up tears
You've cried those grown up tears

And I thought that I knew what love could do
But now the whole truth appears
I never really knew what love could do to you
Till I cried those big old grown up tears
I cried those grown up tears

Gave you all the love I had
'Til my very soul was bare
What a fool I was because I knew
You didn't even really care
(Didn't even care)

I guess I always felt that our love would die
And now my gravest fears
Have been realized, take a look at my eyes
From cryin' those big old grown up tears
From cryin' those grown up tears

Gave you all the love I had
'Til my very soul was bare
What a fool I was because I knew
You didn't even really care
(Didn't even care)

I guess I always felt that our love would die
And now my gravest fears
Have been realized, take a look at my eyes
From cryin' those big old grown up tears
From cryin' those grown up tears

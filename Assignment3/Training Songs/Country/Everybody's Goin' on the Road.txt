[Chorus]
Take a bridge across a river wide
Everybody's goin on the road (wide road)
Glad it's on the other side of the highway
Weighed less'cause I eased my burden
Pick a day for certain and you'll lighten up your lad
You can take a lady or a dog if you wanna
Everybody goin'on the road

Sea captain goin' on the road
Takes a crew to sail the ship
A sea captain on a sailin' ship
Well do you wanna go with me or he?
We'll be the ones who sang in the rigging
Get your ticket 'fore it shoves off from the shore
Take a trip on ship this time
You'll never go to sea no more

[Chorus]

Now my lady friend's goin' on the road-
Takes her dog and my truck and rolls across the land
She's goin' to Santa Fe-leavin' me a lonely man
I take pleasure to see my friends happy
I'll be the pappy if she'll be the ma
I had the pick of the pick this time
Sweetest lady that I saw

[Chorus]

Well there's a city fella goin' on the road
He'd like to catch a ride on a semi-truck
A city fella goin' on the riad 
Just might run into a little bit of luck
With a map of the back of the country side you ride
Take a good ride and you'll never get rode
Take a left, take a right, take a breath of fresh air
Everybody goin' on the road

[Chorus]

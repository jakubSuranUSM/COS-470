I can see the sadness in your eyes knowing that I'm going to leave
If I told you the reason you'd never understand cause the truth you never could see
So I'm goin' back to the country roads back where the tall corn grows
Back where the stream is running free
Back where the air is clear back where I can hear the whippoorwills sing me to sleep

I've enjoyed the sweetness of your smile
And your soft touch that warms me when I'm cold
If you want me you can find me look down that country road
I'll be walking and looking for my soul
So I'm goin' back

The whippoorwills sing me to sleep

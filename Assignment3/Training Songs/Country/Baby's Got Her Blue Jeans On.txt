Down on the corner by the traffic light
Everybody's lookin' as she goes by
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone
Lord have mercy baby's got her blue jeans on
Up by the bus stop and across the street
Open up their windows to take a peek
While she goes walkin' rocking like a rolling stone
Heaven help us baby's got her blue jeans on
She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene
It just comes natur'lly no the girl can't help it
Well up on main street by the taxi stand
There's a crowd of people and a traffic jam
She don't look back she ain't doin' nothing wrong
Lord have mercy baby's got her blue jeans on
She can't help it if she's made that way
She's not to blame if they look her way
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene
It just comes natur'lly  no the girl can't help it
Down on the corner by the traffic light
Everybody's lookin' as she goes by
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone
Lord have mercy baby's got her blue jeans on
Heaven help us baby's got her blue jeans on

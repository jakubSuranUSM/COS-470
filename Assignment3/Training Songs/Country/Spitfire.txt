If I were to untie my tongue
I could use it like a whip and watch you run
I could show you how it's done
We could have a little fun
Better bring your big guns

'Cause I only got one burning desire
To let the whole town know that you're a dirty little liar
I ain't gonna get stuck in your muck and mire
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You make me wanna spit fire
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I suggest you think again but that would be insane
For that you'd have to have a brain
A simple southern way to say "kiss my behind"
Politely tear you apart with
"Sweetie bless your heart"

'Cause I only got one burning desire
To let the whole town know that you're a dirty little liar
I ain't gonna get stuck in your muck and mire
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You make me wanna spit fire,
Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire, spitfire
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Reckon it's 'bout time that I bury you
Better buy some friends that will carry you
Oh to know you is to loathe you
You can fight and fuss but I'm fixing to Spitfire

'Cause I only got one burning desire
To let the whole town know that you're a dirty little liar
I ainâ€™t gonna get stuck in your muck and mire
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You make me wanna spit fire

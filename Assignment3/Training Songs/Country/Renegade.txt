Well, I went down to Nashville
In 1973
And they won't nobody in Music City
Wanted anything to do with me

They said, "Boy you sure dress funny
And you just don't fit our crowd
And your music's weird, your hair's too long
And you play that guitar way too loud"

I said, "Yeah, I know, I'm different
I know, I'm not the same
And you may drive a big Cadillac car
But I ain't gonna play your game"

And you can put me down in this guitar town
And I ain't gonna be afraid
'Cause I'm a proud walkin', slow talkin'
Hard headed, high steppin' genuine renegade

Well, I ain't afraid to tell you what's on my mind
I just ain't the bashful type
I go all the way for the U.S.A.
'Cause I love them stars and stripes

I ain't never been scared of nothin'
And I'm a renegade to the bone
So if you're looking for trouble better bring you some help
I'm a little bit more than you can handle alone

I'm mighty proud of Dixie
I'm just full of Southern pride
I'm a catfish connoisseur
And I know, I'm countryfied

I get an ornery streak sometimes when I speak
But I guess, it's just the price I paid
'Cause I'm a hard drivin' survivin'
Four wheelin', straight dealin' genuine renegade

And you can put me down in this guitar town
I ain't gonna be afraid
'Cause I'm a proud walkin', slow talkin'
Hard headed, high steppin' genuine renegade

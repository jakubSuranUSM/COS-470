I get up and battle the day
Things don't always go my way
It might rain but that's okay
I get to come home to you

Sometimes life may get me down
And I get tired of getting kicked around
I feel lost in this maddening crowd
But I get to come home to you

[Chorus:]
You are my best friend 
And you are where my heart is
And I know at the day's end
I get to come home to you

Hanging out in our old sweatshirts
You let me complain about a hard day's work
I don't know what I did to deserve
To get to come home to you

[Chorus x 2]

Yes I get to come home to you
Oh I love coming home to you.

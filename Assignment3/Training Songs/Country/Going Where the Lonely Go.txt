Rollin' with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go

Making up things to do
Not running in all directions, trying to find you
I'm just rollin' with the flow
Going where the lonely go

And I've got to keep goin'
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

I've got to keep goin'
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rollin' with the flow
Goin' where the lonely go

I've got to keep goin'
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

I've got to keep goin'
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rollin' with the flow
Goin' where the lonely go

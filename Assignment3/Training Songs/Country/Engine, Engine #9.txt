Engine, engine number nine
Comin' down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried
I've looked for it everywhere, it
Just ain't here among the rest, and
I'm a little upset, yes, tell me

Engine, engine number nine
Comin' down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference
I don't think she loves me anymore

I warned her of the dangers
Don't speak to strangers, if by
Chance she finds new romance
Warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter
Stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me, instead of he
That stands beside her

Engine, engine number nine
Comin' down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference
I don't think she loves me anymore

No, I don't think she loves me any more

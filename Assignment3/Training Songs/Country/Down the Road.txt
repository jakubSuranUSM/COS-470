When I was a young man
Standin' in the door
The room was dark and smokey
The smell of death befo' me

Think I'll go down Mama
Go on down the road
See what's goin' on
Down the road

Lotsa friends and chirren
Layin' in the grass
Hookah makes me crazy
Believe I'm goin' have to pass

Then you find your cocaine
Start to movin' fast
Trip, stumble, fall, freeze up
Hope your body last

Drinkin' plenty good liquor
Bourbon twelve years old
Heroine, just in time
Worst trip that I know

Some people into Jesus
Other people into Zen
I'm just into everyday
I don't hide from where I been

I just go down Mama
Go on down the road
See what's goin' on
Down the road

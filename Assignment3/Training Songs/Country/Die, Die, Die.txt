She's fighting with the sky
She thinks she can
Livin' within a lie
She thinks she can
But nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die

She puts her hands against
The life she had
Living with ignorance
Blissful and sad
But nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die

You can try to swim the sea
But say goodbye to you and me

You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone

You can try to swim the sea
And you can try to hold the breeze
And you can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone

And you can try to swim the sea
And you can try to hold the breeze
You can try through skin and bone
But you will end up all alone

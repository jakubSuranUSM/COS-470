I used to leave work at 5 p.m.
Get home about a half past three
Spending my time out on the town
'Cause there was nothing waiting home for me

I was prone to doubt but you showed me all about
A brand new philosophy
For my life has changed and I'm sure rearranged
You've made me everything I wanna be

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
I don't need Dr. Ruth to figure out the truth
This feeling just can't be denied
I love her, 24-7-365

I'm gonna quit watching my TV
Gonna throw my golf clubs away
No more shooting pool, acting a fool
And party 'til the break of day

'Cause she's the only thing in the whole wide world
That ever made me feel this fine
Oh, and anything that takes me away from her
Is nothing but a waste of my time

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Every second each day til' I'm old a gray
This fascination will survive
I love her, 24-7-365

Ah, it's my life at stake
And it's time for me to make
A change is long overdue
I don't need no resume, I threw it all away
I'm gonna do what I was born to do

I love her, 24-7-365
Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
Oh, I don't need no pay, I just wanna say
I bless the day she arrived
I love her, 24-7-365
Oh, I love her, 24-7-365

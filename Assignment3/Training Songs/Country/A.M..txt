Everybody waitin' for the weekend
Getting off 5 in the P.M.
Wanna blow off a little steam and
Go cut loose somewhere
Folks start showin' up at 7
Order up a Crown or a cold one
Nobody buyin' rounds for no one
No girls dancin' on the bar in there

But in the A.M.
They go from getting buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep and we're wide awake in the A.M.

Leave around 10 and you're all right
Everybody's cool, never uptight
But if you stay longer than midnight
You might end up in the middle of a fistfight

Cause in the A.M.
They go from getting buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep and we're wide awake in the A.M.

In the A.M.
They go from getting buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up playin' loud
A honky-tonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
Hey baby, tell me what ya think about
Getting out of this place and
Let me show you my Chevrolet and
We can sit and do a little stargazing
Get a little bit of alone time, in the A.M.
Yeah, in the A.M

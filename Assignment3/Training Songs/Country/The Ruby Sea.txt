I've been trying to travel down
Through the false surface of the ground
Down to where I maybe sleep
And then she sees me floating past
My face is flat against the glass

One time when she was looking down
I floated by under the ground
Down where I try to sleep
And she had reason to step back
A floater's hands can't help attack
Even if he thinks he knows
He was meant to travel so

She was naked squatting down
On the shore of the ground
Current sweeps me out of sleep
But I'm not thinking of that loss
But only of the fact of loss
And the distance between me
And the bed of the ruby sea

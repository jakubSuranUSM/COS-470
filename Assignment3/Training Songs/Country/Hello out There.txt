(Hello out there hello out there)
Hello out there are you sure that the girl in your arms belongs to you
Hello out there I know the one that I love is out there tonight with someone new
So if you're out tonight holding someone so tight well hello out there
I just want you to know you might be holding my baby

Hello out there if you're dancing tonight with the girl that you see for the first time
Hello out there please don't hold her so close she just might happen to be mine
So won't you look for me it could very well be well hello out there
I just want you to know you might be holding my baby
So won't you look for me...
You might be holding my baby (hello out there)

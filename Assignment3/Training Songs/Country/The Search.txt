Nothing to take back or exchange
Double engine dawn express train
Always dreamin', it's the search not the find
Louder than sounds on stream machine
Or some internal combustion burning clean
Always schemin', it's the search not the find
Door is open, to change your mind

We're chasin' paint cans, 21st century
All mixed up in modern company
Always dreamin', it's the search not the find
Wipe the sound, wipe the video
Some terracotta info wherever you go
Always dreamin', it's the search not the find
Door is open, to change your mind

They can listen in and they can nose around
They can listen in but they can never take us down

So leave it to the last believer now
Change in the air it came by turnstile
Always schemin' it's the search not the find
Door is open, to change your mind

They can listen in and they can nose around
They can listen in but they can never take us down

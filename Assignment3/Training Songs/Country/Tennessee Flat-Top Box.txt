In a little cabaret,
In a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar,
And the people came from all around,

And all the girls,
From there to Austin,
Were slipping away from home,
And putting jewelery in hock,

To take the trip,
To go and listen,
To the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat-top box,
And he would play.

Well, he couldn't write or wrangle,
And he never cared to make a dime,
But give him his guitar,
And he'd be happy all the time,

And all the girls,
From nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him don't stop,
And hypnotized,

And fascinated,
By the little dark haired boy that played the Tennessee flat-top box,
And he would play.
Then one day he was gone,

And no one ever saw him 'round,
He vanished like the breeze,
And they forgot him in the little town,
But all the girls,

Still dreamed about him,
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked,
And then one day,
On the hit parade,

Was a little dark haired boy that played a Tennessee flat-top box,
And he would play.

Always darling in all ways I belong to you and just to you alone
Always for all of my days I will love you till the breath in my body is gone
So don't ever doubt me for there never could be
Anyone in this world who could take your place with me
I'll love you always darling in all ways till my heart is true that's how it will always be
[ harmonica ]
Always darling in all ways love me too the way that I will always love you

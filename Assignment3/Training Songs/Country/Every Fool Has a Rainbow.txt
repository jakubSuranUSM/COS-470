Every fool has rainbow be	
But he never seems to find
The reward that should be waiting 
At the end of the line

But he'll give up a bed of roses for
A life filled with thorns
And go chasing after rainbows
Everytime the dream is born

And every fool has a rainbow that only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow and the rule replies to me

And every fool has a rainbow that only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow and the rule replies to me

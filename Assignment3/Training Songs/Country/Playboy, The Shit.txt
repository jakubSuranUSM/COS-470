Teardrops form a shadow 
This tongue starts to waggle 
That's a lovely dress ya'll 
And oh that's just teachin' 

And it's not true you know 
You swear and all by yourself 
As time delivers for a while now 
This may not appeal to you 
But I can hardly spell my name 

A Siamese beside his lonely also
And I've been waiting all my life 
In spite of this arrangement 
Moderation on vacation 
It's time we all settled down

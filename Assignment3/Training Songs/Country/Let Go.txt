Driving alone
And it's late at night
And it feels like a movie
In black and white

And I turn off the road
And I Turn off the light
And I Shut off the car
And stare into the night

And the cornfield seems to breathe
Let Go, Yeah Let Go, Yeah let Go
Of the things that you can't control

'Cause there's something is wrong
Way deep down inside
When a man's got this much
and he want to let it slide
And he wants to let it slide

Let Go, yeah Let Go, let Go
Of the things that you can't control

And I say Don't be surprised
And I say You know it's a lie
Yeah, you know it's all a lie

Driving alone
And it's late at night
And it feels like a movie
In black and white

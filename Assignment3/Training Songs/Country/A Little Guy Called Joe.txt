In a war torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea
There's a little guy who's waiting and he looks a lot like me
His hair is like the raven or the wings of a crow
I don't know what they named him but I'm sure they called him Joe

Just a little guy called Joe like so many more I know
Left all alone somewhere across the sea
I want him to have my name little Joe is mine to claim
This little guy called Joe belongs to me

His mother died to give him life the night my orders came
I wanted to be with them but war's an evil thing
Now he won't recognize me but I've got to let him know
He means much more to someone than just a little guy called Joe
Just a little guy called Joe...

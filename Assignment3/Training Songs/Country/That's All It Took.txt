That's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you burst into flames
I tried so hard
To let you got but look 
How I still tremble at your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker, line and hook
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took

There must be about 100 parties and I hit everyone in town
Now the sun is coming up and this room is turning around
Outside the church bells ringing, I can't hardly stand the pain
This pounding in my head is nearly driving me insane.

It's gonna take a month of Sundays to get me over Saturday night
If I look half as bad as I feel, I must be a sight
Oh, I'd give everything I own for anything that'll make it right
It's gonna take a month of Sundays to get me over Saturday night.

If I knew then what I know now, if I would have thought it over again
I'd have stayed at home where I belong, I wouldn't be crawling in
I wouldn't be laying here with that echo of that honky tonk crowd
And listening to the sunrise, even that's a little to loud.

It's gonna take month of Sundays to get me over Saturday night

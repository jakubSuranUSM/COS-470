There's no hope for me, I'm a girl left alone 
With crowds all around me, I feel all alone 
I can't tell my story for whom it will hurt 
And now I can see that's there's no room for me
I'm a girl left alone, there's no hope for me 
I'm tossed to and fro like a ship on a sea 
There was a mistake and now I will pay 
For those that still love me, I must go on this way

We hear the great story of the great eternity 
Where souls can be happy and I will be free 
I know I will suffer in this world eternally 
But in heaven I wonder if there'll be hope for me

Lipstick, pretty face and maybe you'll notice
Something different 'bout me, different 'bout me
Yeah you talk talk all you want, you pour your heart out
But you never do see, you never do see me

Hey, can't wait around forever for you

Sooner or later you're gonna come around
And you'll be sorry when you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you're gonna wish you had me

Well she don't do nothing for you
But mess you up, yeah she messes you up
I'm your shoulder I'm the quick drive over
Trying to fix your stuff, well I give up

Ooh, you never see me standing right in front of you

Sooner or later you're gonna come around
And you'll be sorry when you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you're gonna wish you had me

Oh you're gonna wish me back so bad, so bad
Oh but it's a little too late for that

Lipstick, pretty face, and maybe you'll notice
Something different about me, different about me

Sooner or later you're gonna come around
And you'll be sorry when you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later, oh

Sooner or later you're gonna come around
And you'll be sorry when you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me, oh
You're gonna wish you had me, oh
You're gonna wish you had me, oh
You're gonna wish you had me
Oh you're gonna wish you had me

I've always been a lover the easy going kind
I've known a million pretty girls but I left them all behind
Don't want no ties to hold me that's why I never stay
I just love 'em and leave 'em that's the easy way

The easy way is the system I use
Spread yourself around and you'll never have the blues
Forget about tomorrow when you greet a brand new day
Just love 'em and leave 'em that's the easy way

I know all the places where it's fast and it's fun
Lots of good times I have and I don't hurt anyone
So if folks talk about me one thing they have to say
The loving I get I get the easy way

The easy way is the system I use

So take some good advice from a man who knows
To keep from gettin' trapped you gotta still your toes
You leave your heart at home when you're goin' out to play
Just love 'em and leave 'em that's the easy way

The easy way is the system I use
Just love 'em and leave 'em that's the easy way
Just love 'em and leave 'em that's the easy way

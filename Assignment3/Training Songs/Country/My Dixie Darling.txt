My Dixie darlin', listen to the song I sing
Beneath the silver moon, with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true, I love no one but you
My Dixie darlin', my Dixie Queen

Way down below the Mason-Dixie line
Down where the honeysuckles are entwined
There's where the southern winds are blowing
There's where the daisies growing

The girls of the north in the gay finery
Whirling around in society
Singin' the song of Dixie darlin'
Where I long to be

My Dixie darlin', listen to the song I sing
Beneath the silver moon, with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true, I love no one but you
My Dixie darlin', my Dixie Queen

Goin' down South to have a big time
To see my girl in old Caroline
I'll drink my booze and do as I please
For all those girls I long to squeeze

Singin' the song of Dixie darlin'
There's where I long to be goin'
Down where the jellyroll's rolling
With my Dixie Queen

My Dixie darlin', listen to the song I sing
Beneath the silver moon, with my banjo right in tune
My heart is ever true, I love no one but you
My Dixie darlin', my Dixie Queen

You know a smile never goes out of style
So brighten up the one that you wear
Let it shine and you just might find
You'll lighten up the load that you bear

You know with all the trouble and sorrow in the world
It seems like the least we can do
Just take that smile into the street
And share it with everybody you meet

Everyday I wanna shake somebody's hand
Everyday I wanna make somebody know that they can
Everyday I wanna try to show my brothers and my sisters
That I wanna help them along the way everyday, everyday

You know a kind work never goes unheard
But too often goes unsaid
And on the tongue of the old and the young
Gets swallowed up with pride instead

You know with all the trouble and sorrow in the world
It seems like the least we can do
Just take a kind word into the street
And share it with everybody you meet

And everyday I wanna shake somebody's hand
Everyday I wanna make somebody know that they can
Everyday I wanna try to show my brothers and my sisters
That I wanna help them along the way everyday, everyday

If they're lost I wanna show them the sunshine
If they look tossed I wanna throw them a lifeline
I wanna reach out my hand, oh yeah

And let 'em know there's a light
Down at the end of the road

If they're lost I wanna show them the sunshine
If they're tossed I wanna throw them a lifeline

And everyday I wanna shake somebody's hand, oh
Everyday I wanna make somebody know that they can
Everyday I wanna try to show my brothers and my sisters
That I wanna help them along the way everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday

Everyday I wanna shake somebody's hand
Everyday I wanna make somebody know that they can
And everyday

Death keeps calling me, she's gonna set me free 
No more
Sunshine sidewalk streets or misery 
Like she did for you

Oh Allen how you suffered 
Lower east-side apartment
We stayed up late 
The bones inside your mind where all

Broken 
And the keys that opened any answers were all stolen
Filling and refilling up the glass with makers 
We both agreed

The Final Moment! 
The sweetest remedy to ever be delivered!
Heaven or heavenless we're all headed for the same sweet darkness
So she came for you, well I guess you wanted her to 

Now in the
Safety of a coffin rest you're through 
No more debts or memories
No more heart blood or skin on teeth 

Final dosage to set you free
Heaven or heavenless we're all headed for the same sweet darkness

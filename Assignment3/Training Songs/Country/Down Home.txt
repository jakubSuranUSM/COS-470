Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days that's a special way of life

Down home, where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checkerboard
Old men telling lies and crowning kings
Kids driving 'round the old town square
Tops rolled down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen

Down home, where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised down home
Down home
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
Down home
Way down home
Down home, down home, way down home, down home

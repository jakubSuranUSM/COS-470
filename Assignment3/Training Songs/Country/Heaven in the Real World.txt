I saw it again today in the face of a little child
Looking through the eyes of fear and uncertainty
It echoed in a cry for freedom across the street and across the miles
Cries from the heart to find the missing part

Where is the hope, where is the peace?
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy, and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world

To stand in the pouring rain and believe the sun is gonna shine again
To know that the grave is not the end
To feel the embrace of grace and cross the line where real life begins
And know in your heart you've found the missing part

And there is a hope, and there is a peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy, and girl
Looking for heaven in the real world
Looking for heaven in the real world

It happened one night with a tiny baby's birth
God heard creation crying and He sent heaven to earth

He is the hope, and the peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Jesus is the hope, and the peace
That will make this life complete
For every man, woman, boy and girl
Jesus is heaven in the real world
Jesus is heaven in the real world
Yes he is
Jesus is heaven 
He is heaven in the real world

Lyin' on our backs 
We stared at the stars
Tryin' to count them 
Or guess how far
I still remember 
The way that it felt
The night we hung our dreams 
Out on Orion's belt
The moonlight danced 
Out on the water's edge
We started a walk 
That hasn't ended yet

[Chorus]
And step by step 
And mile by mile
Taking each turn together
Following the signs 
That point to forever
And side by side
True and tenderhearted
We'll finish what we started

The road we have traveled 
Has sometimes been steep
And we've crossed troubled waters 
That were raging and deep
But with memories to lean on 
And love as our guide
There's no path too winding, 
No river too wide
One foot in front 
Of the other each day
Keeping a promise 
That two young lovers made

[Chorus]

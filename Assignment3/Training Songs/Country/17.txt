Sirens wail and a flashing light
Nothin' better to do on a Tuesday night
But give me hell
Where you headed, what are you out for
Don't see much of you 'round here anymore
I guess it's just as well
Once upon a time you had it all
You let everybody down
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Runnin' from your folks, runnin' from the law
Runnin' from love, runnin' from your fears, runnin' from it all
You keep on runnin' boy
You'll run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Her porch swing still looks the same 
She probably won't even remember my name
Just like she didn't back then
Is she married, is she doin' fine
Does she know about all the nights
I laid awake cryin'
Just to know her hand
The door opens and I run away
Just like the same old clown
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Runnin' from your folks, runnin' from the law
Runnin' from love, runnin' from your fears, runnin' from it all
You keep on runnin' boy
You'll run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Nobody's gonna miss me
No tears will fall, no one's gonna weep
When I hit that road
My boots are broken, my brain is sore
From keeping up with their little world
I got a heavy load
Gonna leave 'em all just like before
I'm big city bound
You're always seventeen in your hometown

Runnin' from your folks, runnin' from the law
Runnin' from love, runnin' from your fears, runnin' from it all
You keep on runnin' boy
You'll run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
She'll bring you down just to cheer you up
You never know with a woman in love

The minute you start holding on 
You'll turn around and she'll be gone
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love

She's a lady, she's a child
She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love
You never know with a woman in love

I oughta know 'cause I've held a few
I've seen the things that a woman can do
She'll play the game 'til you call her bluff
Oh, You never know with a woman in love

Just when you think you've got it all together
If you blink she'll change just like the weather, oh, oh, oh

No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love

She's a lady, she's a child
She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love
You never know with a woman in love

You never know with a woman in love
You never know with a woman, oh, oh, woman in love

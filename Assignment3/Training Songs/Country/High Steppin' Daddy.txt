I'm a high steppin' daddy and I sure do get around 
Ain't no woman gonna' make me settle down 

I go out at night and get full of gin 

I kiss the girls and thank the men 

I'm a high steppin' daddy and I sure do get around 

Well, I'm a high steppin' daddy and I drive a Cadillac 

I got a big old guitar layin' in the back 

When we pull over and we're sittin' still 

If my lovin' don't getcha' then my pickin' will 

I'm a high steppin' daddy and I drive a Cadillac 

Well, I'm a high steppin, high steppin', home wreckin', low down daddy 

I like the feelin' when the women get to squeelin' in the back of my Caddy 

So don't you pick on me 

'Cause I'll do as I dog gone please 

I'm a high steppin' daddy 

Step on it 

I'm a high steppin' daddy and I'm goin' out tonight 

Come along with me baby and I'll sure treat you right 

We go out at eight and come in at three 

If you want to have some fun, come along with me 

I'm a high steppin' daddy and I'm goin' out tonight 

Well, I'm a high steppin, high steppin', home wreckin', low down daddy 

I like the feeling when the women get to squeelin' in the back of my Caddy 

So don't you pick on me 

'Cause I'll do as I dog gone please 

I'm a high steppin' daddy 

A high steppin' daddy 

Well, I'm a high steppin' daddy

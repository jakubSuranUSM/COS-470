I called her today, an accidental mistake
And her name slipped out to some friends
Forgotten old feelings are brand new today
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been

Now, she's just an old love turned memory
And now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down

I went to some places where I knew she'd be
Just to prove our love was over and done
But the moment her eyes meet mine I knew
My sorrow had only begun

So, she's just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see her around
She's just an old love turned memory
But she still turns my world upside down
But she still turns my world upside down

I know we don't talk much but you're but you're such a good talker,
Well I know we should take a walk but why'er such a fast walker,
Oh-whoa, well alright
I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind, outta site
Well o.k., I know you don't love me but you'll still be thinking of me

Well alright, I know you probably hate me, that's o.k. with me, alright
Outta mind, outta site
Outta mind, outta site
You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow
Look out, here I come again and I'm bringing my friends
Look out, here I come again, I'm bringing my friends, o.k. alright o.k.
Alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta sight
Outta mind outta sight
Outta mind outta sight
I know you don't love me [Repeats]

Looking back on the days when I was scuffling for a buck
Not overly concerned with life and love
I was always feeling sorry for myself and my bad luck
I never stopped to think what life's made of

With my nose to the grindstone and my shoulder to the wheel
I fought for my daily dollar like a man
Then you came into my life and nothing else seemed real
I found the answer right here in my hands

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing in the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby child and eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need

Now my working days seem shorter than it ever did before
And the evening breeze gets cooler day by day
And the morning sun is always shining down on my back door
And your laughter washes all my cares away

And there's not a day goes by that I don't look up to the sky
And humbly thank the good Lord up above
For bringing you to me in time to make me realize
That all a poor man really needs is love

Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing in the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby child and eyes to watch my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need

I've got everything a man could ever need

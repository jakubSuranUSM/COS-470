Drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Cryin' blues in motel rooms Lord the hard times weren't that hard
And some fell in and some fell out and some just fell apart
Drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart

Harlan sang us Heartaches By The Number one more time
Johnny tell us how that woman helped you walk the line
Willie sing us Hello walls cause we all know our flaws
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
That blonde there sittin' on the floor my sad song made her cry
I think she caught my zipper bout the time I caught her eye
Well she can take my body home but who's gonna drive the car
We've been drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
Drinkin' from the bottle...
[ steel ]
Now I sip my Chivits from a fancy crystal glass
A young ambitions eight piece pot band a pushin' at my ass
While we're singin' for the money I think back to the start
When we were drinkin' from the bottle and singin' from the heart
So let's start drinkin' from the bottle...

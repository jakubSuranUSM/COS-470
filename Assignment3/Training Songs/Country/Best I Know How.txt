There are rumors goin' 'round about you and me
And you know things can't always stay the way they should be
What I'm trying to say as I kiss you right now
Is I've loved you the best I know how

I give it all that I have to give and I can't take any more
What I'm trying to show you in the way that I hold you
Is I've loved you the best I know how

I can't make a promise and I won't tell you lies
I wish I could give you what I've seen in your eyes
Please don't feel badly 'cause I've got to leave now
But I've loved you the best I know how

I give it all that I have to give and I can't take any more
What I'm trying to show you in the way that I hold you
Is I've loved you the best I know how

And Lord knows I miss you, I'd never forget you
And I've loved you the best I know how
I've always loved you the best I know how

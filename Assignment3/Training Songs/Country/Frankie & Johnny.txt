Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts oh Lordy how they did love
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above
He was her man he was doing her wrong
Frankie went down to the corner just for a bucket of beer
She says Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man he was doing me wrong
I don't want cause you no trouble I ain't gonna tell you no lie
I saw your lover an hour ago with a gal named Nellie
Bligh
He is your man and he's doing you wrong
Frankie looked over in transom she saw to her susrprice
There on the cab sat Johnny making love to Nellie Blie
He is my man and he's doing me wrong
Frankie drew back to her kimona she took out a little
44
Rutty too too three times she shot right through that

Hardwood door
She shot her man he was doing her wrong
Bring out the rubber tied buggy bring out the rubber
Tied hack
I'm taking my man to the graveyard but I ain't gonna
Bring him back
Lord he was my man and he's done me wrong
Bring out a thousand policemen bring 'em around today
And locked me down in the dungeon cell and throw that
Key away
I shot my man he was doing me wrong
Frankie she said to the warden what are they going to
Do
The warden he said to Frankie it's a electric chair for
You
Cause you shot your man he was doing you wrong
This story has no moral this story has no end
This story just goes to show that there ain't no good
In man
He was her man and he's done her wrong

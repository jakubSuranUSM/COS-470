Another day, another dollar
After I sing and holler
Oh it's my way of livin'
And I can't change a thing

In another town is drawing near
Oh baby I wish you were here
But the only way I can see you darlin'
Is in my dreams

It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on

Yeah the hurt you leave behind
Is the hurt that's on your mind
Oh and last night sure took it's toll on me

Well the city lights fly by me
As I lay my body in my bed
Oh and dreams of you flash through my head

It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
It's as long as 
As the road I'm on

Yes these big wheels are ready to roll
We've been flyin' high I'm so low
And all in all this madness
Ain't as crazy as it seems

Everywhere they stop and stare
I'm just a stranger on this road
I stand alone only in my dreams

Highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on

Highway song
It's as long as 
As the road I'm on

Highway song
Sing it on and on
On and on

Highway song
It's as long as 
As the road I'm on, on uh

He'll never love you
Cause he can't be true, girl
He only wants what
He can get from you, girl
He's a cheater
He's a cheater

He'll hold you tight and 
Look into your eyes, girl
He'll steal your love and
Tell the sweetest lies, girl
He's a cheater
He's a cheater

You never listen
And you never learn
You play with fire, girl
You're gonna get burned

He's breaking your heart
And you're breaking mine
Ah this guy he's breaking 'em
Two at a time
He can't be trusted
He can't be trusted

You look at him like 
He's some kinda hero
But in the morning 
You wake up with a zero
He's a cheater wo ho
He's a cheater
He's a cheater 
Low down and dirty
He's a cheater

You never listen
You never learn
You play with fire, girl
You're gonna get burned

He's breaking your heart
And you're breaking mine
Ah this guy he's breaking 'em
Two at a time
He can't be trusted
He can't be trusted

You look at him like 
He's some kinda hero
But in the mornin' 
You wake up with a zero
He's a cheater  wooo hoo
He's a cheater
He's a cheater 
Low down and dirty
He's a cheater

You never listen
You never learn
You play with fire, girl
You're gonna get burned

He's breakin' your heart
And you're breakin' mine
Ah this guy he's breakin' 'em
Two at a time
He can't be trusted

You look at him like 
He's some kinda hero
But in the mornin' 
You wake up with a zero
He's a cheater  wooo hoo
He's a cheater
He's a cheater wooo hoo
He's a cheater   
He's a cheater   
He'll make you cry
He's a cheater
He's a cheater 
He'll break your heart, girl
He's a cheater   wooo hoo
Wooo hoo
Wooo Hoo
He's a cheater   
He'll make you cry

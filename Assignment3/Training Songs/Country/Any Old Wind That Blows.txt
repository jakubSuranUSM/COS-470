Hmmmm

Lord, she's restless,
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day,
Slow and free.
And she possesses,

A mind that can't resign itself to stay,
For long with me
Though I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied,
Until she really needs me,

Yes I do,
But when that certain look comes on her face,
I can't replace it,
And she leaves me.

She's butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to try her brand new wings.
On brand new things.
And she needs no rhyme or reason when she goes.
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon, I suppose:

And Heaven knows
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.
Yes, she will; 
Yes, she will.
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.

[Repeat: x2]
Hmm

I know she needs me,
About as much as I need someone else,
Which I don't.
And if need be,

I swear someday I'll up and leave myself,
Which I won't.
Even if she loved another man,
I'd understand it more than I do.

Hhmm.
But I know the only reason,
That she ever has for leavin',
Is she wants to

She's butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to try her brand new wings.
On brand new things.
And she needs no rhyme or reason when she goes.
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon, I suppose:

And Heaven knows
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.
Hmmm, hmm hmm, Hmmm, hmm, hmm (x4...)

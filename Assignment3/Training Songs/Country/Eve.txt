Eve don't ya know
That God loves you so
He only asks
That you not disobey

He gave you the world
What were you thinkin' girl
To let the devil
Take it all away

Don't eat the fruit 
In the garden Eve
It wasn't in in Gods natural plan
You were only a rib
And look at what you did
To Adam the father of man

Eve I've hear it said
That no one would be dead
If only you had picked
The other tree

From the garden you were barred
An there's an Angel standin' guard
To protect the tree of life
Eternally

Don't eat the fruit 
In the garden Eve
It wasn't in in Gods natural plan
You were only a rib
And look at what you did
To Adam the father of man

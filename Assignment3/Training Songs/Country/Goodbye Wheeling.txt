Well, I've been reeling around Wheeling
West Virginia just a little too long
Well, I gotta be leaving 'cause one deceiving
Free wheeling woman done me wrong

And it's goodbye wheeling West Virginia
No, I don't guess I'll settle down
Since she don't need me, Lord I can't see me
Any longer hanging round this old town

'Cause I've got a feeling that I've been concealing
Many thoughts about traveling on 'cause things ain't grooving
So I'd better be a moving when you wake up in the morning
Big Wheeling, I'm gonna be gone, gone, gone

Well, it's goodbye Wheeling West Virginia
No, I don't guess I'll settle down
Since she don't need me, Lord I can't see me
Any longer hanging round this old town

Goodbye, Wheeling, I said, "Goodbye, Wheeling
Bye, bye so long, oh, goodbye Wheeling"

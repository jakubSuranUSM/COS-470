I just threw my bottle at the jukebox
Got tired of hearing them same old songs
Gotta get myself back to Tennessee
Lord, where a country boy belongs

I kinda like those city women
When they walk by, Lord, and the way they smell
Gotta get myself back to Tennessee
Where the women and the wildcats, they both raise hell

Now let me tell you something city slicker
I didn't know this coochie was your wife
Put that gun back where it belongs
And I get myself on home
I'm gonna get on my hat, get back to Tennessee
Lord, where a country boy belongs

(instrumental break)

Now let me tell you something city slicker
I didn't know this coochie was your wife
Put that gun back where it belongs
And I get myself on home
I'm gonna get on my hat, get back to Tennessee
Lord, where a country boy belongs

Got a roof above my head
Shoes on my feet
And got air in my lungs
Groceries in the pantry
So I guess I'd have to say it's a good day

I don't own a mansion with a big white iron fence
May not ever make a million, that don't worry me a bit
'Cause when the sun came up this morning
It was enough to put a smile on my face
Any day is a good day

Took a walk outside
And I heard a bluebird singing
That tiny little miracle
Oh, it got me to thinkin'
As I watched him fly way
It's a good day

I don't own a mansion with a big white iron fence
May not ever make a million, that don't worry me a bit
'Cause when the sun came up this morning
It was enough to put a smile on my face
Any day is a good day

Don't think you're gonna make it
That's what the doctor told me
This morning I woke up to my one year anniversary
So I guess I'd have to say it's a good day

I don't own a mansion with a big white iron fence
May not ever make a million, that don't worry me a bit
'Cause when the sun came up this morning
It was enough to put a smile on my face
It's a good day

Oh, any day is a good day

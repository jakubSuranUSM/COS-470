Oughta be a law oughta be a law y'all
Oughta be a law against anybody walking that way

Oughta be a law oughta be a law y'all

The way she moves is a moving violation
It just ain't right what she's doing to me
She walked by and stole my attention
You know it makes me want to lock the girl up
And throw away the key

There oughta be a law oughta be a law y'all

Driving home she turned me around
I had to make the block come back and check it out again
Blood red dress and dangerous curves
When she flashes her smile at me it threw me into a spin

Oughta be a law oughta be a law y'all

She's stopping traffic up and down the street
Making a wreck of every man she meets
Somebody ought to go call the police
She's disturbing the peace

Oughta be a law oughta be a law y'all

She ought to get a citation for all the excitation
Go before the judge and jury for causing such a fury
There ought to be some kind of law y'all
There ought to be some kind of law y'all

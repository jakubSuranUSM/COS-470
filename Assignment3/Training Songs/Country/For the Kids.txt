There’s a little girl
And she’s in for the fight of her life
Only six years old
Facing down the future, no fear in her eyes
Her mamma and daddy are praying down on their knees
For a miracle in Memphis
Lord won’t you help them please

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
For the kids

And there’s a little boy
And he’s sittin’ in his daddy’s lap
He smiles and laughs
And covers his head in a St. Jude ballcap
It’s been a long battle but he’s gonna beat the odds
He’s gonna make it outta there ‘cause people care
And by the grace of God

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
For the kids

And I sing for the ones
Whether far or near
We’ve got to lift
So we can give that all the world may hear
Music in their ears

For the kids, we’d trade all our tomorrows
And for the kids, we’d give our heart and souls
‘Cause they’re the heroes of our lives
Fighting to survive
So give all you can give
You gotta give all you can give
For the kids
Yeah, for the kids

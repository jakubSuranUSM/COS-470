Those West Coast lights you talked about in your sleep
The things you always thought that I could be
The skies will spread your wings 'cause this town's too small
Stars and moon, well I hope you got 'em all

'Cause I'm still waiting on life to begin again
Still waiting on love to give a second chance
To stop me and steal my breath the way you did
I'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot
Still taste your lips with every whiskey shot
I hope you found whatever I ain't found yet
'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone
And I think you got 'em all

Those dreams you prayed about but were scared to have
The smiles and the laughs, the greener the grass
Well girl I hope you got 'em all

'Cause I'm still waiting on life to begin again
Still waiting on love to give a second chance
To stop me and steal my breath the way you did
I'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot
Still taste your lips with every whiskey shot
And I hope you found whatever I ain't found yet
'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone
And I think you got 'em all

And yeah those shells we found on the beach in South Carolina
Does the smell of a cottonwood tree ever remind you
Of those memories, of you and me, that I still see
I hope you got 'em all

Girl I'm still waiting on life to begin again
Still waiting on love to give a second chance
To stop me and steal my breath the way you did
I'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot
Still taste your lips with every whiskey shot
And I hope you found whatever I ain't found yet
'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone
Yes, I feel like all my better days are gone
And I think you got 'em all
Girl I think you got 'em all

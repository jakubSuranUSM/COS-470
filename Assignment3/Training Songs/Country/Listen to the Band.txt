Hey hey mercy woman
Plays a song and no one listens
I need help I'm falling again
Yeah, play the drum a little bit louder
Tell me I can live without her
If I only listen to the band
Listen to the band

Whoa weren't they good
They made me happy
I think I can make it alone

Whoa-oh mercy woman
Plays a song and no one listens
I need help I'm falling again
Yeah, play the drum a little louder
Tell me I can live without her 
If I only listen to the band
Listen to the band

Whoah weren't they good
They made me happy
I think I can make it alone

Yeah mercy woman
Plays a song and no one listens
I need help I'm falling again
Yeah, play the drum a little louder
Tell me I can live without her 
Now that I have listened to the band

Oh, weren't they good
They made me happy
I think I can make it alone

Whoa-oh mercy woman
Plays a song and nobody listenin'
I need help I'm falling again
Play the drum a little louder, Johnny
Tell me I can live without her 
Now that I have listen to the band
My my

Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord, it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

Yes, I know that I once loved her and I placed no one above her
And I never thought, I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plan, the way Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close as she danced with me

She said I've loved you for a long time but you're married to a friend of mine
And I tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger, I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know

Now, I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord, it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

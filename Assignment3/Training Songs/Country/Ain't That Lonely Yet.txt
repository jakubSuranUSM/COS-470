You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone
Well that's real sad

And you keep leavin'
Notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more
Girl that's too bad

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
I ain't that lonely yet

Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web
Of love and lies

She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go
Oh but I survived

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
I ain't that lonely yet

There's nothing left that you can do
To try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do
Just brings me down

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
I ain't that lonely yet

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
No I ain't that lonely yet

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
No I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No I ain't that lonely yet

You never looked more beautiful
Than you look tonight
In your eyes I see all I can be
And how you change my life
You held on when I let go
Now all I want is to let you know:

Your love is like a river
It runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty
And warm when I'm cold
And when I feel forgotten
I come running to your shore
And find peace of mind time after time
You give me everything and more

When tomorrow comes I can face the morning
In a different light
You can change your mind a thousand times
Nothing will ever change mine

Cause your love is like a river
It runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty
And warm when I'm cold
And when I feel forgotten
I come running to your shore
And find peace of mind time after time
You give me everything and more

The sun will rise and the light will shine
Oh everything will be all right
Oh yes it will

Cause your love is like a river
It runs through my heart and soul
It's deep when I'm thirsty and warm when I'm cold
And when I feel forgotten
I come running to your shore
And find peace of mind time after time
You give me everything and more
Oh
You give me everything and more

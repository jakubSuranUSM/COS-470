If the 'Amber Waves Of Grain' should disappear
And there were no wheat or barley anywhere
Would we buy our bread and butter from the Toyota man
Would an Idaho spud be stamped 'Made In Japan'
The farm just won't get tended, if the farmer isn't here
And the 'Amber Waves Of Grain' may disappear

There's a railroad train that's on it's way to no where
Never to return again this way
Will the future farmer board this train to no where
Is there nothin' we can do to help him stay
Can we get rid of that foreign aid to the farmer over here
Or the 'Amber Waves Of Grain' may disappear

If the 'Amber Waves Of Grain' should disappear
And there were no wheat or barley anywhere
Would we buy our bread and butter from the Toyota man
Would an Idaho spud be stamped 'Made In Japan'
Can we sink a bit of some foreign aid to the farmer over here
Or the 'Amber Waves Of Grain' may disappear

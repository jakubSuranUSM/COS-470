Why is this day
Why is this day like no other day
Oh you've waited so long
To be sure love is all
And the first flowers bloom ? back on the farm
The windows were warm
Back home the windows are frozen shut
Glad that you showed me how
To get out of the cold
And you almost had a house there in Mendocino
We used to drive through the countryside
And I will miss your dear sweet smile
All the while
I'll see you again
My own Jo Ellen someone who knows
Someone just as long you've been around
There's an empty old sound
Like the day coming down
We used to drive through the countryside
And I will miss your dear sweet smile
All the while
I'll see you again
My own Jo Ellen
Why is this day
Why is this day like no other day
Oh you've waited so long
To be sure love is all
And the first flowers bloom ? back on the farm

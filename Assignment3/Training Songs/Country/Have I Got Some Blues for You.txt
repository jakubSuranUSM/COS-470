The one you love stopped by to see me today,
Said she just couldn't tell you she was goin' away

I took her to the station, and I held her as she cried,
And she asked me if I would tell you goodbye

Have I got some blues for you, your baby's gone
Have I got some blues for you, you're all alone
I hate to be the one who has to bring you this bad news,
Have I got some blues for you

I wish you could've heard it on the news tonight,
Or read it in the mornin' paper in black and white

Then I wouldn't have to be the one who breaks your heart in two,
But she told me she'd found somebody new

Have I got some blues for you, your baby's gone
Have I got some blues for you, you're all alone
I hate to be the one who has to bring you this bad news,
Have I got some blues for you
Have I got some blues for you

(Larry Boone/Rick Bowles)

I may never buy me a big house
A Cadillac, cruising with the top down
That ain¡¯t the way I am

I judge a man by the gold on the inside
I¡¯m not fooled by the glitter on the outside
That ain¡¯t the measure of a man

It ain¡¯t how far you go
It ain¡¯t how much you make
Son, it¡¯s what you give
Not what you take
It¡¯s being strong and true
To those counting on you
It¡¯s lendin¡¯ a hand, makin¡¯ a stand
That¡¯s the measure of a man

I give an honest day¡¯s work for an honest day¡¯s pay
I¡¯ll stand behind every word I say
I¡¯ll seal a deal with a shake of a hand
If I¡¯m a few rungs short of the top of the ladder
When I meet my maker what will it matter
That ain¡¯t the measure of a man

It ain¡¯t how far you go
It ain¡¯t how much you make
Son, it¡¯s what you give
Not what you take
It¡¯s being strong and true
To those counting on you
It¡¯s lendin¡¯ a hand, makin¡¯ a stand
That¡¯s the measure of a man

It¡¯s lendin¡¯ a hand, makin¡¯ a stand
That¡¯s the measure of a man
That¡¯s the measure of a man

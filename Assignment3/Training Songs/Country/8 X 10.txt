All that's left of our old love now is just your picture, 8 by 10.

I remember the night that you gave me this picture.  I ought to - I've relived it so many times.  I remember how I couldn't wait to get home and put in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.

Because you WERE mine, at least till someone else came along and took you off out of my sight.  It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture, though.  Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.

It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame but I'm jealous of anything that's close to you.  And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight.  That looks like more than I'll ever do.  I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame and be so close to the lips that I love.  I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold but sometimes it's just not enough.

You told me that our love was forever
But you never really meant it that way
You said we had a sweet situation
But I'm waking up without you today

Cryin' again
We're out of love again
Cryin' again
Like we've nearly always been
Cryin' again
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again

I thought we had a real understanding
But you never understood what I said
The magic didn't last like we planned it
But we've wasted all the feelings instead

Cryin' again
We're out of love again
Cryin' again
Like we've nearly always been
Cryin' again
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again

Cryin' again
We're out of love again
Cryin' again
Like we've nearly always been
Cryin' again
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again

Cryin' again
We're out of love again
Cryin' again
Like we've nearly always been
Cryin' again
I wonder when I won't be cryin' again

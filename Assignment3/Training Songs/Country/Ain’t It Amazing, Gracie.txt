I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you
Well I left my Gracie and I cought a big train searching for wealth and fame
But every clickety-clack of the railroad track seemed to bring out my Gracie's name

Well ain't it amazing Gracie how much that I love you
I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you
Well she's not the prettiest girl in the world I know she's not the smartest one too

But she's always there and I know she cares and I know her little heart is true
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...

I met a lot of pretty girls wherever I'd go none could ever take her place
`Cause everytime I'd look into their eyes I keep a seein' my Gracie's face
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...

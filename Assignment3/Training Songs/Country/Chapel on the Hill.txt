I can hear the organ playing gentle strains of peace be still
I can see my mother praying in the chapel on the hill

While the choir turns the pages in my heart I feel a thrill
Now they're singing Rock of Ages in the chapel on the hill
How that vision makes me ponder and I know it always will
'Till my weary footsteps wander to the chapel on the hill

(I can hear the organ playing
How that vision makes me ponder

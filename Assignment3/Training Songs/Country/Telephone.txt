I can't be here anymore,
Just want it to be over. (Over.)
Wanna walk where the clouds are big,
An' covered in clover (Clouds of clover.)
I'm sorry I ever called.
Shoulda never, ever, ever picked up the 'phone. (Shoulda forgot your number.)
It's turned into a scary dream.
I never want it back at all.

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.
When the telephone rang.

I've looked in faces that just looked away.
The eyes were dim and cloudy. (Can't see a thing.)
The pain of livin' with the hand that's dealt,
Is more than I can stand. (Can you take it? Can you take it? Can you take it?)
I can't forget all the mistakes I made,
It'd take a lifetime to erase them. (No, I can't go back.)
An' even I would never change a thing,
I can't waste any more time. (Time's a wastin', time's a wastin'.)

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.
When the telephone rang.

Instrumental break.

I'm gettin' old an' my friends are few;
We're crossin' that big mountain. (Almost to the top, almost to the top.)
The sky fills of with the stars and moon and rain,
Pours like a fountain. (Water fallin' down.)
Oh, I could sit here in the midnight air,
An' look at what this life takes from me. (An' what it gives to you.)
An' count the reasons why I can't stand myself.
Just had to say these things anyway.

I never really thought you would answer.
Now it's a big blown up thing.
I wish you hadn't been at home when the telephone rang.-acap

Well the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split, I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back
But before I get going I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love stop burning you got to do what's right

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well the truth
It hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away

But before I get going I got to say
I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love stop burning you got to do what's right

But before I get going and I got to say
There was a time, oh woman, when you used to shake it for me
But now all you do is you treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover

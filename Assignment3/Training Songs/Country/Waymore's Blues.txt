Well, I woke up this mornin' it was drizzlin' rain 
Around the curve come a passenger train 
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan 
Jimmy he's dead, he's been a long time gone. 
Been a long time gone, a long time gone. 

If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E 
You gotta put on your coat and T-I-E 
want to get the rabbit out of the L-O-G 
You gotta make a cold motion like D-O-G 
Like D-O-G, like D-O-G, yeah. 

Well, I got a good woman, what's the matter with me? 
What makes me want to love every woman I see? 
I was trifling when I met her now I'm trifling again 
And every woman she sees looks like the place I came in. 
Looks like the place I came in place I came in. 

I got my name painted on my shirt 
I ain't no ordinary dude 
I don't have to work 
I don't have to work

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
An' my farm boy chased a city girl

I used to know everybody by name
But everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

I thought like my mom and her momma before
That I would die where I was born
Live a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies an' corn

Now here I am, one I am row
Tryin' the read the map on the dash
Nowhere close to makin' up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast

This ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future
Ain't what it used to be

No, this ain't nothin' like
What I had in mind for me
But then again, the future now
Ain't what it used to be

That backwood town in my rear view
Was gonna be my whole world

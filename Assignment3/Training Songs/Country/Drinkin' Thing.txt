Every day, I tell myself, it's temporary 
That it's only 'cause she's young 
That makes her want... another man 

Even though she makes me feel unnecessary 
I've found a way to help me understand 

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done 

And it's a lonely thing 
But, it's the only thing 
To keep a foolish man in love 
Hangin' on. 

If I wait at home, I'll only ask her questions 
She'd probably the truth, so I don't even ask 
So, I sit here on this barstool, feelin' helpless 
And I wonder, just how long, a man can last 

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done 

And it's a lonely thing 
But it's the only thing 
To keep a foolish man in love 
Hangin' on.

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done.

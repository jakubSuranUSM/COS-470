I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
I pay the rent
Pay it right on time
Baby I pay you every single dime
For my heart
The heart that you own

Used to be I could love here for free
Way back before you bought the property
Now I pay daily on what once was mine
Lord I probably owe you 
For the tears that I cry

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own

I struggle each night to find a new way
To pay what I owe
Just so I can stay
I ain't overdue
So you can't throw me out
I've loved here for years
Don't know where I'd go now

'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
There ain't no view but there's lots of space
In my heart
The heart that you own
In my heart, the heart that you own

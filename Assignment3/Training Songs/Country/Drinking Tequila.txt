I'm just gettin' back from Juarez Mexico
And I'll tell you something I want you to know
My poor head is aching it throbs and it twirls
From drinking tequila and teasing the girls
Don't get me wrong because I'm not complaining
I have no regrets I am only explaining
For all of you fellows that ain't had the thrill
A drinking tequila and teasing the girls
Hee ha happy tonight the maidens are dancing out
In the moonlight
Hee ha on top of the world drinking tequila
And teasing the girls

Moonlight and flowers make night so appealing
The breeze from the garden comes tenderly stealing
A beautiful maiden then whispers your name
And suddenly both of your hearts are aflame
Her dark eyes are gleamin' her raven hair shining
You pull her up closer your hearts are entwinning
Her warm lips are thrilling you're out of this world
From drinking tequila and teasing the girls

Hee ha it's good, tome usted
Tengo el dinero, vamos a cafe
Hee ha, ???
Tequila tomar y muchachas amo

If down in Juarez you should happen to be
The Cafe El Gusto's the place you should see
They claim that they have and I know
It's so the prettiest dancers in old Mexico
When Spanish maidens start squirmin' and dancin'
It's sure to set any young heart to romancin'
Your troubles get lighter your worries unfurl
While drinking tequila and teasing the girls

Hee ha, so happy tonight
The maidens are dancing out
In the moonlight
Hee ha, on top of the world
Drinking, tequila and teasing the girls

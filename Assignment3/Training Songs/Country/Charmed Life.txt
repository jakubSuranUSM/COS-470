Some say it's the strong who survive
Sometimes I wonder if there's any truth to that at all
I've been lucky and that's a fact in a crazy world
I've led a charmed life

I know judges and I know priests
I know gangsters, bad cops and lawyers too
But I don't need none of them to sing this song
I've led a charmed life

Chorus:
No this ain't no hard luck story
Some have had better and some have had worse
Then again until you've walked my way
You'd have to say I've led a charmed life

I'm not so scared of dying
I've got my health , my friends and family too
I'm just afraid of living and not being sure
I've led a charmed life

Chorus:
No this ain't no hard luck story
Some have had better and some have had worse
But then again until you've walked in my shoes
You'd have to say I've led a charmed life

Bridge:
When the dice come tumbling down I'll be waiting
To see what luck comes my way
When the cards get passed around I'll be waiting
To see what hand I should play
I believe it's neither wrong or right
To cross that line from the dark to the light
And I say, "even in the worst of times against all odds,
I seem to have led a charmed life."

Repeat chorus

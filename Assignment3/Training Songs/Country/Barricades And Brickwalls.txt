Barricades and brickwalls
Won't keep me from you
You can tie me down on a railroad track
You can let that freight train loose
Iron bars and big old cars
Won't run me out of town
Well I'll be damned if your not my man
Before the sun goes down

Well you can chain me down
On the edge of town
You can leave me there to die
But the railroad track
Will bring me back
When the lonesome whistle cries

Barricades and brickwalls
Won't keep me from you
You can tie me down on a railroad track
You can let that freight train loose
Iron bars and big old cars
Won't run me out of town
Well I'll be damned if your not my man
Before the sun goes down

Well you can lock me out
You can scream and shout
You can try to change your name
By the end of the day
I'll take you away
Like a force 10 hurricane

Barricades and brickwalls
Won't keep me from you
You can tie me down on a railroad track
You can let that freight train loose
Iron bars and big old cars
Won't run me out of town
Well I'll be damned if your not my man
Before the sun goes down

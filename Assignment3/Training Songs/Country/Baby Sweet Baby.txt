Without you my life is so empty I'm sad and I'm blue as can be
Just a little sad girl in a big lonely world 
Without you there's no love for me
Baby sweet baby I love you so oh why did you go
Baby sweet baby baby please come back to me

We had a quarrel and you left me and I've cried 
Ever since you've been gone
Come on home like you should and I'll love you so good
For without you I just can't go on
Baby sweet baby

Homebreaker that's what you're calling me
But he stopped loving you before he came to me

You're sayin' that I broke up your home and that I stole your man
But that's not really true, I never had it planned
You're giving me the blame but in your heart you should know
He stopped loving you a long time ago

Remember what he has to face when his day would end
Just another party night with you entertaining your friends
You gave them all your attention and he often sat alone
Neglected and left out of things in what you called a home

Homebreaker that's what you're calling me
But he stopped loving you before he came to me

I was sittin' in a diner when you came all alone
Why, I bet you didn't miss him or even know that he was gone
I listened as he talked to me, he had to tell someone
And he cried tears for you, now yours have just began

Well, now you say you love him but if you really do
Then give him this chance at happiness
A happiness he never had with you

Homebreaker that's what you're calling me
But he stopped loving you before he came to me

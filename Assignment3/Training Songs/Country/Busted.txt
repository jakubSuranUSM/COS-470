The bills are all due and my baby needs shoes 
But I'm busted 
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound 
But I'm busted 

I got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay 
A big stack of bills that get bigger each day 
The county's gonna haul my belongings away 
I'm busted. 

I called brother Bill, thought I'd get me a loan 
I was busted 
Lord, I hate to beg like a dog for a bone 
But I'm busted 

But Bill said that "There ain't a thing I can do, 
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu, 
And I was just thinkin' about callin' on you, 
I'm busted." 

Now Lord, I'm no thief, but a man can go wrong 
When he's busted 
The food that we canned last summer is gone 
I'm busted 

The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow 
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go 
Where I'll make a living, the Lord only, knows 
I'm busted

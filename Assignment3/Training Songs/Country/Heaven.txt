Well, everybody wants to go to heaven
Everybody talks about heaven
Well, let me tell you a thing or two    
Heaven’s only five foot two
And I know all about Heaven
 
Heaven is the way she loves in the morning
Heaven is the way she loves at night
And heaven is the way that she kisses
And I go see Heaven every night 

Well, everybody talks about heaven
And everybody wants to go to heaven
Well, let me tell you I’ve been there
Heaven’s got blond hair
And I know all about Heaven

Heaven is the way she loves in the morning
Heaven is the way she loves at night
And heaven is the way that she holds me
And I go see Heaven every night 

Well, everybody wants to go to heaven
And everybody talks about heaven
Well, let me tell you what I’ve seen
Heaven’s got eyes of green
And I know all about Heaven

Heaven is the way she loves in the morning
Heaven is the way she loves at night
And heaven is the way that she loves me
And I go see Heaven every night 
And I go to Heaven every night

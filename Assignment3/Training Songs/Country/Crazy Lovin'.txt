If you want me to sail
To the far end of the island
If you want me to dive down
And gather you pearls
If you want me to shine
Like a light up in the lighthouse
If you want me to take you
To the end of the world

Just show me the way
One more way,
One more way

Little darlin' now don't you see
This crazy lovin' has got to me
Little darlin' now don't you know
This crazy lovin' has got to go

If you want me to ride
To the far side of the mountain
If you want me to bring back
All the silver and gold
If you want me to run
Like a thief up in the canyon
If you want me to find out
What's never been told

Just show me the way
One more way,
One more way

Little darlin' now don't you see
This crazy lovin' has got to me
Little darlin' now don't you know
This crazy lovin' has got to go

(ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
(ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
(ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
(ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)

Little darlin' now don't you see
This crazy lovin' has got to me
Little darlin' now don't you see
This crazy lovin' has got to me
Little darlin' now don't you know
This crazy lovin' has got to go

Oh I'm so homesick all I do is roam the street
Can't sleep at night can't eat a bite homesick too homesick to eat
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Too ashamed to cry too sick to die homesick to be with you

Little by little I'm losin' my mind cause I haven't been home in too long a time
But I'll be home soon I'll be home if I have to come in a box
Cause I'm homesick homesick for you
I'm so homesick I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do
Can't sleep can't eat just roam the street homesick to be with you

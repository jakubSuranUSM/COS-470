Forgive me, please forgive me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I love you and I need you
Do anything, but don't say goodbye
Let bygones just be bygones
We all make mistakes now and then
I'm sorry forgive me, my dear
And let's be sweethearts again
Forgive me, please forgive me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I love you and I need you
Do anything, but don't say goodbye
Let bygones just be bygones
We all make mistakes now and then
I'm sorry forgive me, my dear
And let's be sweethearts again
And let's be sweethearts again

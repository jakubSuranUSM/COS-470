As a young man I was raised by men of the cloth
And I was tought to judge men equal and not to find their faults
Until one day I witnessed a tragic thing
The men lay on the church steps, slain
And when the smoke cleared a tall man holstered his gun
The bright day ended and a cloud did cover the sun
I found hate in my heart that I'd never known before
I'll see this man hang and if that's the one thing that I know for sure

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree
And you'll die in misery

His face remained in my eyes as I grew through the years
I practiced shooting every day while trying to hold back the tears
I travelled through Oklahoma and Texas to the Rio Grande
Knowing when I met Silverado the Lord would steady my hand

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree
And you'll die in misery

Then the day came I dreamed of for years
Silverado stood before me and my heart it pounded in fear
As he turned and saw my eyes he knew why I'd come
And without a flick of the eyes he went for his gun
And as I caused a fight tears come to my eyes
When he collapsed before me I dropped my gun an sighed

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree
And you'll die in misery

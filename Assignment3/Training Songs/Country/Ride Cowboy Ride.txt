Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way yet to go
He started his long ride in Prescott
The sun was a hundred or more
On down he rode at full gallop
Into the flat desert floor
Driving the big herd to Flagstaff
In Prescott the letter was there
Happiness soon would be sorrow
Sad news the letter did bear
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't go too slow
Ride, cowboy, ride
You've a long way to go
Your darlin' now lies on her deathbed
Racked by fever and pain
Reaching for you at her bedside
At each breath she's callin' your name
Forward he leaned in the saddle
Pushing through mesquite and sage
His head never raised for a greeting
As he passed the Wickenburg stage
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way to go
In Phoenix he traded horses
Now on the back of this roan
He could see visions of Tucson
His darlin' and their lovely home
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
There's still a hundred and twenty to go
In through the ranch gate he galloped
And without breaking his stride
He bounded out of the saddle
And rushed to his sweet darlin's side
Then as the dyin' girl saw him
A smile came over her face
Holding her hand as it tightened
Barely had he won the race
Ride, cowboy, ride
On through the blue
Ride, cowboy, ride
She'll be waiting for you
Ride, cowboy, ride
On through the blue
Ride, cowboy, ride
She'll be waiting for you

I want a full time job makin' love to you
I'll do anything you want me to
But if you have no plan to use a full time man
A part time job will do

I want a life time job bein' close to you
Makin' all your dreams come true
But if your heart don't throb about a full time job
A part time job will do

You wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime
As long as you would let me
Get in a little bit of overtime

I want a full time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too
Don't need a part time job, I want a full time job
But a part time job will do

You wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime
As long as you would let me
Get in a little bit of overtime

I want a full time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too
Don't need a part time job, I want a full time job
But a part time job will do

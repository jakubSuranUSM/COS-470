I listened when they said bad things about you
And when they told me I should leave you on the wrong
And they said just walk right out there's nothing to it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
It seems some people have no feelings at all
For them to break a heart is some sorta fun
Well I'm afraid that's not my way of thinking at all
'Cause it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done

Ever since I left blue tears have fallen
My friends say just forget her dry your eyes
And it sounds so simple when I hear them say it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever tried
It seems some people...
Yes it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done

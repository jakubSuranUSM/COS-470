Can't you tell my love's a growin'
Can't you feel it ain't showin'
Though you must be a knowin'
I've got a big, big love

It's not the kind to be concealin'
Just the kind to be revealin'
It's not a little bitty feelin'
I've got a big, big love

I think it's time we done some walkin'
I think it's time we done some talkin'
Well there's a great big moon above
But we've got a big, big love

This is not infatuation
This is a true love sensational
It's not my imagination
I've got a big, big love for you
Can't you tell my love's a growin'

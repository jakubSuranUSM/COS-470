Swarbrick

I know Rosie
You're living in a world you didn't make
And I know it's hard feeling happy
When the things you want aren't even there to take

Come on Rosie, rosin up the bow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Lie down cozy and let's learn to take things slow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Of my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie, rosin up the bow

Throw away your uniform
Now's the time to take things by the hand
Come on in and take your coat off
Settle down and listen to the band
And ain't that grand, Rosie

Come on Rosie, rosin up the bow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Lie down cozy and let's learn to take things slow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Of my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie, rosin up the bow

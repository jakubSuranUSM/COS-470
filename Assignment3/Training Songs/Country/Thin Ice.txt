Some folks go to the motel and some folks go to the brush
And some folks go for that funky thing and some folks go for therush
But I thought we had a real love filled with a common trust
Till your love slipped and I got hip now nothing ain't like itwas
 
And we're traveling on
Thin ice, baby
Thin ice, baby
We're traveling on
Thin ice, baby,
Thin ice
 
I'm giving up living that nightlife I'm giving up walking the street
I'm giving up waiting for sunrise and the high-heeled sound of your feet
And you said we had a rare wine with a taste so bittersweet
But that's all wrong our good thing's gone it ain't like it usedto be
 
And we're traveling on
Thin ice, baby
Thin ice, baby
Yeah we're traveling on
Thin ice, baby
Thin ice
 
Thin ice, baby
Oh yeah, we're traveling on
Thin ice, baby,
And ooh, we're traveling on
Thin ice, baby,
 
And we're traveling on,
Thin ice, baby
And we're traveling on,
Thin ice, baby
Aah we're traveling on,
Thin ice, baby
Aah we're traveling on,
Thin ice, baby

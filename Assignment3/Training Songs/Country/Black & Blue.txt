Pack up your shit, we're through
Prepare for black and blue
She slams the door, out into the night she flew
Maybe you'll shut the f*ck up
Well, it's late and that's quite enough
But I scan the streets, and I scream off the balcony for you
Love
Drown myself, it's just as well
Throw my body in the wishing well
Fallin' apart, spellbound, scheming for you
I'll crawl to the corner store
Courage makes me want you more
I'm fixin' my mind but I'm fuckin' it up
For you, for you, it's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
Pack up your shit, we're through
Prepare for black and blue
She slams the door, out into the night she flew
Love, love, love

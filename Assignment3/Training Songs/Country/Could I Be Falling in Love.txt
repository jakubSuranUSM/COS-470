I feel very strange 
There's evidence of 
A radical change 
Could I be falling in love

I see three or four
New moons high above 
Or is it just your 
Intoxicating love

My heart's a flaming fire 
The moment you appear (moment you appear)
I have just one desire 
To have and hold you near (to hold you near)

I've tried to resist 
The strange mystery of
The need for your kiss 
Could I be falling in love

I have just one desire 
To have and hold you near

I've tried to resist 
The strange mystery of
This need for your kiss 
Could I be falling in love
Could I be falling in love 
Could I be falling in love...

What did I have
Oh, what did I have?
Search for the diamond
Shine through the door
What ever I did, lord
I would do again
Oh, what did I have then?

Don't say it's over
Hilltop leaves turn gold and red
Don't say it's over
Your black eyes remind me
Of the dreaming dead

Turn up the future
Turn off the past
Only in your arms
Will this ï¬?re last
What ever I did, lord
I would do again
Oh, what did I have then?

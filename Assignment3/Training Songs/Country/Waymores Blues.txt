Well I woke up this morning it was drizzling rain
Around the curve called a passenger train
I heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Jimmy he's dead it's been a long time gone
Been a long time gone
A long time gone

If you want to get to heaven got to d-i-e
You got to put on your coat and t-i-e
Want to get the rabbit out of the l-o-g
Gotta make a commotion like a d-o-g
Like a d-o-g
Like a d-o-g

I gotta good woman what's the matter with me
What makes me want to love every woman I see
I was traveling when I met her now I'm traveling again
And every women she sees looks like a place I came in
Looks like a place I came in
Place I came in

I got my name painted on my shirt
I ain't no ordinary dude,I don't have to work
I don't have to work

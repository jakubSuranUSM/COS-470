All the street lights on Main Street know my shadow
All the stars up in the sky know all my wishes
And the sidewalk on your street know my footsteps
And the stars keep tellin me I'm repetitious

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
On and on and on
I keep wishin for you

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do in a pinch
Honey it's a cinch
To keep wishin for you

All the boys down at the poolhall got my number
Some gal up in some hotel got my shoes
Ah but I still got my last, bottom, dollar
Lucky me I never lost more than I could lose

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
If you can't wish on your own
I keep wishin for you

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do in a squeeze
It ain't nothin' to sneeze at
Wishin for you

All the dogs down at the dumpyard can hear me whistle
As I walk through my hometown wild as a stranger,
Oh, but the kiss of love is hotter than a pistol, 
And I think it's safe to say I love the danger.

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
If you can't wish on your own
I keep wishin for you

I keep wishin for you 
I keep wishin for you 
It's more than you'd ever do, in the wind,
And when the wind don't blow even then,
I keep wishin for you.

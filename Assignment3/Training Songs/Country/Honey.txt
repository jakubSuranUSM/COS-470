See the tree how big it's grown but friends it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when I came home from working late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes one day while I wasn't home while she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights
And call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed
Where honey loved
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could

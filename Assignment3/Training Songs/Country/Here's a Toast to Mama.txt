Today I found a dollar on the sidewalk so I went and bought a jug of wine
And I'll sit here in this alley and keep drinkin'
Until the thoughts of mama leaves my mind
Here's a toast to mama do you miss me do you even think about me anymore
Mama did you even stop to kiss me when you left me laying at a stranger's door

Oh how I wish I could've known you mama maybe now I wouldn't feel the shame
Maybe now I wouldn't feel so empty cause mama I don't even know your name
Here's a toast to mama...

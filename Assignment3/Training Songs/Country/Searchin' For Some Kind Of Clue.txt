Every hour, every minute of every single day, girl
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I told you that I'm sorry over and over
But I'm still not gettin' through
I've got to win you back somehow
If I have to turn this whole world upside down

I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Tryin' to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
I'm searchin' for some kind of clue
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue) yeah
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue)

My letters keep returnin', your telephone keeps ringing
My heart's on the line
Every day I've sent you roses, nothin' seems to work
I still can't change your mind
Don't you think that I've heard enough
Tell me that I haven't lost your sweet love

I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Tryin' to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
I'm searchin' for some kind of clue
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue) yeah
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue)

I've looked high and low everywhere I know
Tryin' to find my way back to you
Someways to bring you home back where love belongs
Tell me how do I get through to you
I'm searchin' for some kind of clue
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue) oh, oh
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue)
Searchin', searchin, baby
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue)
(Searchin', searchin, for some kind of clue)

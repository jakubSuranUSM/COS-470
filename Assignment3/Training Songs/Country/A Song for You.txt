Well I've been a lot places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhymes
I acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for you

And I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you

Well you taught me precious secrets of a truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front but I was hiding
And now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Just listen to the melody for my love's in there hiding

And I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you

Well you taught me precious secrets of a truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front but I was hiding
And now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody for my love is in there hiding

And I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you

I almost didn't make it
Boys, I risk life and limb
It was plain to see that my wife
Was in that honey-do mood again

Well buddy, that ain't nothing
I barely made it out the door
She was prayin' and a-cussin'
Like she was 'bout to wage a holy war

Mine got so mad, she was bitin' her lip
She turned her head and I gave her the slip

Now we're all in the same boat
Pass me a beer and a fishing pole
Let's find a spot and drop that anchor down
We're really livin' the high life
And blue skies
We left all our worries back in town
We're all in the same boat now

Did you see the one I just missed?
Hey I bet he weighed six pounds
And by the way I thought you said you wore
The breeches in your house

She don't run my life
I do as I please
And that minnow you couldn't seem to land
Didn't look that big to me

You boys are good actin' tellin' them tales
But truth be known, we know damn well

That we're all in the same boat
Pass me a beer and tell a good joke
Let's find a spot and drop that anchor down
We're really livin' the high life
And blue skies
We left all our worries back in town
We're all in the same boat now

It's time to go and your hands are shaking
Don't think I didn't see your knees are waking
We're gonna need some luck cause we all know
That we're all in the same boat

All in the same boat
Pass me a peppermint and go slow
We'll be lucky if the women ain't locked us out
And we're all in the same boat now

Time is sand just sifting through my hands
Gonna live as long and loud as I can
When the wind carries me
High above the tallest tree
Let know I've been there
When the evening comes
I don't need a reason
For all the thing I've done
Sometimes you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun
Give me more
Than just a place to fall
Cause I can't live my life
Behind a wall
there's a place
I've got to find
there's another state of mind
Even if it?s just from going nuts
Sometimes you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun
Sometimes there's no explaining
The darkness is singing
The moon keeps you hanging on
Sometimes you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun
Time for workin
Time for prayin
Once in a while
I make some time for playin
Lord is forgivin
there's love in the livin
If you want to have some fun
Sometimes you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun
Sometime?s you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun
Sometimes you've gotta run
Just to chase the sun

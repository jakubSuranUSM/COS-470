I'm counting the cracks on the wall by my bed
'Cause I can't get to sleep
And my mother said 
To try counting sheep as they're jumpin' the fence

But the fence has a hole
And the sheep snuck out
Their tails are wagging 
Back and forth in celebration
Farmer Sam is calling out their names
But he's yelling to loud, and I can't get to sleep
And it's all on account
Of those runaway sheep
Now they're out in the woods eating ice-cream and cake

Dancing 'round and around
That's why I'm awake
Unless I'm dreaming
This is all too silly to be really happening
They've all got party hats
Every one of those sheep has a bell on it's neck

Going ring-a-ding-ding
I'm a nervous wreck
They're ringing so loud
Tell me why it won't stop
A familiar sound
Just like my alarm clock
Hey, no wonder
I can hear mom say good morning
Time for breakfast
Tell me what you dreamed

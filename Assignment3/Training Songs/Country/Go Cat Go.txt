You don't want a home and the family you say you just can't live that slow
You like your music loud and you like that swinging crowd
So say goodbye and go cat go
You say the sound of wedding bells don't move you
And babies may be cute but they cry so
I'll find someone to share the life that you call square so say goodbye and go cat go
Go cat go may life be good to you may all your lights be above
I hate to have to try to get over you but your life don't move me at home
I may be wrong to think that you miss me I may still be around I don't know
I'd know there'll be tears but that jukebox hurts my ears
So hit the road and go cat go so hit the road and go cat go

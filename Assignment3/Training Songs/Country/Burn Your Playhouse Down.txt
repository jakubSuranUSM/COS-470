I've got an achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
I've got a badly broken heart
I've had it from the start
You're giving me the run around

Now if you play with fire
It's sure to burn
I've known this all of my life
Go on, be on your way, well honey I've had my say
'Cause I'm through with you for life

There's one in every yard
I'm getting mighty tired
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down

I've got an achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
I've got a badly broken heart
I've had it from the start
You're giving me the run around

Well if you play with fire
It's sure to burn
I've known this all of my life
Go on, be on your way, well honey I've had my say
'Cause I'm through with you for life

I achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down

Now if you play with fire
Sure to burn
I've known this all of my life
Be on your way I've had my say
And I'm through with you for life

I've got an achin' in my heart
Arson on my mind
I'm gonna burn your playhouse down
Thank you Keith, thank you George

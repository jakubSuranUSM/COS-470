There goes my baby walkin' out the door
I never cried a bigger tear before
You don't know 'til it breaks
How much a heart can take
You don't know pain until it burns inside
I should have picked on a love my own size
How could a love so strong
Turn out to be so wrong

The bigger the love the harder the fall
When I lost your love I lost it all
I never hit the ground 
Until you shot me down
The bigger the love the harder the fall

If I had known you'd be too much for me
I would have kept you as my fantasy
To get you off my mind I'm gonna need some time

The bigger the love the harder the fall
When I lost your love I lost it all
I never hit the ground until you shot me down

The bigger the love the harder the fall
The bigger the love the harder the fall
When I lost your love I lost it all
I never hit the ground until you shot me down
The bigger the love the harder the fall

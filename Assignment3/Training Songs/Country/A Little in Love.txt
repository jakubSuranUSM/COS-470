I'm really kinda bad at hedging my bets
Straddling the fence just to get my feet wet
It's sorta like me to jump on in
To see if I sink or swim

So maybe I'm a fool for taking this fall
But it's all for you or nothing at all
Too late for a little in love
I'm all the way in

Ain't no kinda, sorta, maybe
When I'm holding you baby
Halfway ain't near enough
Every waking minute

Got my heart and soul in it
No I can't be just a little in love
No such thing as a little in love

This is high wire walking
I don't need a net
Parachute jumping, ain't pulled the cored yet
No turning back now, I'm goin' all the way down

Ain't no kinda, sorta, maybe
When I'm holding you baby
Halfway ain't near enough
Every waking minute

Got my heart and soul in it
No I can't be just a little in love
No such thing as a little in love

I might learn the hard way
That's the chance I take
Knowing there's no such thing
As a little heartache

Ain't no kinda, sorta, maybe
When I'm holding you baby
Halfway ain't near enough
Every waking minute

Got my heart and soul in it
No I can't be just a little in love
No such thing as a little in love

No such thing as a little in love
I can't be just a little in love
No such thing as a little in love

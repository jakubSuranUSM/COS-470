Imagine a month of Sundays
Each one a cloudy day
Imagine the moment the sun came shining through
Imagine that ray of sunshine as you
 
Remember your darkest hour
With dawn still far away
Remember the way that you longed for morning's light
And think of yourself as a candle in the night
 
Make believe this is the first day
Everything all brand new
Make believe that the sun is your own lucky star
And then understand the kind of gift you are
 
[Chorus:]
The gift you are
Like the very first breath of Spring
The gift you are
All the joy that love can bring
The gift you are
All of our dreams come true
The gift you are
The gift of you
 
You are the promise of all the ages
You are the Prodigal Son
You are the vision of prophets and sages
You are the only one
 
Dream of a bright tomorrow
Know that your dream will come true
Carry your dream in a sparkling crystal jar
Then you will know the kind of gift you are
 
[Chorus]
 
The gift you are
Like the very first breath of Springtime
The gift you are
All the joy that love can bring
The gift you are
All of our dreams come true, yes they do
The gift you are
The gift of you
The gift you are
The gift of you

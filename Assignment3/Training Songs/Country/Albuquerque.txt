I've spent twenty three nights in this one horse town
I've been jacked up, been broke down for too long
I've been bustin' my tail in the blazing sun
Watching jack rabbits watch tumbleweeds run until dawn
Something's whisperin' in my ear
That I should be light years from here in

Albuquerque where the skies are blue
(Gonna take a bus take a train gonna' fly)
(Prayin' she's there after all this time)
Albuquerque my heart aches for you
(Stretchin' out across the lazy haze)
(Haunting my dreams calling my name)

Three more days 'til I get my pay
I need my money but I can't stay another night
I've been tossin', turnin' in my bed
I can't get her out, out of my head to save my life
Shake the sand out of my boots
634 miles to you in

Albuquerque where the skies are blue
(Gonna take a bus take a train gonna' fly)
(Prayin' she's there after all this time)
Albuquerque my heart aches for you
(Stretchin' out across the lazy haze)
(Haunting my dreams calling my name)

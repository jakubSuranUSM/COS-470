At dusk you see them gather on the edge of town
Cold winter, long nights
And they'll be coming for you when the sun goes down
You can't run, can't hide

Wolves wait outside your door
Getting restless and I cannot feed them anymore
Woods are empty they've been running through the town
You know they're hungry honey can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl

Things have changed around here girl since you've been gone
Cold winter, long nights
And now you spend your evenings waiting for the dawn
Can't run, can't hide

Wolves wait outside your door
Getting restless and I cannot feed them anymore
It wouldn't do for them to catch you're out
You know they're hungry honey can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl

You'd say anything to get you out of here
But take it easy darling cause you know they smell the fear
You're always honest but you're answers always wrong
Careful girl another winter's coming on
Winter's coming on
With the long nights

Wolves wait outside your door
They're getting restless and I cannot feed them anymore
Woods are empty they've been running through the town
You know they're hungry honey can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl?
Can't you hear them howl

The moon is full and my heart is why
I love to dance oh me, oh my
Gonna have more fun than a tree in a coon
Tonight's the dance of the cajun noon.

Chorus:
Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Pick ups and wagons 'round the river road shack
Bonfires draw in a crowd out back
Step through the door and I see my Sheri
That's when I see her mamas eyes on me.

Chorus:
Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Guitar, a squeeze box, a fiddle, a bow
Little band a-playin' every song they know
Old woman sittin' there and yellin' for more
My heart is willin', but my feet - they're so sore!

Chorus:
Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Once more we're waltzin' to Jolie Blond
I lean in closer and Sheri responds
Her mama's smilin' as we slip from the room
To sit and stare at the cajun noon.

Chorus:
Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon...

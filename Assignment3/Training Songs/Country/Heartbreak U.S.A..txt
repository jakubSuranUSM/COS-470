(Back home in heartbreak USA)
The harbor's empty my love has gone
With aching heart I face each cold and lonely dawn
And till the trade winds bring him home to stay I'll live in heartbreak USA

Don't let those Geisha girls get your heart in a whirl
And if you meet some sweet Fraulein remember you're mine
Don't forget your sweetheart while you're away back home in heartbreak USA

Sometimes I'm lonely and time stands still
And I wonder if you feel the way I always will
So darling write me letters every day in care of heartbreak USA
Don't let those Geisha girls...

Woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine
Looked everywhere tryin' to find that gal of mine
I just found an ice cold pilow layin' by me side

[Chorus]
Well the moon is down 
But it still ain't dawn 
And the world is dark 
And my baby's gone

Looked out the window and I could not help but cry
She left me all alone and never said goodbye
She even took the golden sunlight from my sky

[Chorus]

I sit here and wonder why she left me
Just try to think what I done wrong
I stay in the darkness of this lonely room

[Chorus]

Woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine
Looked everywhere tryin' to find that gal of mine
I just found an ice cold pilow layin' by me side

[Chorus x3]

Well there ain't no moonlight
There ain't no starlight
There ain't no sunlight
My baby's gone

[Repeat x7]

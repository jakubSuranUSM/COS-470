She kinda breezed into town from New Orleans
And said, "Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now, I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just come to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me

Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'"

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red-hot kiss on his cold blue lips
He started breathin' (aah)

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, "come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole"
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, "I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me"

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans
Big Bad John and his Cajun Queen
They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time
But their love's just as strong as that night in the mine
A hundred-and-ten grandchildren

Now the moral of this story has a real clear omen
Don't you ever underestimate the power of a woman

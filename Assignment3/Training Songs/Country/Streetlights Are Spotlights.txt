I’ve got years of living, scratched on my guitar 
Ran away from my life, to be a rock star
My hopes they all moved, too fast for me to catch
But on this street of stars, they have met their match
And packed in my suitcase, dreams are getting old
I’ve been up and down town, on this broken road

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine 
Over the moonlight, it feels so right
I’m poetry in motion
It’s part of my devotion
I play with all emotion 
Under the spotlight, of the streetlights

So make a wish and throw, a dime in my hat
You’ll hear songs a new way, from this here cool cat
My heart and my music, I wear on my sleeve
I have crowds gathering, like you won’t believe
My skin’s gotten thicker, my hair may recede
My guitar and music, they’re all that I need

Running after my own dreams
Tripping over my own feet
Held on to my self esteem
Walking to my own loud beat
So stand tall or take a seat

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine 
Over the moonlight, it feels so right
I’m poetry in motion
It’s part of my devotion
I play with all emotion 
Under the spotlight, of the streetlights

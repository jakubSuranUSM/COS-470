The wind is blowing 'round the cabin
I hate to hear that lonesome sound
I'm all alone and so down hearted
Since my true love she ain't around
 
I hate to see the sun a sinking
Another night to toss and turn
Another night to dream about her
Another night for her I yearn

She had no cause to go and leave me
For I had never done her wrong
She left our home and little children 
And with another she has gone

The children they are soundly sleeping
No they don't know that their mother's gone
What can I do when they awaken
I can't tell them that their mother's wrong

They couldn't see what i thought would be so
Obvious
They hide behind the laws they make for all of
Us.
The ministry of truth at deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're tryin' to
Do
I'm breaking the rules and its for me and for you.

I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They think i workship the devil
They only see through his eyes
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel.

They live their lives in fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
But i'll make you wish that you had never been
Born
Cause i'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll do as i please
I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'm a free as the breeze
I'm a just rock 'n' roll rebel

They'll try playin with your heart
They know it rules your head
They only feel what bigotry feels
They won't fool me again (oh no)

God only knows why they couldn't see that
Obvious
Is it because they manifest the incubus
The ministry of war that got caught in the draught
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When its all boild down and the days at the end
I'll give you no bullshit and i'll never pretend
Cause i'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say i workship the devil
Why don't they open their eyes

Unleash your swimming life
Allow it to be caught by science
Life's boundaries are being smashed
Processes in natures defiance

Existence without creation
Life without conception
Humanity pushes progress
But is this in the right direction baby?

Cones, not knowing where you came from
Professionally created
Who were you spawned from?
Frozen you have waited

An after crop of technology
Not knowing the warren crop
Of flowing milk and honey

Experiments no longer restricted to animals
As long as you got the money
Caught in a realm of fantasy
Is an actual reality

Life of mass brutality
You've blossomed from modern surgery
End the tears of infertile parents
Embryo's paused in time

Is your life an endless question
Or an unnatural crime?
Now you know, you have been told
The truth about your life

You're father was a sterile test tube
Your mother a surgical knife
Unable to carry a child so meek and mild
Who's fault is this?

Our seed shall blend with science
In an alliance, our minds insist
So now you find your life's an endless cause
The endless question that haunts you

You can not pause
Your parents say they are truly yours
Answering questions, opening doors

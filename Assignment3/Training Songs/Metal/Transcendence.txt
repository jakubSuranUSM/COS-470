I draw the line and
Hard times are mine and
All the lies

I walk the line and
Hard times I'll find and
All the lies

I see, I see you
But I'll never follow, I'll never follows lies
I see I see you
I'll never follow, I'll never follow love

Haul the line, all the minds

Who transcends this?
I do
Do you transcend this?

I see, I see you
But I'll never follow, I'll never follows lies
I see I see you
I'll never follow, I'll never follow love

Haul the line, all the minds

Who transcends this?
I do
Do you transcend this?
Who transcends this?
I do
Do you transcend?

Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
Do you wanna take a stand?
Take control
Take command
Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
You can't take it anymore
Then it's time to start a war

'Cause now is the time
For you to fall in line
For you to read the sign
For you to be divine
'Cause now is the day
For you to get your way
For you to make your play
For you to jump and say hey

Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
Do you wanna take a stand?
Take control
Take command
Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
You can't take it anymore
Then it's time to start a war

'Cause now is the time
For you to fall in line
For you to read the sign
For you to be divine
'Cause now is the day
For you to get your way
For you to make your play
For you to jump and say hey

All day, it's been a bad day
A sad day
A stick it up your ass day

All year, it's been a tough year
A rough year
A never get enough year

Throw your hands in the air
Now's the time to not care
Throw your hands in the sky
And say goodbye to bad times

'Cause now is the time
For you to fall in line
For you to read the sign
For you to be divine
'Cause now is the day
For you to get your way
For you to make your play
For you to jump and say hey

Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
Do you wanna take a stand?
Take control
Take command
Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
You can't take it anymore
Then it's time to start a war

Do you wanna start a war?
Start a fire
Start a roar
You can't take it anymore
Then it's time to start a war

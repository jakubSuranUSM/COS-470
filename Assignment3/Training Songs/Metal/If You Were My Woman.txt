If you were my woman
And I was your man
If you were my woman
I'd be your man
Oh baby when I feel your touch
The magic in your fingers takes control of me
My love for you is way too much
Don't turn me off, don't leave me Don't
set me free
Hold on to what we've got
If nothin' else we've got a lot
Your loving takes me higher
Takes me high.
If you were my woman
And I was your man
Would you be my woman
Then I'd be your man
Well baby when I saw you on that night
I had to put my loving spell on you
You were standing in the rain
But through the stormy weather all your love
came shining through
Oh baby can't you see
A love like this was meant to be
Your loving takes me higher
Takes me high
If you were my woman
And I was your man
If you were my woman
I'd be your man
Oh baby can't you see
A love like this was meant to be
Your loving takes me higher
Takes me high
If you were my woman
And I was your man
Would you be my woman
I'd be your man
If you were my woman
And I was your man
Now you are my woman
I am your man

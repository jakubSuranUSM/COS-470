Midnight, we kill.
We slaughter the tongue of revolution.
To our graves, we are marked by the stain of lust.
How many times can I trust in you, my beloved friend?

Because every time I trust, I lose.
So I believe in nothing, nothing.
Because of you, I still believe in nothing.
Because of you, I still believe in nothing.

I'll always know my place in this world.
No longer fit in your fucking world anymore.
Your lust ruins everything.
Like a growing target on my back, I feel the knives are chasing.

See my eyes are no longer blind.
See my eyes are no longer blind.
There is a purpose in life today.
Destroying you every step of the way.

From this point on - no more friends.
I know my role in this world.
Don't fit in your fucking world.
This once meant everything to me.

Now another forgotten effigy.
Because only scars remain.
Broken bones form a hope that's been left grey.
I die every time I hear your fucking name.

Been left grey.
Been left grey.
And there is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet, as we march to our graves.

Fight back.
There is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet, as we march to our graves.
I can still feel your thoughts ripping me apart, tearing me apart.
Ripping you apart. tearing us apart.

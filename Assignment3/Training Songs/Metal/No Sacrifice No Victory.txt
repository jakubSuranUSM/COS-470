Once there was gold at the end of the rainbow
Honored by blood we kept searching for more
Light turned to dark as we lost what we fought for
Now we have come to settle the score

Sacrifice Victory
No Sacrifice No Victory

Light, brings us light on the pale darkened heavens
Lead us towards our vast victory
Fighting for all that we brothers believe in
Together, united we're standing all for one
On our pathway to glory, we stand together and honored by blood
Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever
By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die
Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory

In the end only truth will survive, no matter what you sacrifice
So you can't harvest your glory all based on deceit, 'cause no one will swallow your lies

On our pathway to glory, we stand together honored by blood
Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever
By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die
Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory

Sacrifice Victory
Sacrifice Victory
Victory

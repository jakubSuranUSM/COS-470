Danger zone
I look into the mirror see my face again
I hear myself preaching
You are getting bold
Growing old
Skin turns cold

You're to blame
But I will find the way to be myself again
I break the mirror with a noise
Stop preaching me teaching me
Leave me be

There's no way to stop me now
My end is in sight
I reach for the light
Tonight

Twilight time
It's twilight time
Reaching for a morning light
Twilight time

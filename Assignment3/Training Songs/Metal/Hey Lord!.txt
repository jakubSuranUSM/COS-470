Pleasure of pain
Cold or fire
Love against disdain

Hope or despair
Thuth of liar
Normal or insane

Do You know what to choose?
It can´t happen you lose
Like the stairs nedd the light
No left without right

Hey Lord, hey Lord
Life is striking as you taugth
Hey Lord, hey Lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey Lord (what is it all about?)

Good or profane
Odd of even
All is face to face

Sinner or saint
Serve each other
Life is called this place

Do you know what to choose?
It can´t happen you lose
Like the stairs nedd the light
No left without right

Hey Lord, hey Lord
Life is striking as you taugth
Hey Lord, hey Lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey Lord

Hey Lord, hey Lord
Time is running, time is short.
Hey Lord, hey Lord
Life is striking, life is short
Hey Lord

Hey Lord, hey Lord
Time is running, time is short.
Hey Lord, hey Lord
Why did You want us so way hard?

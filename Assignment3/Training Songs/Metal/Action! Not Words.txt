I'm sick and tired of the damn TV
I'm gonna make my own movie
I want to star in a late night show
And all I need is my video

Shock me make it electric
Shock me make it last

Curtain up let the camera roll
It's automatic it's in control
Got no script baby, ain't no lines
Just me and you and a real good time

Oh shock me make it electric
Shock me make I'll it last
Shock me gimme thunder 'n' lightning
Shock me ooh babe I need it fast

'Cause all I want is some action
Action, action, not words
Gimme action, action, action not words

C'mon and shock me, let the cameras roll

Oh I'll be the hero, you be the star
With your wine and your caviar
No audition, a starring roll
I'll be your bogart 'n' you be monroe yeah

Shock me make it electric
Shock me oh bump and grind
Shock me make a night to remember
Shock me do it one more time

So cut me in on the action

Lights, camera, sound, I need action
Action, action,
Gimme action, action, action not words
Let the camera roll (action, action)
Action, Action, action, not words
I need a little action, action, action, action not words  not words
Well, shake a little piece of your
Action, action, action not words
Come on, talk to me with your body

This is when panic and shock are given out in doses
There is nothing to admire
Absent from this present anxiety is liberation
Malice now exists inside my head
Crush and rebuild
Destroy and organize

I stand above
Looking down on this devastation
Words form blindly to express my feelings
And these hands work to gather what is lost
Anxious thoughts
Torment now exists inside my head

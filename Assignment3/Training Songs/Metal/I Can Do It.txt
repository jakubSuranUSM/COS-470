Ah-thinkin' 'bout guitars when I was just a kid
Just lookin' back on the things we did
Like hangin' round at the local hop
With my candy

And my soda pop.
I guess I never really stood a chance
I liked the music
But I couldn't dance

I guess I've really learnt a lot since then
'Cause I can really do it now it's back again.
Yeah
I can do it

I can do it
I can really move
From my head right down to my blue suede shoes
I can really make the groove

I can do it
I can do it
I can really move.
I can really rock

Ooh
I can do it...
Dancin' was trouble thinkin' 'bout it now
I had no girl friend to show me how

I was too young to date
Too old to wait.
It's kinda sad I was born too late
But like I said I learnt a lot since then

And I can really do it now
It's back again
I can do the jive
I can do the stroll

It's just another name for rock 'n' roll.
Yeah
I can do it
I can do it

I can really move...
Yeah
I can do it
Yeah I can do it

Yeah.
I can really rock
Ooh
I can do it...

Torture now follows my name
Amputation and killing becomes a game
Pain and agony is what they feel
As I slip them the drug that heals
Removing and decapitating these pathetic bits
From what was once a healthy bitch
Sawing a chiselling the limbs away
Chucked in a corner left to decay

A frozen body clinically cut
Tampered and plundered and totally gut
Symbolic memories of human trophies
Fridge full of limbs and no motives
Cadavers ripped apart and left to decay
Prostitute heaven such as prey
Cadavers ripped apart and left to decay

Frozen the bodies are all locked away
Buried put in holes left to decay
Infesting the insects begin to pick away
Eating eating through the waste decay

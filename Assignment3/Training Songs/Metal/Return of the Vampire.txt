And so I saw it
The birth of a vampire
Fresh in his lair
Spreading the veil
He'll spread his wings
Leaving at sunset
Fly high and low
Back before sun's glow
Return of the vampire
Leaving his liar or (Leave now he's come)
Sucking your blood through your veins or (I can't go back to that place)
Return of the vampire

Leaving his liar
Sucking your blood through your veins
There's only one way you can stop him
You gotta trace the vampire to his liar, oh yeah
And then you gotta drive the stake
Right through the heart of the living dead, oh yeah
Oh I can feel you living again
Vampire I'm losing control
Vampire just give me your cloak
Vampire I'm losing control
Vampire just give me your cloak

We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart, the vocals are screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth, the best heavy metal comes from north

The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy

Metal, Metal
Back with the vengeance
Metal, Metal
All that I need is heavy metal
Metal
Screaming together
Metal, Metal
Metal is all that I need

While hell bends for leather we stand strong, a rocker can party all night long
the school couldn't teach us rock' n roll, the school couldn't help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground

The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy

Kick ass!

If you're taking a flight
At the speed of light
You're shaking your heads to the band
If you're there on your horse
But you're not on the force
We're taking this place to the ground

In the heat of the night
When you're fists are alight
Forged on anvils of steel
If your body's on fire
About to expire
We go to the threshold of pain

[Chorus:]
Pull your head back
Hold your hands high
Shake your body
If it's too loud
And you're burning hot
fill your heads
With heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder

On the wings of an eagle
You're hoping to fly
Holding your hands to the sky
In a blue sea of denim
Checkin' the band
With your banners and scarves held on high

If you think something more
You'll come down to the front
Don't sit there and do as they say
We're an army of thousands
Surrounded by light
Tearing this place to the ground

It's orchestrated by another hand
Believe inferior dreams that I am
Orchestrated I don't understand
Belief increasing in me that I am

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever After

Without frustration
With no master plan
With nothing left of the dream that began

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever After
Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever After

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

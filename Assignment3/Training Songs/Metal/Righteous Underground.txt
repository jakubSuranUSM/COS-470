I have got an idle little mind and a grateful attitude
Waiting patiently inside a subway on the move
Avoiding the eyes
I'm humming a song to the crippled among the healthy ones.

I step outside in the carbon dioxhyde like drifting off to sleep
Shameful, uneasy and delicate, appearantly not too bright or deep

I know I can do whatever I want to how ever cruel
What may seem like greed has nearly taken over me
Here I come like a sleepwalker down the street
I clear my throat position my mouth
I want to kiss life...

In the house speakers beating my legs and arms around
Intoxication and free will in the righteous underground

Pleasure seekin' ignorance is not a subculture
I can't free my mind
I don't know what made me feel this way
Whatever you're thinking of it's not like I'm afraid

Behaving so good I am bound to get in trouble
With the truth, what can I say?
A seasickness makes me jump conclusions every single day
And I'm watching myself
Growing really funny on behalf of everybody else

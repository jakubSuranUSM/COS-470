You wanted love, you wanted love but its not what she was thinking of.
You step to the left, you step to the the left on your dancing feet, now.
Dancing feet, I cant compete now with with your dancing feet.

Somebody gotta try and to get to know you,
Somebody gottsa try and say its all right now, said its all right now.

Dancing feet, I compete now with your dancing feet now.
Some people say, they cant compare, when your not over here your there.
You see cause girl, she say oh no, another boy would you like to know

Somebody gotta try and to get to know now,
Somebody gottsa try and say its all right now, that its all right now.

She got the white feather,
To get you through the night.
He got the white feather,
To make you feel alright.

Dancing feet.

Somebody gotta try and to get to know now,
Somebody gottsa try and say its all right now, that its all right now.

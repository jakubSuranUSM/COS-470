Give me the right to be heard, 
To be seen, to be loved, to be me,
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

Father, there’s a little flower
Beautiful and different
All alone all alone

It it so, Dad? I’m not supposed to 
Make the world anew, and be like you? Am I you?

Give me the gift to be heard
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me
To be safe, to believe
In something
I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

Right to be heard
To be seen, to be loved, to be me

You made it clear right
From the start
I am to take your sour
Heart within, one sad day

But I will never teach my son
Embittered history, tried
And true, cause I’m not you

I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything… I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

Give me eyes so I see,
Give me ears so I hear,
Give me love so I know what love is,
Give me the freedom to think
To believe in something

I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

I have a special right to grow up,
And to develop physically and spiritually in a healthy and normal way

Free, and with dignity
I have the right to love, and understanding
My parents have special responsibilities for my education and guidance
I should be taught peace
Understanding, tolerance, and friendship among all people.

So give me the gift to hear, to see,
The love, the freedom to choose the things I feel,
To be right to the world you’ll leave

Give something!

Give me the gift to be heard
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me
To be safe, to believe
In something
I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

Eeeeeee oooohhhhh
Give me the gift to be heard
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me
To be safe, to believe
In something
I have a right to be heard 
To be seen, to be loved, to be free
To be everything I need to be me,
To be safe
To believe
In something

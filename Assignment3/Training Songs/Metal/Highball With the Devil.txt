He came to conquer what he could
But he held back
'Cause his tongue was tied by shy.
So he laid the money down and he drank up
Put the sparkle in his eye

Sittin down you saw his paunch
So he stood up
And he gazed across the room
The toxin squeezed the head
So he slipped back
He knew he left his seat too soon
A-Haw

Come the morning
We'll be waiting
And weilding the power
To paralyze
So we state now
For the records
You brought this upon you
Paralyze, agonize, terrorize

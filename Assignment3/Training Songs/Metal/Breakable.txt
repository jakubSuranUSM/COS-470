You place your hate on me and never feel your wrong
The words for war you will soon regret
The time has come for me to show you what sets us apart
I'm the one, I'm the man, that cannot be bent

Can't you see you're falling
And I'm the one still standing
Then you'll know you're fucked
'Cause I know you're so breakable

You seem to think I'm the dirt on which you walk
And when this ground gives way, no you won't forget
This time will be the last time I deal with it
I'm the one, I'm the man, with your death intent

Can't you see you're falling
And I'm the one still standing
Then you'll know you're fucked
'Cause I know you're so breakable

You can't take it back now
The words you have thrown around
What comes around, goes around
And I won't change my ways to fit inside your world

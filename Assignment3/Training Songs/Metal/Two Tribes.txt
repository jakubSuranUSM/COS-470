When two tribes go to war 
A point is all that you can score 
Score no more, score no more
When two tribes go to war 
A point is all that you can score 
Workin' for the bad guys
Cowboy number one, a born again poor man's son
Workin' for the bad guys

When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score 
Score no more, score no more
When two tribes go to war 
A point is all that you can score 
Workin' for the bad guys

Switch off your shield
Switch off and feel
I'm workin' on lovin'
I'm givin' you back the good times
I'm shippin' out, out
I'm givin' you back the good times
I'm shippin' out, out

Listen to the voice sayin' follow me

We've got two tribes 
We got the bomb,
We got the bomb, yeah
Are we living in a land, are we living in a land
Are we living in a land, are we living in a land
Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?
Where sex and horror are the new gods, where sex and horror are the new gods?

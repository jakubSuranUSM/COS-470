Speeding
Speeding through the night
Stolen car candy jar tonight I will see the light
Under, under the influence
A fire burns within my veins
Fever acid trance

Engine screams now it seems like there is no return
Moonlight beams violent dreams I am ready to burn 

Hell's around the corner
Chaos and disorder
Riding next to death
Under the scythe
The end of my destination
Narcotics and frustration
Crashing through the gate
Under the scythe

Empty emptiness is all
All the world has no place for me
I can hear the reaper call
Flashes
Memories in my eyes
I accelerate into darkness
Into blackened skies

Engine screams now it seems like there is no return
Moonlight beams violent dreams I am ready to burn

Hell's around the corner
Chaos and disorder
Riding next to death
Under the scythe
The end of my destination
Narcotics and frustration
Crashing through the gate
Under the scythe

Hell's around the corner
Chaos and disorder
Riding next to death
Under the scythe
The end of my destination
Narcotics and frustration
Crashing through the gate
Under the scythe

Hell's around the corner
Chaos and disorder
Riding next to death
Under the scythe
The end of my destination
Narcotics and frustration
Crashing through the gate
Under the scythe

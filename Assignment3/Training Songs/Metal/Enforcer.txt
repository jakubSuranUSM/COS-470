The man's got the magnum
Bows down to none
Cops and cowboys is his life
And everything he's won
No matter how he slices
Any which way but loose
Action is his vice
Adrenalin his juice

Turn around face me
Gravedigger you better make it three
Turn around face me
The good, the bad, and the ugly

Do whatever I say c'mon and make my day
A fistful of dollars is what you're gonna pay
And hell followed with him
The pale rider destined
Spit from his jaw
And Josey's never questioned

I'm sitting here alone in darkness
Waiting to be free,
Lonely and forlorn I am crying
I long for my time to come
Death means just life
Please let me die in solitude

Hate is my only friend
Pain is my father
Torment is delight to me
Death is my sanctuary
I seek it with pleasure
Please let me die in solitude...

Receive my sacrifice
My lifeblood is exhausted!
No one gave love and understanding
Hear these words,
Vilifiers and pretenders
Please let me die in solitude

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust...

Sitting here alone in darkness
Waiting to be free,
Lonely and forlorn I am crying
I long for my time to come
Death means just life
Please let me die in solitude

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

And please let me die in solitude...

It's just me
Against the world

Leave me alone
I'm on the defense
I'm not made of stone
Why doesn't that ever make sense
I'm sick of all this indecision
You're messing with my mind
This ain't no false facade
And this ain't no freak disguise

'Cause I am for real
You don't know what I feel
My strength is in my will
I can not wait
I won't be second rate
In for the kill

[Chorus]
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world

Inside looking outside
Through a goldfish bowl
In each hand of the masters
Make me lose control
If I'm an outcast 
I'm not the last
I'm gonna have my say
They'll never take me in alive
I'm gonna make em all pay

'Cause I am for real
You don't know what I feel
My strength is in my will
I can not wait
I won't be second rate
In for the kill

[Chorus]

You can't face my life
You just won't think twice
I see it my way
I won't be the martyr
I know you see it wrong
The color don't belong
I'm holding tight
Don't you push me too far

Yeah
Its me against the world
Its me against the world
Its me against the world
Don't you push me too far
Yeah
Its me against the world

[Chorus]

Don't push me too far

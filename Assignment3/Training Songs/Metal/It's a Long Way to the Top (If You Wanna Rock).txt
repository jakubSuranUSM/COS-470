Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stop in all the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you folks

It's harder than it looks
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one-night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll

Hotel
Motel
Make you wanna cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' gray
Gettin' ripped off
Underpaid
Gettin' sold
Second-hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll

It's a long way
It's a long way
It's a long way
It's a long way

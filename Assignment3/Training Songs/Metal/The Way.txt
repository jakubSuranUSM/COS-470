I want to sing some other way 
Always the same, never a change 
What can I do to make me feel right 
Change all my ways, give up my life 

[Chorus]
Oh, what did you say? 
Oh, Christ is the way 
Rockin' for the One who is the Rock 

I feel His strength come into me 
Reading His word helps me to see 
I feel so new, I want to sing 
Feeling His joy in everything 

[Chorus]
Rockin' for the One who is the Rock

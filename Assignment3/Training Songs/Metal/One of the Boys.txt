They were so damn glad when I left school
Said I was crazy 'cause I broke the rules
Time to start livin' my teenage dream
Out on the streets it was rough and mean

That's why, they call me one of the boys

Got tattooed arms and rings in my ears
Never gonna suffer a straight man's fears
Better have a drink, crankin' with the mates
Movin' fast I'm gonna make the grade

That's why, they call me one of the boys
That's why, they call me one of the boys

I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it fast
Gotta work it over, I gotta make it last

What you need is mates, staunch and true
Hold out your back they're gonna see you through
I don't look for trouble but I won't hide
I'll jump on you if you don't step aside

That's why, they call me one of the boys

There's one thing I've learned
And I know it's so true
Bad girls love bad boys but
Good girls love 'em too

I was young and wild, so much to learn
A fierce bright flame and hot to burn
Can't turn back 'cause the die is cast
I die young, from livin' fast

That's why, they call me one of the boys
That's why, they call me one of the boys
That's why, they call me one of the boys

Ah yeah I'm just one of, I'm just one of
I'm just one of the boys
I'm just one of, I'm just one of
I'm just one of just one of the boys
I'm just one of just one of the boys
I'm just one of just one of the boys

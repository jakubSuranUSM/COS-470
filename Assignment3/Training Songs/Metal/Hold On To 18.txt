I got one small thing that's on my mind
Am I half dead or am I doin' fine?
Well, I know one thing, I won't be forgotten

I don't got nothin' and I want a lot
If money can't buy it, I don't wanna talk
Don't wanna be long forgotten

'Cause I know what I need
But I don't know how to get it
It's totally out of reach
Yeah, I know what I need
But I don't know how to get it
I wanna stay young, stay young

So hold on to 18
I know what I like, babe
Hold on to 18
They can't see what I see

I don't care about society
I don't care about responsibility
And I don't need no one, out on my own

I won't grow old and I don't wanna die
You say I'm too young but that's a dirty lie
I wanna be on my own now

'Cause I know what I need
But I don't know how to get it
It's totally out of reach
Yeah, I know what I need
But I don't know how to get it
I wanna stay young

So hold on to 18
I know what I like, babe
Hold on to 18
They can't see what I see, no

I've got one small thing that's on my mind
Am I half dead or am I doin' fine?
Well, I know one thing, I won't be forgotten

I don't got nothin' and I want a lot
If money can't buy it, I don't wanna talk
Don't wanna be

Hold on to 18
I know what I like, babe
Hold on to 18
They can't see what I see

Hold on to 18
I know what I like, babe
Hold on to 18
Hold on to 18

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

You know, there aint no other woman, that could make me feel this way
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Gets up close, you know, I just aint got a word to say
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

You know I got so nervous, when I see his eyes that shine
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
He gets too close, and a chill runs down my spine
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Well, I don't know why she got her claws in me
'Cause I aint fighting, baby can't you see?
Sneaking up the stairway, running like a thief
Spend the night, just shaking like a leaf

I remember the first time, I took you to a cheap motel
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
I woke up drunk you know, I felt like Eskimo Nell
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much, huh!

Please don't touch, I shake so much
Please don't touch, I shake so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much

Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much
Don't you touch me baby 'cause I'm shakin' so much, whoo!

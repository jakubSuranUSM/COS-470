All systems down, something's wrong
Unplugged and freezed to the bone
Feels like I'm locked out, helpless within
I can feel uncertainty's rising

We trust too much and we are too blue-eyed
We get careless and we will fail
And we will wake up when it's too late
Tower of power is crashing down
My life will be erased, no files will be found

Gazing the screen, feeling the power
Still walking on the thinnest ice
For the last three to five years memories been saved
Without warning everything's gone

We trust too much and we are too blue-eyed
We get careless and we will fail
And we will wake up when it's too late
Tower of power is crashing down
My life will be erased, no files will be found

There's something invisible here with us
Untouchable, spreading like rust
There's something invisible here with us
And it's teasing and tearing our minds apart
There's a virus

There will be time when I will rise again
When all the things are saved and settled down
I'll be awake and I will never fail

There's something invisible here with us
Untouchable, spreading like rust
There's something invisible here with us
And it's teasing and tearing our minds apart
There's a virus

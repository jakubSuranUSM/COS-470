Just in time for a decade of heresy
A nation born on pain and disbelief
We are a permanant structure
One nation over god
Hunger struck a beaten down to the ground
Find the strength tp pull them down
Mistreated ashamed and bound
Find the strength to pull them down
Your structures your cross fucking belong to us
When 7 trumpets sound

Find the strength to pull them down
Crawling at a rapid rate we will pull this monster down
Showing a brand new way
State by state well change today
Become a part of this, become a soilder
Nation rise up and show them
Go forth, go strong, go quickly
Get it done, get back to us

We need you all right now
With stregnth in numbers we can never fall down
I can remember when I felt like I belonged to nothing
I remember when I felt like I belonged to nothing
And no one would notice if I were here or not
To be stronger but just to stay alive and well if you wanna make history
Stay home do, Do nothing
Don't be part of them

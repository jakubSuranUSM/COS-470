It takes eight days where I wanna go 
Well, there's just me am I only go 
I've got no face to make this slow 
The further I travel the less I know 

Somebody help me get home 
I can't spend my whole life alone 
Somebody help me get home 
I don't wanna be on my own 

Won't somebody put me 
In the right direction 
Cause all I need is 
A New York connection 
Really need a woman's affection 
I've got to make the close connection 

Somebody help me get home 
I can't spend my whole life alone 
Somebody help me get home 
I don't wanna be all alone 

Somebody help me get home 
I can't spend my whole life alone 
Somebody help me get home 
I don't wanna be on my own 
Don't wanna be on my own 
I don't wanna be on my own 
I don't wanna be on my own 
I don't wanna be on my own 
I don't wanna be on my own

See me coming
Down the road
I'm coming down the road
Standing by the end of the line

What you gonna do
Intuition can't you see
Mistreator got the shake on me
Fire and water rollin' dice

I'm gonna get you
No matter the price
I'm a hard man 2 fight
I'm an easy man 2 please

Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take the heat
I want to be your man
I want to be your lover baby

I want to be your man
No complication let me explain
I'll take you higher than an airplane
Look in the mirror

What do I see
I see the devil
And he's looking at me
I'm a hard man 2 fight

I'm an easy man 2 please
Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take the heat
I want to be your man

I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man

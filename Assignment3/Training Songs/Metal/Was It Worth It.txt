I've been dragged through
Mud here
Entirely beat up and torn

But when last night
Comes back to me I sure as hell know

We rocked, went crazy
And far beyond
When I look back
And ask myself
Was it worth it?

Hell yeah 
Ignore the Pain
Hungover
But I'll do it again
Crying
Tears made of grit
Flying
Oh yea, it was worth it

Withdrawal kickin' in. I can't shake it
Yet in one way I have to take it

I'll rock. Go nuts
And far beyond
And I look back
I don't need to know
Was it worth it?

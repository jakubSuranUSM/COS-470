She was the dawn of a new day
The crystal voice inside my head
And at times she showed me Eden
Untrodden paths, a sky that's bleeding

Serpent's embrace
Serpent's embrace

Darkness waiting in her eyes, her gaze
Kissed by a fraudulent snake
A soul eater, serpent's embrace
Serpents embrace

She was the dawn of a new day
But all it brought was pure dismay

The sky and sun turned black
Nailed black as ebony
And there was no turning back
No turning back

A golden sun in past times, floating high above
Looking back from now, a collection of strange days, for love

And at time I realized
Everything must surely end, some day

Darkness waiting in her eyes
Darkness waiting in her gaze
She gave birth to a worm of lies
A place of shadows mourn
A soul eater, serpent's embrace

Every dawn of a new day
Too far away, but death in cheap
There's a giant, black sun below
Maybe just below the ground, about six feet deep
Beneath the undertow
Beneath the undertow

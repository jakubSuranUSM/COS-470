Inspired to create. Driven by hate.
We experience progression through aggression.
All the while, closing our eyes and pretending.
Pretending that we're not LIARS.
We're not COWARDS.
We're not THIEVES.
Always in search of the almighty villain.

The world’s corrupt, our lives forever FUCKED…
Yet we still believe in the storybook ending.
Because HOPE is the END ALL, BE ALL.
We're no longer kids.
It's not about the end, it's where it all begins.
We'll carry on because a FIGHT is what let's us know that we're still alive.

After all, we're DEAD EVERYWHERE,
Not just dead inside.

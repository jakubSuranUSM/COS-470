Past it haunts again
The trace of life and f*ck this nightmare
That has no end the shadow of tomorrow
So this day to day has my corpse shake into my raise
My spirits high
I never thought that

I should never have thought that this would never end
The moment we started old words you could not mend

Five and day to day
Six six the voice I take away
My dreams are fallen
No more to share
No the end remains
My one regret my body stays
I'm sick again
(can't tell what he screams here)

I should never have thought that this would never end
The moment we started old words you could not mend
Should never have thought that this would never end
The fear was to much for us to bare

So this day to day has my corpse shake into my raise
My spirits high I never thought that

I should never have thought that this would never end
The moment we started old words you could not mend
Should never have thought that this would never end
The feel was to much for us to bare

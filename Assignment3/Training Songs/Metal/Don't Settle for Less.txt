Watch you like an outer satellite
Watch every move you make
You got me running, electrified
I've got a feeling, a feeling so strong

Can't miss with this emotion
Can't fail to satisfy
I'll sail the stormy oceans
To let our hearts collide

Too much, too fast
I'm in and out of trouble
Days have gone, nights have past
But your heart is mine at last

Want your love, need your love
Honey, I don't settle for less
'Cause your love is enough to satisfy me

Hey you!
Always focussed on your precious heart
Felt every aim was true
You were the target right from the start
Since you came walking out of the blue

Too much, too fast
I'm in and out of trouble
Days have gone, nights have past
But your heart is mine at last

[Chorus]

Need you a little closer
Got to have you near me
Need your love so bad

[Chorus]

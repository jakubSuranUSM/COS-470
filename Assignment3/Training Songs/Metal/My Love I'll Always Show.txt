Verse 1
You know I really love you
Your love is beautiful, lasting and true.
I've searched for a true love for such a long, long time
Now, my search has ended, yes, cause you are mine.

Chorus
I'll always love you and I'll always tell you so
As long as I'm with you, my love I'll always show

Verse 2
Whenever I'm sad and feeling real blue
I begin to feel happy as I sit and think of you.
I think of your face and your personality.
You are so beautiful, you mean everything to me.

Repeat Chorus

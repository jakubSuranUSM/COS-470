Take door no. 1 with a suicide
You're going straight to hell by the devil's side, oh-no, oh-no
Take door no. 2 with a prison view
They never knew what hit 'em but we knew it was you, oh-no, oh-no
Praying for what lies in store beyond the curtain, behind the curtain
When the die is cast you can't ignore the truth
You gotta deal with the devil
Deal with the devil
You gotta deal with the devil
You gotta deal with me
Take door no. 3 with a fantasy
You said she was your lover, but she never agreed, oh-no, oh-no
Take door no. 4
You're a greedy whore, they pray in your temple while you worship the floor, oh-no, oh-no
Praying for what lies in store
Beyond the curtain, behind the door
When the lies unmasked you must endure the truth
Go to heaven, go to hell, sit back, enjoy the rapture
Go to heaven, go to hell, control to me, body and soul
Your pride is just, covet thy trust
Give into lust, anger you'll bust
Gluttony's a meal, envy you steal
sloth as you will, let's make a deal
Yeah, you know I'm on the level
No more working with that shovel
When you're livin' in the ghetto
When you're shootin' high to get low

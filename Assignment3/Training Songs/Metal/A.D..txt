This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

I don't want this dream or the grievance it brings
Can't justify greed at the cost of equality
Tangled in endless archaic chains 
Of power, profit, gain
What about the poor bearing poverty's marks
What about the sick whose lives are torn apart
What about those whose rights aren't respected
A nation of youth dejected

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage

A burdened soul once searching for liberty
Crowned in debt as the new face of slavery
Died by design with a senseless hope 
And a never ending rope
What about the leaders abusing authority
Corrupt moral compass guarded bureaucracy
What about those who died so we can live our complacency must end

It's time to rethink this dream you call American
Corrupt beliefs, that some will call their heritage
This dream can't be
What it used to be, ever again

Spirits of the slain hiding in the corners of my mind
Screaming when I kneel to look inside 
Stomach fucking turning and now it's disconcerting
Fight fire with fire you'll see everyone's burning

Turn on the TV for the murder spree
Get distracted while they take your civil liberty
Thoughts and prayers again, is that what it'll take?
Which industries profit while lives are at stake 

Now hear the media fools discuss the killer's mind
Starring at the screen to tell us what they find
Manifesto, dollar, worship get on your knees
So they can sell us a cure for the American disease

It's time to rethink this dream that they call American
Corrupt system of beliefs, some will call their heritage
It's time to rethink this dream that they call American
So one day it can mean something real again

You've got a full time job, with a minimal pay
You do all of the work, but you don't get no say
You never raise your voice, or try to run the show
You always get there first, you're always last to go

You always take your share, no more no less
And when you've had your turn, there's always something left
For whoever's next, behind you in the line
When there's work to do, you always spare some time

you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain
You never push up front, just for your personal gain

This goes out to all the zeros, to my personal heros
All the losers and zeros, you're my personal heroes,
This goes out to all the zeros

You never do no wrong, you never hurt no one
You always tell yourself, the best is yet to come
No matter how things look, How bad it all may seem
You always stand your ground, and live by your means

you work your hands to the bone, but you don't complain
You never push up front, just for your personal gain

[Chorus]

We're all heros, we're all zeros.......

[Chorus]

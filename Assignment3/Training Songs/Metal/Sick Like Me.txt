Is it sick of me to need control of you
Is it sick to make you beg the way I do
Is it sick of me to want you crawling on your knees
Is it sick to say I want you biting down on me

Are you sick like me

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at your ugliest I always say

You're beautiful and sick like me

Is it sick of me to feed the animal in you
Is it sick to say I tease the hunter like I do
Is it sick of me to watch the wicked way you thrill
Is it sick to say I live to break your will

Are you sick like me

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at your ugliest I always say

You're beautiful and sick like me

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
Am I beautiful
Even at your ugliest I always say

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces
You're beautiful
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful and sick like me

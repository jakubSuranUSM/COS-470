Slaughtering one another
Getting their deserved death
Driven by their blind belief
Killing in the name of God

Watch their fall!

In desperate they are dying.
Searching for ethereal life
Self-destructive martyrs
Satisfying their"holy God"

Watch their fall!

Countless ages passing by
They're still preaching stupid lies
Telling us that we're all sinners
while they're killing in the name of God!

Show no mercy!
They're gonna die!
Show no mercy!
No one's ever gonna save their souls

Slaughtering one another
Getting their deserved death
Driven by their blind belief
Killing in the name of God

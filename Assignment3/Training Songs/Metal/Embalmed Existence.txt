You walk alone, lost in the world
My mind's a ease, you're dead at birth
My demons rise, from depths of old
They wait to ride on your defeat
Evangelistic torture,
Sinners reclaiming their faith unto you
In time you'll burn in evil,
Your cold heart tormented, torn and abused
Your pain becomes my pleasure
As I lie gaining my power and youth
I'll strike you down with vengeance,
Darkness will rise and destroy what is true
Call to your father in vain
I will then rise and destroy
God has forsaken his son
Demons will rise and devour
Embalmed existence
My time has come, please walk with me
I'll lead you through eternity
Turn on me, and you will die
For I am here, I am alive
Call to your father in vain
I will the rise and destroy
God has forsaken his son
Demons will rise and devour
Embalmed existence

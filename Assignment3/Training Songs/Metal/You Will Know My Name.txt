Their judging eyes watching me
It's all I've ever known
When I try to open up my heart
I am ridiculed and torn apart

Your damn jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good, I'm not evil
Just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

To try and break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies

No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good, I'm not evil
Just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

You will know my name! 

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

You will know my name!

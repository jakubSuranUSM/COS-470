VERSE:
The world's falling down
On our way to the promised land
Have we ever been
To this twilight zone before
We touched the rainbow
We cross the castle of the Kings and Queens
Believing what we see
In the night where even eagles aren't free

PRE-CHORUS:
Mysterious journey
On our way through the gates
Black moon on the horizon
Sailing on through the oceans of time
Will we ever arrive?

CHORUS:
Mystica
We travel trough shadows
Try to hide in the night
Mystica
Surrouned by darkness
We fell into (the) light

VERSE 2:
As the edge of the world's passing by
We saw an angel
Crossing the line on the way down to earth
We cross the hellfire
Magical truth from down below
Paralyzed knights
On the run still not sure which way to go

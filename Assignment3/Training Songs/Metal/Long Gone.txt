Now's the time
See the writing on the wall
Life's a crime
Watch the axes as they fall

Tear the page 
Let them know you've been around
Kick the cage
Turn it upside down

It's gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away
Gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away

Walk your walk 
Choose a path walked by the few
Save the talk 
Show your point of view

It's gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away
Gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away
Nothing you can do 
Nothing anybody else can say
Gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone,gone away

Feet of clay
Never made a man stand tall
Seize the day
Be the writing on the wall 

It's gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away
Gonna be long gone
Gonna be long gone away

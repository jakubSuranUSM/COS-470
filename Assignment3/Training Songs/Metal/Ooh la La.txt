Ooh la la ooh la la la
Ooh la la ooh la la la
Ooh la la ooh la la la

My baby
She gives me lovin' like a good girl shou'd
She always treats me like a sweet thing wou'd
She's got groovy lips that's what she has
My honey she's always happy being by my side
I'm contemplating having her my bride
She's got great big tits that's what she has
Yes when it comes down to lovin' anything goes

And ev'ryone knows it I swear now
For she has a thing about shedding her clothes
It makes her sing out in a strange style she sing

Ooh la la I really love ya baby
Ooh la la say you'll be mine
I love ya I really love ya honey
Ooh la la ooh la la la la

I took her to see my ma an pa and they said
Soon why she's the one ?
Later on
They went to bed and pa said
Don't be late, son
(we won't be long)

Soon we got started to havin' some fun
I kissed her just to keep her quiet
But she started burning and turning it on
And she started causing a riot and she say
And she went

Ooh la la I really love ya baby
Ooh la la say you'll be mine
I love ya I really love ya honey
Ooh la la ooh la la la la.

I heard my parents footsteps 
Coming down the stairs to see what
All the noise was about. 
So I rolled over to the old piano and I
Said "Ma
We've been playing the blues".

My mother gave me a
Knowing glance and she said "Son
Is that how you play it with
Your trousers round your shoes ?"

So they sat with us for a short while just to learn
The words to the song I'd been singing
And then they retired to their rooms with a smile
And now the whole house is a-ringing

Ooh la la I really love ya baby
Ooh la la say you'll be mine
I love ya I really love ya honey
Ooh la la ooh la la la la.

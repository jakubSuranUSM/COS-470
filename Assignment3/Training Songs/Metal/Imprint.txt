You look me straight in the eyes
It's like a reaction felt straight to the heart

makes me feel like I've been alive
Makes me wonder if I got he strength to carry on
Not just to get by

what's with you son?
A fatal vision not the only one
It's like sand in my face
I feel the blood drip in my eyes

it's like a constant picture inside
Never fades, never slips away
It stays imprinted inside

I slipped again, underneath again
Eyes slip back into the head
I see the pictures again
I grit my teeth in my sleep
A shallow imprint, step to the grave
You ain't getting far,
You're a walking stone
You ain't getting very far

where you gonna run
When you're running from yourself
You look up to me
Believe me,
Believe

I'll tear you apart
Cause I ain't one to f*ck with
Someday I'll cut you just like they cut me
So look me straight in the eyes

vengeance and hate runs deep
I'll always know where you sleep

The lies that you sell
They offend me
You’re the killer
And the kisser
Try to not tell
All my secrets
Stop the pressure
Hear the whisper
Watching myself fade away
How long will I live so broken
A fallen friend, no family
How long will I keep failing

Can you tell that I’m hurt
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind 

Regret as I fall
For that sweet burn
You’re the killer
And the kisser
Inject as I crawl
To my master
Stop the pressure
Hear the whisper
Watching myself fade away
How long will I live so broken
A fallen friend, no family
How long will I keep failing

Can you tell that I’m hurt
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind 

Time missed
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All the time that I have missed
Time, stress
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All the time wasted in stress
Time missed
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All of it
Time, stress
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All of it 

Can you tell that I’m hurt
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind 

I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals

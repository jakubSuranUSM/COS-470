It was a Monday morning, when the blues came falling on me
It was a Monday morning, when the blues came falling on me
Now it's Saturday evening, and still got a hold on me

It was a Monday morning, when my baby left me
It was a Monday morning, when my baby left me
Now she's walking down the street, and stopping every man she meets

Now I'm sitting at the table, with a breakfast made for two
Sitting at the table, with a breakfast made for two
Oh please, dear Lord, help me get rid of my self destruction blues

Falling so hard for you woman, would you say that love's a crime
Jury can call me inguilty, but I want what's mine
And now I'm crying out in anger, the night has taken you away
Filin' the sins of another can lock you away
And you can knock on any door, from now until eternity
And you can keep on lookin' anywhere, you won't find another man like me
If I only had the wings to fly, leave the chains of love below
Take my heart up in the sky, I would never let you go
Cuts like a knife to remember, touch is burnin' skin to skin
The sweat on our bodies steamin' the love that I'm in
And you can knock on any door, from now until eternity
And you can keep on lookin' anywhere, you won't find another man like me
Chorus:
If I only had the wings to fly, leave the chains of love below
Take my heart up in the sky, I would never let you go
If I could hear the thunder in your heart, I know my love would light the sky
I could do anything if I had the wings to fly
(Solo)
Reach out your hand to me baby, I got the faith to lead the way
Give me your all and nothing and drive me away
Chorus
If I only had the wings, I'd fly back to your side
Make you my own, never never let you go
If I could only hear your heart, the thunder's in the sky
If I had the wings to fly

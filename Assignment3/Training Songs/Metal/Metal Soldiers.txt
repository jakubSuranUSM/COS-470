We climb aboard the eagle made of steel
Get ready for another flight
Another town, another city will appear
Through the darkness of the night

A flash of light
There's thunder on the way
The stage ignites when we play metal soldiers

And we're marching through the night
Metal Soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might

Out on the road, the battle has begun
And we plan our strategy
Cross fields of fire beneath the burning sun
Onward to our victory
A flash of light
There's thunder on the way
The stage ignites when we play...metal soldiers

And we're marching through the night
Metal Soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might

It's in our hearts, and deep within our bones
A passion no one can deny
Get on your feet, lord you know you're not alone
Let me hear your battlecry
A flash of light
There's thunder on the way
The stage ignites when we play...metal soldiers

And we're marching through the night
Metal Soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might
Can you feel it ?
Metal Soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might...metal soldiers
And we're marching through the night
Metal soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might
See ya real soon

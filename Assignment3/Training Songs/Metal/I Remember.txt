Through the mists of eternity
I have found you again
The passion in your eyes brought back the memories
Of the daybreak of our time
I had never lost my hope
Longing makes me crazy
I missed you really so much that I almost despaired

Previous times gave us a clue
To find a pact for our love
Now we're not separate anymore
That's what I always wished before

[Chorus]
I remember that first time
Green emerald eyes and the sweetest smile
You are the color of my life
I pray I'll never lose you again
Until my final end

We found our way through
Green fields in summer days
And along stony paths in winter's cold
When the shadows are closing in
I showed you how to fly
No one can trim our wings
Or the angels will forever cry

And when you whisper my name
I wish you would never stop
There's no money in the world
That can buy me your precious love

"I've heard voices in my dream. 
Made me stand up, helped me see. Aaah... Oohhh... 
Visions called him to awake his mind, 
to find his horizon 
and find out what may be behind. 

[vision:] "Take what you need, 
you can find in the back of your soul! 
Wake up the king in yourself 
to be mighty and bold!" 

Seasons of doubt, 
fear and silent desires of life have gone by. 
Visions have called back my longing 
for freedom tonight. Made me sigh... 
Wasting my life till the day 
that the voice has appeared... Made me see: 
I am the one that can make it 
through times of despair; I am free!" 

They built up a symbol of warning 
to give me fear, 
to keep me away from paradise 
although it's so near, 
expecting I don't take a look 
at what is behind: Freedom calling... 

Take a look at the open gate! 
Walk on and don't be afraid! 
Free your mind in what they call 
it's the heart of temptation! 

...oh... Go the way! 

Take a look at the open gate! 
Walk on and don't be afraid! 
Free your mind in what they call 
it's the heart of temptation! 

Night after night 
I remembered the word of the priest: 
"Thou shalt not! Never give in to the promises made by the beast, 
so help me god! 
Never give in to temptation or you'll burn in hell a long, long time! 
Forever-eternal-salvation is 
what I can sell if you stay blind!!!" 

But I want to know what lies behind the gate of their hell. 
And I won't believe all the stories that 
they always tell. I got the mind to find out what is right and what's wrong. 
Freedom calling... 

Queen of mine I long for you. 
Tell me why to wait to find our joy! 
It's your wait for heaven's door, 
your fear that makes them grow 
and let you forget today. 

I'll never go and I'll stay on your side. 
They'll never know what I give to you 
is a piece of paradise. 

Heaven can wait! NOW I'm living! 
Heaven can wait forevermore. 
Heaven can wait! 
I am to live like I want to also before I'll die. 
Heaven can wait! You can't thrill me! 
Heaven can wait, we dance till we die! 
Heaven can wait! Welcome to the 
THEATER OF SALVATION 

"Hallelujah, hallelujah!" 
I hear the man in black, his 
"Hallelujah, hallelujah!" 
He tries to keep me back. No! 
"Hallelujah, hallelujah!" 
Lock up the gates to wisdom 
Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
Too late! I've found the kingdom... 

Hallelujah, hallelujah! 
I see a band of angels. 
Hallelujah, hallelujah! 
Freedom calling... 
Hallelujah, hallelujah! 
I do not fear the stories. 
Hallelujah, hallelujah! 
Freedom calling me... 

Don't you see it? Don't you feel it? 
Freedom calling... 

(...and the vision finally added: "Go and find the answers in yourself; 
and always remember: 'You're already living.' 
Don't let them scare you on your quest for answers and for salvation -
for real salvation...)

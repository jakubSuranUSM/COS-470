You watch what I say,
(Watch what I Say),
Watch what I do.
Because I really don't care,
I really don't care,
I know you're trying to get somewhere.
You watch what you say,
(Watch what I do),
I'm gonna get on you.
I really don't care,
I really don't care,
You're never gonna go nowhere.

[Chorus]

(I Get Wet)
I Get Wet when the party is dying
I Get Wet without even trying.
I Get Wet [x8]
I Get Wet whenever you trying
I Get Wet when I know that you're dying.
I Get Wet [x8]

You're making wars,
You're breaking doors,
And now you're on the floor.
I really don't care,
I really don't care.
I know you're tryin' to get somewhere.
You watch what I say,
(Watch what I say),
Watch what I do.
Because I really don't care,
I really don't care,
You're never gonna go nowhere.

[Chorus]
(I Get Wet),
I Get Wet when the party is dying
I Get Wet without even trying.
I Get Wet [x8]
I Get Wet when I know that your dying
I Get Wet without even trying
I Get Wet [x8]

I Get Wet when I know that you're dying,
(I Get Wet).
I Get Wet without even trying.
I Get Wet [x9]
I Get Wet whenever you're trying,
(I Get Wet).
I Get Wet when I know that you're Dying.
I Get Wet [x8]

I Get Wet when I know that you're dying,
(I Get Wet).
I Get Wet without even trying.
I Get Wet [x9]
I Get Wet whenever you're trying,
(I Get Wet).
I Get Wet I know that you're Dying.
I Get Wet [x8]

I Get Wet when i'm not even startin'.
I Get Wet without even trying.
I Get Wet [x8]
I Get Wet whenever you try it.
I Get Wet when I know that you're dying.
I Get Wet [x8]

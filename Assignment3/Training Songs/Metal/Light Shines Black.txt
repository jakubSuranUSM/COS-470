At the side of the world 
I watch your painless face
It's a veil that covers all 
The falsehood that you carry 
It is true, 
It is true 
That I've never been here before
Now, that's a lie, 
That's a lie 
That has been used before 
All the shining light
they've hidden away inside
All the dying light
the light shines black inside 
At side of the world 
I watch the painless ones
I am an insect 
Waiting to be devoured
It is true, 
It is true 
That I never wrote 
These words before
Now, that's a lie 
That we reuse 
Everytime we are alone 
All the shining light
They've hidden away inside
All the dying light
The light shines black inside

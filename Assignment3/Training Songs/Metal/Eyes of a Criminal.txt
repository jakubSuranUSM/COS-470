This rage has overcome
No more will I shun 
These thoughts I've had
This lie I've lived 
I let them put the blame on me 
Engulfed in hate 
Retaliate 
You can't conceal these thoughts 
You can't disguise this rage 

You have 
Overstepped 
Your boundaries 
Now I've got 

I've got your back against the wall 
Forever trapped 
Staring through the eyes of a criminal 

A broken home 
Left alone 
An excuse you used 
Don't bullshit me 
Save all the breath that you can breathe 
Engulfed in flames 
Incinerate 
You can't conceal my thoughts 
And you can't disguise my hate 

Staring through my eyes

I wish you well, hope you understand
If I could only tell (if I could only tell)
Choice you have to make
A beggar or the throne
But please don't

Touch the flame that burns inside
It will keep you safe and alive
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Who am I, ever to judge you
Repeat the fears (repeat the fears)
Can you feel it feel it on your skin
But please don't

Touch the flame that burns inside
It will keep you safe and alive
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Touch the flame that burns inside
It will keep you safe and alive
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Open up your soul and let love in
But please don't touch the flame

Touch the flame that burns inside
It will keep you safe and alive
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Touch the flame that burns inside
It will keep you safe and alive
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Touch the flame that burns inside
(Don't touch the flame)
It will keep you safe and alive
(Don't touch the flame)
This empty memory lane
Is filled with the touch of a flame

Don't touch the flame
Don't touch the flame

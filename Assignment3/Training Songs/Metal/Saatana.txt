Leather and bullet belts
Spikes, blades and chains
Sinister black metallers
It's time for feast tonight

Vomit, blood and semen
Headbanging metal men
Gloomy, dark and dim
Ready for the sin

Spirit and the breath from hell
Smoke and chants released from hades
Tolling of the doom bell
Christian slaves, sacrifices

The brave and the strong
Filled with fury
The bold and powerful
Filled with rage

Wearing inverted crucifixes
Wearing inverted pentagrams
Tattooed marks of the beast
Six hundred and sixty six

Saatana, saatana, saatana
Headbanging for saatana
Saatana, saatana, saatana
Hails raising for saatana

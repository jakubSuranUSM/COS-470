Made of flesh, to suffer
Sacred scars, uncover
I become the tortured one
In my wounds discover
Endless pain, forever
I become the bleeding one

Made of flesh
Forged in blood
Raised in fear and torn apart
Still alive soon to die
Till will come to say goodbye

Blessed in hell, forgotten
Souls dispelled, unbroken
I belong where death is strong
Destiny is calling
Set me free, no mourning
Silent wings of death and fear will swing

I feel
Pleasures of death
In war against myself
No life
Remains in my flesh
Rest in hollow graves

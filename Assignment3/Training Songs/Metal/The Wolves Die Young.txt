Weather's getting colder
Winter claims the land
It is said the Queen is dressed in
The warmest gown in the whole land

They say it is a wonder
her dress is made of thunder
The wolves, who cannot see it
Will one day dethrone the Queen, oh yeah!

The citizens all cower
the beauty of the power
Makes them see a flower bloom
In the winter wonderland

The walls keep getting closer
Breath fear in your cage
For the Queen will hear today
The reason in the rhymes children play

"The Queen is naked and no-one sees her amber eyes!"
Now the innocent kneel down
And ask forgiveness for their lies
The court, the meek
Will obey the tyrant Queen
"Bring us their heads for"

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run"

Mutiny is rising 
against the wall of fear
Mirror, mirror of the fall 
sees her final spiraling downfall

"The Queen is naked and no-one sees her amber eyes!"
Now the innocent kneel down 
Ask forgiveness for their lies
The court, the meek
Will obey the tyrant Queen

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

Find out where those children have run
Find out where those children have run

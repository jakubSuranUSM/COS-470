Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
Last man to the bottom
I consider myself free

Run run run outside
Keep your head uncovered
Get that kid outside
Are you out of your mind?
You're free!

Watch your mouth
And watch your television
If something don't look right
Dial 1 800 YOU'RE FREE

Free
You're Free

Run run run outside
Get your hair colored
Hang that thing outside
Are you out of your mind?
You're free!

Watch the sky
And yell at television
If something don't look right
Dial 1 800 YOU'RE FREE

Free
You're Free

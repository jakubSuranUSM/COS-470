What's Wrong
Don't you sing no ding dong
Pushing out the phony
Hook in up the rain away

[Chorus]
Motion 
Can't you feel the motion
You can see right through me
We can etch a part of me

Take this 
Break the ryme and make this
Get up on it Oh Yeah
Close your eyes and fly away

[Chorus]

Get up on this wisconsin death trip [Repeat: x4]

What's Wrong
Don't you sing no ding dong
Pushing out the phony
Hook in up the rain away

[Chorus]

Get up on this wisconsin death trip [Repeat: x8]

Take me 
Yeah you ride and make me
Feel the inside Oh Yeah
You can have me anyway

[Chorus]

Get this Wisconsin Death Trip

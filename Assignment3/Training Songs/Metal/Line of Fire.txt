Muddy water running through your veins
Unlock the secret it's high time
To break theses chains
Try leapin' once before you look
Instead of tryin' to find
Your way off the hook
You never learn
Until you touch the wire
And When you do
Ice and Fire
Next time you're cheatin'
Don't forget to look
Cause you've seen the movie
But I wrote the book
When it comes down to the wire
Will you step into the line of fire
When passion rules desire
You gotta' step into the line of fire
Weak ones run for cover
Tough ones take the licks
Play both sides of the middle baby
That's how you get your kicks
Do you think that you'll be able
When it comes down to crunch
Will ya' lay your cards on the table
Are ya' tough enough to take the punch
You never learn
Until you touch the wire
And When you do
Ice and Fire
Next time you're cheatin'
Don't forget to look
Cause you've seen the movie
But I wrote the book
When it comes down to the wire
Will you step into the line of fire
When passion rules desire
You gotta' step into the line of fire
When it comes down to the wire
Will you step into the line of fire
When passion rules desire
Step into the line of fire
And when it comes down to the wire
Will you step into the line of fire
When passion rules desire
You gotta' step into the line of fire

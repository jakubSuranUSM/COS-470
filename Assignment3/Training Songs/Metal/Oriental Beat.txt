I'm gonna take a holiday, 
Be somewhere far away, 
I won't be back for awhile
For a long long time, 
I wanna get away from the west
To the place that I like best, 
And where the nights are long
And the girls are pretty

I'm goin' to rock till I drop, 
Around the clock, 
And never ever gonna stop
Gonna send you a postcard from Hanoi, 
I won't be comin' back
So beware, my baby, 
(Well) I am ten thousand miles away

The Chinese girls make me happy, 
Its enough if I tell 'em
I'm not from the U.S.A., 
And they believe every word I say
Hanoi rocks every morning, 
At night I'll fall asleep
To the smell of romance, 
As I see my geisha girl dance

Round and round the world goes around, 
I used to believe I was such a happy guy
Now I've found my place on earth, 
Leavin for Europe just can't be worth
Baby, baby, won't you take my hand, 
To aikido garden
Well you understand, 
Propaganda surrounds us
But never mind what they say,
I ain't goin' back home, 
I ain't goin' back home

Chinese guys make me happy, 
But its enough if I tell 'em
I'm not from the U.S.A., 
And they believe every word I say

There is no holiday, 
'Cause holiday is every day
And let me tell you the truth, 
If I leave I'd be a fool

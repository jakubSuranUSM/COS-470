You live it good girl
And baby you live it high
You reach it easily, makes me wanna cry
You look so fine girl
I suppose you always do
So fine and so sweet
It's good to look at you

Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeah

You and the fashion
Baby you're as one
It's not long before - it's much more than fun
Yes it's taking chances, but they don't want to know
And since your fine baby left you
Don't know which way to go

Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeah

You live it good girl
And baby you live it high
You reach it easily, makes me wanna cry
You take it good girl
I don't know who will bring you down
Who will bring you down

Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeah

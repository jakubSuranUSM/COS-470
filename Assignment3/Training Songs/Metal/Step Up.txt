1, 2, 3 - Go! 

Broken, 
Yeah, you've been living on 
The edge of a broken dream 
Nothing, 
Yeah, that's the only thing 
You'll ever take away from me 

I'm never gonna stop, 
I'm never gonna drop, 
Ain't no different 
Than it was before 

So take some good advice, 
You better stop and think twice, 
Before you take your first step, 
Out that door 

If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down) 
If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down 

You had your chance to walk away 
Live to see another day 

If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down). 
You're gonna get knocked down... 

Aaah... 

Suffering, 
Yeah, that's the only thing here 
That's left for you 
Nothing, 
Yeah, that's the only thing 
You're ever gonna - do 

I'm never gonna stop, 
I'm never gonna drop, 
Ain't no different 
Than it was before 

So take some good advice, 
You better stop and think twice, 
Before you take your first step, 
Out that door 

So if you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down). 
If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down 

You had your chance to walk away 
Live to see another day 

If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down). 
You're gonna get knocked down... 

You're gonna get knocked down... 

And now you've crossed that line... 
You must be out your mind 

Go 

If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down (knocked down). 
If you want to step up (step up), 
You're gonna get knocked down 

You had your chance to walk away

Walking through the mists again
Avalon, seem caught forever
I don't know where I belong
Holding on and waiting

Eternity, a lonely grave
From the haze of time I'm calling
Is our journey to begin
Or am I only dreaming

In a land far away from here
Like a star that's blinding
Heaven's magic silently appeared
And I'm leaving for the dawn

Is it true that I must sleep
Forevermore, just watching changes
Heaven knows the story is not over
And the knights will gather

Out in the cold, so long forgotten
Leaving the past behind
So timeless we're here, and we shall reappear
To find god

From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
From Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So rise from avalon

Now has come the point of no return
And I'm feeling fire, fill my veins
The torches start to burn
And the quest is starting

It's up to you to be forgotten
Saddle the horses now
The mindless shall fear when we all reappear
To rise up

From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
Rise from Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So rise from avalon

Thirteen Knights to reappear
Merlin can you, can you hear?
Can you see the past and the tomorrow

Tell me can we now succeed
Find the grail and turn the key
Find a better future for us all

Ride on out and make the world
Brighter than a shiny pearl
For all

Heaven knows I wait for thee
Give my love eternally
I'm calling, calling for you on an island in the sun
Only wait for things to come
Never think about tomorrow
Building castles in the sand
Wait for you to take my hand
Without fear and without sorrow

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 

From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
From Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So rise Avalon

In the morning sun
Our journey has begun
Don't close your eyes and turn away

Put and end to all the grief
To the pain from the make-believe
Don't close your eyes and turn away

In the land of the unbeliever
Tear the mask of the mass deceiver
Don't close your eyes and turn away

In the rays of the morning sun
Our journey has begun
Don't close your eyes and turn away

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh

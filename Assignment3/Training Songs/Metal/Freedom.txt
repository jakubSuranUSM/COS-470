Taking my freedom
Now I can feel it
I'm getting closer to breathing
I can repeat it over and over
In my head

Oh, I feel every air
It is clear
I'm not scared

I take my feeling
And I feel it
I'm getting closer to the medicine
Over and over
I can repeat it in my brain

Oh, I feel every air
It is clear
I'm not scared
Now I see everywhere
It is clear
I'm not scared

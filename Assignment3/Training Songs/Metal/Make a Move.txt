So are we lost or do we know 
Which direction we should go 
Sit around and wait for someone to take our hands and lead the way 

'Cause every day we're getting older 
And every day we all get colder 
We're sick of waiting for our awnsers 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for ourselves 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move 

Are we meant to take the pain 
Should we sit around and wait 
All we need is to say all the words that 
I never liked, you like to make us hate (???) 

'Cause every day we're getting older 
And every day we all get colder 
We're sick of waiting for our awnsers 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for ourselves 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
And we will never lose 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
It's time to make a move 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
And we will never lose 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
it's time to make a... move! 

It's not enough 
To let it ?
Where'd it go ?
It's all wrong 

So sick of waiting for our answers... 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for ourselves 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move 

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for ourselves 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move (move, move, move, move).

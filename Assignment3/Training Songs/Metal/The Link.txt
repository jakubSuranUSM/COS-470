He who learns must suffer
I want to protect myself let others
Dream, I run to a better place
Hell, illusions, see
This state of me unconscious
Cannot
Want to undertake to feel my soul
I want to build some fire
Burn myself
I decide what I see

Call my name, I'll be there for you

Wrong and right
I want to create things
Beyond, insight
Life
I want to build some fire
Run to myself, dive

Find a link between wrong and right
Understand, you create what you are
Be the link, you are what you create

And now comes fire
Left and right connected
Call my name I'll be there
I am there for you now
Understand, you create what you are

See a thousand bodies crackin 'n' fallin' back,
Rows of loaded weapon ready to attack.
Sharp pain screams like hell in a victim's eyes.
Want to say to everyone, promises were lies

And here we go again, back to back,
Round and round,
And here we go again, back to back,
One shot, buddy, and you're hitting the ground

Land of broken hearts.

One more shot and another friend's gone.
Land of broken hearts,
Pray to your god, 'cause the killing's begun.

See a million faces, can you let it go?
Try to stop this bloody rain paintin' on the snow.
Blood, death, all around, livin' on the edge,
Look smashed flesh 
And bones prayin' for revenge.

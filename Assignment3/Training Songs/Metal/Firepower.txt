With weapons drawn we claim the future
And then seep out through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk to dawn

Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower

The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our unions rise so go to hell

Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives of danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser and lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace

We fight this firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise

You know I thought you were so naive
But you were runnin' again on me
Cuz baby I saw through your lies, lies, lies

When I had the world in the palm of my hand
You never looked at another man
But when I started to slip, you said bye, bye, bye

Time has made you just a memory
Now I'm winnin' so baby either see
You're runnin' back to me

You better keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Don't stop runnin' (don't stop runnin')
keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Cuz you can't catch me
You better keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Don't stop runnin' (don't stop runnin')
keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
OH yeah

Well you heard I got my big break
So now you're sayin' that you made a mistake
And you wanna come back for the ride, ride, ride

Well the word is out all over town
You're not the only girl that's chasin' me down
Take your place at the end of the line, line, line

Used to love you, but you set me free
Table's turnin' now you're beggin' me
Oh baby can't you see

You gotta keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Don't stop runnin' (don't stop runnin')
Keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Oh, you can't catch me
You better keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Don't stop runnin' (don't stop runnin')
Keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Oh, yeah

If you wanna get next to me (don't stop runnin')
If you wanna be in extacy (don't stop runnin')
If you want it like it used to be (keep on runnin')
So you want another chance with me, Haha (don't stop runnin')

Ooooh yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

You better keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')
Don't stop runnin' (don't stop runnin')
Keep on runnin' (keep on runnin')

If you wanna get next to me (keep on runnin')
If you wanna be in extacy (don't stop runnin')
If you want it like it used to be (keep on runnin')
Keep on runnin'
So you want another chance with me (keep on runnin')
Oh baby you're just a memory (don't stop runnin')
Cuz you'll never catch up with me (keep on runnin')
Keep on runnin'
Oh yeah
Keep on runnin'
Don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin'

How can you believe the lies bestowed upon you by a false creed when the truth is right in front of you?
They consume and hide the real truth to a superstitious fear and stitch the mouth of all who interfere
You look into the world with blind eyes, always fearful of your demise
But you people don't seem to realize is that you're fearing a fucking myth
A tale that you comply with or be condemned to torment
Your loving idol would conflict woe and pain?
I won't be deceived by serpent lies or cry out to the sky
This goes out to all of those who've ever feared to really live because of all the sin and blasphemy
Pursue what you really want and don't let anything stop you no matter what get what you want.
Nothing bad will ever come from getting what you desire
Forget the ruler no one will ever find out
Living your life this way will only bring great satisfaction so take it all and give nothing
Or are these the words of a snake?
Now it's gone and you will feel the pain of life
You were blinded by your greedy mind and now it's time
This is now your new reality hope you enjoy the choices of your mortality
You will then feel what its' like to bleed
You will feel the pain everday
Every ounce of blood you spill is real
No more tree of life and it's all your fault
Desolation of Eden begins.

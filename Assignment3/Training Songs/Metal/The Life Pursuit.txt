What do you do when hope is all but gone?
You need a brother to lean on
But your brother's gone
Your sister's in the wrong part of town
I took a walk to remember ecstasy
It's not today, not even yesterday

Songs of praise all very well 
Their voices swell
They tug at sadness
Like love tugging at your sleeve
Is it worth the pain
To walk into the void again?
In your darkest hour he is the tiniest light

Light that's found beyond your present situation
And it's wide and it's broad, beyond all estimation

Is your belly fat, is your man a twat? 
Do in-growing hairs provide you with strange fascination?
The highlight of your day is plucking all the roots away
You took a walk to remember ecstasy
It's not today, not even yesterday

In your darkest hour he is the tiniest light
The smallest of sparks
He's a tinderbox, he's a flaming torch
Pinch your self quite hard, in a place that hurts
If it doesn't work, ask your friend to comply
And if they hit the spot
You can let yourself cry
And when the teardrops stop, I will take you for a drive
I'll explain all I know about the spiritual side

Life that's found beyond your present situation
And it's wide and it's broad, beyond all estimation

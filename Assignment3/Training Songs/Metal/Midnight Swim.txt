The sun will set tonight
The sun will set

It's a midnight swim
Where it is late and the air is all clear
And I remember that evenin', you on the floor
I was attached to the ceiling

Look behind the glass in your mouth
These words I am due for

The sun will set tonight
Under the lonely dreamers
(Lonely dreamers)
Only to rise again
So we can start it over
(We'll start it again)

And you were right
When you whispered in my ear
And it all became so clear
It's gonna be alright
(Alright)
Everything will be alright
Even if, even if the city ignites

Look behind the glass in your mouth
These words I am due for

The sun will set tonight
Under the lonely dreamers
(Lonely dreamers)
Only to rise again
So we can start it over
(We'll start it again)

Now to get back to
The home where there's windows
As large as the city below
Now to get back to
The home where there's windows
As large as the city below

Bring me down to the safe
Unlock all the pain, until then

The sun will set tonight
Under the lonely dreamers
(Lonely dreamers)
Only to rise again
So we can start it over
We'll start it again

So we can start it over
We'll start it again
So we can start it over
We'll start it again
The sun will set tonight

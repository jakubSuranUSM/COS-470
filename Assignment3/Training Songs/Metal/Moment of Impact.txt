Falling from the sky and I have lost all track of time
Every image of my life flashes before my eyes
Floating deep precise time of eye of my demise
My said prayers of circumstance
Have recently expired

I pray in spite
My soul my life

Straining every muscle for my contact with fate
I could never dream my life would end this way
Cross my heart and hope to die
Fade to the black
Brace myself the time is now
The moment of impact

I pray in spite
My soul my life

My cross (I pray)
Will Hide (in spite)
I pray (my cross)
In spite
My fears of impending doom that I'm about to die

Brace for the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact
Brace for the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact

I can hardly breathe
I can hardly breathe
Cause I am choking on this deadly scream

Brace for the shock
The trauma
Brace myself for the impact

Sitting here another night
In television view
Seems like that's my only friend
When I'm away from you

Yeah, we had another fight
About the other flame
Now you claim the candle died
But I say it's the same

You say I'm the only one
Now that just suits me fine
You better treat me good
'Cause I'm forgiving you this time

[Chorus]
I'm sleeping all alone
Tell me you're coming home
I'm sleeping all alone - tonight

If I had a half a mind
I'd kick you out the door
And if I were an other guy
I'd even up the score

But you see I love you
And a body has a will
So please don't knock me in the heart
I hope you had your thrill

You know that you made mistakes
And me I made some too
So hurry home and ask me
If I'm - television blue

[Chorus]

I felt strong enough
To play a tough man's game
Quit chasing after love
That never'll be the same - with you

See if you got your second chance
And that's all that you get
Some guys wouldn't give you that
You better watch your stand

[Chorus]

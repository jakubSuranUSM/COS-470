Wanted love to find me
Easy love no chains to bind me
Life on the run so cold

The look in your eyes gets brighter
Summer night a cool inviter
Close to the edge, I feel like letting go

Tonight I'm falling for you
Tonight my love is for you
I'll be the light that guides you
Tonight my love is all for you

See the warm reflection
Your's the water mine's direction
A river so deep to die
Walking the streets in silence

No need for words
To bring misguidance
So much to say
So much to give away

Tonight I'm falling for you
Tonight my love is for you
I'll be the light that guides you
Tonight my love is all for you

Oh, starry eyes get brighter
Summer night a cool inviter
So much to say
So much to give away

Tonight I'm falling for you, tonight
Tonight my love is for you
I'll be the light that guides you
Tonight my love is all for you

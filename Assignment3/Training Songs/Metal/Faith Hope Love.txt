weve all seen the evil of this world
and we feel so helpless with all the lies
everyone believes somewhere theres love
darkness is just a speck in the light
bad luck we hide it oh so well
just enough to tell you
i cant see my eyes are blind
if i look then surely i will find
if i learn my lessons when im older ill be wise
we are children trapped in time
we are strong
you see the word beings no lies
i believe it has a name
i believe he is alive
listen to me very closely
there is more heaven than hell
faith hope love

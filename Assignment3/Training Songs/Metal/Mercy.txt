Have mercy
Have mercy baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

Well I went to see a gypsy
And had my fortune read
She said Don, your baby's gonna leave you
Her back is packed up under the bed
And I cry

Have mercy
Have mercy baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

I say, if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
Well I'm a goin' to the nearest river, child
And jump from above to the ground
Don't leave me

Have mercy
Have mercy baby
Mercy yeah
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

Well hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you tryin' to do, huh?
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through

I said if you stay, baby
I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work to a job seven days a week
And bring my money home to you

Well I say mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy

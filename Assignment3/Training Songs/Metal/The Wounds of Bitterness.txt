An image of a wailing blackbird 
Embedded in my chest 
My heart bleeds the tainted purity 
Of this emptiness 
Heal these wounds of bitterness 
That hurt in me 
Released once again 
The anxiety subjected 
By a devotion 
Dead I am rejected 
What I have kept in my 
Heart so frail and cold 
Vanishes into this 
Nothingness that now unfolds 
Heal these wounds of bitterness 
That hurt in me 
Released

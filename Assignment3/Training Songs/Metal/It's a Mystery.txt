In the middle of the jungle
There are ruins of temples built along ago
Stone by stone
They were made by the Mayas
A tribe that is not so well-known
Each pictures on the wall
Recorded history
They were gazing at the sky
Seeing stars telling them the days
On the year
Monuments marked time
But altars meant death and fear
Worshipping gods now gone long time ago
The population grew, new cities were found

What happened then?
Was it a strange decease that wiped away almost everyone?
Or it might have been starvation caused by drought and
A scorching sun

It's a mystery
The way they disappeared
It's now history
We will never know

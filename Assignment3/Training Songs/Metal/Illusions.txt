Imaginative formations
Taking control of the fears I hide
Intricate creations
Twisting and shaping me from inside
Massive confusion
Constantly veiling my mind's eyes
Into oblivion
Spiraling downward, reaching my demise
Misleading visions
Reflecting figments of what is to be
Forceful delusions
Driving me inward to my mental sea
Optical distortions
Bind me to what I don't know
Repulsive contortions
Blinding me of which way to go
What have I done to reality?
Chaos strangles my sanity
What have I done to reality?
Chaos strangles my sanity
Projected through shadows
Chromatic patterns shift and blur
Dim light shallows
Oppressive darkness becomes obscure
Imprisoned by unreal
Plunged into falseness rapidly
Deceit I feel
Images betray me constantly

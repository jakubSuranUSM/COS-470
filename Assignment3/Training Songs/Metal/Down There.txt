...Oh, hear the thunder
Hear the voices
Hear the noise from hell
Demons, devils, dark spirits
From church horror tales
The hordes of dead roar...
To down there
Where chaos prevails
Down there
Where fallen souls revive
Down there...
Underground
Down there...
Oh, veils of death
A pace from death
The land of demonic fear
Fear is real
That I feel
In this eternal night

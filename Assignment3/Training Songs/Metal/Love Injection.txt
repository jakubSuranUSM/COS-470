I know why you're feeling so sad
I see that tear in your eye
You look, but just can't have it
Well, I know there's a reason why
I said come on baby take a flight
With me
We're gonna travel around the world
Across the seven seas
I'll tell you that its easy
Here's how it goes
I'll tell you something, sister
What you need to do
You've got to move!
Your time is growing short
Well, you kiss
It just blows by
You look but you just can't find him
Well, I know that it's just another night
I said come on baby take chance
On me
You've got to grab on to my belt
If you want to break free
I'll tell you that it's easy
And here's how it goes
I'll tell you something, sister
What you need to know
It's a love injection
That's my kind of drug
A love injection
And I do it for free
Love injection
That's my kind of drug
A love injection
Don't you know what I mean?
You time has finally come
Your doc says he's got your cure
I know that it's just a lie
I know because I've been there before
I said come on sugar
Take you chance on me
Gonna fly around the world
Across the sewer seas
I'll tell you that it's easy
Here's how it goes
I'll tell you something, sugar
What you need to know
It's a love injection
That's my kind of drug
A love injection
And I do it for free
Love injection
That's my kind of drug
A love injection
Don't you know what I mean?
Kiss!
Well, I know why you're feeling
So sad
I see those tears in your eyes
You look, but you just can't have him
I know there's a reason why
I said I feel you heart beat
I feel it pounding, so
I'll tell you something, sister,
What you need to know
You take a little time
You need another shot
You need one chance
You do it like this

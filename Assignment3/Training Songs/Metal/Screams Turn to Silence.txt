I watched the walls collapse
Beneath a hollow shell of lies
Worn paper-thin and stained in black, fell beneath the fading light
The shards that penetrate
The thickest of my skin
I feel the sting it separates, and bleeds my body of its sin

The darkness that grows inside, like a cancer that's feeding
Reflected behind her eyes
As screams turn to silence

The sound is deafening
The hollow voices of regret
Held like the damned under the flames
Burned against the endless night
The pain that suffocates
A prayer escapes my lips
Force fed the lies, I'm choking back the bitter taste of what I am

The darkness that grows inside like a cancer that's feeding
Reflected behind her eyes
As screams turn to silence

The pain grows to consume me
Counting the scars left in its wake
The endless torment of silence
Crashing down it separates

That darkness that grows inside like a cancer that's feeding
Reflected behind her eyes
As screams turn to silence

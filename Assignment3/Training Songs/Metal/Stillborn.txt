My thoughts my mind's trapped behind
An inescapable wall of depression
Try to face it one to one,eye to eye
Accepting no lies
Cannot break my boundaries
Forever held in a grasp of despair
My thoughts all die
Before they are born
Expression of my mind suffers
Tormented under mental chains
Only alive to serve others
Caring nothing of my own pain
Stillborn
Stillborn,reeling of my mind
Fighting everything
No hope of ever being heard
To set it free
Just live to suffer
Trapped inside these fleshened wall
So many live,how many perish ?
Will never achieve its goal
Stillborn
I am dead before I am alive
Open wide and be force fed
Pitiful way of existence
What they instill into your head
Insight silenced before it escapes
Life left to rot in hell
Blinded by falsified hope
Succumb to your mental shell
I am stillborn

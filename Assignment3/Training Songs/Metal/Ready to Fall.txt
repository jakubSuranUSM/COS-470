Holy child
See what we've come to today
We defile
All things that get in our way

Now we're ready to fall, ready to fall
Ready to fall, ready to fall

So much pain gaze through the eyes of the poor
World's insane
Sorrow is at every door

(REPEAT CHORUS 2X)

Well I think I'm going crazy
Now I must be going mad
Been crawling in this stinking shit
My world is filled with bad
And I stumble and fall and I'm sinking down
And I'm clawing and starting to drown
I see pain and death and lies and hate
In every street and town

Holy child 
There's nothing that you can do
Prince of liars
Look how he's laughing at you

(REPEAT CHORUS 2X)

World is changing every day
World is changing every moment
But some little things remain the same
They hurt my mind, a real pain!

Look around what you see
Only hate and misery
This world, a poisoned ball
We destroy ourself, so we fall!

We have to give our best
But who is changing all the rest
We're jumping the world into a better world
Your help we need today,
Forget what you did your mother say
We're jumping the world into a better world
No standing still, madness we kill
We're jumping the world into a better world
All is prepared
We're starting nor the world music show
We're jumping the world into a better world

So come on jump

We have to give our best
But who is changing all the rest
We're jumping the world into a better world
Your help we need today,
Forget what you did your mother say
We're jumping the world into a better world

World is changing every day
World is changing every moment
But some little things remain the same
They hurt my mind, a real pain!

Look around what you see
Only hate and misery
This world, a poisoned ball
The salvation, today we're gonna jump!

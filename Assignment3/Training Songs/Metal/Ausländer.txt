In a new place, in a strange land
An undone new world, not a part of the plan
Hatred and fear is the language I know
Out of my home, out of control

Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?
Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?

How much more do you think I can take?
I yield to your smile, a victims mistake
I don't want your life, Ive got my own needs
A life of my own, a chance to be free

Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?
Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?

Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?
Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?
Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?
Everything that I want, isn't it everything that you've got?

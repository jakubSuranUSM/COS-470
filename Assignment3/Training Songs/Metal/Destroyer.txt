Take it down with a steam hammer
Pack it hard
Lead shot in your mood shooter
Choose your poison
Have a drink with your painkiller
Take us down

Wreck a party like it don't matter
Smash it up
Dead guitar
Broken beat maker
If I could I'd trade it all for an automator
Here it comes

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Cosmo sucker
Bad breath crier
Bad timing robo-crap
You're a great liar
Overdrive
Deep dirt on your shit highway
Black-eyed

Fuzzy filter
Hollow head wobble
Take a trip
Get a grip before you get in trouble
And you wonder why you're called the
Destroyer-stroyer

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
It's coming back again

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
It's coming back again

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
It's coming back again

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Take it down with a steam hammer
Pack it hard
Lead shot in your mood shooter
Choose your poison
Have a drink with your painkiller
Take us down

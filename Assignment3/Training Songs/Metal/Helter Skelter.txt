When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
I get to the top and I go for a ride
I get to the bottom and I see you again
I see you again
Do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Oh tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter

Do you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Oh tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter

Oh yeah, come on turn on the power

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
I get to the top I go for a ride
I get to the bottom and I see you again, I see you again

Do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Oh tell me, come on baby tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Comin' down on you
It's helter skelter

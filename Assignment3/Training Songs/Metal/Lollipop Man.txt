You go to the girl's school
And I go to the boy's school
Both separated by a lollipop man
I must cross the street to
Get around to meet you
Therefore I have to pass a lollipop man

Lollipop man, there's a lollipop man
Who stands in the middle of the street
(Ain't he sweet)
There's a lollipop man, yeah a lollipop man
Hey, good golly there's a lollipop man

He carries out his duty
Isn't he a cutie
There in the middle with his lollipop pole
Opposite the high school
Right in front of my school
He's so incredible
He's really got soul

Lollipop man, lollipop man
Lollipop man, lollipop man
He won't let the traffic come between us
We can be together very soon
But he will make the traffic stop
With his giant lollipop
Looking just a little like a moon man

In a yellow rain coat
And a pair of gum boots
There in the midst of an incredible jam
Any kind of weather
Bringing us together
There stands a funny little lollipop man

Lollipop man, there's a lollipop man
Who stands in the middle of the street
(Ain't he sweet)
A lollipop man, there's a lollipop man
Hey, good golly there's a lollipop man

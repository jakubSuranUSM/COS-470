Live to rock

When I was a boy I didn?t know what I should do They said get an education you got to forget about the blues But I was hooked on rock and roll I got a demon in my soul I was waiting for the day when I could break away
You gotta live to rock never stop live to rock you gotta blow your top 
I could have been a soldier I could have been a lawyer I could have been a teacher what about a preacher but I got new foryou I just dig these Rhythm and blues I got one thing to say you got to let the music play
You gotta live to rock never stop live to rock you gotta blow your top
Just follow the rules that?s what they said to me you got to get an education forget about the blues but I was hooked on rock and roll I got a demon in my soul I got one thing to say you got to let the music play
You gotta live to rock never stop live to rock you gotta blow your top

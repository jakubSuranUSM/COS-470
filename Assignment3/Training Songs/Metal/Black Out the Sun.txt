Screamin’ at the sky again
I can’t blame you for this my friend
Believe in fate if it helps you
Through the day

I said wait
Where’s my father
Where’s the one and only martyr
I see heaven needed you way more
More than me

So far
I have to go
The minute I started to run
So far
Why did you black out the sun

Prayin' for another day
My decisions have cost me faith
And all you wanted from me
Was a goodbye

I can’t take this my father
Your my one and only answer
For the selfish man
That I’m sendin' out the door?

So far
I have to go
The minute I started to run
So far
Why did you black out the sun

So far
I have to go
The minute I started to run
So far
Why did you black out the sun

So far
I have to go
The minute I started to run
So far
Why did you black out the sun

(Dancing) I'm having so much love
(Dancing) Too bad my back had gone
(Dancing) Boogie down with daddy now
I'd give my house in the country
If you'd slept; it's so funky

(Music) I'm dancing in the street
(Oh, music) I've torn the shoes from my feet
(Romancing) It's got me dirty and sweet
It's got you reeling and rocking
Won't you let the slender thing in?

(Rolling) I think it's all I can do
(Rolling) Just got me feeling you too
(Rolling) Get a little, take a little
Get a little back
Jumping John, the great goose is gone
Got a lion in my hand
Got a Charlie on my back

(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Oh, get you with me
(Don't get me wrong) ah ha ha ha ha
(I'm only dancing, oh, ho, ho)
(I'm only dancing, oh, ho, ho)

(Dancing) Have you heard the news?
(Dancing) President has got the blues
(Dancing) I tell you, comfortably
If he gives it to you
He'd better take it from me

(Said, sir) I pick up the bones
(Said, sir) Leave the numbers alone
(Said, sir) Get off your telephone
Look the people in the eye
Tell them my, oh, my
Let your backbone slide
Buddy, whistle and cry

(John)
(She turns me on) La, la, la, la
(Don't get me wrong) Hmm, hm, hm
(I'm only dancing, oh, ho)
(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Ah, ha, ha, I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I lost my feel
(Don't get me wrong) I'm off on my way
(I'm only dancing, oh hooo) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing, oh, ho)

(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woh, woh, woh)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woh, woh, woh)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woh, woh, woh)
(Dancing) I'm only (dancing) I'm only (dancing) I'm only (woh, woh, woh)
(Dancing) I'm only (dancing) I'm only (dancing) I'm only (woh, woh, woh)
Can see no care
Lost my fear
Traped, Charlie, dance on

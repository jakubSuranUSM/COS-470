The fire is gone, a time to search and then replace
I'll never know just how the blind can lead the way

They search for faith, it shows the way...it leads the way
The distant smile, banished denial, no more denial

Are you the one who tries to send me to the grave
I cannot know who deals resent who deals the pain

Weak search for faith
A path to take, you tread in vain

In the days when lands were few,
And man sometimes had no chance
But sell his soul to his landlord to make a living
In far and away country,
They gave acres of land away for free,
To all able to claim it
Ships sailed across the great seas,
Fortunes were made and dreams shattered
Sometimes couples were torn apart,
For all they could afford, was one ticket.

Leaving my life behind
My young love and the unborn
Only have a lock of her hair
And burning love inside

After forty work-filled days and sleepless nights,
The sails are lit by the lights of Boston
And here we go
Off the ship! towards the adventure,
The one to define our lives.
Daily grind and a tiny room.

I got here safe, love.
I have an address, until spring, then I shall race for the land,
Hope to hear from you soon

Her letter reads

Please let me know everything's alright
Thinking about you, though you're out of sight
Every night, when I'm turning in, my tears find me.
Please hurry, dear, come back and rescue me

Now that I have made the dollars we need for the dream.
The best horse I've ever seen,
A carriage and everything I need
I will make my way to the great unknown
Every moment I wish you were here with me now

Please let me know everything's alright

No, I'm not a stranger, among the people in here
Yet I have never felt so alone
At high noon the sound will boom,
And I will start racing for the
Land we can call home.

I stuck my
Flag in the ground, screaming 'n shouting,
I've never felt so proud, love!
We are free from eternal serfdom!
I'm gonna bring you home, my light!

Nine, eight, seven, six, counting the days. solo!
Five, four, three, two, together forever! solo!

I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
I am the land and the land is me
Freedom is everything and we are free

I made my way into the great unknown
Land by the river, and a new built home.
Every night, when I'm looking at the full moon rising
I hold you and know that we are free

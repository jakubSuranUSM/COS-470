This is my diary of broken dreams, 
A monument over me, 
Page after page twists my mind with grief

What I should but never did, 
How could I ever be so wrong?
Crucified, Upon an empty sand lass, 
My life is gone, I am none, 
Sentence to mediocrity, 
Sentence by myself

[Chorus]
Forgotten, Forsaken, 
Frustrated when nothing more remains
Forgotten, Forsaken, 
Wasted, I am in vain

I had a life, I had a dream, 
Places to go where I'd never been, 
Visions so brutally ruined, 
Cause I didn't dare to try

[Chorus]

People spend their life 
regretting the things they never did
All those times they turned away 
was yet another dream unfulfilled
What I should, I never did, 
How could I be so wrong? 
How could I be so wrong?
Was I ever right?

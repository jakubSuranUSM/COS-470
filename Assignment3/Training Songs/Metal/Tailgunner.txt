Trace your way back 50 years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah|
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the blood thirst
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

[Chorus: x2]
Climb into the sky never wonder why, tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Nail that fucker kill that son.
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more|
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers (just one big bomb)

[Chorus]

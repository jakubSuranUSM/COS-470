You've got that look in your eye again
It's working overtime
Worried about where I'm gonna spend my life
But it's much too late, it's much too late
Oh it's much too late to start picking fights

You said: Where ya been, where ya been
Where ya going to, where ya going to, where ya going to?
'Cause I'm right here, yeah

Can't it wait, can't it wait, can't it wait
Just a minute now, just a minute now, come on

CHORUS
I need some air to breathe
I need some space, just leave
'Cause I'm colder than ever (colder than ever)
I said I'm colder than ever
I'm empty, empty through and through

Someday they'll see, someday I'll be
Unwanting of somewhere to hide
But for now I'll take shelter
Deep in the back of my mind
Can it wait? Can't you wait?
'Cause I ain't ready to lay it on the line
I still shake, I still shake
From this chill in my spine

I've got this chill yeah
In the back of my spine
Baby all the time now
Chilling my bones, chilling all alone now

Find a way, find a way, I've found a way
To cope with the everyday now
Raise your hands if you understand

CHORUS

Smiling's just a phase yeah
And nothing can phase me

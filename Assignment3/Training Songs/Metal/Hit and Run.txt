You say I drink too much
I do too much smoke
You say I drink too much 
I do too much coke…that's a joke

When you say I get to London 
I get too loud…I'm proud
If you don't like it
Don't hang around…no

CHORUS
'cause I'm hit and run all the way
I'm hit and run I might die today
I'm hit and run all the way
‘Cuz I'm hit and run
We're gonna die today

Well now you better move
You don't slow down 
Pedal to the metal
You never touch the ground

Running all the red lights 
Too much speed…I need
Breaking all the rules
I hear the devil scream

CHORUS
I don' know
Why do we wonder
When you see the rain
And hear the thunder 
Better open your eyes
Now open your eyes
Better open your eyes
‘Cuz everybody's gonna die
YOU MIGHT DIE TODAY
Ok….OK

Chorus

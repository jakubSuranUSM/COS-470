I'm starting to lose my mind, can we start over? // I need to shed this skin and misery // I'm feeling trapped in these walls, can we move forward? // We're in this mess you made, now let us crumble // Come down from the clouds // you donâ€™t seem to sit well where you don't belong // I've carried my mind through thick and passed through through every great divide // It's like I have a new life and now it seems to me, the reason we're alive and I'm the one to be left out in the dark // And you're the one who's to blame for it all // Put a gun to my head, send me to my own bed, and I swear I'll never lose it // It's like I have got a new life, and now it seems to me - the reason we're alive // Put a gun to my head, send me to my own bed and I swear I'll never lose it // I'm starting to lose my mind, can we start over? // I need to shed this skin and misery // I'm feeling trapped in these walls, can we move forward? // We're in this mess that you made, now let us crumble.

I remember when you used to come to me at night
You told me I was good for you
And then I found out about that other man
and with that patronizing tone that I was just another fool

The times I tried to phone but there was no reply
Your voice would say you wasn't in
If you leave your name and number I'll get back to you
But with all my desperate tries you're back just to say

Goodbye
And I'm not in love with you, don't call me I don't wanna see you again

You don't want me you don't need me I'm so lonely please don't leave me for my love

Goodbye
And I'm not in love with you, don't call me I don't wanna see you again

I remember when you used to come to me at night
You told me I was good for you
And then I found out about that other man
and with that patronizing tone that I was just another fool

The times I tried to phone but there was no reply
Your voice would say you wasn't in
If you leave your name and number I'll get back to you
But with all my desperate tries you're back just to say

Goodbye
And I'm not in love with you, don't call me I don't wanna see you again

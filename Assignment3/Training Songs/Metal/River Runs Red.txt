I got the razor at my wrist
'cause I can't resist
I've got this fever burnin' fist
That does as I wish
But when I get downtown
And see what's around
I just know there's got to be
A better place to be found

Oh, God help me

The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'

Well I know there'd come a day
When my mind would say hey are you afraid
Well all I know is that I been down here tryin'
Well, I'll bleed on through the night
I suppose I'll be dead by the morning light
So don't be surprised if you mind when you find me

The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'

Oh, God help me

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday bullshit things that you have done

Your impossible ego f*ck is like a
Megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fuckin' touch me I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that
Shit you call a heart
Ya ya ya

I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed
Made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is
That's all you'll ever know

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I want to understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it
I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it
At least I admit it

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

Kill you, f*ck you, I will never be you
Kill you, f*ck you, I will never be you
I can't fuckin' take it anymore
A snap of the synapse
And now it's fuckin' war
Kill you, f*ck you, I will never be you

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

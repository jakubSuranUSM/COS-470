See you in hell

Can I make you an offer? You can't refuse
I kept my eyes on you 'cause I tell you that you lose
And you can come with me to a place you'll know so well
And I will take you to the very gates of Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell, oh yeah, see you in Hell

Your choice's up then how many sins can be yours
At my kingdom final choice is yours
You can take it any time that you need
Next thing I'll borrow all you've got to do is bleed

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell, oh yeah

Come with me, I will take you down to the very depths of your soul
And I'll make you burn
See you, see you in Hell
See you, see you

Can I make you an offer? You can't refuse
I kept my eyes on you 'cause I tell you that you lose
And you can come with me to a place you'll know so well
Like I told you at the very gates of Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell

See you in Hell
See you in Hell, see you

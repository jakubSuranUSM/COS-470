We look, into the skies,
We're searching for a sign
- Something to find -
We need to find reason to be

Send us a sign
To know you'll come
Send us a sign
Your faithful's here

We don't, believe you're here
We don't think you've come before
Your coming has, been foretold
We need something that's real
I need, a new master
Gods of old, seem no more
A crutch, I need to find
A god to destroy our enemies

The stars are all set right
Alignment is in the sky
I whisper the arcane rites
The prophecy will come tonight

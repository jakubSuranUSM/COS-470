Feel the tension of rejection
Bleach it out with therapy
The confusion exclusion
Turns into my deformity

Never trust it, maladjusted
I've become my own worst enemy
The aggravation in my fixation
Keeps it all controlled inside of me

See it all collapsing, it's all around me
This condition is killing me
The isolation still surrounds me
In remission but it's killing me

It's what I can't control
What I can't control
What I can't control in me

Born again I feel so hollow
Torn again my senses fade
Mourn again without the sorrow
Born again without the blame

Force a new solution, it's all inside me
In remission but it's killing me
Evolution is divided
In remission but it's killing me

I can't increase the treatment
It won't suppress the feelings
Or stop the way I'm getting
Used to the pain

Breaking down
Self-destructive pattern

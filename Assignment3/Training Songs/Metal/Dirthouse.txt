My dirthouse
Watch it happen from the box
Mind wanders
Dirty dirty word
My dirthouse
This is where it all comes down
Look into my eye
You feel my skin, it's dirt

Drive me wild
Remember when you blew my mind?
Cut through me
Living in the dirt
These dogs are curled up in a little ball
These dogs are freezing their asses off

Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I want to call this my home
Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces
I've got some pain of my own

Open the box
See what's inside
You make the call
Sick of it all again

Tear me down
Pushing on my every nerve
Scares me
I hope I don't get burnt
Look closer
Look into my dirty mind
Feeling sick inside
My blood has turned to fucking dirt

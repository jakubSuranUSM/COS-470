You're confiscating transmission 
For liberty, no sympathy 
Don't interfere with direct invitations 
She's talking of communal love 

If you had what it takes 
Well you wouldn't be afraid 
But you got no I.D. 
No identity 

Don't break your heart over me babe 
Your body falls, too unpredictable 
But I'm dancing 
The game is up, your contraceptive's love 

If you had what it takes 
Well you wouldn't be afraid 
But you got no I.D. 
No identity 

You programme love insatiable crime 
Imprisons me in liberty 
Your chauvinism's a sensuous smile 
Transmission of commercial love

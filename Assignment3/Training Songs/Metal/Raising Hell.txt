I feel the fire (fire)
Can't touch the flames (flames)
This is reality, an infamous game
I taste the blood (blood)
Can't seem to cave (cave)
The deed is done, but the debt is unpaid

Everyday it seems I'm running from the reaper
Kicking and screaming and going down swinging
Without my soul you're a gun without a trigger
Fate is unfolding, who made you the king of the dead

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

Raising hell!

You got a choice, you digress off your master
No restraints, no remorse are you hearing this
You wanna test me I know, I'll destroy you
Save your breath, nothing's left here I come at you

Everyday seems like I'm running with the reaper
Kicking and screaming, the demons are singing
Disarray as the grave is getting deeper
Weakness is showing, I'll make you a slave for the dead (for the dead)
Slave for the dead

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

Raising hell!

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

This is a war that can never be won
Let me go
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall
I'm raising hell

Here we go again, on a 747
Looking at the clouds
From the other side of heaven
Smoking and drinking, never gonna stop
Reading magazines
Stop me looking at the clock
Wanna watch the movie, can't keep still
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil

Watching all the road crew
Attacking little girls,
Joined the mile high club
Goin' round the world,
All the booze is free,
Airline going broke,
Here come the lady
With another Jack and Coke
Wanna watch the movie
Can't sit still,
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil

Steve, Clem, Hobbsy, John
Crazy Dil and Pappy
Had to travel second class,
They ain't too fucking happy,
Elevator music, butter in my ears
Think we're gonna die,
Just the pilot changing gear,
Wanna watch the movie, can't sit still
Flying down to Rio, going to Brazil

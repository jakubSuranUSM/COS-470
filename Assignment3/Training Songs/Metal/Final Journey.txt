A feeling, a presence,
Time is of the essence
A fear that you’ll be left alone.
A warning, a presence,
Delivery of a message
It’s all there in the unknown.

Alerting, averting
It’s all disconcerting
Shots ring out from afar.
Swerving, observing,
The sound is a piercing screech
Of a speeding car.

It’s your final journey.
Destination unknown!
On your final journey
You’ll be travelling alone.

A pitching and rolling,
Sensation controlling
You strike while the iron’s a glow.
Sensing the danger
One look from a stranger just passing
Somehow you know.

It’s your final journey.
Destination unknown!
On your final journey
You’ll be travelling alone.

Urgent, urgent
Somehow it’s all converging.
Your instincts tell you to run
Away from the blackness, the fear and the madness.
Onward, into the sun.

It’s your final journey.
Destination unknown!
On your final journey
You’ll be travelling alone.

We're still together after all that we've been through
They tried to tell you I was not the boy fore you
They didn't like my hair, the clothes I love to wear
They didn't realize that I was strong enough for two

[Chorus]
I love you love , you love me too love, I love you love me love
I love you love my only true love, I love you love me love

The things they said about the two of us were lies
I know they couldn't see the love lights in our ours
They said I wouldn't dare, to show how much I care
They didn't know we were just two angels in disguise

[Chorus]

So here we are alone, we made it on our own
And though they tried they can't deny the way I really showed e'm

[Chorus: x2]

I love you love me love!

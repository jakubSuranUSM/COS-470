I wake up lonely you're next to me
I don't know if I've survived my sleep
Don't you know me I'm your agony
Don't detest me try to live inside me
I want to break through your skin but

I don't mind I don't care
I can't see the sky from here
What have you done?

I don't mind I don't care
I can't feel my soul down here
What have you done?

You're getting closer trying to leave
Begging for mercy please let me be
Can't you see it? Life becomes unreal
Can't you feel it? I'm inside your skin

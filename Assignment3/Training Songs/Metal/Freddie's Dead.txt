Hey, yeah, hey, hey
Love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, yeah !
Say Freddie's dead, huh !

That's what I said
Let the [unknown] said he'd send him home
But his hope was a rope but he should have known
It's hard to understand

There was love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery was his woman and things
Freddie's dead, huh !

That's what I said
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie plan

Pushing dope for the man
A terrible blow but that's how it goes
Freddie's on the corner now
And if you want to be a junkie, wow !

Just remember
Freddie's dead
We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess

You can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality, what does it mean ?
Ain't no damned thing said
'Cause Freddie's dead

Hey, yeah, hey, hey
Love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, yeah !
Hey, yeah, hey, hey

Love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, yeah !
All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm tryin' to find

This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
I need a woman, child
Why can't we brothers protect one another ?

No one's serious and it make furious
Freddie's dead
Don't be misled, just think of Fred
Don't be misled, just think of Fred

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man

Freddie's on the corner now
And if you want to be a junkie, wow !
Freddie's dead
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, Freddy !
Freddie's dead, huh !

Tragic
Is the world and it's ever pressing changing ways
Distorted melodies and drug influenced dreams
All of my miseries
Area changing me
Wrap me up inside of everything
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy you
And be the way you want me to
Lullabies and candy canes
A stagnant flow of error
Nothing can be done to satisfy everyone
But in a world of precious pain and beautiful memory
Can you see me in the way
Of everyone and everything
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Such a small little voice
I mean nothing to you
My existence so vulnerable ( you know it's true )
Terror, malice, fear, and inflammatory hate
Nothing compares to the feelings I hold for you
The world is so full of deceit and lies that I can't seem to sympathize
With all these fucked up people and their ways
Your so beautiful and sensitive
Nothing seems so perfect in my eyes
And nothing seems so right
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Can you feel my love
Reaching out to you
Can you feel the pain
Of what I've been through
I've seen so many people treat my feelings like a play thing
Tearing me apart with their words
As this faithful day has come
I speak to you and you won't seem to
And it's just another day to me
Constant affliction gets to me
I don't know what I want to be
I can't tell you what I mean
You mean everything to me
I don't mean shit to me
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Drug induced dreams
Narcotic hallucinations ease the pain
Isolate me
Isolate me from everything
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Love (*repeat fade out*)

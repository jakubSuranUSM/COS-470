He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband

Last night I went out drinking
When I came home I gave her a beating
So she ? the rolling pin and went to work on my head
Until she bash it in

I lie cold dead in the market
Stone cold dead in the market
I lie cold dead in the market
She killed nobody but her husband

I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
I lick 'im wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
And if I kill him, he had it coming

Man,
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband

My family they're swearin' to kill her
My family they're swearin' to kill her
His family they're swearin' to kill me
And if I kill him, he had it coming

Here I lie cold dead in the market
Cold dead in the market
I lie cold dead in the market
She kill nobody but her husband

There is one thing that I am sure
He ain't goin' to beat me no more
So I tell ya that I doesn't care 
If I was to die in the electric chair

Man
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband

Hey child, I'm coming back and bash your head one more time

No, no no man you can't do that

He's stone cold dead in the market (murderer)
He's stone cold dead in the market (da criminal)
He's stone cold dead in the market
I killed nobody but my husband

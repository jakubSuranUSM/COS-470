He's got plenty of drugs
But he can't find his guitar
Winds up drowning in puke
Or with a needle hanging out of his arm

This is plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
This is a plea for junk
Anything I can use

I'll shoot junk in my eye
I can't die
Whoops- I'm already dead!
Maggots are writhing inside my head

This is plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
This is a plea for junk
Anything I can use

Desperate for anything
Anything I can use
A plea for drugs
An appeal from me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die...

See me failing, see me sprawling, see me...go through your purse
See me crying, see me dying, see me....ride off in a hearse

This is a plea for drugs
This is an appeal from me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die...

I'm pathetic! Yet magnetic!
That is until the drugs are gone
Then I am a total dick until I get a good load on
Don't want to fucking shoot myself, that would be a mess
I really should O.D. on junk, I think that would be best!

This is plea for drugs
This is a plea for booze
This is a plea anything
Anything I can use

A plea for drugs
An appeal from me to you
There is nothing you can do
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die...

So what I've been with a prostitute
I've been on meth for a week or two
There's a teenage girl, she's fuckin' high on drugs
I think she's driving my truck
I don't care, live the way I wanna
I don't care, I live the way I wana
(Chorus) Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better?
One day they'll lay me down to rest
Till then I'll answer to myself
I'm from another world you know I'm not a man
I'm a beast I'm a beast I'm a beast yeah
I don't care, I live the way I wanna
I don't care, I live the way I wanna
Chorus
I apologize for nothing
While you just sit here and wonder why
All out, I'm black, we are nothing
Chorus
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Around and around and around and around, around

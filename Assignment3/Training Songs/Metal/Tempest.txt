Take out the stories
They’ve put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky

The sky beneath
I know you can’t be tired
Lay there
Stare at the ceiling

And switch back to your time just go ahead now try
And taste it I know it should be ripe, thrust, ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival

Cut to the end
I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

I wonder just how you shaped it
To get back to your prize, thrust ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end

I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Wake for the glory
I know you can’t be tired

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end

I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Inside, inside, inside
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
I want you to take me
Apart from the inside
Right to the end

Do you need to feel so empty
So full of shit
You never been so far
And so damn close
You wake up, stuck
Ready to f*ck, somebody up
But one day it'll bring you down

Oh set me free
Your radiance could rescue me
I'll pay you back

Candle lights burn inside
But for how long?
There's a time to come and time to go
Someone said, son, make sure you go on
Push until the light turns white
We all know it'll bring you down

Oh set me free
Your radiance could rescue me
I'll pay you back

And it's too late to crawl back
I should have known
Temptation was my second name
You break steal ready to kill
For money to close a deal
Yes, it has brought you down

Oh set me free
Your radiance could rescue me
I'll pay you back

The sands of time stream threw my fingers!
Chasing lost days of a dead dream,
And I don't care if we lose it all tonight.

Cause I'm not sure anymore if it ever happened,
It feels so unreal.

Don't close your eyes what if all disappears,
Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle,
I won't hate you anymore.

First time I saw my father's tears,
I knew there was still hope for me.
Now share your brain so I can upload some hate,
If you saw me now would you pray for me?
Still I'll keep doing the same mistakes.

Cause I'm not sure anymore if it ever happened,
It feels so unreal.

Don't close your eyes what if all disappears,
Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle,
I won't hate you anymore.

Why does it feel like god spent more time on me?
I burned all the bridges.
But the moment I met you they where all rebuilt again.
Rebuilt again

Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes what if all disappears,
Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle,
I won't hate you anymore.

Don't close your eyes what if all disappears,
Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle,
I won't hate you anymore.

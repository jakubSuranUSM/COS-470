A bed of nails, cold dark deep refrigeration 
A hear it calling me
A broken rail as he drools over the congregation 
I hear it calling me 
Now I won't tell you how to live your life
I never saw the point in thinking twice 
I turn the wheel by day, by night 
Praise your flag
Here's to the liberation 

Day by day I move in time
Turn the wheel, pay for my crimes

The miller's horse is wearing down
He bangs his heart on hollowed ground
The miller hears a single sound
The sound of the grinding wheel goes round and round

The ship has sailed to dark sea destinations 
The gods are hailed for their absentee observations 
I feel it holding me
Now I can't tell you where integrity hides 
It showed it's face, you struck it down and it died
I turn my wheel with a seamless pride 
Raise your flag 
Here's to the revolution 
The pain is all you ever feel 
A concrete will, and a back of steel 
I give you my soul unto the wheel 
Get it done

Eye of the needle, it in the hear of the sun
Stuck in the middle, with the blazing one 
This weathered hand, has a grip of steel 
These eyes have seen it all; catch your spirit on the grinding wheel 
Say your prayers, say what you feel 
Count your blessings, make a deal 
What you borrow, what you steal 
Crush it all, on the grinding wheel

I'm walking the streets and I hear what you say
Advising me telling me how to play
I know your name it's called Mr. Mean
One thing I've learned, you don't know beans

High I fly
I touch the sky
Far above the frozen minds
You can't kill my dreams
You can't kill my spirit
I was born to be free

I walk to my own song
Every day the power grows stronger in me
I walk to my own song
Head up proud
I'm the master of my own destiny

You think you know what is better for me
Holding me lectures of how I should be
Shrugging my shoulders I leave you behind
Anyway I look at it...you are blind

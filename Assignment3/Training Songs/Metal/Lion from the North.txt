A time of religion and war
Legends tell the tale of a lion
This beast in the shape of a man
With a dream to rule sea and land

And all those who stand in his way
Die by God and victorious arms
With the righteous that follows him south
Once more set ashore to war

Legends have taught battles fought
This lion has no fear at heart
Lion come forth come from the north
Come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per augusta

A storm over Europe unleashed
Dawn of war a trail of destruction
The power of Rome won't prevail
See the catholics shiver and shake

The future of warfare unveiled
Showed the way that we still walk today
Der LÃ¶we aus Mitternacht comes
Once more he is here for war

Stories of old truth unfold
Control over Europe he holds
Freedom he'll bring
Lion and king lion and king

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per augusta

Gustavus Adolphus go forth libera impera
(Gustavus Adolphus Libera et impera)
Acerbus et ingens go forth libera impera
(Acerbus et ingens Augusta per augusta)

Mighty eagle rule alone
Liberator claim the throne
Lion from the northern land
Take the scepter from its hand
Take the scepter from its hand
Take the scepter from its hand
Take the scepter from its hand 
(Oh oh oh you lion from the north
Ooh you lion from the north)

Legends have taught battles fought
This lion has no fear at heart
Lion come forth come from the north
Come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per augusta

Gustavus Adolphus go forth libera impera
(Gustavus Adolphus Libera et impera)
Acerbus et ingens go forth libera impera
(Acerbus et ingens Augusta per augusta)

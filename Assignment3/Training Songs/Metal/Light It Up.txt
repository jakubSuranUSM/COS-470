Hey I want a taste, you're a black heart devil
And I can't explain why you wait for your face
You're a hotel lover on the back and to the disgrace
Every night she seems to change her name
Does it matter who you really are?
Back room where we sip champagne
I can never seem to get out enough

I ignite so hold on, 'cuz we're about to light it up
It's on tonight so hold on, 'cuz we're about to about to light it up

Hey there's no mistake 'cuz I'm a hard time sinner
With a bullet to waste
I will break all these chains
And hit the club house running with the money to play
I got the whiskey running through my veins
Tip me over and corer the valve
Yo daddy tells you not to play my game
But what I'm sell baby, she can't deny

I ignite so hold on 'cuz we're about to light it up
It's on tonight so hold on 'cuz we're about to about
I ignite so hold on 'cuz we're about to light it up
It's on tonight so hold on 'cuz we're about to about to light it up

It keeps calling my name
I can't send it away
You got to pay it to play yeahhh
Yo daddy tells you not to play my game
But what I'm sell baby she can't deny
I ignite so hold on
It's on tonight so hold on 'cuz we're about to

I ignite so hold on cuz we're about to light it up
It's on tonight so hold on 'cuz we're about to light it up yeah
Hold on 'cuz we're about to about to light it up

Faceless, subhuman
Shattered souls I feed
Experimenting
Dead eyes watching me

Bow down
Sheep to the slaughter
Bow down
Follow the creator
Into the path of the unknown
Where they must walk alone

The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead

Hopeless, disgusting
Pathetic human beings
Annihilation
Of what you believe

Now you will Bow down
Sheep to the slaughter
Bow down
Follow the creator
Into the path of the unknown
Where they must walk alone

The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead

Secrets of the dead

Take control of my everything
Killing them systematically
My power is growing
Their blood is flowing

The unholy are lifeless
Sunken eyes dripping back
The secrets of the dead
They keep calling me back

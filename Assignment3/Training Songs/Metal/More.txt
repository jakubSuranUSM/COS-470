With every corner of my mind
With every moment of my time
With all the strength I'll ever own
I'll never make it all alone

I believe you but I can't see you
You're every step I'll ever take

'Cause you're more than I can say
You're more than I can feel
You're more than I can say you're all to me!

My every heart inside of me
My every breath my every me
You're every thing I really own
I'd never make it all alone

I believe you but I can't feel you
You're every move I'll ever make

'Cause you're more than I can say
You're more than I can feel
You're more than I can say you're all to me!

I believe you, though I don't see you
You're every thing that's on my mind
I will seek you I will speak you
And everything will work out right so right!

'Cause you're more than I can say
You're more than I can feel
You're more than I can say you're all to me!

You're more
So much more
You're so much more
You're so much more to me!

Jesus knows my story, he knows the position that I'm in
A hooker knows the feeling to get fucked the way I've been
Turn my insides out; your mouth drank my water

You look at me like I'm subhuman
You talk to me like I'm subhuman
You're treating me like I'm subhuman
You're jumping into the subhuman race

Brothers hear my story, but don't you take no pity out on me
A soldier knows the feeling to get pushed out in a field
Taking liberties; burned by your dictation

There's an air of urgency, the wail of sirens pierces the night
The damage has already been done, irreversible accidents, security's tight
This is not a drill, it's a drastic tragedy to cope with
Time is the worst enemy, to those who play with the fate of man

Breakdown, warning, nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning, contaminates society
Breakdown, warning, radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning, mistakes are now becoming clear

Meltdown, becomes a word of panic
Meltdown, radiation burns the skin
Meltdown, the public has yet to be informed
Meltdown, invisible killer closing in 

Breakdown, warning, nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning, contaminates society
Breakdown, warning, radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning, mistakes are now becoming clear

Geiger counters crackle in a frenzy, useless meters to prove our danger
An enemy that man created, how ironic that he cannot fight
Technology beyond control, build up of waste, no safe disposal

Breakdown, warning, nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning, contaminates society
Breakdown, warning, radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning, mistakes are now becoming clear to us!

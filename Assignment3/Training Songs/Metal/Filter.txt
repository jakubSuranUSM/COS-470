Why can't I free
The things I want
Why can't I be a
Part alone

Thrusting hate inside
I found a reason
Nothing from, nothing attacking
Something from, nothing we'll find

Thrusting hate inside
I found a reason
Tracing dead
Habits and finding
Mothing from, nothing untrue

You forsake my mind
You should have
Never possessed arid demon
Yourself undone

Keep on looking 
But you f*ck it away
And you'll keep on trying 
But your minds led away

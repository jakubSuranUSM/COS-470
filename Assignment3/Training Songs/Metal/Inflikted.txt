Born from dust
In the gutters of this earth
Maggots and leppers
Is this hell or is this heaven?
The cursed, the damned
Spreading hate across the land
No more pretending
Destroy your seeds of envy

Unleash the wicked
This hate is self-inflikted
Deliver this torment
Upon your final judgment
Follow the storm
In the land of no return
It's you, the scum
We'll kill until it's done

[Chorus: x4]
Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin' wicked

Falling and burning
Execution now is coming
Corruption is the sign
And destruction of your lies

[Chorus: x4]

[x2]
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt

Inflikted, inflikted

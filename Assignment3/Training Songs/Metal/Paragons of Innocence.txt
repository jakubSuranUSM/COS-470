Day
Into night
Into day
Into I don't know you anymore

But I stand
Where you say
Thinking all the time you planned it

You've been gone away too long
Leaving us to carry on
Though in truth you never tried
Just stepped back and watched the slide

Paragons of innocence
Questioning of your intent
Never quite sure what you meant
From the other side

Moments on the carousel
Must admit we ride it well
And the horses never tell
All throughout the ride

That no one leaves
No one leaves
No one leaves...
Alive

Time
On my hands
Slips away
`Til I just don``t feel it anymore

Thinking back
When I can
To the time when it began with
Bits of dreams all in a line
And somehow we missed the signs
That it all was never real
And in truth a fatal deal

Paragons of innocence
Questioning of your intent
Never quite sure what you meant
From the other side

Moments on the carousel
Must admit we ride it well
And the horses never tell
All throughout the ride
No one leaves
No one leaves
No one leaves...
Alive

There always comes a time
When you do what you want to do
You know you shouldn't do it
But you do it anyway
And when he had that time
When he knew what he wanted to
He quickly placed his order
Though he never thought he'd pay

But the lines turned to lies
And the lies turned to tangles
And you're pale as a cadaver
Though you think it doesn't show
So you live with the lies
And the friends that it gathers
But somewhere in your heart you know you

Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Got to let it
Go

Paragons of innocence
Questioning of your intent
Never quite sure what you meant
From the other side

Moments on the carousel
Must admit we ride it well
And the horses never tell
All throughout the ride
No one leaves
No one leaves
No one leaves...
Alive

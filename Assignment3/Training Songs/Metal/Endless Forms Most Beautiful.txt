Come on hop on let's take a ride
Come and meet the travelers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars

We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, a rest haven of life

Lay on a field of green with mother Eve
With father pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous

Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful

Beyond aeons we take a ride
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the Tiktaalik
Take her first walk witness the birth of flight

Deeper down in Panthalassa
A eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one weâ€™ll soon become

Lay on a field of green with mother Eve
With father by reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous

Deep into the past
The lonely eon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful

A life of wearing on
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful

Deep into the past
The lonely eon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful

A life of wearing on
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful

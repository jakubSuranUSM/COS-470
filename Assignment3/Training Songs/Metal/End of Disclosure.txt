I'm sitting on a moon looking down for you
And watching what you've become
The new world gone unensambled for you
A great deception that will make you numb

Fantasy invasion from the sky
For whom you got their secret funds
This is a new pond
Only for the selected ones

End of disclosure
Now the countdown has begun
End of disclosure
Before they kill everyone

Don't speak
You will disappear
They're gonna erase the truth
Mass genocide
70% will die
It's too late for you

Fantasy invasion from the sky
For whom you got their secret funds
This is a new pond
Only for the selected ones

End of disclosure
Now the countdown has begun
End of disclosure
Before they kill everyone

Open to May, when we were young and brave
Took steps to remove me, I'll come in and out with the tides
The lost and the love, I admire
You had every chance to close this, to take it all down and out of sight
Where there's nothing to find and there's nothing to hide

Your breath fills my skin, all the way in
In the event of an emergency, I'll ask for your saving again

Return to now, as we are opened wide
Underneath the haze of lights and scents of cigarettes and lies
So say your goodbyes and let it all die tonight
'Cause you have every chance to close this, and let it all in and out of sight, where there's nothing to hide, where faith buries strike

Your breath fills my skin, all the way in
In the event of an emergency, I'll ask for your saving again
I'd sleep in mountains of rain to never escape from the endless you
And we'll side step the masses and live life through the glasses of truth
And you'll never go away
Yeah, you'll never go away

A parished smile, a hidden tear
that sends a shiver down the spine - of joy and fear
A hasty move, uneven step
This show is on - you've learned it inside out, to death

A silent sigh, a stolen kiss
it's all - the miracle of life and goes like this
An empty stare, a final scream
It's live a never ending soap - or so it seems

Look what's going on - you are my witness
On the silver screen - my eye witness.

Infinity like time without a friend
Who'll sing the song if melody should end
You're dead my friend.

Lost angel come and take control
Lost angel gotta keep on
Hold on
hold on
hold on.
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my Feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels
Listen to the way to rock'n'roll.

Insanity
I can feel the knives inside my brain
I stand alone at the threshold of my pain.

Lost angel come and take control
. . .

Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels.

How I see it now all my friends inside my life
Appeared before my eyes
And returning to space to see myself disappear

Lost angel come and take control
. . .

Gotta get on back to the love in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'hn dead on my feet
Gotta get on back to the love in the street
We're lost angels.
Gotta get on back to the love in the street . . .

Screaming in agony,
Cries fill the air
Eyes once full of hope
Shedding tears of despair

All that they've ever known is dead

Fire reigns from above,
Iron birds of dread

All that they've ever loved is dead
All that they've ever dreamt is dead

Yet there's a glint of hope,
If the chosen can survive
In secret, the ten thousand hide
East in the mountains,
The chosen bide their time

The Clouding, our strike on mankind

Temples are burning,
Streets soaked with blood
Heed the prophecy,
Destiny is done

All that they've ever loved is dead
All that they've ever dreamt is dead

Yet there's a glint of hope,
If the chosen can survive
In secret, the ten thousand hide
East in the mountains,
The chosen bide their time
The Clouding, our strike on mankind

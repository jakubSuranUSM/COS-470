Tick tock the boring clock
I want to rip it off the wall
Count down the seconds to the
The hell raisers ball

An evil celebration
Don't need no invitation
This one you will not miss
Your name is on the death list

Come down
To the hell raisers ball
I'm gettin' down
To the hell raisers ball

Black metal postcard
From the edge of time
They spelled your name wrong
But you don't mind

You'll see all kinds of demons
And think that you are dreamin'
It starts just after midnight
Dance naked in the moonlight

Come down
To the hell raisers ball
I'm gettin' down
To the hell raisers ball

Now is the time to choose
What have we got to lose except all we've worked for?
Right out the door
All of our lives we slave
Headfirst into the grave without a second thought

In Y2K
Digital disarray

Impending all-time low
Solutions come much too slow in our high-tech age
It's all the rage
Stopped in our global tracks
By a stupid, shortsighted act
Time will be standing still

In Y2K
Digital disarray
In Y2K
Two digits of dismay

Countdown to the year two thousand
Seems like an insurmountable mountain

In time this may not be a big deal
But right now fear of the future's all I feel

An inquisitive mind
Will always tune into the world beyond.
Curiously you'll find yourself
Observing it all with intrigue.
So keep a close eye
Such a detailed awareness
Helps you to feel alive

You're always watching,
But it's only watching.

This voice so confident
And proud of chanting opinions
Stuck in his verbal crusade
Ranting an invented position
You're only ever a witness
To what you want to see
You're glorifying this misperception.

So fill your head
With what you think you understand.

My ears grow tired
Of listening to this constant recital
Lend yourself only when it suits
For this worthy cause, for this worthy cause
Feed the elevation that you so desperately, so desperately

In all these words in which you preach
I would have thought you'd act.
But you're sitting too comfortably
In a land so distant
Watching for entertainment

And in this voice of confidence
Too proud to admit flawed opinions
Bound to his verbal crusade
Preaching his invented position.
These tones will always
Deceive the unfamiliar
Still glorifying your misperception.

So in love with the sound of you own voice
And why? You would talk for eternity
The watcher runs
With the circles of his debate
And in the end, what's been achieved?

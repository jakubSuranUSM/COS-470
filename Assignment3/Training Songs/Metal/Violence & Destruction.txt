Young men, it's time to take your stand.
It's time to raise your voices.
The nations are in an uproar and the kingdoms shake.
But when he speaks, the earth melts away.
Hold the orphans, help the widows, become the fire
and raise your voices.
(I see your curious eyes.)

Rise up and speak violence and destruction.
Awaken the nerves beneath your skin.
Rise up and speak violence and destruction.
Open your eyes and let light in.

Take refuge and have strength.
We have an ever-present help in trouble,
so do not fear, though the earth give way.
The waters roar and the mountains quake,
but do not be afraid.
Turn the lights on, raise the windows, and let
your voice ring through the streets.

Now speak violence and destruction.
Awaken the nerves beneath your skin.
Rise up and speak violence and destruction.
Open your eyes and let light in.

Let light in.
Be still.

Oh please cover me light. I don't feel so good.

It won't be long until the fires crash like waves against the sky.

Rise up and speak.

Let life in.

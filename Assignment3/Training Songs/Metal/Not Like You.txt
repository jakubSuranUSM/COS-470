Hey man, I'm the stand you're on,
Always preaching for nothing,
Somehow you never seem to fall
In the Cracks were i live

I'm not like you,
So uplifted, hiding from the truth,
I'm not like you,
Overlooking all in front of you I'm not like you.

Hey man, I'm the trip your on,
An introduction to heaven,
not bad the way you find your God.
You stare him down in the Mirror

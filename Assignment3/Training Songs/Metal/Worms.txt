All bonds that God ties
Man is master to tear apart
All crop on God's made land
Man is master to sow and reap
All deaths worms die
Man is master to engineer
And the bliss of freedom glimmers like gold
Empty the cast, melt the mold

The worms of God

We've torn away Your spear God
This is sacrament to show it
It's the bread of liberation
And the wine of celebration
In the gloom of gluttony, lust takes its toll
Its hold is stronger than of the Gods of old

The worms of God

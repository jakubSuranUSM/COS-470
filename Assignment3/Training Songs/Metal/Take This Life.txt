It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And curse my fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever
If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see
Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

The rain drops just beg to hit me
What now hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing

If I ever
If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see
Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

These thoughts burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts will keep me feeling

These thoughts burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts will keep me feeling

If I ever
If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see
Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

Take this life
I'm right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

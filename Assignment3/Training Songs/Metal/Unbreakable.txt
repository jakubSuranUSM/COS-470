There are weapons in the sound
And they echo all around
And you feel the bitter sting as you fall to the ground

Memories and plans forgone
Pave the way for fear to spawn
To find a vein to feast upon
Hoping I become undone

And I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
I'll never break

Throwing caution to the wind
Learning how to fight again
I carry on regardless of the shape I'm in

Every torch and pitchfork thrown
Only makes the fire grow
When it engulfs you, you will know
That I will not be overthrown

And I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
I'll never break

Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand
Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand, go

Through the firestorm, I will remain
And you will know where you stand
And you will know where you stand

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
Unbreakable (unbreakable)
Unbreakable (unbreakable)

I will remain

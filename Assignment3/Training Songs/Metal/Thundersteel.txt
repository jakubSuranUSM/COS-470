streak of Lightning is shooting through the air
Electric sun lights the sky
His face is fighting, so evil one's beware
Men of disaster hear his cry
And now at last we know he's real
The power of his sword we feel
Thundersteel Thundersteel

The earth it rumbles death is in the air The city
crumbles is everywhere And from the burning sky we
see the soldier fly He mounts his horse of steel and
now he rides And now at last we know he's real
The power of his word we feel Thundersteel
Thundersteel A streak of Lightning is shooting through
the air Electric sun lights the sky His face is fighting,
so evil one's beware Men of disaster hear his cry And
now at last we know he's real The power of his sword
we feel Thundersteel Thundersteel Thundersteel

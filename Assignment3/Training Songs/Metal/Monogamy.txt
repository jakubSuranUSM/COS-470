I pack my things I go
I leave you all alone
Well J. it's about time
To face the facts
Our relationship sucks
After six years of sex with you I'm blured
Oh even a beauty can bore
Monogamy, my agony
Is not inborn

When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I lied

All the nights I spent through
Lying next to you
Listening to your breath
It's such a drag
To loose the best I've ever had
To accept the fact that I will miss you
To ignore the fear of being alone
My Venus is there nothing left between us
Monogamy my agony
Is not inborn

When I've said
I've done it all for you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were sad
I was there
Yeah
I lied

I've done it all for fucking you
I've always been true blue
Whenever you were so sad
I was there

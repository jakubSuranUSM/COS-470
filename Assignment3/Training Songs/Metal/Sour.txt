Mellow out....bitch 
Hell no 
I thought I knew ya 
Took the time to put my love into ya 
Screw ya 

'Cause now you got me sittin' in the sewer 
I'm through with all them roller coaster rides 
See, I ain't forgot about the knots 
That you been tying with my insides 
I dropped my pride 

Without you I was sure to die 
I tried with cash 
And all I could, to make it last 
Now I accepted that was in the past 
I know you love me 

Love me like a piece of trash 
But at first you were so sweet 
Couldn't go without seein' your face for an hour 
So sour 
It all became a hassle 

You were even living in my castle 
Just to use me 
And verbally abuse me 
That's not the way I'm running my shop 
It took a while to see the light before I stopped 
And you got dropped off 

It's over, probably I'll be sweatin' it 
But in the long run you'll be the one regrettin' it 
Maybe you won't, maybe you will 
But baby, you're still about as real as a three dollar bill 

[Chorus]
There's no one to blame but you 
And who gets the blame me 
Ohh ohh, I sound like a bitch 
A little bitch in heat 
With all that anger that I'm feelin 
Bitch I think it's heat 
Another split tail 
Just another split tail 

Thanks for the lesson 
Now get your shit and hit the trail 
We know I'm coming from that old school 
You damn fool 
Intensity is something that I'm made of 

And certainly I'm not afraid of 
A little smack in my face 
Thanks for the taste 

[Chorus]

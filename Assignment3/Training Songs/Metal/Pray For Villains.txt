Bitter blood on the blood-stained highway
We're brothers in arms 'til we get it right
You're gonna want it your way
It's gonna be done now
Don't take it too far, gonna get it right
Move on from the past
Agree to disagree

Every sorrow has it's source
And your conscience isn't free
In the dog days of Summer
On another sober September
This was meant for you

Am I not my brother's keeper?
All is what it seems to be
I'm A strong rival
A bitter enemy
Best friend
Till the end
The man you wish to be

They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
Let them down!

The ties that bind he clock that winds
As the oceans meet the sky
On the hour of my death
Will you be standing by

Every sorrow has it's source
And your conscience isn't free
In the dog days of Summer
On another sober September
This was meant for you

Am I not my brother's keeper?
All is what it seems to be
I'm A strong rival
A bitter enemy
Best friend
Till the end
The man you wish to be

They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
They pray for villains
When their heroes let them down
Let them down!

Bless the broken road
As we limp back home
You get off on the sound
Of everything coming down, so down
Walk down the broken road!

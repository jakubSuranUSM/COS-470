Someone take this cold from me
And let my mind run free it used to be
Easy to deal with the everyday shit
Now it seems I'm all alone to deal with it

Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear

No one there to hear the inner cry
Only I can watch me die inside
I live alone among a crowded world
I can't forgive myself this weakness
Sets my pride to burn
I can't believe I find a way
To make it through this hell everyday
Slip slipping my reality slips away
Sleep sleeping it seems the only way

Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear

Now it seems there is a way
To shed this pain from
My brain and walk away
I found an ally who is
Strong as I

I need no other to get me by
Inner me inner me I am he
I and I set me free
I, must, control, the pain
Just, for, another day

Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear

No one to hear the inner cry

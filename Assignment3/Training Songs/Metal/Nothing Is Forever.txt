Certainty of emptiness, trustful
New pain and thoughts of the path
2mal there is just one Constance,
Nothings for ever!

Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,black & white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief
Nothings for ever!

(From above the dark sky of the night
Watches instructive my inner fight,)

[Chorus]
I gave my heart, my blood,
Nothing is forever (but eternity)

Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,black & white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief
Nothings for ever!!!

And in the end only haze remains
Nothing is forever

[Chorus]

Certainty of fate,fatal emptiness
An empty hope for future,
How shapeless (the) fate shows,
I fight for something eternal

Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,black & white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief
Nothings for ever!

I'm thirsty - And weary from the heat
As the Sands rinse the hands of time
I will suck the venom from your wound
If you will do the same and suck from mine,

You and I - Were ruined by
This desert between us
I walked through the valley
And stared into death

This instance of a distance
Designed to defeat us
And still her face I can't seem to forget

The war you wage
Forever the life that you pay
Something wrong in you
Comes alive in your veins

Lose yourself in some kind of Hell
A new version of where you are now 
Truth's unveiled
You'll never ever get out

At a glance - Sudden avalanche
Suffocated me within
Gasping for air I can't breathe

Paralyzed - I've been sterilized
And cleansed of my sin
In a state of suspended belief

Somewhere along the way
Time changes everything 
We all disintegrate
It's running out,

Taunted by time
Imposing it's certainty
Absolute always
Stopping for nothing
This race cannot be won

So days it crawls
While other days it flies
It feeds on our flaws
And knows no compromise
Inevitable rise of the sun
Time what have I become

Somewhere along the way
Time changes everything 
We all disintegrate
It's running out,

The war you wage 
Somewhere along the way
It's running out.

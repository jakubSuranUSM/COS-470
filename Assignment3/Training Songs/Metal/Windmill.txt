Time goes wherever you are
Time is your guiding star
That shines through all your life
Makes you feel and move

My dreams are out in the far
So are yours a part
Of secret fairy tales
Dripped on the wings of a mystery mill

Windmill, windmill, keep on turning
Show me the way, Take me today
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning
Longing for love and a chance to be free

Don't feel alone and depressed
Someone will come at last
To soothe your stumbling mind
To keep it away from the evil storm

Windmill...

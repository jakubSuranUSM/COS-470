There is nothing inside of me
Except my hate voyeur society
I hate all the people that I see
I'll hate you even though you worship me
You can't get rid of me
You'll want to hear what I just said
Yes that's me I'm in your head
I'll be there until you're dead
There is nothing I'd rather be
More than this violent freak atrocity
Listen and look at what you see
And blame all the pain inside on me
You can't get rid of me
You'll want to hear what I just said
Yes that's me I'm in your head
I'll be there until you're dead
You are so empty
So dead and empty
Forever empty
You are so empty
Worship me
You can't get rid of me
You'll want to hear what I just said
Yes that's me I'm in your head
I'll be there until you're dead

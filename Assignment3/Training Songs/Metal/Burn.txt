I stand before my saviour what do I see
Thousands of warrior souls bowing down to me
Hail the log awaited first born son
Darkness salutes you as we march into war

Hear the screams from behind the veil of light
Save me
We commence our battle to seek the purest souls
Burn!

As we approach the light the urge for blood is strong
Feelings of burning hatred become our fuel
They hide behind the words of deceit and lies
Judgment day has come to show the glory of the dark

Hear the screams from behind the veil of light
Save me
We commence our battle to seek the purest souls
Burn!

As I gaze into the night through my bloodred eyes
Satisfaction grows as I watch them die

I stand before my saviour what do I see
Thousands of warrior souls bowing down to me
Hail the log awaited first born son
Darkness salutes you as we march into war

The peaceful smell of death surrounds me as I strike
The crosses burn and blood is dripping from above
Our mission is accomplished and we march on
To seek the last remaining christinsane ones

As I gaze into the night through my bloodred eyes
Satisfaction grows as I watch them die

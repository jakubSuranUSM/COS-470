Dark lady read me the future
The ancient verse hidden away
I turn from the ever-gray, and

Tarot cards keep us enraptured
Open mind become the sage
Let this unlock the cage

Ancient power
Darkest hour
Open your third eye and you'll see

(Killers and kings)
Inheritors of Earth
(Killers and kings)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
A diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

Look to Earth, summon the master
Awake the human living inside
Ecclessiasticide

The hangman gives into temperance
The sun shines over the fool
High priestess, spreads her rule

Death and rebirth
Decay and mirth
Open your third eye and you'll see

(Killers and kings)
Inheritors of Earth
(Killers and kings)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
A diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

The diamond bears our ring
Yeah
Oh

The king of pentacles is here
Strength and fortitude help to push away the fear
We stand atop the mountain with the hermit and the lamp
As the lovers in the knight of swords give in to the damned

What do The cards say?
The prophecy remains
The devil in the emperor could keep us locked in chains
And the death card doesn't mean you die
It means a change is coming that you simply can't deny

Reborn
Rebirth
From death comes rebirth

(Killers and kings)
Inheritors of Earth
(Killers and kings)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
A diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

(Killers and kings)
Inheritors of Earth
(Killers and kings)
From death there comes rebirth
And as an army we will sing
A diamond bears our ring
Killers and kings

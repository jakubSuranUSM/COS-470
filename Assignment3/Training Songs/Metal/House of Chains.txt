Pitch black, no light
No day, no night
I’m trapped inside your broken house of chains

When you invited me into your majesty
I was so eager to please I treated you like a temple
Didn’t take long to find your kind it preys on my kind
Getting in was so easy, getting out not so simple

You keep me underneath your angel wings
I’m tied to you in your house, in your house of chains
I’m locked inside you know I’ll never leave
I’m yours to use when your house is in your house of chains

Rooms full of trophies of all the victims before me
Nothing left but the bones stacked up like a collection
You got me smothered in bliss you suffocate with a kiss
You take away all the fight then bring me down to submission

You keep me underneath your angel wings
I’m tied to you in your house, in your house of chains
I’m locked inside you know I’ll never leave
I’m yours to use when your house is in your house of chains

You keep me underneath your angel wings
I’m tied to you in your house, in your house of chains
I’m locked inside you know I’ll never leave
I’m yours to use when your house is in your house of chains

I’m trapped inside your cold embrace when your house is in your house of chains
I’m locked inside you know I’ll never leave
I’m yours to use when your house is in your house of chains
When your house is in your house of chains
When your house is in your

Pitch black, no light
No day, no night
I’m trapped inside your broken house of chains

Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm on a burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never gonna give in
If acquired and that's how you like it
The same trouble in a different disguise
Bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

Svengali, wail with the enemies
I never follow and I never make apologies
Your divisions, are gonna get ya
Because you won't disappoint each other
Center for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
Until we learn from our time we can never die

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world comes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame, yeah
F*ck

The Prescient, the Nascent
The quotient (They all will fall)
The Cystic, symbolic, condition (Systemic)
Egregious, replete with
These lesions (Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish
Creation (Your failure)

Know I got ability, divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centerpiece pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing skies of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe, doesn't matter now
Turn away, the killer is that of now

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world comes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

Too much time has gone by
Take a look back on that life
I see your eyes, I see myself
And I can't look back on that life

Forced to listen forced to learn
With the sounds of the lonely
I remember now, it takes me down
Leave me, leave me now

Dislocated I walked away
You feel the walls begin to build
You were the one
I'm sorry but you could've been anyone
I see you now, you show me everything

Forced to listen forced to learn
With the sounds of being all alone
I remember now, it takes me down
Leave me, leave me now

I remember now, it takes me down
Leave me, leave me now
(It never leaves)
Never

No one get's left behind, another fallen soul
No one gets left behind, another broken home
No one gets left behind, we stand and fight together
No one gets left behind, or we all die alone

Politicians banking in their greed
No idea on how to be all they can be

Have you no honor have you no soul
What is it they're dying for do you really even know
Have you no backbone have you no spine
Whatever happened to no one gets left behind,

No one gets left behind, I know you made it up
No one gets left behind, it's more for money
No one gets left behind, drink from the golden cup
No one gets left behind, your turn is coming

Play your war games with other people's lives
It should be you on the front line

Have you no honor, have you no soul
What is it they're dying for, do you really even know
Have you no backbone, have you no spine
Whatever happened to no one gets left behind

Have you no honor, have you no soul
What is it they're dying for, do you really even know
Have you no backbone, have you no spine
Whatever happened to no one gets left behind

No one gets left behind
No one gets left behind
No one gets left behind
No one gets left behind

No one gets left behind

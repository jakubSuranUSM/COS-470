Cars, mansions and planes
Income that never refrains
The more you receive, the less you believe
In His name

There will come a day
When this will all pass away
The world will die and millions will cry
To be saved

King of Kings
And Lord of all is He
Come and be a part of the reign

Pride, fortune and fame
Glory given to your name
A heart filled with greed is planting a seed
With no shame

There will come a day
When you will soon pass away
The Son will deny and then you will cry
To be saved

King of Kings
And Lord of all is He
Come and be a part of the reign

Dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee
Deep in the cinnamon forest
She offers me crickets, she offers me tea
In the court of her enchanted palace

Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen bee

A sip from the well
I am locked in a spell
Trapped in a grim fairytale
Endless the fun
I wish I had a gun

But I'm dancing forever, from room to room

We dance the fandango, we do menuet
Waltz in her shadow palais
Listen to the strings of a goblin quartet
See the magic ballet

Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen bee

I'm dancing in the temple
Of the mad queen bee

Hey little girl, get your dancing shoes.
Your gold sation jacket, and the silvery blues.
And it'll be alright
Dancing on a Saturday night.

Well, the jukebox a-playing like a one man band.
It's the only kind of music, girl, we both understand.
We're gonna be alright
Dancing on a Saturday night.

Well the roller coaster
Gotta make the most and dance.
Dance
Dance the night away.
Helter skelter maybe I can help her dance.
Dance
Dance the night away.

(Ooo-wee) My blue jean baby,
She's the queen of them all.
She's the only one who makes me wanna rock and roll.
Don't wanna say good night
Dancing on a Saturday night.

Well the roller coaster...

(Ooo-wee...)
I wanna hold her tight,
Dancing on a Saturday night.

I'm gonna hold her tight
Dancing on a Saturday night.
(Ooo, watch her dancing
watch her dancing)
I wanna hold her tight
Dancing on a Saturday night
(Watch her dancing
oh, watch her dancing)

Blue jean baby (watch her dancing)
Blue jean baby (watch her dancing)
Dance dance dance (watch her dancing)
Dance dance dance (watch her dancing)
Blue jean baby (watch her dancing)

We spin the world like a pinball machine
We have thoughts of a life in abundance
Day and night we wish movies were real
And what is behind the screen is our entrance

I'm like a satellite
Transmitting different eras
I am the voice of the next generation
Completely digital
Create synthetic auras
Start a revolution now

You will never have to cry
'Cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
But everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold
You do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
Erase return in a digital world

I know it feels like you are part of a dream
You can fly and fight wars without judgement
You respawn and mistakes will repeal
But you will always be searching for an answer

I'm like a satellite
Transmitting different eras
I am the voice of the next generation
Completely digital
Create synthetic auras
Start a revolution now

You will never have to cry
'Cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
But everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold
You do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
Erase return in a digital world

Start a revolution now
Start a revolution now

You will never have to cry
'Cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
But everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold
You do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
Erase return in a digital world

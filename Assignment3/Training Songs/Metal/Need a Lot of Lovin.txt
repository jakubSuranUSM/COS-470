Mighty fine woman
Need her by my side
So I can rock and roll it
I can feel my pride

I gotta find a chicken
Gotta make up to
But I ain't no telling Sally
That I'm feeling blue

Don't let go
'Cause ya got me going
You're moving fast
And there ain't no slowin' you

I need a lot of lovin'
Gonna have a lot of lovin'
Need a lot of lovin' tonight

Early in the morning
To the middle of the night
Gonna rock it to the rhythm
Of the early morning light

With my baby boogalooin'
And the feeling's getting strong
Gonna keep it in the move
Until the darkness come along

Don't let go
'Cause ya got me going
You're moving fast
And there ain't no slowin' you

I need a lot of lovin'
Gonna have a lot of lovin'
Need a lot of lovin' tonight

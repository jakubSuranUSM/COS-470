A story is told that in Asgard of old
was a hammer of great might
By the furnace light in the depth of night
there was cast an ingot of old

Can you hear the hammerhead in the wind [x2]

They hammered on wrought and the rune spell caught
and engraved upon it's shaft
With a head of steel beneath which all men would kneel
and would lay down the sword at last

Can you hear the hammerhead in the wind [x2]

[STICK:]
They laid on the anvil, a steel cold bar
Needing no fire nor file
But their sledgehammers, like thunder rolled
And sindre sang runes by the fire

[SOLO]

[REPEAT STICK]

Can you hear the hammerhead in the wind [x4]

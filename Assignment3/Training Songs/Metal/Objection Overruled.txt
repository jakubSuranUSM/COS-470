Members of the jury
Your conclusion has been drawn
Defendants should be sentenced
But you just let 'em go

The city is a time bomb
The judge has lit the fuse
Vigilante breakout
Gotta tighten up the noose

Your honor, please
We want the truth 
Nothing but the truth
Your honor, please

Objection overruled 
Let's hang 'em high
Overruled 
Horsewhip 'em

I call upon the nation
To take the witness stand
Too long you've stood in silence
Now justice will be done

Hey you, the jury members
You let the people down
We trusted your sincerity
One finger at the law

Your honor, please
We want the truth 
Nothing but the truth
Your honour, please

Objection overruled 
Let's hang 'em high
Overruled 
Horsewhip 'em

The judge's hammer falls
Eruption in the court room
The cry goes up, "It's anarchy!"
Just stick your bloody rules

The judge's hammer falls
Let's loot them out of office
Some heads are gonna roll
The cry goes up, "It's anarchy!"

Your honor, please
We want the truth 
Nothing but the truth

Objection overruled 
Let's hang 'em high
Overruled 
Horsewhip 'em
Objection overruled 
This is a travesty of justice
Overruled 
Appeal to a higher court

Objection overruled 
Let's take it to the senate
Overruled 
In the name of sanity
Objection overruled 
Are you crazy
Overruled 
Are you crazy

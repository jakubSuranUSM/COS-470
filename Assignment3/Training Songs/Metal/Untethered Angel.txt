You built this world around you, your universe
In spite of best intentions, things could not be worse
Chaos and fear left you hangin' by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Givin' up yourself won't set you free

Misgivings and dismay, nightmares of wasted days
Can't live your life this way, something needs to change
Healthy, accepting thoughts, intent on driving us
Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

Fear can't live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Givin' up yourself won't set you free
Set you free

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart, be set free

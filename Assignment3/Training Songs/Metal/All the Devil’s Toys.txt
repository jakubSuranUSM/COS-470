Come here I'm gonna tell you how this will end.
Come here I'm gonna drag you down as they ascend
Guns go off and acid rains down, the face of this town
Blood and dirt and dirty blood money, an explosive sound

The whole ground cracks
From the oil and the blood on the tracks because

All the devil's toys
(Now you're gonna see them)
When I bring you this
All the devils toys
(Now you're gonna hear them rise)

Listen I'm gonna take you to where it starts
Listen I'm gonna lead you to the dead at heart
Charlatans ride and libertines run and the dollhouse flames
Cars are burning and citizens crawl and the mercury drains

The whole ground cracks
From the oil and the blood on the tracks because

All the devil's toys
Now you're gonna see them
When I bring you this
All the devils toys
Now you're gonna hear them rise
Taste the devil's kiss

All these courtesans' eyes
Some secret, some cold

And their will is like ice
It's dark, it's bought, it's used and it's sold

Can you hear his voice, it sounds of vengeance
Can you hear the noise, it is an anthem there

Death's face will break your fists, if you try to resist
Death's face will break your fists, if you try to resist

All the devil's toys
Now you're gonna see them
When I bring you this
All the devils toys
Now you're gonna hear them rise

All the devil's toys

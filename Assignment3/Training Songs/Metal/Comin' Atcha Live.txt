(Keith, Hannon, Wheat)

I'm a mean machine, I'm the kind you don't wanna meet
My middle name is trouble, I'm a danger in the street
My motor's in overdrive, I got my pedal to the floor
Never get enough, always comin' back for more - yeah yeah

Here I come, better step aside
Here I come, I'm comin' atcha live, comin' atcha live

I'm the one you want, I never give a warning twice
Anything could happen like the rollin' of the dice - now!

Here I come, you better step aside
Here I come, comin' atcha live

Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - oh here I come

Come on!

[Solo]

Comin' at you live - I'm comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - comin' atcha live
Comin' at you live - oh here I come
Comin' at you live - step aside, oh step aside

Ow! Ow! Oh yeah, here I come - here I come!

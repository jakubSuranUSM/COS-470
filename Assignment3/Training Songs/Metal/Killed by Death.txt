Shut up!

If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventurer
And a reptile too

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
 
I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!

Killed by death, Killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
Come on, I said you're killed by death
Come on!
Killed by 

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Aah!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by a bunch of death!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Shout out your mouth, shout out your mouth!

Come on!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
I'm dead, I'm dead
Dead, dead, dead, killed by death
Aah!

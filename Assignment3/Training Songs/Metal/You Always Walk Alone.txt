When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back

There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
And I reveal what I have loved before

There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

[Chorus]
The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone

Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why

He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

You... you cannot hide
You... you cannot describe your feelings inside

[Chorus]

What's the slave to the hero rock?
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
Makin' sparks for the pyro jock
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
Or givin' light to the light and dark
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
In the city there's a sound
It's a seesaw goin' down

All abord for the check out line
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
Trust in Him and it'll work out fine
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
In the city there's a sound
It's a seesaw goin' down
Every moment has a place
It's a cage with a gaze

Well, if you're there tell me where you are
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
I can walk if it's not too far
Doesn't anybody know what's right?
Take it easy, it's okay
I'm believin' what you say (what you say?)
What ya knew I can dare
Where we hollered am I there?

In the city, yeah, there's a sound
It's a seesaw goin' down
Every moment has a place
It's a cage with a gaze

You couldn't hold your mouth to stop the sound
With all these riches on the tip of your tongue
And I was trying to dampen it all out

You were talking louder than I should here
Producing nothing but all these mirrors
And I was trying to play it all down

With eyes of blood
These kisses won't rust
Where the baptized drown
We used to breathe

Underneath the red
Come running back to me

Sad song, so wrong
Your body shakes for so long
Towing me down
Let's just stay late
A safe bet for second place
This time, our time, we have, we'll last

That evil, a brutal sickness brings
At times you can't let go
It chases you from everything
To settle for almost anything 
It's times like these 
When you should only choose just not to speak

And the clouds don't break when the sun is on empty

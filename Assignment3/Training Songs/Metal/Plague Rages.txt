Scale the inferno, take it all in
Am I right or wrong, or just confused?
Glamorized, dare I say it?
Fantasized, but through who's eyes?
Not theirs, that's for sure!
Rebuff beliefs that we've lost.
A plague rages in all our hearts.
Am I the last in line?
To stop and turn, and pretend that we're really changing.
I'd sooner DIE!...........

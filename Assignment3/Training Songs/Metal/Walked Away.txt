Feels so cold to be abandoned
I can't see past what you have done
Memorized how they fade away
Now you want to come back
I walked away from you
No fuckin' tears for them lost years
I took the pain then I turned it to hatred
So dead to me
No fantasy
My own blood is the enemy remedy
Long gone test me be strong
Let me move on
Kill the memories
That I see only tragedy
From his belt to his hands to his fist
I can't believe this
I can't forgive this

I locked you out
These years
This hatred
Cries in my head
You died in my head

Steady coming with that friendly fire
Shooting me down
Two caps to the back
Dropped face first
Hit the ground 
Never around
So in the fucking mind you're dead
And now that you're alone you want to be my friend to
Foe
Who got control
Now I'm the one that's walking away
So what do you gotta say
Lying bruised and beat
Kicked to the curb
You're not my father don't bother because you never were
Take that motherfucker

[chorus]

Striving forever to find who I am
Striving forever to find who I am
Abandonment how I can taste it
My resentment time to face it
On my knees oh god replace it
Can't believe it I can't take it

On the brink of a break down
No love found in my soul
Straight from the get go
Nothing left in this heart
Just a motherfucking stab in the back
Back in my life
Yeah right

[chorus]

Stabbed in the back
Filled with hate
Nothing else to say
'cause I walked away

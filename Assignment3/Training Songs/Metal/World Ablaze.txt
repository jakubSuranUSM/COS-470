Can you feel it?
The expectancy of our deepest desires
In one moment, in one second
Watch it all burn

You and I will stand as one
You and I will be transformed
This is the promise, this is the gift
We hold this truth

Shed the weight of the world
The burden has been lifted
Let it all fall

Set this world ablaze
We alone remain
Don't fear what awaits
We alone remain

You and I will stand as one
You and I will be transformed

Shed the weight of the world
The burden has been lifted
Let it all fall
Let it all fall

Set this world ablaze
We alone remain
Don't fear what awaits
We alone remain

Let the skies turn black, let the infection burn
This is the new beginning, embrace eternity

Let it all fall
Set this world ablaze

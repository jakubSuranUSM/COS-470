Eye to eye, face to face
Still we don't see them, we look away
Still they cry, but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom they deserve
Let the world listen closely
I say, its time to cross the lines of culture
Birth bringing on poverty
They keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves, we'll fight for them
Its time to fight the silence (go)
Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
But we can raise our voice and bring it to an end
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Set the captives free
Fight, fight, fight the silence
They're a slave to a system of apathy
Bought and sold
They're right to life has been taken away
Bought and sold
Bring an end to slavery
Open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes
Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer
Will somebody take a stand
Against a system that's been designed to deny
Its victims their right to life
Let's set the captives free
When all is said and done, we'll see justice come
Its time to fight the silence (go)
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence
Fight, fight, fight the silence
Its time to fight

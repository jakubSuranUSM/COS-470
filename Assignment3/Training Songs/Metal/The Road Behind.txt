Well I'm traveling down the road
And I'm carrying that heavy load I walk around in a stupor Sleazy,
I can't do the show
Hanging out backstage
I'm in a homocidal rage I signed a million dollar contract
I puked on every page
Slaughtered half the crew
Caused they ate the deli-tray
Oh Baby hey
Said I'd do the show but I Canceled anyway
[Chorus:]
You were road kill baby Till I scraped you in my arms
Just another wattle flapping
On the old turkey farm
So baby....
[Second Chorus by Beefcake]
[2nd Chorus:]
And while the wheels keep rolling
And another signpost gone
All along the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Like the sad whale song I'm on the road behind
Well there you have it baby I'm just a sensitive guy
why'know I snuffed a million planets
But I still find time to cry
Because there's more to life
Then making other people die
Like a little bloody tear
Running out my dirty little eye
And some things baby
They don't make no sense
Does it really matter if it bugs
Your parents?
[Chorus]
Now baby quit yer crying
Put those clown britches on
[2nd Chorus]
A sad whale song... sad whale baby

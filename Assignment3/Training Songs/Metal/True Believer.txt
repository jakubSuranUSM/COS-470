Every day about this time 
I lose my reason and my rhyme, 
Everything around me's getting clearer. 

Season's changing quickly, 
My attitude is strictly here and now 
The time is getting nearer. 
  
But it's all right now 
To run along with me 
Maybe I'll make you see. 
I'm a true believer, 
A true believer, baby 
Any time or any place at all. 
  
No matter what you heard before 
You never know just what's in store 
Until you've found the road you're taking. 
But even now I'm killing time, 
Believing you were only mine, I guess, 
That rules were made for breaking. 
  
Maybe time will tell 
If you learned your lessons well. 
So, have some faith in me. 
I'm a true believe, 
A true believer, baby, 
Any time or any place at all. 
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby 
Any time or any place at all. 
 
Then in your sleep I saw you crying. 
But I knew, those tears were not for me. 
  
But it's all right now 
To ride along with me. 
Maybe I'll make you see. 
  
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby. 
Any time or any place at all 
I'm a true believer 
A true believer, baby, 
Any time or any place 
I turn around and I see your face 
Any time or any place at all 
True believer, true believer, true believer.

Hark the frozen chimes of winter
Crystal shimmer in your mind
To the first time when you saw her
You implored her to be kind

In the open fields around you
All before you gone to ground
Both the question and the answer
Deep inside you, you shall find

And while you're strollin'
Through the summer of your years
Enchanted, a garden overgrown

Don't call me sentimental
Those of you who care
Could find there a lover and a friend to the end

And if you're taken
By the spirit of your age
No reason to carve the cornerstone

Sway me, trade me
Your philosophy
First you're sowin', then you're growin'
Then you reap until you sleep

Will you scale the silver studded mountain?
Where contemplation will spring to mind
See the veiled prophet's withered gaze reflect the 'Nouvelle-vague'
Glazed visions imprisoned in your mind

Unwinding rivers flowing through the meadows to the sea
Paths of glory through shifting glades to fall
Present laughter and the memory of troubles you have seen
It is written in your mind

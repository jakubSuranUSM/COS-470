Abandon this search for an ultimate reality
Your words only used to conceal the true meaning
Never speaking from the heart
As you've built a wall of lies, silence falls

Awakened all that you despise
These lies, our chosen roles
Force-fed your values and your goals
Why? You won't see

Truth : unity
Bound eternally
Reincarnation of the eternal soul
This struggle forever in our blood boils

Withstanding these attacks
Lay waste to all your claims
Kept chained no longer
Finding strength in all your shames

These lies our chosen roles
Force-fed your values and your goals
Why? You won't see
Truth: unity

Bound eternally
Forgiveness for those who stray
Protection through unity
Forgiveness for those who stray

Protection through unity
These lies, our chosen roles
Force-fed your values and your goals
Why? You won't see

Truth : unity
Bound eternally
Forgiveness for those who stray
Protection through unity

Forgiveness for those who stray
Protection through unity

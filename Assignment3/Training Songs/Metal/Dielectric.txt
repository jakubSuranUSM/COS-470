Electrocution
I will intensify
For which division
Your power I divide

Disconnected
All that time
In this conflict
'Til the end of time

'Til the end of time

Confluctuation
This will be energy
On my division
Throughout eternity

My dishonor
All my powers too
My distortion
Always perfect through

I will never pray
Or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins
Dielectric strength

Dielectric strength

It's too late to resist
My free will must exist

Or we'll be the avalanche
Plaguing your world to collapse

Or will be the avalanche
Plaguing your world to collapse

My dishonour
All my powers too
My distortion
Always perfect through

I will never pray
or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins
Dielectric strength

I will never fade
Will never fade
I resist the pain
Resist the pain
Flowing through my veins
Through my veins
Dielectric strength
Dielectric strength

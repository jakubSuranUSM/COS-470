Life's tragedies, leaving mental scars
Tortured by fear
Viciousness breeding emptiness

A sickness of the soul, emotions mummified
Affliction of dementia, compassion nullified

A weakened state of being
Which leaves the sences numb
Victimized by despair
And unrelenting depression

The death of innocence
Virtue's decay
Engulfed by selfishness
As the soul begins to fade

Overcome by subconscious urges
Driven to sadistic release
A wretched fleeting existence
Devoid of humanity
Destroyed by years of defilement
Conscience devoured

Drawn into infamy
Sanity decomposed
Scourge of subconsciousness
Erosion of soul

Metamorphosis
Cynical and inhuman
The mind desensitized
By traumatic evolution

Compelled into derangement
By a life of atrocities
Overcome by subconscious urges
Driven to sadistic release
A wretched fleeting existence
Devoid of humanity

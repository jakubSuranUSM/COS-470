When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by, I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged Or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing Through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass

Oh, ah, it kick start my heart
I hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this, to rock

Oh, yeah
Kick start my heart Give it a start
Oh, yeah, baby, Oh, yeah
Kick start my heart Hope it never stops

Oh, yeah
Kick start my heart Give it a start
Oh, yeah, baby Oh, yeah
Kick start my heart Hope it never stops
Oh, yeah
Kick start my heart

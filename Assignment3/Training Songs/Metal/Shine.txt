Throw away all my skin
Feel all the lies set in
Now I'm drowning inside
Reaching for your life
It's gonna shine the day that you're dead and gone
I'll move all the dirt away for your cold worm hole
You'll never leave from here
So give into the fear
It's gonna shine the day that you're dead and gone
I'll move all the dirt way for your cold worm hole
Then you'll have nothing to say when you're all alone
It's gonna shine the day that you're dead and gone
Tried to feel my skin again
Found the hold you left back when
Now I have the scar to show that you were here
Tried to feel my skin again
Found the hold you left back when
Now I nail the box to put you away again
Now you're drowning inside

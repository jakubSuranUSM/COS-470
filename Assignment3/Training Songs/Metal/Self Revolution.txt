I can't comprehend society's movement
The regression of human existence
This is the quest of life
Fulfill your destiny

Slow down this fast paced world
And you will see past the illusion

Breaking the foundation
Collapse the control
Building a revolution to heal nations
It starts within you

Slow down this fast paced world
And you will see past the illusion

Breaking the foundation
Collapse the control
Building a revolution to heal nations
It starts within you

In this search for I and I the truth is always deep inside
(Reversal of oneself finding the truth)

This is the quest of life
We must find the strength for a new movement
Slow down this fast paced world and you will see the revolution
For a new movement

In this search for I and I the truth is always deep inside
(Reversal of oneself finding the truth)

Slow down this fast paced world and you will see the revolution
For a new movement

Sea full of diamonds, good morning new day 
I'll fix us breakfast, and the newspaper says 
The company will lay off 5000 souls today 

"I wish I was a child with no worries back then", I say 
"Kiss me and smile", you reply, in your way 
You wake up the children for school, for the last time 
For suddenly our beautiful life blurs away and the world breaks into pieces 

'Cause today the sea came in. 
The wave came and stole my loved ones 
I write these lines alone 
On the rooftop of my home 
I'm adrift on the vast oceans, can you feel me? 
I will not see you again, even if I live through 
The day when the sea came
Day when the sea came 
Day when the sea came in
I trace the scenes our children once played 
Names carved in wood, all the words, bound to fade 
I believe, my love, your memory and dreams deserve to live again tomorrow 

My love
We built this world together, we lived in here together 
And shared the fun together, bore the sorrows, all together 

My friend
We'll win the fight together, we'll lose the game together 
Greet the heroes all together, and forever, we'll remember 

My world
We built this world together, we lived in here together 
And shared the fun together, bore the sorrows, all together 

And as long as we're together, in spirit, yet together, 
You're the air that I am kissing 
You will always be there
I can feel you in the wind
I can feel you in the wind

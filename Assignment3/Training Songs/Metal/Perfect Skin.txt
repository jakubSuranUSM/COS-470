You got a perfect skin
With a Devil's grin

Say hello to the pretty eyes
Say hello to the devilish strides
You got the looks, baby
I could die
You got the looks
You got a murder style

(Perfect)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby
(Your skin, perfect skin)
It's getting hot
Who's going to rescue me?
Nothing here
You got a perfect skin
With a devil's grin

Say hello to the pretty eyes
Say hello, perfect alibis
Shake your hips, baby
I could die
Shake your hips
You got an L.A. style

(Perfect)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby
(Your skin, perfect skin)
It's getting hot
Who's going to rescue me?
Nothing here
You got a perfect skin
With a devil's grin

You got a perfect skin
Lies like sin

Jenna, Paris, Jessica
Mara, Gene, Jonna

You got the looks, baby
I could die
You got the looks
You got a murder style

(Perfect)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby
(Your skin, perfect skin)
It's getting hot
Who's going to rescue me?
Its okay, that's alright now
But I ain't going to burn in flames
Let it go now, let it go now

(Perfect)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby
(Your skin, perfect skin)
It's getting hot
Who's going to rescue me?
You got a perfect skin
You got a perfect skin
With a devils grin

Perfect skin
With a devils grin
Perfect skin

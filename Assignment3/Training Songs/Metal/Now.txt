Now At this point in history
Now There's a chance of liberty
Now If we grasp what the future brings
Now Everyone could live like kings
Now With the power that's waiting there
Now Everyone could take a share
Now We can get what we dream about
Now Times are changing, there can be no doubt
For the first time in centuries
Maybe we can find some unity

[Chorus]
Now
Now

We don't want to hear about the enemy
Other human beings are all we can see

[Chorus: x3]

Now With the whole world on T.V.
Now You believe what you can see
Now If we make our feelings known
Now We can prove we are not alone
Now At this point in history
Now There's a chance of liberty
Now If we grasp what the future brings
Now Everyone could live like kings
There's a turning point in the world today
This is not the time to turn away

[Chorus]

It's going to be a struggle if you choose the fight
It's going to be a struggle 'til we all unite

[Chorus]

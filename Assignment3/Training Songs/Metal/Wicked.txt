Alone I traveled through the mountains
Led by a star fading west
When I came upon an ancient ruin of a church
And it was there I stopped to rest

Then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps
Crashed down on me like a wave
Whispering through the trees and eerie breeze
Carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave

In a whisper she said

[Chorus]
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

From the black and twisting shadows rose a woman
Beauty alluring to the eye
Oh her devilish grin, her moonlit skin
And long dark hair flowing down around her thighs

As she approached I felt the evil growing stronger
I waltz with the wicked within
Frozen in my place, she kissed my face
And in a storm of passion bathed me in sin

In the madness, she said,

[Chorus]

Then she weaved a mist, and cast me into the shadows

"Come with me, love eternally, forever mine"
"Set me free, in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever"

As so the light, cast down from the heavens,
Washed over me like wave
I awoke, it seems, from some crazy dream
Only to find I was standing at her grave

In my nightmare, she said

[Chorus]

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Don't ever leave me, never leave me

[Chorus]

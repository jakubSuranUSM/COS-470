Here we all stand on this canvas of white
Our palette holds but only one shade tonight
Silence snows in, in her wintery chill
Let’s paint the ground red with the blood of our kill

Kill
The battle goes

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

Hell hath no hold on a warrior’s mind
See how the snow has made each of us blind
Vibrant colors spray from new dead
Staining the earth such a beautiful red

Red
The battle goes
On and on
Make your stand

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

I’m left in the cold
As winter unfolds
The blood on my hands is my own

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

Silence in the snow
Silence in the snow

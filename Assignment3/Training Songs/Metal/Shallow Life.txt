I never thought I'd be a soldier
I take my place inside the battle
I've come to realize the journey's over
Realize that life is sober

Everyday I'm like a soldier
Waking up within the battle
And through the haze I live a dream that's better
Than what I feel inside diggin' in me

Suffer and darkness in my eyes against the light of chrome
I see the reflection of the ghost that I've become
Waiting behind the windows I resign to be alone
I want to feel alone and lost in this solitude

Shallow life
I'll stay close to the ground
Shallow life
The walls keep falling down
I close my eyes
I'll find my way around
In the shallow life

Welcome to the bottom line
Suffer and darkness in my eyes against the night of chrome
I get confused and all I hear is just myself
I will resign and search for peace of mind I'm on my own
I need to be alone and lost in this solitude

Shallow life
I'll stay close to the ground
Shallow life
The walls keep falling down
I close my eyes
I'll find my way around
In the shallow life

The walls keep falling
Shallow life
I'll stay close to the ground
Shallow life
The walls keep falling down
I close my eyes
I'll find my way around
In the shallow life
Shallow life
Welcome to the bottom line

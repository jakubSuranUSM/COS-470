When I hear your voice in my loneliness
I look back and see my memories
I take a little look back
Just a little look back
Remember she's fire and water in one
A hunter who kills or a prey on the run
It's just a little look back
Just a little look back
Everytime my thoughts
Bring me back to you
It always hurts me, baby,
Whenever I do I take a little look back
Just a little look back

[Chorus:]
What I need - I'll never get
All that you've left me is just a little look back
What I need - I'll never get
All that remains Is just a little look back
Why don't you come back?
Why did you leave me alone?
Only have memories to call my own
I take a little look back
Just a little look back

[Chorus:]
What I need - I'll never get
All that you've left me is just a little look back
What I need - I'll never get
All that remains Is just a little look back

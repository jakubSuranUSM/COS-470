See the man standing in the rain
Must be waiting for the train
All the people they stop and stare
But there's nobody there

Psychotic reaction
Hell in disguise
Psychotic reaction
The old man dies

Hearing words of things unspoken
The telephone is broken
All the people waiting in a line
Can you spare the time

Psychotic reaction
Hell in disguise
Psychotic reaction
The old man dies

See the man living in a tree
Hang a sign on me
Yeah, bad news on the doorstep - yesterday
Won't you come out to play

Psychotic reaction
Hell in disguise
Psychotic reaction
The old man dies

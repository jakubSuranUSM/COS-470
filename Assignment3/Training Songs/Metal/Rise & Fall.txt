A singer, once a singer sang 'bout bullshit and everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit, he's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive and lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive, well they killed him with a gun

Sometimes you're wrong by some things you have done
You see fate is too strong, nothing's won
No use for a fight if you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size like a live

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire but never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet but their parents told them stop
And then it all turned out peculiar he couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain when you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown by your own
Feelings your like, disappear over night
You sip up every grin free to win

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
You nearly go insane

A spaceman files the rocket, well that takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket but she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless, she did it with a chair

Sometimes you're wrong by some things you have done
You see fate is too strong, nothing's won
No use for a fight if you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size like a live

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
Ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
You better use your brain
So better use your brain

Rise, fall

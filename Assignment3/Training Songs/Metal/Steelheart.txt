Stone drunk and crazy I was running from his gun 
Caught me in the corner with that look of death, said you ain't my fuckin' son 
I said man, are you crazy? Let go of my hand 
Just because you put me in this world, doesn't make you understand 

You're a 16 year old punk, you think you know it all 
You still got dirt underneath your nose, for your Mama you still call 
Hey Boy, can you hear me? I want you to get out 
Go out and fight the world like I did and learn what life's about 
No, no, no, no, I won't come easy 

Look at yourself Boy, ain't nothing but a dirty bum 
Do nothin' all day just play that guitar, and hang around with all the scum 
Your hair's down past your shoulders, I can't even see your eyes 
You're lookin' at me but I can't even tell 
Whether or not you're sellin' me lies 

You think it's been so easy, never took time out to see 
I've been standin' for years lookin' for love 
But your bottle's your friend, not me 
Are you deaf? Can you hear me? I'm knockin' on your door 
When the sun goes down I'll be on the tracks, won't see my face no more 
No, no, no, no, I won't come easy 

Cause Daddy, I'm just like you, I've got a steelheart 

Yeah, you threw me to the lions to fight 'em all alone 
Like you do, I have to suffer, to find, find, find, find my way home 
Yeah I know I will survive, somehow I'll find a way 

Live or die I'll make a stand no no no no matter what they say 

Bring on the world now, I'm down and ready to fight 
I've grown stronger than dynamite 
You can throw me down and kick me, but you're never gonna see me run 
I'll pick myself right back up and load my guns 

[Chorus]
I'm a one man army, a two man fight 
I got a steelheart and I'll die for my right 
I'm a one man army, a two man fight 
I got a steelheart and I'll die 

I've been sleeping in the doghouse, I shower in the rain 
I fought through all the fire, no no no I feel no pain 

So take me as I'm now, I'm down and easy to fight 
I've grown stronger than a pit bull's bite 
You can throw me down and kick me, but you're never gonna see me run 
I'll pick myself right back up and load my guns 

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, I got a steel, I won't come easy, no 
I won't come easy, I won't come easy 
Steel, steel, steel, steel, steelheart 

I'm a one man army, a two man fight 
And I'll die, die for my right 
A one man army, a two man fight 
And I'll die with a stealheart

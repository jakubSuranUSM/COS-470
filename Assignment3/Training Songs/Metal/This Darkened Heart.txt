I've watched the days pass one by one until the fall of man
And seen the cynics feed the jaded merely scraps and bones
The kingdom shaken, it's foundation nearly turned to sand
With foolish faith in faulted leaders that I must disown

Now rise again, this darkened heart betrays what I've always held so dear
Now rise again, this darkened heart it bleeds fast for all my family
Now rise again, this darkened heart it bleeds fast for all humanity
Now rise again, this darkened heart condemns my soul

I've laid to rest the false belief of average stock in me
I'll not relent, no average destiny
I'll reach the point where mankind's sins no longer rest in me
A long hard road, this manifest destiny

I will not be held down

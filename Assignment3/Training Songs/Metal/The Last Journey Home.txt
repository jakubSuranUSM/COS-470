Strangers to reason, our bleeding hearts so cold
Life brings a change in season, fear will blind the soul
In the silence one moment alone
Cast away scattered far on the wasteland

Sever the soul from the forgotten sickness, escape this life
Challenge the dream before the long departed a mindless rhyme
Whoa, oh, oh
Hear the burning thunder roar
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh
Still lost in a fire storm
Tonight we feel the past return

Lost inside the dream, pass by the life we'll live forever
Still the wasted time left burning below
One thousand shattered voices, lost inside in endless wonder
Tonight her voice will take me home

Shine glorious we run, we stare into the blackened sky
Save the last command, the virtue blinding
So far beyond the sun, still burning with the fire inside
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home

Paralysed, intensified mutation, frustration
Everlasting lifetime in the underworld
We'll travel endlessly, deluded, disjointed
One man can't understand this sad misery

Whoa, oh oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh oh

They've taken my heart
They've taken my soul
And now we stand alone insanity

In time we'll see the past unwind
Alive, still wandering our fallen land
One more time we stare into the blackened sky
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel
One last time see our destiny revealed

Shine glorious we run, we stare into the blackened sky
Save the last command, the virtue blinding
So far beyond the sun, still burning with the fire inside
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home

Shine glorious tonight, still blinded by the blackened sun
Save the last command, forever rising
So far beyond they come, still burning with the fire inside
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home

I knew there'd be times like this
When I'd sit at home and reminisce
Oh how one's memory slips...
So I close my book
And sighing, take a second look
Sure enough - I'm quite alone
Still, there no sound
So I spin-a-disc around and around
And slide the needle in the groove...

Drive down any highway baby
But don't bid me adieu
Through a sea of twisting byways
I'll be trailing you
Eternity'll solve our problem
Take it as you may
And destiny will stand corrected
Should we connect some day

Another time - to spend
Another place - to go
Another love to share with you

Deep emotion springs from this life
Wells up inside
Quick, pick me up and pour me over
The clouds crying by

Another time - to spend
Another place - to go
Another love this time it's true

Anyway you want me lover
Used to be your tune
I looked you up - you looked me over
My lucky strike won through

I was cut, dried and discarded
Just a rusty blade
But since I found my four leaf clover
I've seen the light again

All the tears
In the world
Seem to fall from you
At their
Rainbow's end
A halcyon day
Or two
How soon
We fool ourselves
How slow
We tread
Astral planes
Collide head on
And on and on we glide
As if forever

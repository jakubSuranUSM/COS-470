Hey, you little fool, come down to me and see
Show you my world of things you never meant to be
Don't fear, just crave for all things for you to come
If you won't be the same before the night is done
So, look all through my place, say, isn't it nice?

Got sick and tired, my job is done
I give this life and go to start another one

Hell for sale!
Come down you won't believe it
Hell for sale!
You can buy it
Hell for sale!
I know you won't leave it
Hell for sale!

So as you're here I think you feel its special charm
It's dirty cheap and weather proof
Forever keeps you warm

(Public Sale)
OK, we start with the first offer at 10 quid
Who bids more?
12 quid!
12? For Hell? You gonna be jokin'!
No!
OK, you got it!!!

He's The Man
He is the king of our land
With golden heart and iron hand
He rules
He's the saviour

He's taking care of our lives
His black eyes know to hypnotize
He leads
Through his behaviour

With golden wings on glory ride
He rose the iron sword
We all are here to pay tribute
And celebrate the lord

He's the man
He fights for law and order
He's the man
And standing one for all
He's riding for our liberty
Beyond the fear and agony
He will be the saviour of us all
He's the man

The scepter's rising for a sign
The chalice full of bloody wine
Beloved king,
We salute ya'!

The jester does exhilarate
There is no time to hesitate
We know
We 'll ride forever

The path of glory never ends
We keep the faith of fame
The iron sword is riding on
Hallowed be thy name

Marching in the darkness
Standing side by side
All the gods of thunder
Blinded by the light

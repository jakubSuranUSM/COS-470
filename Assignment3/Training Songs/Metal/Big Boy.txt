The earth is shaking, so am I
If you don't run, it's suicide

Big boy, big boy

My name is David, he don't care
He's never nice, he's never scared

Big boy, big boy

Big boy comes around
Throws his weight around
Throws our girls around
Leaves without a sound

Big boy, big boy

He's well-equipped, the girls are sure
Is that a guess, or something more

Big boy, big boy

We're bored to tears until he comes
And then we're crying cause he's come

Big boy, big boy

Big boy comes around
Throws his weight around
Throws our girls around
Leaves without a sound

Big boy, big boy

The earth is shaking, so am I
If you don't run, it's suicide

Big boy, big boy

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be your emptiness
I wanna be the god who kills
I wanna be the christ who dies
upon the fires
of infamy
can't you see it
can you feel it

until you call on the dark

can't you see it now
how black your future will be
and every emissary that i send you will bleed

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be the christ who dies
upon the fires
of infamy
can you see it
can't you feel it

until you call on the dar

Say hello to the city life,
Say hello to your dreams.
Say hello to the candy man,
Say hello to your rock 'n roll queens.
The painted ladies of the evening,
Will show you what you wanna see.
For a dime or a dollar,
Well, you can ride in a limousine.
Rock City, Rock City,
See what you wanna see.
Rock City, Rock City,
Be what you wanna be.
Rock City, Rock City,
See what you wanna see.
Rock City, Rock City,
Be what you wanna be.
Yeah!
Well all the fancy cars, and all the funky bars.
Feel the fire burnin' under your feet.
When the smoke clears honey, you ain't got no money.
Then you'll start to feel the heat.
Rock City, Rock City,
See what you wanna see.
Rock City, Rock City,
Be what you wanna be.
Rock City, Rock City,
See what you wanna see...oh my god !
Rock City, Rock City,
Be what you wanna be...yeah, yeah.
Oooh, come on, uh.

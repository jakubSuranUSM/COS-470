Gently you are tying
The strings around my neck
'Round my arms, 'round my legs
Like a flesh marionette

When you whisper in a sweet voice
To give up my own will
So my life will be eternal
And of grace as never seen

And you wanna drain me
'Cause you bought yourself a man
I'll be free within a single thought
'Cause I'm clean in spirit and mind
And I am deaf for a serpent's speech
That is always singing from a twisted mind

I'll never ever have a second thought
To slap you in the face with the glove that's black
'Cause if you wanna fight, follow me
I'll fight you to hell and back, to hell and back

I will never ever have a second thought
Slap you in the face with the glove that's black
'Cause if you wanna fight, follow me
And I'll fight you to hell and back, to hell and back
'Cause it's easy to fight a mind that's black

Gently you are tying
The strings around my neck
'Round my arms, 'round my legs
Like a flesh marionette

When you whisper in a sweet voice
To give up my own will
So my life will be eternal
And of grace as never seen

And you wanna drain me
'Cause you bought yourself a man
I'll be free within a single thought
'Cause I'm clean in spirit and mind
That's why I'm deaf for a serpent's speech
That is always singing from a twisted mind

I will never ever have a second thought
To slap you in the face with the glove that's black
'Cause if you wanna fight, follow me
And I'll fight you to hell and back

Twisted minds breed twisted offspring
When lies become truth, the truth is black
If I was the last, I would walk proudly
And I would fight you to hell and back

Twisted minds breed twisted offspring
When lies become truth, the truth is black
If I was the last, I would walk proudly
And I would fight you to hell and back

There are secret tests 
Labs in east and west 
Working for their states 
On a second race 

Changing human genes, 
Building 'em new again 
To a perfect kind 
Modern Frankensteins 

It's a simple plan: 
They try to build a man 
That's more productive, 
More intelligent 

Perfect mind and body 

But it is no use 
Humanity will lose 
'Cause the greater mass 
Becomes a second class 

Nature's not to rule 
Those who try to do 
Could be the first to go 
When the mutants come 

Who would stop these slaves 
When they leave their cage? 
Then we'll meet our fate 
'Cause they're better, they've got 

Perfect mind and body

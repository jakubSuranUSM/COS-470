I've lived a long life
To get to where I am right here
I walked the long road
With just the wind through my hair
All I had was a smile
When I began to lose track
I walked on for miles
And I never looked back

I'm not the kind of guy
To get left out in the cold
I'll walk on forever
And I'll never grow old....

Don't want to live the real life
Workin´ nine to five
Find a piece of paradise 
Finally feel alive
I live my life to the fullest
I have no regrets
Don't have to stack the deck
To win all my bets

I feel the fire burnin´deep inside my soul
I'll hold on to my destiny and I'll never let it go

(Chorus)
'Cause I live my own life
Found what I set out to
And I'll never look back because....
I found PARADISE
Devote my whole life to
Never giving up again

Follow your heart, your mind, your soul

Hold onto your dreams and never let them go

I count the minutes
´Till I can run away
A little love and affection
You can feel the same way
Put your arms around me
And I'll show you the way
want to change your destiny?
Rewrite ancient history...

I feel the fire burning deep inside my soul
I'll hold on to my destiny and I'll never let it go

(Chorus)

Follow your heart, your mind, your soul

Hold onto your dreams and never let them go

I know...I've been searchin'
For that place to call my home
All of my life
It's been in my soul

Now I know

(Chorus – repeat twice)

Never giving up again

I live my own life

Found what I set out to

And I'll never look back because

I found Paradise

Devote my whole life to
Never giving up again

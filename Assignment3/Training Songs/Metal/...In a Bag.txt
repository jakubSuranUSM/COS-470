Get to get it out of me 
I feel it 
I feel let down 
Lay it out in front of me 
I feel it 
I feel it now 
Tie it up tie it up 
And throw it 
Throw it out 

Tie me up 
I'm cursing I'm searching 
Tie me down 
I'm giving up 
Tie me up 
I'm losing I'm drowning 
Tie me down 
In my shit 

I'm cursing I'm searching 
I'm giving up hoping 
I'm losing I'm drowning 
In my shit I'm floating 
It's after it's never 
It's too late for reason 
It's now or it's never 
It's over it's pouring out 

Tie me up 
I'm cursing I'm searching 
Tie me down 
I'm giving up 

Tie me up 
I'm losing I'm drowning 
Tie me down 
In my shit 

It's after it's never 
Tie me down 
It's too late 
Tie me up 
It's now or it's never 
Tie me down 
It's pouring out

It's a world that won't let you feel
You grow up very fast in sorrow
The drinking damage a parent provokes
Can ruin a child's tomorrow

No no no no do you feel you're abused
By a bottle of liquor
The alcohol will cause the fall

State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul

There's no support they don't care at all
You're lonely cause you feel abandoned
But there's a way
To heal the pain
With God again and again

You know I know
Keeping secrets from your friends
That your mothers sick
It's like I said being drunk is dead

State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul
And the soul of your children

You feel like you've always been walked on
And frankly I don't blame you a bit
I see your unhappiness and I say
No no no no

State of control
It never wants to let you go
State of control
Like chains around your body and soul

Woohoo...
She doesn't have to say, she only has to look.
I think she sees through me, reads me like a book;
And I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me.
And the love goes sailin' on, across the stormy seas.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm, I got my babe.
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'.
Woohoo... Woohoo...
Sometimes I go over the line, she has to bring me down;
And the pride pulls heavy, makes some evil sounds.
But I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me.
And the sea runs calmer now, I kiss the love that sleeps.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'.
O-O-Oh...O-O-Oh.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
O-O-Oh...O-O-Oh.

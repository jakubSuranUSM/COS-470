The tales that speak of frost and fire
The Frost Monstreme and the Fire Divine
The frost preserves and the fire destroys
Like pouring rain on the sands of time

I feel it burning and I feel the freeze
The frost, the fire, it burns inside of me

The tales that speak of frost and fire
The guardian angels and the demons of night
The power preserves and the Beast will destroy us
Like gathering darkness in the circle of light

I feel it burning and I feel the freeze
The frost, the fire, it burns inside of me, yeah

I feel it burning and I feel the freeze
The frost, the fire, it burns inside of me

The tales that speak of frost and fire
Tales of all the souls that fell
Words that burn and words that chill us
Like laughter kinding in the heart of Hell

I feel it burning and I feel the freeze
The frost, the fire, it burns inside of me
It burns inside of me, it burns inside of me

Silence, we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between

Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey

Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again

Silence, we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold

Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more

More's been empty for years
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again

Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you

Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

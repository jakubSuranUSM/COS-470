Tell me what I'm supposed to feel because I can't feel this
Sick and tired and it's all the same,
Same shit, different day, all day, every day
Wish you were perfect?
Well welcome to your fifteen minutes of fame
Come get it well it's hot, you want it, we got it, come get it now
Can you feel me now?
Tell me how I'm supposed to feel for you when all you do is hold me down?
Told me I'm nothing, well tell me what your thinking now
So back off 
Never more alone than all alone
I don't know where the hell I am
But they say there's a price to pay for asking questions
So I'm guessing and ending up where I began

I never got a second look before now
I was the one that you'd ignore
Now turn yourself inside out
Come on
Can you feel me now?

Tell me what I'm supposed to feel because I can't feel shit
Hollowed out and you wonder why?
"Too much, not enough, slow down, pick it up"
Genuine adrenaline keeping me high, so high
So walk your walk, talk your talk,
But as far as I can see
On the inside out your bout as ugly as me
'Cept now I'm fit to knock you down
Told me I'm nothing?
Tell me what your thinking now
So back off
Tell me what I'm supposed to feel for you
Turn yourself inside out,
Take a closer look inside
I think that you deserve yourself

Title match, main ring
No time to rethink,
You swim or you sink
You want it, we got it, come get it

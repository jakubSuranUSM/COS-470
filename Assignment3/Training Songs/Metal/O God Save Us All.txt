I’ve had a bad three days
Coming off of a bad three years
I’ve had nothing but time
For me to think about how
Things aren’t always as they appear
You know the sun will always shine

With every dream that I chase
Watch it all be erased
And just like trying to capture the wind
In the hole we find ourselves in
And it’s sinking

Misguided
Divided
We have nowhere left to fall
O GOD SAVE US ALL
Mistaken
Forsaken
With our backs against the wall
O GOD SAVE US ALL

I’ve been asleep forty days
Been awake forty long nights
My life is stuck in rewind
If I don’t think about
These trials just disappear
My apathy turns out just fine

I’m on a road of regret
The pain I’d like to forget
Like somebody left the record
Stuck on repeat
So that just when you think it’s over
It keeps screaming

Misguided
Divided
We have nowhere left to fall
O GOD SAVE US ALL
Mistaken
Forsaken
With our backs against the wall
O GOD SAVE US ALL

Misguided
Divided
We have nowhere left to fall
O GOD SAVE US ALL
Mistaken
Forsaken
With our backs against the wall
O GOD SAVE US ALL

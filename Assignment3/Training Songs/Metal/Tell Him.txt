I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that man gets into your blood
Then go out and get him
If you want him to be
Always by your side
If you want him to

Always think of you, you got to tell him
That you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that man gets into your blood
Then go out and get him
If you want him to be
Always by your side
If you want him to

Always think of you, you got to tell him
That you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

Ever since the world began
Been that way for man and women
Were created to make love our destiny
Then why should true love be
So complicated?

I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that man gets into your blood, straight
Go out and get him
If you want him to be

Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

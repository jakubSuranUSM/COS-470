My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you

Another day another dollar 
Another day another dollar
Another kill for the corporate collar
Why I wake and why I bother

I run second to no-one and no-one to me
I run second to no-one and no-one to me
I can't see it to be it to be it to be
I can't be what the world can't be to me
I wake up and the world just steps on me 

My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you

Another day another dollar 
Another page another chapter 
Ain't I one to kill the laughter

Whatever matters if it matters it matters
Whatever matters if it matters it matters to me
Whatever matters it should matter and matter to all

The bigger we build the bigger the faster we fall
And if it happens to one it happens to all
Remember me when the world comes to take you 

The more I look the more I learn
The more I learn the more I can discern
The more I look the more I want to know
The more I know the more I want to grow
The more I feel the more I want to see
The more I see the more I want to be
The more I look the more I realise

I see this world is facing her demise 
Money God
Money God
Money God
Rise and shine 

I wake up it's enough I wake at all
Hate to have to say it but some don't wake at all
Money money the hand that plays us all
The new day and these eyes never fail me
I run second to no-one and no-one to me
I can't see it to be it to be it to be
I can't be what the world can't be to me
I wake up and the world just steps on me 

My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you
My God it's good to see you
Another day another dollar

I can't see you when you're here
I can feel you when you're near
Hiding somewhere deep inside my head, you breathe my silent thoughts
Smell your breathe, somewhere near you soar
Saw your smile, it left my soul to die
You can't make me do your deeds
Never gonna feel your greed
I can feel you're there between the lines
Faceless at the time
Wounded smile, choose among the lies
Saw your smile, it left my soul to die
Jesus Christ, please stab my eyes
Jesus Christ Jesus Christ

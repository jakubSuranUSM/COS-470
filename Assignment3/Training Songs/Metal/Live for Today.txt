They thought you were crazy
When you took a walk right through the door
They don't know the reason
You just couldn't take it anymore
The lies that they told you
And the times that they sold you
Down the line

Live for today - don't need your politician
Live for today - don't want no inquisition
Live for today - you gotta throw the rules away

You gotta, you gotta
Live for today - don't need your politician
Live for today - don't want no inquisition
Live for today - you gotta throw the rules away

Counterfeit city
Spending your life in their charade (sorry for yourself)
Sincerely phony
This musical masquerade has gone too far far far
You sold your clothes
Now it's cold up your nose
And you froze

Live for today - don't need your politician
Live for today - don't want no inquisition
Live for today - you gotta throw the rules away

Live for today - don't need your politician
Live for today - don't want no inquisition
Live for today - you gotta throw the rules away

Gotta gotta gotta gotta
Live for today - don't need your politician
Live for today - don't want no inquisition
Live for today - you gotta throw the rules away
You gotta live for today
You gotta throw it away
Gotta gotta live for today
You gotta throw it away
Get out of my way
I'm only live for today
Live for today
Throw it away...

I've given up
On society
Up on my family
Up on your social decease
I've given up
On the industry
Up on democracy
Done with all your hip-hop crusade
All the decay
I've seen all of the lies
I hate it
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I've given up
On the media
Feeds my hysteria
Sick of living down on my knees
I've given up
On morality
Feeds my brutality
F*ck what you think about me
All the decay
I've seen all of the lies
I hate it
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I won't change for you
And I can't take the pain
There's nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
I've given up
On everything
Up on everything
Up on everything
I'm wasting here
Can anyone
Wash it all away?
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
I'm wasting here
With everyone
Just wash it all away
I'm waiting here
For anyone
To wash it all away
Wash it all away
Wash it all away

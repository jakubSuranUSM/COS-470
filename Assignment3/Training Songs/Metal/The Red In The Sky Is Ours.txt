Hunger, the word of wolves
Rhythms collapse against closed doors
Hearts frozen in time
Blood stains our sight
The red in the sky is ours

Hunger, soulrot
Thirst for higher rush of pain

Hands raised to theheavens
Oh, sing praise to the Lord of Rot
A kingdom burned by sins
The red in the sky is ours

Hunger, soulrot
Thirst for higher rush of pain

Black, the eyes of God they shine
As our victory coulors our sight
Blessed be thee, Queen of Crimson
The red in the sky is ours...Twilight is ours

Revoulution, the red in the sky is ours
The red in hte sky is ours 'till the end of time
Red

Louie Louie, oh baby, we gotta go
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Louie Louie, oh baby, we gotta go

Y'know, my little girl, she's waiting for me
Sail a ship across the sea
On the ship you know I'm all alone
I wonder if I'll ever make it home

Louie Louie, oh no, we gotta go
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Louie Louie, oh baby, we gotta go

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
I think of girls, oh constantly
On the ship, you know I dream that she's there
I smell the roses in her hair

Louie Louie, oh baby, we gotta go
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Louie Louie, oh yeah, we've gotta go

Let's give it to 'em, right now!

I see the Jamaica moon above
I don't know when I'm gonna see my love
I know I'll hold her in my arms and then
I'll tell her that I'll never leave her again

Louie Louie, a-cha-cha-cha-cha
Louie Lou
Oh, no, Louie Louie, oh baby, we gotta go
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

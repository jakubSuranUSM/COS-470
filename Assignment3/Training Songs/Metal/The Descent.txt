Why am I pissing blood 
I can't live I can't eat 
Time has risen land of the free 
It is no gift honesty 
It is my life don't promise 
Me shit drunk sad f*ck 
Live your life don't live mine 
Leave me alone I don't wanna be sane 
I don't wanna be saved 
I don't wanna be safe leave me alone 
Wait and see what you'll get 
The best is yet to come there 
Ought to be truth inside honestly 
I've nothing to hide you aren't 
The victim you are the plague 
I stand for freedom I'm not a slave 
Lost away locked inside here 
I stand the test of time time 
Has risen land of the fake it 
Is no gift honesty

Burning are the skies, blinding is sun, the Evil work is being done
The sea turned red, the land is warm - see the omens of the final storm
Biting wind, infernal chant, no dead is rising from the grave
Ferocious trance and frantic dance, all the dognas are falling apart

Absorption of the sun - apocalyptic flash
All forces from beyond the time now gathered on earth

For thousands of years the Evil has been penting up its rage
Waiting for so long with only aim to take revenge on Christ
Spreading the spawn (here on earth) of self-sacrificing beasts the darkness' breed
Preparing human kind to fight against the Holy Trinity and its greed

Serenity is tubid once and for all
With death's blessing I will win

Like living candles fighting winds from the abyss' depths
(It is only)insanity that can keep you from the stark reality
Evil perfection - all dead things are dying again
Like living candles fighting winds from the abyss' depths

Absorption of the sun - apocalyptic flash
All forces from beyond the time now gathered on earth

Serpent's eyes from the nest of filth derived
Raping fire inhales the Serpent's wisdom of The Incantations!

Sorrowful march of human crowds, infernal flames burning them down
Violent dirge from the abyss' gates, humanity your end has come!
Relics are past, religous signs blew down by a ust of rage
When ancient gates are open wide nothing can restrain the death

Absorption of the sun - apocalyptic flash
All forces from beyond the time now gathered on earth

There is a part of me that's always sixteen 
I've found the secret of eternal youth 
Some get high on life or money 
But there's an escape 
Drop out the race 
To walk through world by one's self 
You can't be protected 
Your trust is in whisky, weed and Black Sabbath 
It's goddamn electric 

(chorus) Don't waste your time embrace it 
And then you will know yourself 
The change in you is goddamn electric 

The weight of the world is lifted and parted 
My eyes roll blind to sights that distract 
Through tunnel vision and dope haired blinders 
I'll cut a path and evoke my will 
To walk through the world by ones self 
You can't be protected 
Your trust is in whisky, weed and Slayer 
It's goddamn electric 

(chorus) Don't fake your life inhale it 
And then you'll know yourself 
The change in you is goddamn electric 
Don't waste my time, embrace it 
And then you'll know yourself 
The change that is goddamn electric will focus the minds eye 

One hand on the bottle 
The other a shaking fist 
Rejuvenated, yet isolated, no pressure 
From the outside, my sight is goddamn electric 
And these eyes have seen a world 
An entire goddamn electric system 

(chorus)

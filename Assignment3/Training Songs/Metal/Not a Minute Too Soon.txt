I was pretending it was easy alone
I built a fortress to keep out the unknown
Surrounded myself with walls of rejection
Trapped in the dungeon for my protection

Your smile came shinin' through, so pure I knew

Not a minute too soon, your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon, your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time

Time after time I threw my heart away, my faith was fading fast day after day
I had enough of giving in
I couldn't lay down my pride so love just pushed me aside

Your kisses washed away my thirst, every touch felt like the first

Not a minute too soon, your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon, your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time

In this angry world, I thought loneliness would shelter me
My broken spirit cried in vain, till you set me free

Your kisses washed away my thirst, every touch feels just like the first

Not a minute too soon, your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon, your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time

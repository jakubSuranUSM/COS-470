Sanity and insanity
Go together hand in hand
But never be afraid
On which side of the line you stand
Take the power to get in control
It's you that rules your life
Break down the walls that are surrounding you
Be strong and change your life
Erase - The rules that are set there to keep you down
Break down - The chains that keep you to the ground
Erase
Erase - And follow me to where the real fun is
It is not a shame to be called insane
And to go against, against the grain
Demand the right to set your own rules
Not to walk the path of those who are lame
Erase - The rules that are set there to keep you down
Shout out - Your discontent, let your voice be heard
Erase
Erase - And follow me to where the real fun is
Do not adapt to others
Just be one with yourself
And walk with me equally
Erasing false mentality

Oooh

Up every evening 'bout
Half eight or nine
I give my complete attention
To a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my, she crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature
My TVC one five, he, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then we'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five

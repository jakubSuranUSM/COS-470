Come on everybody, see her play a 45
She's a rock'n'roller, makin' with the old hand jive
Someone's gonna feel the pain
Hit the floor, she's takin' aim
Is it you - is it you, is it me - is it me
Who's the next in the line gonna be?
Hot shot, what a lot
Someone gonna make you stop - yeah
Hot shot, got a lot
One by one you're gonna drop - yeah

Someone's gonna feel the pain
So hit the floor, she's takin' aim
Is it you - is it you, is it me - is it me
Who's the next in the line gonna be?

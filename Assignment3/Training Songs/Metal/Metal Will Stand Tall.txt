Come on baby

Oh, no no no no no no.

We crack it up, we hit the top.
We're moving through time.
We're thunderous, mysterious and glorious.
We're born to born to born to
To raise some hell.
We speed at night move out of sight.
We breake the chains.
Oh, yeah!

Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall.

We crash and burn.
We hit and run.
We make a stand.
From the ash into the fire.
See a phoenix rise.
See a phoenix rise.

Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall.

Yeah!
We stand tall!
Come on!

Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.

Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall.

Will stand tall, yeah!
Will stand tall!
Metal will stand tall!

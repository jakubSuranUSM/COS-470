Using your hands to murder
To fasten minds/that feel no mercy
And who knows us/who knows us?
Bound by diversion
Rehearsed/endlessly through time
Hindered/your life is measured
By those inhibiting your mind

Who's the scapegoat?
Who is labeled?
Who gnaws the desert/in frustration?
Now who's the scapegoat?
Who is labeled?
Who gnaws the desert/in frustration?

Bound by/diversion
Rehearsed/endlessly through time
Hindered/your life is measured
By those inhibiting your mind

Awe-inspired by murder
To trample dead/those who are subject to torture
And to hinder/to hinder

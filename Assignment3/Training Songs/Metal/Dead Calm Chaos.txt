Broken bones
Shattered temple bleeding wound bleed more
Beatless heart
Blackened clouds pounding rain rains more

I'll fight the pain
But all the time I fight it just hurts more

Strengthless feed
Sarcastic romance smiling clown that grieves
Horror dawn
Unshaped shadows lurking now hordes

So show me dead calm chaos

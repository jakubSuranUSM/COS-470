I'm heading right to nowhere, ''cause nowhere's where I'm from
I just passed your trail, Here and today, you were lucky to be in my way
Bring me wine women and whiskey, I'll chase it all down with rum
Once you're turned on, I'll be long gone, ''cause the road I'm on is endless and long

I'm the rebel on the run, my baby, Rebel on the run, my girl Got you under my gun
My future's buried behind me, I've only got my guns to guide me
Maybe to heaven, maybe to hell, I tell you, only the time will tell
Got you under my gun, my gun, Don't ask what I search for

You never should of an outlaw, I'm a refugee and I always will be
'Til I find what I once lost in me, I've spent my life rambling
Made myliving out of gambling, May sound romantic, but it's bitter and tragic
Dead or alive for any prize, I said dead or alive into the night
I have to race the time to find what's lost inside me

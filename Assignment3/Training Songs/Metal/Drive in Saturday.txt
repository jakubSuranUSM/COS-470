(Uh uh ah) Let me put my arms around your head
(Dom do ah) Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
(Dom do ah) Pour me out another phone
(Dom do ah) I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always buddy (got got do ah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do ah)
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do ah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do ah)
It's a drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work (dom do ah)
Neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation

(Bah dom bah) cursing at the astronette
(Dom do ah) who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Once had raised a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

His name was always buddy (got got do ah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do ah)
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do ah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do ah)
It's a drive-in Saturday

His name was always buddy (got got do ah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do ah)
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do ah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do ah)
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah, yeah

(Drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a drive in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir,
Yes sir
(It's a drive-in Saturday) dom do do do, dom do do do
(It's a drive-in Saturday) dom do do da, dom do do da
(It's a drive-in Saturday) yes sir
(It's a drive-in Saturday)

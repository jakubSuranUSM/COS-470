This is the year where hope fails you
The test subjects run the experiment
And the bastard you know is the hero you hate
But cohesing, it's possible if we try
There's no reason, there's no lesson, no time like the present
Tell me right now, what have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose? Except your soul?
Who's with us?
I fight for the unconventional
My right, and it's unconditional
I can only be as real as I can
The disadvantage is, i never knew the plan
This isn't just a way to be a martyr
I can't walk alone any longer
I fight for the ones who can't fight
And if I lose, at least I tried!

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots!

I won't be the inconsequential
I won't be the wasted potential
I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize, you'll never take a stand
It isn't just a one sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted
And I wont leave another victim deserted

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots!

Do you understand? (yes)
Do you understand? (yes)
Do you understand? (yes)
Do you understand? (yes)

Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)

We fight 'till no one can fight us
We live and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had spit back in their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots!

Do you understand (yes)
Do you understand (yes)
Do you understand (yes)
Do you understand (yes)

Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)
Say it again say it again (we wont die)

Unconscious, conscious
Your mind is trapped, your body is free
A senseless life in silence
Your eyes are closed, yet you see

Within your personal world you see
a realization of what could be my soul
or is it just my fantasy?

A timeless world unreal

Reach out for all you can not feel
Things you have seen at places that you have never been
Envision what turns out to be a part of life's history
Flashbacks of things to come
Past and future are one

Mind reflections
Mind reflections

Roam into the nowhere of pleasure
Behold through your inner eyes

Experiences of human nature appear on the screen of imagination
Seen by the restless mind
The source of subconscious vision

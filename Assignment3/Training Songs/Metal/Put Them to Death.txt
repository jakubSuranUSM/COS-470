Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there

Blood spewing from their eyes
As you hear their sinful cries
Destroy their evil minds
We should take their fucking lives
They should be caught and punished
For what they have done
Torture them slowly it would be fun
Kill them all off one by one

Let them go, no torture them slow
F*ck you, and your kind
We don't need you, or your lives
Execute by injection
Execution by electrocution

Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there

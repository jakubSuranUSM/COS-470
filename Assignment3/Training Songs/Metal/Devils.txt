Who told you about a man without fear
Who told you about a god who does not care
Who told you about a pain that does not hurt
Who told you about a love that turns to dirt 

Devils
You've got a face-to-face with your
Devils
You've got a race to race with your
Devils
You've got to find a place among your
Devils
You cannot replace your
Devils
Devils

Who told you about cause and effect
Who told you about a heart that can forget
Who told you about fortune and fame
Who told you that the evil has got no name

Devils
You've got a face-to-face with your
Devils
You've got a race to race with your
Devils
You've got to find a place among your
Devils
You cannot replace your
Devils
You can't deny
Devils
They'll get you in the night

You gotta ride on your rage with your devils

With the lights out
We'll be sitting pretty
Scream a pitiful scream

With the lights out
We'll be warm and willing
Better watch where I lean

When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all
You'll see nothing's gonna happen 
Overnight so please

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
When the lights are out
When I hear you sigh
Let me feel you warm breath on my neck
It makes me hit the sky
    
Oh, what a whisper
You can bowl me over
Blow a beautiful blow

With an answer
You can turn me under
Wind up ready to go

When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all
You'll see nothing's gonna happen
Overnight so please

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
        
When you gaze into a crystal ball
You'll see nothing's gonna change at all
You'll see nothing's gonna happen
Overnight so please

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

When the lights are out [Repeat x4]

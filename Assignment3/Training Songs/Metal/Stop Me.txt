When you see me you can't resist
You want my name on your telephone list
In your dreams and on your mind
Tonight's the night I could make you mine
Later on just me and you
I could make your dreams come true
You say for you I'm number one
Just meeting me is such fun

Oh no, you won't go, don't know what you're missin
You say, you won't stay, you stop me when we're kissin
Stop me when we're kissin

You come backstage to talk awhile
I want to party 'cause that's my style
Young & tight you're what I need
Your fantasies I want to feed
So come with me, back to my place
You know you've got such a pretty face
I'll show you how it is to be
Hanging around with a rocker like me

Tellin me you've gotta run
Cuttin out before the damage is done
Come on babe that ain't no fun for me

Cuttin down ain't where it's at
You're just a tease and that's a fact
No more talk it's going nowhere
And neither are you, you just sit and stare
Time to go I'll say goodbye
I thought I saw tears in your eyes
You watch me leave in my limousine
And you go home to your poster dreams

Little acts, little deeds for little minds
I'm a breed, I'm a breed of my own kind
Attitude, gratitude - I let that shit carry me
And do it every day until the muthafuckas bury me
And you think we dress and we act strange?
To un-change the words that we exchange
Take a deep breath; try to leave that shit unsaid
And step on the stage where I unleash the hatred

[Chorus]
Know who the f*ck you're talkin' to?
Know who the f*ck you're talkin' to?
Know who the f*ck you're talkin' to?
Know who the f*ck you're talkin' to?
Out of my way
Out of my way

Hypocrites, politics, and democracy
Governments overran by hypocrisy
There they go, there they go
All in my business, sellin' their souls, and they ask for forgiveness
And I think everybody better come clean
And raise up to the wrongs that are happening
Take a deep breath; try to leave that shit unsaid
And step on the stage where I unleash the hatred

[Chorus]

Get back
Get back, muthafucker, get back!

All the things you've been told that you keep inside
Find it easy to hide

I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound

Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream

Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher

This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn

Cada cosa que guardas dentro de ti
Es difcil mentir

I want to know what divides you
I only want you to lose
For the fear lives inside you
Listen to the sound

Of your dreams
Like whispers they scream

Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher

This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn

Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher

This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
Wake me from this dream
(Why don't you?)

Wake me from my sleep to find the
World's on fire
(Burn)
Trying hard to reach and still I
Can't get higher
(Burn)

This can't be a dream you see it
Cuts like wire
(Burn)
Wake me from this dream I want to
Burn

The wise women said,
Once your heart is in battle
There is no coming back
(Fight for Thor)
And before the attack
Feel your blood starts to boiling in your veins as you charge
(Hundreds fallen)

As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish Pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again

When our brothers have fought
Is where we will be proven
On ground stained by blood
(Standing tall)
And we know, if we fall
Our comrades awaits in Valhall
(Odin's calling)

As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish Pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again

First to the battle
First to the feast
Destiny waiting,
No retreat,
Retreat!

Swedish Pagans, marching a shore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again

This sickness, it burns inside me,It sticks in my throat, I'm gonna choke, I can not speak,

Besides it runs the fear of the unknown,
Could this be some reckoning,
Wrath for wrongs I've done commin back to haunt me, The God I have denied his power shown
But now I can't protest although defiant heart it pounds deep in my chest, I know that this will Have its way with me.
For now I chose to go,
I know it just the mind tryin' to interrupt my flow
Intentions all fall down,
My, soul, has, died...

Now this will not, die they warned me, inchurch when I was young I could rely,
If there's a God he's one I've never seen,
And now I just lament,
Did not heed the threat, I played the card that I've been dealt, Like putting out the fire, with gasoline,

For when I use I lose, won't face the fear of life without something abused, now that I'm forced to find another way,

My show, your final, show
A homicide I tried to warn, you should have known, 
Now I'll take you with me,
Show, You, MY, Pain..

Feed the need it's not greed,
I figure,  So what,
Can I fix the hole that resides deep in this, gut?
Well, I'll fix myself, whatever it takes, I cano not wait.

Come and get it, Come and get it, Get Some, I feed the need that twist my mind, time and time again, you think I play to win, I do know what I'm takin you know I'm fixin ta get some. 
Come and get it, Come and get it, Get Some...

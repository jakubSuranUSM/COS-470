Turn around, look at what you see
The world is fading away
Sadness is everywhere
And living in despair
How much longer can you stand the pain

See the face in the mirror of your dreams
Emptiness is all that's left
Sadness in your eyes
Take off your disguise
How much longer can you hide the pain

There is a place
That lives within our minds
A world o( human fantasy
Reach for the stars
Never look back again
You've got nothing to lose
Everything to gain
Fly with me
And what you see will be
Look upon your rainbow
Dream a dream
Don't let it slip away
In your hands
Lies the birth of a new day

When I look into your eyes
The world is there for me
The more I look inside
The more there is to see

Sun dunes all around me
The light knows that I'm free
Make believe I'm everywhere
Believe your here with me

The End

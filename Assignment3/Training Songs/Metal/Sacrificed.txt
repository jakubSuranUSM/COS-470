There's an evil wind blowing through my soul,
a firestorm that makes the mountains roll.
I can feel his might from day to night.
The fires of hell I can see them burning bright.
The time has come to take me away.
Way down deep to where the demons stay.
This day I see is my last up here.
I have no guilt and I have no fear.
I am off the earth. I am off the border.
I am never to return.
Victimized, I am his chosen
In hell I shall burn.

[Chorus:]
I AM SACRIFICED.
Deeper down down deeper down down deeper down.
Deeper down.
[repeat]

I seek for cold in this world of heat,
no longer a man in this world I am meat.
I have to pay for all human sins,
in this world where only evil wins.
Where evil wins.
I am off the earth. I am off the border.
I am never to return.
Victimized, I am his chosen.
In hell I shall burn.

[Chorus]

The thunder strikes much louder here...
The rain is boiling tears.
You can never guess what hell is like.
Until you're lying in his hearse!

[chorus]

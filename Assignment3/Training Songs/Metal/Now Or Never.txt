What'd you go and do that for
I see the way you're
Looking at me
And I don't know why

I don't know and I'm not sure
Have you lost your way
Did you lose your mind
Are you out of time
You say goodbye
Like everythings all right

If we go on it's now or never
If we go on
If we go on it's now or never
If we go on

What'd you go and do that for
I'm telling you so tell me
What's it gonna be

I don't know and I'm not sure
But sooner or later 
I want to believe
I want to believe
You say goodbye
Like everythings all right
It's now or never

The end is near, panic is closing in
Sick with fear, they run
Watch freedom's fall
What have we become? Cannon fodder

Reign of terror, enslave the nations, devastation
This is war, pull the trigger
One nation under their control

Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise

The end is here, feel it closing in
Blood runs red
Watch in horror, our lives destroyed
We failed

The final holocaust
Enslave the nations, annihilation
This is war, pull the trigger
One nation out of control

Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise

War, pain, suffering
The price we pay to stay alive
Blood, fire, death
His glory come, his kingdom rise
This world will burn, burn, burn, burn

Rise, the tyrants rise
The enemy inside, the tyrants rise

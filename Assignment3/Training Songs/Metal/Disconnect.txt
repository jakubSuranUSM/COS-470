Behind closed doors all you live for is taking
That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking
Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter
Don't you hear people talking? what is it that your after?

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect

The key to save yourself if for nothing else
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden
With a broken heart underneath all of the pain
Do you stroke the pretty scars? the hurt never ends

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real, anything's so real so you just disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just disconnect

I am your poison candy gram
The love that's meant to fade away
Vade retro, alter ego
Move aside I'm choking on this life
I think I tolerate your hate
As long as you're afraid
All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day

Under the moon I hold a wake for a promise torn
Mortally wounded, feeling sheltered me
Once again my shadow will enter your life
Time to walk with me the last mile

I read the book about a man, the love, the women, how they die
How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry
I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak
I spent a year in love before I realized it's me

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you're lying
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Could I let you wait out the night?

Mother always said: "My son, do the noble thing"
You have to finish what you started
No matter what, now, sit watch and learn
"It's not how long you live but what your morals say"
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't say a word

It won't be long now love, like mist I slowly feel the room
I place a black candle on your chest
The path of night its manifest
I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase
It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you lie
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Setting the score, we pass the twilight

Mother always said: "My son, do the noble thing"
You have to finish what you started
No matter what, Now, sit watch and learn
"It's not how long you live but what your morals say"
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't say a word

Strawberry blonde your stranglehold
On my heart is bound to end
I suppose, life sometimes
It doesn't go the way it was meant
Though you never were a believer
I assure you, I won't die before you
You read the book now
The part "ashes to ashes, dust to dust"

Short is the flight of this little sparkle
Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me
I will carpe the diem while it's still here
And see how the fear of death becomes her

We had it all so sweet
Made for me, you, indeed
Big secrets, small the lie
Don't cry for me, oh, argentite

No words you say tonight
Can make this be alright
I'll help you follow through
Remember this: Pacta sunt servanda

The wounds are to deep
I need to keep the scars
To prove there was a time
When I loved something more than life

Unlike the last time here
I now have the means and a will sincere
Your knight is nowhere near
Unfortunate for you, this make me your God

Closing your eyes, don't ever say you love me, whore
You never meant a word, I know you lied
When there is life there is despair, indulge me now 
And stay alive this night
I promise you the end before the first light arrives

Mother always said: "My son, do the noble thing"
You have to finish what you started
No matter what, now, sit watch and learn
"It's not how long you live but what your morals say"
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't say a word

Mother always said: "My son, do the noble thing"
You have to finish what you started
No matter what, now, sit watch and learn
"It's not how long you live but what your morals say"
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't say a word

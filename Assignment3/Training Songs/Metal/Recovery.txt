When I wake up, I want to see you.
I need to hear you.
I want to live your life.
In my day, I fail to see.

I fail to seek the one that gives life.
I've looked away from your grace.
You've been waiting at the gates.
I'm running, you're standing still.

It's been so long since I've been here.
It's time to come back again.
It's time to make a correction.
Slain to the past, resurrect me, undeserving, you love me.

Still slain to the past, recovery, undeserving, you love me still.
Your love, I love.
I've run away a thousand times.
I've run away for the last time.

I'm alone with bleeding and broken hands.
It's been so long since I've seen your love.
I've looked away from your grace.
You've been waiting at the gates.

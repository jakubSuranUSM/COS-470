Are you ready it’s time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won’t stop 'til it’s all destroyed

Let it out, just let it show
We’ll burn it down, and we’ll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we’re alive, there’s no time to sleep

Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa oh, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh!

Round two, are you feeling alive?
We’ll overcome, we’ll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
We can’t stop till it’s all destroyed

Let it out, just let it show
We’ll burn it down, we’ll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we’re alive, there’s no time to sleep?

Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh! Riot!
Whoa oh here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa oh run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh!
It’s time to tear it all

Riot
Whoa oh! Riot
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa oh! Whoa oh! Riot

Listen to me I have a story to tell
About a guy whose name I can't spell
He likes blood, pus and gastric juice
Of course blood too, so let him booze
He is insane for a brain
Laps of gut sips the fluid
For the sweet he takes meat
To the bone for him alone
Never he is full or has enough
Wouldn't dream of stop eating people though

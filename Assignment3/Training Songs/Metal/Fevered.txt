Marking this body of infancy 
Wounds - smiling my way 
Again emotions fail to exist 
The anguish of existence calls us all 
The world is sick 
and life is the disease 
Feverish we breed 
See the willow that embodies my weeping 
And so the weeping calls us all 
The world is sick 
And life is the disease 
Feverish we breed 
The loneliness feeds my resentment 
I remain dead

Susie oh Susie come on & let me in
There's love in the air, love on my
Mind, love in the pores of my skin.
Worked real hard all week long
Kept on sigin' the same damn song
One for the money two for the show
Paid on Friday and I'm ready to go
And if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the worst in me
It might be bad, but it sure feels good to me.
You think I'm outrageous
You think I'm insane
But everthing I'm doin' tonight
I'm doin' it screamin' your name
Susie oh Susie open up the door
We won't be able to walk tomorrow 
So we might as well do it some more
And if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the worst in me
It might be bad but it sure feels
Good to me
If I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the beast in me
It might be dirty and it might be bad
But it sure feels sure feels sure 
Feels good to me

You come on over right through my front door
Strapped with all your baggage
What you bringin' that for
Don't want no disrespect 'cause we all know the score
But you need to put time in
At the common sense store

Yes yes why all you're brain washed all in your head
Let's make one thing crystal clear
We don't want no ism here

How you say you hate me and you're not ashamed
It's just insecurity that's causing you pain
Well if you can't get past that we are not the same
Then realize that ism is a part of the blame

Racism - we don't want it here
Sexism - we don't need it here
Fascism - we don't want it here
Keep that ism out of my ear
Terrorism - we don't want it here
Leftism - we don't need it here
Fakeism - we don't want it here
We don't want it we don't need it

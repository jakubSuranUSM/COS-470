They said that self destruction I stopped below and for along
My only home is the bottom of the bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go
I let the scent die in and out and I don’t care how long I last
On the constant drink and drugs and don’t get me wrong I'm having a fucking blast
I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of
 
I am rock and roll at it’s fucking finest 
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

You cannot stop me‘till my insides bleeding 
You cannot stop me‘till my last breath comes
I'm gonna go until I hit the floor 
Can’t find a way back to my feet anymore

Pass me a glass and let’s destroy everything in this fucking place 
Like a billion miles an hour you pussy's can’t keep up with this fucking pace 
I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of

I am rock and roll at its fucking finest 
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns, wohoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

I’ve drunk the last time you stood here, you’re by my side
You thought that it should be just like the good old days of rock and roll 
Without a drink, without regret without a second thought 
You look below on the end of the back of your fucking throat 

I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

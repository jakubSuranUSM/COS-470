I was alone, she was a woman,
I was a man, I never knew her name,
And she was pretty, New York City
I just gotta let it go,
The train kept a rollinÂ´ all night long

Get it on, cheap little woman get it on, on my way
Get it on, cheap little woman get it on, on my way
The train kept a rollinÂ´ all night long
The train kept a rollinÂ´ all night long

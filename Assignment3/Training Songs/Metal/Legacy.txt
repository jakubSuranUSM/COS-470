Brand new day
Somewhere so far away
A global village awakes and starts to crack the open airway's
Cause the tiger's escaped
He tore right out of his cage
It's like a spark to a flame
Assimilating it's collective on the way
Like turning on a light the brain's online tonight
All around the world
That freedom in the air big brother is aware
Or within my dreams?
And do you think it dreams of life are we the air it needs?
Are we the air this beast needs to breathe
The engines's tuned and clean time for man and machine to join
Society of the mind
School today
A sea of seething rage
And on the menu in the lunchroom we got Ritallin and Prozac
So I can concentrate
On my next level in Quake
Where I can shoot them I can kill them
And dehumanize the cancer in my veins
Online you gotta sell your virtual as hell
All around the world
That freedom in the air big brother is aware
Or within my dreams?
And do you think it needs your soul once your inside it's mind
Once your inside the mind of the world
The Code is running lean time for mand and machine to join
Society of the mind
Are you waiting for the strike
New Religion overload
Like turning on a light the brain's online tonight
All around the world
That freedom in the air big brother is aware
Or within my dreams?
And do you think it dreams of life are we the air it needs?
Are we the air this beast needs to breathe
There's lightning on the screen now watch man and machine will join
Society of the mind >

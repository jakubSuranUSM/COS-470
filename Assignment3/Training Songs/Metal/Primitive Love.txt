[Chorus]
Primitive love, Primitive love
Primitive man make primitive love
Primitive love, Primitive love
Great heavens above, it's primitive love

[Chorus]
Drags his woman back of the hill
Rough, and tough, but I don't care
You be Tarzan, and I'll be Jane
Run off and leave you
But I'll come back again
(Heavy Sigh!)

[Chorus]
You be Adam, and I'll be Eve
Primitive love is all I need
Jungle fever in my head
Gimme strange kinda lovin'
That's what I said

[Chorus]

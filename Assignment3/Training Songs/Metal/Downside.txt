Cooler in the shade sipping lemonade
Watching me burn in the sun
Who are you to judge let go of your grudge
You might be the next one, the one to fumble

Invitation to starvation
See the situation on the other side
Devastation all around you
Repercussion everywhere you try to hide

Welcome to the downside

No cares for you, when your bills are due
And there's no place for you to turn
Voices come and go, telling me what I know
Time to go do it all again and again and again

Invitation to starvation
See the situation on the other side
Devastation all around you
Repercussion everywhere you try to hide

Welcome to the downside
Welcome to the downside

Everything, everything
Everything, everything
F*ck everything, everything
F*ck everything, everything
F*ck everything, everything
All I want is everything

Go
Come on

Invitation to starvation
See the situation on the other side
Devastation all around you
Repercussion everywhere you try to hide

Welcome to the downside
Welcome to the downside

Welcome to the downside
Welcome to the downside

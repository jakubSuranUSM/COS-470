Walking down the path that leads me to my memories
Pacing all the way without a care in my stride
Where are the friends of my yesterday
Have they moved on with their lives
Can we still laugh and joke about things like before 
There's no need to hide the past that I have left behind
It's a good resource somewhere for me to find
Why am I waiting for someone to reach out
It should be all up to them
Keeping in touch ain't that easy but I'll have to try 

Where have all the years gone
That's what I am asking now
What have I learnt so far
Tell me Father Time 
Tell me now 

Now I understand I'll take from time what I need
And I store it inside it's there for me to find
I can't deny that the years will pass by
But it won't bother me
Coz now I will set out to realize my dream 

Where have all the years gone
That's what I am asking now
What have I learnt so far
Tell me Father Time
Tell me now

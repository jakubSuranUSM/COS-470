Nobody gives a damn about anybody else,
Think everyone should feel the way they fell themselves,
Rich men think that happiness is a million dollar bills,
So how come most of them O. D. on sleeping pills,

Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, you all know what I mean,
What's the use of a cry for help, if no one hears the scream,
No one hears the scream,
No voices in the sky, confusion blinds the eye,
Can't take it with you when you die,
No voices in the sky,

The ones who dedicate the flags to make you brave,
They also consecrate the headstone on your grave,
Ritual remembrance when no one knows your name,
Don't help a single widow learn to fought the pain,

Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, you all know what I mean,
What's the use of a cry for help, if no one hears the scream,
No one hears the scream,
No voices in the sky, confusion blinds the eye,
Can't take it with you when you die,
No voices in the sky, 
Take it

Politicians kissing babies for good luck,
TV Preachers sell salvation for a buck,
You don't need no golden cross, to tell you wrong from right,
The world's worst murderers were those who saw the light

Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, you all know what I mean,
What's the use of a cry for help, if no one hears the scream,
No one hears the scream
No voices in the sky, confusion blinds the eye
Can't take it with you when you die
No voices in the sky

No voices in the sky, confusion blinds the eye
Can't take it with you when you die
No voices in the sky

Well, here I'm rollin' down another sunny highway,
Been in the sun too long.
I'm goin' coconuts but least I'm goin' my way,
I'll prob'bly be here when that sun goes down.

I want to live it up, want to quit my job,
Tell the boss to go to hell.
I ain't complainin', you do the best with what you got.
I know you're laughin' 'cause it's easy to tell

I'm goin' crazy,
Goin' crazy,
Oo, from the heat.

Remember dancing on the pier last night?
Got drunk and fell into the water.
The big policeman wasn't laughing, didn't blink an eye,
He said, "You're messin' with the mayor's daughter."

Don't tell me, "Give it up", too busy getting down,
I learned my lessons well.
You get it goin' and you don't never stop.
I know you're laughin' 'cause it's easy to tell

I'm goin' crazy,
Goin' crazy,
Oo, from the heat.

Goin' crazy,
Goin' crazy,
Oo, from the heat.

Goin' crazy,
Goin' crazy,
Oo, from the heat.

Goin' crazy,
Goin' crazy,
Oo, from the heat.

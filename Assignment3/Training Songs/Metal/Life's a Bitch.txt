Woke up this morning more dead than alive
Sentenced to madness from nine until five
The weather is lousy, think I'm gonna be late
I don't give a shit, my mind is filled up with hate
My breakfast is freezing, the milk has gone off
I feel like telling the world to f*ck off
I ain't got no money, I'm late for the train
If I don't get out of here, it's gonna drive me insane
Why does nothing ever turn out right

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch

When you feel the squeeze
My brand new motor's almost made out of rust
And my bank account has almost bit the dust
My baby's screaming that she needs now clothes
She had a hundred dollars but she stuck it up her nose
Hey why don't you shut your mouth

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch

When you feel the squeeze
The rent collector's knocking hell out the door
The Sunday dinner's plastered over the floor
I can't understand what the hell have I done
I just got to try and get my hands on a gun
Why does nothing ever turn out
Just the way it oughta turn out
Anyway you look, there ain't no doubt

Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch
When you feel the squeeze
Life's a bitch
When it's got you by the balls
Life's a bitch
When you feel the squeeze

Relax, it's over, you belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax, it's over, you can never leave
I take your second digit with me, love, 
You are, my first, I can breath
I find you fascinating
You are, my favorite,lay you down to sleep
It's all that I can do to stop, love, 
So blue, so broken,paper doll decays
I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive, your eyes are full of bleach
Tomorrow, I will go away again, love, 
You are mine, you will always be mine, I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you.(love)

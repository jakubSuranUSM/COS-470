Conspiracies being made deep in the caves
The plans of Destruction whispered, again and again
Faithful hollow men, their strife was crying aloud
Waiting for the white moon to shine, and bring them
Their might
You believe it's coming wild

Can you believe right now? It's Pandemonium
Everywhere we go, you know it's Pandemonium
Deep in the cracks we fall of Pandemonium
Staring at the black sun we know it's Pandemonium

We believe it's going wild

Trust me, freak show
It was like a twisted circus
Trust me, freak show
Out from the cries the charisma will say

Freak show, freak show
Keeping hate alive and well is all that matters now
Freak show, freak show
The time has come to recognize, there's no turning back

I can believe, right now it's Pandemonium
Everything's falling apart, it's Pandemonium
High from the skies we fall from Pandemonium
Looking in your eyes, I know it's Pandemonium

We believe it's coming wild

It's Pandemonium, it will never be One
It's Pandemonium, we'll go into the sun
It's Pandemonium, I cry, we've all got to run
It's Pandemonium, we cry, it's Pandemonium

See you sittin' next to the window in the bedroom 
She brakes down - brakes down 
Crying over something and starin' into nothin' 
Afraid now - hate now 
Wanting, needing, haunting, it's killing me 
Faking what has happened to live the life like that man 
I'll brake down - It's fake now 

Will you, Will you love me tomorrow? 
So Will You, Will you stay with me today? 

Fade in and out of reason to fight the way she's feelin' 
She brakes down - brakes down 
Going through the motions and holding onto hopes 
and her dreams now - somehow 
Shaken, mistaken, forsaken, it's killing me. 
Wishing you could change, but he's always been this way 
If you leave now - I'll drown 

Will you, Will you love me tomorrow? 
So Will You, Will you stay with me today? 
Will you, Will you be here tomorrow? 
So Will You, you remember yesterday? 

Yesterday! Yesterday! 
Yesterday! Yesterday! 

This time, I'm sorry 
This time, I'm sorry 
This time, this time, I'm sorry for this time 
This time, this time, I'm sorry 
This time I'm sorry! 

Will you, Will you love me tomorrow? 
So Will You, Will you stay with me today? 
Will you, Will you be here tomorrow? 
So Will You, you remember yesterday? 

Will you? 
So Will You? 
Will you?

Tell ya 'bout this lady

Such tender eyes, such a sweet believer, the story never lies
When I found you girl, you were so far down, a black cat in disguise

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you'd gone too far
Saving your soul for that one last kiss
Living your wish upon a star

Madalaine, this is love too tough to tame
Madalaine, beware of the girl, beware of the pain

Running scared through the dark of the day, the story never dies
But the names keep changin' and the faces fade, take you dead or alive

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you'd gone too far
Saving your soul for that one last kiss
Living your wish upon a star

Madalaine, this is love too tough to tame
Madalaine, beware of the girl, beware of the pain

All your glory was left like an angry child
Waiting to take your luck away
But you can't see you're still running wild
Oh Madalaine, now don't run away from me

Madalaine, this is love too tough to tame
Madalaine, beware of the girl, beware of the pain

Madalaine, this is love too tough to tame, too tough to tame...

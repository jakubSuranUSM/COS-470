Come on Boys!
She looks so fine
Like champagne or wine
No one ever gets her
Oh, ain't she cool
Plays us for fools
If we anna let her
Across the room
She sees some buffoon
Blown away by her style
She goes out of her way
So that she can play
And make him beg for a little while

Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground

Like caviar
Or a fine foreign car
He's a motivator
Dressed to the T's
They're down on their knees
He's a Master Baiter
He'll make 'em crawl for the hell of it all
He likes to see 'em cry
And then just for fun
He'll say she's the one
And then he'll make her die
He's gonna

Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground

They don't care about feelings
They were made to be stepped on
And while one is healing
They go and step on another one

Now, these people prey
On us everyday
Some are bad, some badder
They think we're fools
So they make their own rules
It only gets us madder
Well, they think they're hot
Well, I say they're not!
They shoot us down just for fun
If they wanna play
Let's make 'em pay
Shoot them down with a fucking gun

Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground

Come on, now
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground

Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground
Come on, honey
Come on, shoot 'em down

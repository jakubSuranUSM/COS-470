Fate!

Peddlers, pushers, insects
The chants, charms
Blow sweat and beer
I've got bones to throw

It's no secret
Secrets aren't bought and sold
You gotta pay
With your heart and soul

We're all laid low by the hand,
So get your head up
Get your head up outta the sand,
So get your head up
The lion will eat the hear,
Serpents coil from the start
What did you hope to achieve?

Along side rides, one with great destiny

Fate stepped in to lend a hand again
Fate stepped in to lend a hand
Fate stepped in to lend a hand again
Fate stepped in to lend a hand

Echoes from the grave!

Potions, oils, insects
Their chants, charms
Blood sweat and beer
I've got bones to throw

It's no secret
Secrets aren't bought and sold
You gotta pay
With your heart and soul

We're all laid low by the hand,
So get your head up
Get your head up outta the sand,
So get your head up
The lion will eat the hear,
Serpents coil from the start
What did you hope to achieve?

Along side rides, one with great destiny

Fate stepped in to lend a hand again
Fate stepped in to lend a hand
Fate stepped in to lend a hand again
Fate stepped in to lend a hand

Echoes from the grave!
From the grave 
From the grave

Watching the vultures swarm
Like being tied down
In the midday sun

Echoes from the grave!
From the grave
From the grave
Echoes from the grave!
From the grave
From the grave

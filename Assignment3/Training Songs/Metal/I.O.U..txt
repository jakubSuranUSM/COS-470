You may think you're fin'lly free from me this time ba,
By I got news for you
I think you'll find I got something there that guarantees you're mine
Now I'll telling you get back in line

I got my I.O.U.

That's all I got from you

I got my I.O.U.

But only you will do
I'm not evil I'm just asking you to recognise what's mine is mine
Line by line by line

What a situation for a girl like you
Thinking you can do just what you want to do
Fancy free and easy any time you choose
Now the time has come to pay your dues

I got my I.O.U.

That's all I got from you

I got my I.O.U.

But only you will do

You owe me more that Money Honey
I'm just holding you to all the promises you ever made me

It's no good you putting on your baby face
All I'm gonna do is put you in your place
Why don't you stop running and give in with grace
I got all I need to win my case

I got my I.O.U.

That's all I got from you

I got my I.O.U.

But only you will do

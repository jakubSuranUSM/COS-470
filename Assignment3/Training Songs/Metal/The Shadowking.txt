Spellbound by the power of the devil
I'm running through the shadows of the night
I'm sensing he will take my soul forever
I'm praying to the guardian of my fate

Freedom now or never, oh I'm going insane
Times have changed forever free me forever

One more time I fly
Over the rainbow
One last time no return
No more tears to cry
Into the shadows
No more lies it's the final way to paradise

I'm tortured by the demon of desire
I'm drowning in my dreams and fantasies
The raging storm is feeding on the fire

I'm praying for an answer to my pleas

Freedom now or never oh I'm going insane
Times have changed forever free me forever

One more time I fly
Over the rainbow
One last time no return
No more tears to cry
Into the shadows
No more lies it's the final way to paradise

Welcome to the afterworld I'll be there
Center of the universe take me there

Drowning in seas of desire
I'm dwelling in sadness and pain fear
I end up in silent surrender
I'm resigning myself to my fate

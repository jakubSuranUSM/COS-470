Going down, sir?
Indeed
Here you are

Plagued by the past and down a badly beaten path
Lies a place, one of a kind
Cursed by a blinding light that no one can outshine

A mess of a man, his fate unknown
One drink away from a broken home
He can't give up but can't go on like this
A five year old longs to be free
From visions he can't help but see
And a mother who can't understand

That the writing on my walls will tell you how it's gonna be
Oh can't you see that you're just rats within my halls
To hell with hospitality (and we all scream)

Welcome to your last resort, don't overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy so say goodbye to sanity
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much enjoy your slay

Face down in the lap luxury
F*ck the comforts of reality
Turn the page, disengage and destroy
All work and no play makes jack a dull boy
oH I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm just gonna bash your fucking brains in

Now the fun has just begun
And one by one your wife and son
Hang in the web you've spun as family ties come undone
Redrum!

The writing on my walls will tell you how it's gonna be
So follow me
Cross out the words “do not disturb”
On the doors of depravity (and we all scream):

Welcome to your last resort don't overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy so say goodbye to sanity
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much enjoy your slay

An identical scream from 217
Slashes to ashes, dust to dust
Hey danny, come play with us

Come drain or shine
I'll hit your whole bloodline
Shall we tell old Jack what he's won?
A chopping spree
Around the family tree
Where you can hang once
All work is done

The writing on my walls will tell you how it's gonna be
Oh can't you see (that we all scream)

Welcome to your last resort don't overlook the past
If you need help finding piece of mind don't hesitate to axe
They can see the vacancy so say goodbye to sanity
We're here to help you on your way
Thank you very much, and please do keep in touch

Enjoy your slay!

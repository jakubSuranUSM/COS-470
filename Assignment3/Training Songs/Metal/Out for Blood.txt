Waiting for a street fight
Clock strikes midnight
I got a bad reputation
So what the hell
'Cause we ain't doin' nothing
I ain't never done before
So give me all you got, babe
I could use a little more
You try bringing me up
But you're dragging me down
What you got, I ain't looking for

I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood

Carried a switch blade
Since you were thirteen
You never won a battle
So don't fight with me
'Cause you ain't really nothing
Tried to tell you that before
So get your ammunition
'Cause I'm ready for war
Wasting my time
Frying my mind
And I am not
So, what you take me for?

I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood

I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood
I'm out for blood

All my life I've been fighting
For the right to make my stand
Scream my anthem to the night
And hold the power in my hand
I'm gonna do it my way
Or not do it at all
Taking the world on my terms
I'll take it by the balls
I'm fighting for justice
For the American way
I believe in what I do
And I mean what I say
You got it, the right to rock
We've got it, the right to rock
Don't let anyone tell you
How to live your life
We won't turn it off
We'll never turn it down
'Cause it's our way of life
I'm fighting for freedom
For the golden rule
The right to say what I feel
And the right to say it to you

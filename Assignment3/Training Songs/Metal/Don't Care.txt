Shut up and turn off the light
I'll take you deep right through the night
Just leave before you're in my sight
'Cause I don't need another fight

And I don't need your sympathy
You'll get no tender love from me
Kneel before me on your knee

Do it hard, make me free
Do it hard, make me free
Do it, make me free
Do it hard, make me free

Don't want your pity
Don't want your care
Don't care for giving
Don't care for fair

Don't want your kindness
Don't want your heart
Don't care for wanting
Don't care for smart

I'll come to you from behind
You know my touch will not be kind
You'll feel my loveless power bind
No feelings here that you can find

Between you're legs I will lay
On you're back you better stay
I'm gonna f*ck you night and day

Do it hard, make me pay
Do it hard, make me pay
Do it hard, make me pay
Do it hard

Don't want your pity
Don't want your care
Don't care for giving
Don't care for fair

Don't want your kindness
Don't want your heart
Don't care for wanting
Don't care for smart

I don't need your sympathy
You'll get no tender love from me
Just kneel before me on your knee

Do it hard, make me free
Do it hard, make me free
Do it hard, please make me free

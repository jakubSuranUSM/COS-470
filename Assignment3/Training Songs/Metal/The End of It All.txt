Break down the abode,
And with the flames let my name go,
Deteriorate what I’ve lived with,
The ground is all that is left to believe in,
Tremors shake and collapse my home,
An earthquake from a burning dome,
The core of my existence,
Engulfs everything I’ve built on it,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus:
If this is temporary,
Will You show me what lasts,
From ashes I cry out,
Is this the end of it all?

Creeping lies and ill promise,
Crumble the world upon us,
Deceiving nature drives the herd,
Misunderstanding the word,
False lies and unjust doctrine,
Prosperity forgotten.

Flames burn all that I know,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus

Hold fast to what is left,
The only thing I hold close,
Life fades away,
Life fades to grey,

Chorus

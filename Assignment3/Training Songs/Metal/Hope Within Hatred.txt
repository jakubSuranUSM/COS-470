Go ahead and take what you want
And carve yourself, self right out of me
And disconnect what you were
And it will always be hard to believe
You forced this on all of us
I would rather die by myself
Than kill myself fighting for you

Rid yourself of the truth
Rid yourself of the dreams we believed (the dreams, you believed in me)
Force yourself from the truth
But you cannot force this on me
Force this on all of us

I can't
Recognize all the days that were lost and the heart that you robbed from me
I won't
Face this on my own
Return the power into my hands now

I know this can't be the first time
You won't live up to the hope I had
The hope I had in you

Rid yourself of the truth
Rid yourself of the dreams we believed (the dreams, you believed in me)
Force yourself from the truth
But you cannot force this on me
Force this on all of us

I can't
Recognize all the days that were lost and the heart that you robbed from me
I won't
Face this on my own
Return the power into my hands now
I can't
Recognize all the days
All the days that you robbed from me
I won't
Face this on my, face this on my own

I won't face this (4x)
On my own

I'm chasing memories within
But the words slip through my fingers again
Slip through my fingers again

We can find the will to break through
Break through
Yeah

I can't
Recognize all the days that were lost and the heart that you robbed from me
I won't
Face this on my own
Return the power into my hands now
I can't recognize all the days
All the days that you robbed from me
I won't face this on my
I wonâ€™t, I won't face this on my own
Return the power to my hands now

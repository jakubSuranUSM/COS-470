I'm not in a state of despair
Nothing seems to fit my mind
And although I can't be there
I still know that there's a place for someone
Just like me
Now will I ever wake up
Wake up to see the box I'm in
And will I ever stand up
I'm standing on the edge of inability
And though I'm trying it still penetrates my body
All these demons that I carry deep inside
The changing faces forces me to leave the traces
Of the stranger things that are growing in my mind
Oh I know that I have
Done this once or twice before
The names are still a blur
I'm arrogantly close to falling of the edge
I know I'm not insane
Though my head hurts on the inside
The images disturb me
I know I'm not insane, I'm not what they call me
They're no good, still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
The blood just paint my world
They're no good, still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
They're forcing my actions upon my deathbox
And though I'm trying it still penetrates my body
All these demons that I carry deep inside
The changing faces force me to leave the traces
Of the stranger things that's growing in my mind
Now will I ever wake up
Wake up to see the box I'm in
And will I ever stand up
I'm standing on the edge of inability
Now is this a failure
My project kill is right awake
I'm all burned out from pressure
My thoughts have brought me to my knees
Awake in pain
They're no good, still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
The blood just paints my world
They're no good, still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
They're forcing my actions upon my deathbox

Another memory and I'm asking myself
Why can't I let the past be the past
Once and for all take a hold of the future
And not let it control what I aspire to have
I see where my decisions have brought me
What's done is done and its time to start again
Can't let it tear me in two waste me away
I gotta believe
Cause this is now
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now
If I control myself I control my destiny

What I've seen and what I've been through has made me who I am
There was a time in my life where I had no desire to carry on
I couldn't see a place for me or a will to survive
I never thought to rely on myself or the beliefs that I have denied

But this is now
How can I can change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now
If I control myself I control my destiny

If I control myself I control my tomorrow
I got to change today
Cause this is now

How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
I must control myself if I'm to control my destiny

Cause this is now

Cause this is now
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now
If I control myself I control my destiny

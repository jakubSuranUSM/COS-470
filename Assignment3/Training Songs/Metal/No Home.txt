No home 
This is not any form of home 
Home is where the heart is 
No home no heart 

No home no heart 
This is your viewing room 
Your room no view 
Nothing seen nothing heard 

Your home no heart 
Shut up I'll kick out you shut up I'll do you in 
This is your trap your crap 
This is not my thing 

No soul no heart 
No home no heart 
Shut up I'll kick you out shut up I'll do you in 
Old wounds heal slowly they grow in to mold me 

Home 
Can (I didn't know what it means) 
you (I've just lived here for so long) 
Trust me (and I can't leave now I can't leave) 

Can you trust me? (I can't leave you) 
Can you trust me? (No I can't leave you) 
I've lived here for so long and it's been my way 
It's always been the way to be like myself 

Now you want me to change 
Can't you trust me anymore? 
I can't change for you 
I can't change I can't change for you 

Can we just be enemies? 
I've lived here for so long 
I won't change 
So long sometimes 

Can we just be enemies? 
Old wounds heal slowly they grow in to mold me 
Shut up I'll kick you out shut up, I'll do you in

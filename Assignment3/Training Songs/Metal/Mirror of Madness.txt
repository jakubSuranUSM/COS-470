I'm caught by the mirror, 
It's like a nightmare, 
I cannot get out
I'm seeing that face again 
And it's making me mad
My rage and hate is taking over 
When you look at me
So I close my eyes 
And you scream to me

Leave me alone,
You're not real to me
This is the way it has to be
This mirror is twisted 
And so are you

Hey you, in the mirror
Stop twisting my weak mind
Mirror of madness, 
Stop haunting me

Hey you, before the mirror
Your eyes keep telling you lies
Mirror of madness, 
Is making you insane

F*ck off my mind, 
I told you to go 
But you don't believe 
So I'm forced to deceive
There is no other way 
To end this day
I believe you are real 
And you live in me
But you have to die
Step into the light, 
Don't be shy

You keep on telling me your lies, 
"Kill yourself and it's alright"
Don't want to die but I hope you do

Hey you, in the mirror
I'll smash your face to pieces
Mirror of madness, 
This dream is over

No more, you no more
Your face is gone, forever 
Mirror of madness, 
Left me alone

Forever gone

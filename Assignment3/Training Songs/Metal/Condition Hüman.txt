Do we ever stop and wonder
Wonder what’s around us?
Do we take for granted
What some may dream to have?

Broken words of yesterday
Feels like I’m standing still
Promises don’t mean a thing
Like a hunt without the kill

Do we ever take the time
To see what comes and what goes by?
Do we ever stop to see
Just who we'll leave behind?

Who are you leaving behind?

Broken words of yesterday
Feels like I’m standing still
Promises don’t mean a thing
Like a hunt without the kill

As the wise man waits
The widow prays
Searching remnants of yesterday

And the shadows cry
When darkness fades
We try to understand
Under moonlit skies

Welcome to a generation
Divided unity of man
Disconnected circuitry
Pull the trigger on demand

No remorse
They have no sense of apathy
Critical mass on its way
Who is searching for the truth?

Desensitize the innocent
Quick to medicate the youth

As the wise man waits
The widow prays
Searching remnants of yesterday

And the shadows cry
When darkness fades
We try to understand
Under moonlit skies

A charade in broken frames
Gather pieces from the past
Shape the species over time
Moralities collapse

Millennia of holy wars
Suppress the meek and mild
Profits of the corporate whores
Who will teach the child?

Illusions cast in complex forms
Death creates new life

No reception
Tonight

Welcome to a generation
We are all conditioned human
No remorse
They have no sense of apathy

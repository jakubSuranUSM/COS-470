where are you tonight
i don't seem to know you
no i'm not all right
where are you tonight
and my heart is nearly gone
there's not much left to offer
if i could somehow know
i could stop the burning down
where are you tonight
are you even really out there
i won't put up a fight
where are you tonight
and the world keeps spinning round
a vicious cycle turning
some of them know love
some of us know the burning down

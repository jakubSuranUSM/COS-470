We can move around now
You know it's so good
But I know you wouldn't come clean now, baby
Even if you could
white line fever 

White line fever made me a believer now
White line fever, yeah
Take me away from you
Just come to me babe
We can stay right here
But you don't remember me, honey, 'cause of all you've done this year
White line fever 

We're gonna make you a dreamer
White line fever, yeah
It's a slow death
Hey 

Bye, bye, bye baby
'Cause there I come
Won't go to sleep tonight
Because the white line turns me on

White line fever
Made me a believer
White line fever, yeah
It hasn't killed my yet
Oh

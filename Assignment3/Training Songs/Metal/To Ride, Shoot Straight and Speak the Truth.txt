Got a god and herbless.
I want everything she offers and won't settle for less.
I see heaven under my feet as well as over my head.
Bet you wish you was already dead.
Always less done than said.

Met this guy, who knows why.
But he says, "I know where you'll go when you die".
Told him how I felt for his god and that I wasn't impressed.
You see, I'm already blessed.

I want to ride. Gun in my hand. God on my side.
I've tride. So far no good. More than a little misunderstood.

Love the fall. No control.
They say,"it takes one to know one".
Well I know them all.
They say,"stupid is as stupid does".
Guess you'll always be if you everwas.

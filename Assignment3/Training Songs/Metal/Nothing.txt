Dont try to hide your eyes 
You must wake up your mind 
You've seen the world outside 
Is this the way things should be? 
I've got some news for you 
This world can be so cruel 
No matter what you do 
There will be nothing left for you 
Is this what you where searching for? 
You're the same loser that you were before and nothing more 
So now see the truth 
I hope that you were'nt let down 
And if you hear my words 
They were'nt just meant to scare you 
Drift on numbered days 
Waste your life away 
to never see the sun

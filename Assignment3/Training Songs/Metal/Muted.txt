Life's a bitch and then you're gone
You can pray all day and sing a song
Stay awake all night for a man 
To give the answers to you

Save yourself then save us all
Blame our ways and burn our souls
You're lucky enough for a man 
To give the answers to you

Some people like me don't know, 
I don't know where to turn
Say I'm evil say I'm worthy of hell
Say I'm just a fool with a story to tell

I kinda know what you're thinking 
But I don't really care
You've got your ideas 
I'm sure you're welcome to share

Some people like me don't know,
I don't know where to turn
so won't you get it straight now?
I don't want your help now

Even if I'm going down
F*ck you, I don't need it

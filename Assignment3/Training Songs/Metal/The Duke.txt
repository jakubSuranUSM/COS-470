No one lives forever but you can't escape from life
Every day could be your last so consider your demise
Mine has drawn so near
Stare into the eyes of the end
Reaping now without fear
The time that's left to spend
The time that's left to spend
The time that's left to

Look up in the night
See it ride across the sky
Hanging there above
Far away but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind
Burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell
But I will never die

This world has grown too small, I can't stay much longer
My body begins to fail as my spirit grows stronger
It's time for me to go
The circle closed as the snake eats its tail
Lay my burden down
Walking free beyond the veil
The time that's left to spend
The time that's left to

Look up in the night
See it ride across the sky
Hanging there above
Far away but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind
Burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell
But I will never die

I will never die
I will never die
I will never die

Look up in the night
See it ride across the sky
Hanging there above
Far away but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind
Burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell
But I will never die

I will never die
Never die
I will never die

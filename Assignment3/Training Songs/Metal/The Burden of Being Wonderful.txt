Why in a world of ugly faces 
should I, be allowed to be so hot 
So many people without talent 
yet I was born with all the magical gifts I got

The perfect body, the perfect face 
it’s like god’s best work all in one place 
But the haters hate perfection 
Can’t you see

It’s a burden being wonderful like me

How in a world that’s so imperfect 
did I wind up with so much cool 
Friends never stick around too long 
they never feel like they belong 
next to me they feel like a fool

I’ve got the grace of a dancer, a golden voice 
people seem to hate me like I had a choice 
Being this blessed is a lonely way to be

It’s a burden being wonderful like me

Like me

So you say you wanna hang around 
don’t ever ask me to turn it down 
I’m a diamond I’m gonna shine 
compared to everyone else 
I’m like a whole damn diamond mine

Oh yeah

I’m just a Maserati in a world of Kias 
‘genius’ wouldn’t describe any of my ideas 
If I was born in 1453 Leonardo Da Vinci would be jealous of me 
but a world of stevie wonders would never see

It’s a burden being wonderful like me

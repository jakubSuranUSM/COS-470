I feel so sick.
So sick again,
Just when I thought it went away,
This time there's nothing I can take,

To calm it down to make it sleep,
All this is spent waiting,
For a cure that's just beyond reach,
One more forgotten day in line,

One more desperate cling to control,
Just don't wake up from this routine,
This plastic mask covers everything,
I heard you say you had the answer,

A quick fix an easy way out,
This time I'll try anything,
To be so sedated so secure.

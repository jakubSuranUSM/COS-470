I am the God of Hell Fire and I'll bring you 

Fire 
I'll take you to burn 
Fire 
I'll take to learn 
I'll see you burn 

You fought hard and you saved and earned 
But all the things got to burn 
Out your mind your tiny mind 
You know you've really been so blind 
Now's your time burn your mind 
You fall apart went far behind 

Oh no, oh no, oh no 
You gonna burn 

Fire 
To destroy all you've done 
Fire 
To end all you've become 

I'll feel you burn 

You've been living like a little girl 
In the middle of your little world 
Into flames you turn your mind 
You know you've really been so blind 
Now's your time fool your mind 
You 're falling far to far behind 
Oh 

Fire 
To destroy all you've done 
Fire 
To end all you've become 

You gonna burn 
You gonna burn 
You gonna burn 
You gonna burn 
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn 
Whhaaaaa

Fire 
I'll take you to burn
Fire 
I'll take you to learn
Fire 
I'll take you to bed 
Fire 
To destroy all you've done 
Fire 
To end all you've become 
Fire 
I'll take you to burn 
I'll see you burn 
Destroy all you've [?]
Fire 
Fire 
I'll take you to hell

Desperation feeds your inspiration
Celebration as you heat the station
Desolation in my spirit nation
Violation sparks the inflammation

One and one the altitude
I don't need this shit from you
Two and two are calling for
Identical the mainstream whore
Three and three it makes me sick
Bowing to the corporate prick
Four and four let's congregate
And listen as the master baits

Are you aware of your soul
Listen to me as you're losing control
Up in arms, rising up from the core
It's time for disband to arise
As it shatters the Mold

Ejaculation in cooperation
Corporation gives me aggravation
Designation is no violation
Congregation of the restoration

One and one the altitude
I don't need this shit from you
Two and two are calling for
Identical the mainstream whore
Three and three it makes me sick
Bowing to the corporate prick
Four and four let's congregate
And listen as the master baits

Are you aware of the soul
Listen to me as you're losing control
Up in arms, rising up from the core
It's time for disband to arise
Are you aware of the soul
Listen to me as you're losing control
Up in arms, rising up from the core
It's time for disband to arise
As it shatters the Mold

Hey, Hey, Hey, Yeah
Hey, Hey, Hey, Yeah
Hey, Hey. Hey, Yeah

One and one the altitude
I don't need this shit from you
Two and two are calling for
Identical the mainstream whore
Three and three it makes me sick
Bowing to the corporate prick
Four and four let's congregate
And listen as the master baits

Are you aware of the soul
Listen to me as you're losing control
Up in arms, rising up from the core
It's time for disband to arise
Arc you aware of the soul
Listen to me as you're losing control
Up in arms, rising up from the core
It's time for disband to arise
As it shatters the Mold

Hey, Hey, Hey, Yeah
Hey, Hey, Hey, Yeah

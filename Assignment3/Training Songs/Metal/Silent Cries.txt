Born to an air of apathy
Indifference shapes of fragile minds.
Questions formed at an early age
Beg answers unasked.
Silent cries
Behind curious eyes resides
A child who cannot speak.
Years find a mind alone whose
Questions flow too deep for words.
Covered in a shroud of silence
Watching the world go by.
Silent cries
Behind outcast eyes, hides
A child who cannot speak.
Time blindly races on
Towards the autumn years
Seasons unheeded pass
While we all drown in tears.
Questions unanswered remain
Alone they mourn a fragile mind
Silent cries
Behind lifeless eyes lies
A child who cannot speak.

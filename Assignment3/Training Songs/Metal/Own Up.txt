Hey Mr.operator
I'm looking after number one
Look what's she done
I really gotta talk to her
She was the instigator
I'm gonna take more care next time
Loves number nine
I gotta get my message through

Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Does he ever think of miracle nine

Your telephone don't answer
Your gonna need it when I look by
There's no reply
You really gotta hold on me
I still want you heart breaker
Don't thank before I change my mind
Loves number nine
You better listen what I say

Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Does he ever think of miracle nine

Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Does he ever think of miracle nine

Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Own up, Take a look at yourself
Does he ever think of miracle nine

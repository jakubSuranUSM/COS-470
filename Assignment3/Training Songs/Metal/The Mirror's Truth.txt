This spectacle, our collapse
It's not a false alarm
The ashes settle in

I guess, we are the insane
As we ignore the mirror's truth

Should I join the feast?
Should I acknowledge the leash?
A future in captivity
I'm not who I'm supposed to be

Without even trying 
Let this light explode

The bleeding, we deceive them
Fuel the life that fades
At the height of reason
We shouldn't live by your laws
Call the swarm
Feed them another false hope

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this night explode
Without even trying
Find the exit sign and disappear

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this night explode
Without even trying
Find the exit sign and disappear

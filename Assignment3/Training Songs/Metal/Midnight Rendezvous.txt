Another day, another lonely night
I want to know who can be right
She's dressed to kill and I'm under her spell
I think I know her but I never can tell

You give to me that something I need
Without you near, I just can't survive
I need your love but that look in your eyes
Is so much colder than ice

Midnight Rendezvous
I've got to get a message to you
Midnight Rendezvous
What more can I do?

You're tearing my heart out

I close my eyes, but I still feel the pain
I'm pushed away while you play your game
You're not so shy but you've got nothing to say
Just look at me and throw my heart away

You run, you run away

You're tearing my heart out

One, tow, three, four
New York City, N.Y.C.
Pretty mean when it wants to be
Black leather, knee-hole pants
Can't play no high school dance
Fuzz tone, hear 'em go
Hear 'em on the radio

Misfits, twilight zone
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S
RAMONES
Bad boy rock, bad boy roll
Gabba gabba, see them go
C Jay now hit the gas
Hear Marky kick some ass
Go Johnny, go, go, go Tommy o-way-o

Misfits, twilight zone,
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S 
RAMONES
Bad boy then, bad boy now
Good buddies, mau mau mau
Sing it loud, rock 'n' roll
Good music save your soul
Dee Dee, he left home
Joey call me on the phone

Misfits, twilight zone,
R-A-M-O-N-E-S, R-A-M-O-N-E-S 
RAMONES

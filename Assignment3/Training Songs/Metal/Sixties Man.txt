Take me now, I think I'm a simple man
Just give me some loving and an easy living plan
But everyday now someone pulls my life
Sixties I say hey you got to get inside

Sunny days are over and gone for good
Shape up boy, you ain't working like you should
Well I know now I'm a man and I love this place
Don't have the 1980's kind of face

'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Woodstock nights, oh where are you?
Strawberry fields and San Fransisco too
'Cause I'm a sixties man and it's hard, maybe so are you
'Cause I'm a sixties man and it's hard, maybe so are you

Flower power, you never knew much pain
Sitting round, loving in and loving out again
Oh the seventies, I found I hardly knew
They left me high and dry and now I wonder why

'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Woodstock nights, oh where are you?
Strawberry fields and San Fransisco too
'Cause I'm a sixties man and it's hard, maybe so are you
'Cause I'm a sixties man and it's hard, maybe so are you

'Cause I'm a sixties man, Bob Dylan, oh, where are you?
I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Sixties man and hard like you
'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Sixties man and hard like you

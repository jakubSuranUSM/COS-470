(J. Lea/N. Holder)

I don't want to drink my whiskey like you do
I don't need to spend my money but still do
Don't stop now, come on
Another drop now, come on
I wanna lot now, so come on
That's right, that's right

I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now

You told me, fool fire water won't hurt me
You tease me, and everybody deserts me
Don't stop now, come on
Another drop now, come on
I wanna lot now, so come on
That's right, that's right

I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now

I don't want to drink my whiskey, but still do
I don't need to spend my money but still do
Don't stop now, come on
Another drop now, come on
I wanna lot now, so come on
That's right, that's right

I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now
I said mama but weer all crazee now

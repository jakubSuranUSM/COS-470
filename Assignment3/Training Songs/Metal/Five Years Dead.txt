Uptown downtown 
Haven't seen your face around 
Paper said you shot a man 
Trigger happy punk down in Chinatown 

You're five years dead 
Sexy Sue from Hong Kong 
Asked around right or wrong 
Outta town change your name 
Or ya get five years with a ball and chain 

You're five years dead 
You're life's on a steady tilt 
I stand around and watch you wilt 
Lose or win never mattered mattered to you 
They always said you'd fall apart 
I took the bet, but I missed the mark 
The kid was bad--bad from the start 
Left, right, up and down 
Same old runaround 
Neighborhood professional 
Your ass is runnin' into the ground 

You're five years dead 
Uptown downtown 
Haven't seen your face around 
Paper said you shot a man 
Trigger happy punk down in Chinatown 

You're five years dead

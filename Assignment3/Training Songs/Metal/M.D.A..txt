Satan's veil, the night so red
Another creature sighted
The night's alright, the music's loud
The feeling is so right

Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy

Someone wishes, dare to learn
And understand the chance
About his lair, the king has spoke
To be in there with him

Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy

Later on, the cauldron's burning
Take away their breath
You can't resist my evil touch
Nature fights their bearing

Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy aliens
Mission: destroy

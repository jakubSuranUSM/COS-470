The gavel has fallen, along with the rest. Are we expected to settle for this?
Bring us the plague, lead us away. Blacken tomorrow with ash of today.
Can't you see the fabric of our standards wearing thin?
See your world in its grave at the hands of the enslaved.

Won't bow to man. Won't bow to government.
Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust.
Won't love a world where my God is mocked. I defy.

Oh, a kiss on the serpent's head.
We walk in the line of deceit, the walking dead.
Can't you feel the ground of our discretion giving way?
Refusal of hope, solution demise. Bury the truth in a mountain of lies.

Won't bow to man. Won't bow to government.
Won't trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust.
Won't love a world where my God is mocked. I defy.

This is what you try to sell me. Subjective nothingness.
Pull your sickness from my throat.
Let me breathe the truth. Let me breathe the truth.

Won't bow to man. Won't bow to government.
Won't bow to greed. Won't bow to false hope.
Won't bow to self. Won't bow to modern code.
Won't sell my soul to a dead world. I defy.

Dreams that once found their destiny
Soar above carried by sorrow
The passage I once Followed
bstructed by barriers
Used up all the knowledge
forgotten dreams turn to illusion
Now that you are awake
Now that you are awake -
dreams that once found their destiny
Now that you are awake -
wake up and tell me what you see

I witness the eminent past nearing
In the woods of darkness,
in the valley of dismay
The lifeless guise of disembodied souls
Seeking, begging, bound towards the same trail

Forgotten dreams turn to illusion -
now that you are awake
Forgotten dreams turn to illusion -
now that you are awake
Like a Spider weaving ist web to capture prey
Or a scorpion swinging his sting to slay
Now that you are awake -
dreams that once found their destiny
Now that you are awake -
Wake up and tell me what you see

Blod flowing life-filling trough your head
Can gently turn into a toxin of demise
The past is here and craves for homage
Darkness gorges the bellows for serenity

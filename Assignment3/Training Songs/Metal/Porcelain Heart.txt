I, lost all I had (that April day)
I, turned to my friends (nothing to see)
I, wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I, wallow in shame

I, said that I love (eternal skis)
I, cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I, promised to stay (and held my breath)
I, went far away

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

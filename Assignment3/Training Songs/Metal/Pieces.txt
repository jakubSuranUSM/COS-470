Take me right now
Up your arm, right next to your ear
So I can whisper
So what if I now forgive you
So what you're not the one
I have to rise above you
And we must be moving on

Take me down there
Share your secrets
Break the boundaries into pieces

Wake me up in time to miss you
I won't know it and I won't care
And so what if it's blown to pieces
At least you're still alive
Ã¢??Cause I just can't believe this
You just laid down and died

Take me down there
Share your secrets
Break the boundaries into pieces

Just say that on the way down you'll wave to me
Just say that on the way down you'll wave to me

Take me down there
Share your secrets
Break the boundaries into pieces

Just say that you'll break me right into pieces

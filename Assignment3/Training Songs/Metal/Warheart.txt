I'm an outcast on the path of rebound 
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn 
I have chosen darkness to be my guide 
War is in my heart, death is by my side 

[Chorus]
War heart! With no remains of compassion or love 
War heart! Hate your fellow as yourself 

I have chosen night to be my guide 
When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die 

[Chorus]

I'm the war heart, I'm dying to win the battle I live everyday 
One for all and all for me, I'm an animal, better set me free

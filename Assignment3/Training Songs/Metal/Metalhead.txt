You only fool yourself if you think we are alone
You can't deny the truth it's here it's plain to see
But do they come as friends our brothers from the stars
Or are they here to take our place and rule our world

Heed the warning
Come the day
They walk among us
Metalhead

Did they come for you through mists of swirling light
You had a childhood dream abduction in your sleep
You start to scream out loud but no one hears your voice
You never feel the implant deep inside your head

Heed the warning
Come the day
They walk among us
Metalhead

Your tiny world revolves in a sea of endless space
Are you feeling safe protected from the skies
They come and go at will there's nothing you can do
We only stand and stare at powers they possess

Heed the warning
Come the day
They walk among us
Metalhead

Heed the warning
Come the day
They walk among us
Metalhead

I'm holding on so tightly now,
My insides scream so loud
They keep watching,
Watching me drowned,
How did it come to this

How did it come to this?
How did I know it was you?
It was a bad dream?
Asphyxiated and watch me bleed
The life support was cut,
The knot was too tight,
They push and pull me but
They know they'll never win

Throw it all away throw it all away
I keep on screaming but
There's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but
I can't keep going on this way

I can't keep going,
Can't keep going on like this,
They make me sick,
And I get so sick of it,
Cause they won't let me,
They won't let me breath,
Why can't they let me be?

Why can't they let me be?
Why don't I know what I am?
I force this hate into my heart
Cause it's my only friend,
My lips are sewn shut,
I watch my self bleed,
They push and pull me
And it's killing me within

Throw it all away throw it all away
I keep on screaming but
There's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but
I can't keep going on this way

I can't keep going,
Can't keep going on this way
I can't keep going,
Can't keep going on this way

My heart beat stumbles and
My back bone crumbles
I feel is it real as
The lynch mob doubles?

They want blood and they'll kill for it,
Drain me and they'll kneel for it
Burn me at the stake met
The devil made the deal for it.

Guillotine dreams, yeah,
They're guillotine gleams,
The blood of they're enemies
Watching while they sense me.

Sentencing ceased, sentence
Diseased and watch them bask
In the glory of their holy disease

Throw it all away throw it all away
I keep on screaming but
There's really nothing left to say
So get away, just get away
I keep on fighting but
I can't keep going on this way

I keep on running,
I keep on running
I keep on running
But I can't keep
Going on this way

I keep on running
I keep on running
But I can't keep
Going on this way

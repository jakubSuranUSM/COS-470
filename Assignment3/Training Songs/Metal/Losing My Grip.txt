Cold stove waits for me when i get home
No fire burns for me living on my own
I could de in my sleep, nobody'd ever bother asking why
Lying here, all alone listening to my soul cry

Chorus:
I must be losing my grip
I feel i'm slipping away
Now the dawn's coming after me
Lost another day

Born in the middle of no time west of nowhere
Looking for a saddle just to take my burden elsewhere

Repeat chorus

Solo

Repeat chorus

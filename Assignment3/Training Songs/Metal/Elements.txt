Elements, wind, fire, water, earth
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy

Pools of sounds fill my mind
A universe of shapes
Kaleidoscope of colors
Star gardens blossom in their solitude
Spiral architecture
Here I'm standing
Here I'm wondering
Curiosity, thirst for knowledge

Eye for an eye and the whole world will be blind
Oceans of madness drowning the hope of mankind
What kind of man kills because of ideology?
What kind of god justifies violence?

I am begging for comprehension
While aggression tears the world apart

Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(We are star children)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what we are made of)
Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(That's what life's made of)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what I'm made of)

Wind, bringer of fright
Fire, protector
Water, cleanse my soul
Earth, be my guide

And in the darkest night
I won't give up the fight
I won't be losing hope
I hold on to what is true

Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(We are star children)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what we are made of)
Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(That's what life's made of)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what I'm made of)

Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(That's what life's made of)
Elements, wind, fire, water, earth, elements
(That's what life's made of)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what I'm made of)
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
(That's what I'm made of)

Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements
Elements, fear, anger, sorrow, joy, elements

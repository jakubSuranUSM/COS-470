Horror

It's written in the pages, you have been warned for years
Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears
It's written in the pages, you have been warned for years
Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears

You chose whom you would serve
You chose your side, now you get what you deserve
You chose your side, now pay your price

The battle lines have been drawn
Knee deep in blood we'll sing our victory song
The battle lines have been drawn
Knee deep in blood we'll sing our victory song

War like this world has never seen
The time for mercy has passed
Evil shall triumph no more
This world wins no more

It's written in the pages, you have been warned for years
Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears
It's written in the pages, you have been warned for years
Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears

She was a ricochet heading back at me
She was the full circle nightmare weaved into the thick of my dreams at night
I toss and I turn and I wake up without you at my side
These days there's a million ways to make love to a woman
But I can't find one way with you
You're the full circle nightmare making all these bad dreams come true

He was a day late, he was a dumb kid
He was a little less than what you like so why the hell did you go with it at all?
His picture's perfect babe but it's hanging crooked there on your wall for show
And now you've got to live with every photo you wish you could let go, too bad
The full circle nightmare never lets you have what you had

But what's a boy to do with such a whiplash woman?
I never make it through to you in time

It was my last night, it was my last chance
It was a warehouse party where I saw her spinning around in the dance, alone
A flash of light hit me right in the eyes then she was gone so quick
And the people 'round the punch bowl made me feel so twisted and sick of you
You're the full circle nightmare making all these bad dreams come true

But what's a boy to do with such a whiplash woman?
I never make it through to you in time

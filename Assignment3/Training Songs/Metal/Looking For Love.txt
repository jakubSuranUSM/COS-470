I want to, I need to, I got to move on down the line
If not to, to make me, I should have stood behind the lines
What is this, what have I, what am I? Not what you see
So take me, so use me, I'm stupid, I don't want to

Oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love

A standard, a program, religion burns me at the stake
I questioned, I listened, I worshiped, how can I relate?
I worked so hard at it, oh Lord, the bruises and the burns
I just don't, don't get it, I guess I lost my faith

Oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love
Woh oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love

Lookin', lookin', lookin'
Lookin', lookin', lookin'

Oh, lookin' for love
Woh, lookin' for love
Woh oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love
Yeah

Oh, lookin' for love
Woh oh, lookin' for love
Woh oh, lookin' for love
Oh, lookin' for love

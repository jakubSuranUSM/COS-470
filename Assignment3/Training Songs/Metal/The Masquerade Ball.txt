See the Sun over the rainbow
And the rain comes falling down
Holy nights, the spirit of the temple
They appeared to take the crown

Evil shadows were passing through the air
No one knows if he is there

The bell strikes midnight, the mist begins to rise
The master's calling your name
Soul to soul, the last light of eternity
Lost fools for the game

Winged assassin with power and his grace
The evil force arisen from the grave

It's the Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball

Climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder
The evil's in despair
The Masquerade Ball

Dark shadows of the Moon
The Sun had turned to black
Evil eyes are ready to attack

Dust to dust, the mist was fading
The earls have just arrived
Who ever knows who will survive

Get away from the demon dance
And lock on the doors
No place for the holy this midnight romance
No prayers on the floor

It's the Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball

Climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder
The evil's in despair

The Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball
The Masquerade Ball
Yeah
The Masquerade Ball

It's the Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball

Climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder
The evil's in despair

On and on they sailed away
With fire in their eyes
The burning heat began to rise

Eye to eye with broken chains
They left the house of black
Escaping from final attack

Get away from the demon dance
And lock on the doors
No place for the holy this midnight romance
No prayers on the floor

It's the Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball

Climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder
The evil's in despair

The Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow
On the other side
The Masquerade Ball

Climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder
The evil's in despair

The Masquerade Ball
See the wizard fly
The Masquerade Ball
Yeah
See'em fly

Evil's in despair
The Masquerade Ball

On and on they sailed away
With fire in their eyes
The burning heat began to rise

On and on they climbed
Through the wind (they)
(But soon they turned to)

(See the wizard)

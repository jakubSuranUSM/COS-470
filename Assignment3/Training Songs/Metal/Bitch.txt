I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and suffering
you put me through

I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and suffering
you put me through

I can't imagine
to be like you
All the pain and suffering
I go through

You surrounded yourself
with evil
Every nightmare you have
is your equal

(don't hesitate)
You live in your own hell.
(outta my way)
You're surrounded by evil
(don't hesitate)
you can't get away
(outta my way, outta my way)

Dark clouds will follow you 
rainy days
will always find you 
you can't ever get away 
Evil will come
Another day

(don't hesitate)
You live in your own hell.
(outta my way)
You're surrounded by evil 
(don't hesitate)
you can't get away 
(outta my way, outta my way)

I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and suffering
you put me through
(repeat)

I can't imagine
to be like you
All the pain and suffering
I go through

You surrounded yourself
with evil
I hope it catched you up

I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and the suffering
you put me through

I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and the suffering
you put me through

I can't imagine
to be like you
the pain and the suffering
you put me through

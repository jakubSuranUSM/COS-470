Breathing in and breathing out
My head leaned back, my hands are tied
I stand in here alone I scream
Questions why

Days slip by and nights I taste
These memories run through my veins
Injecting me with one last kiss
Screaming why

This medication can't save me
And desperation takes hold of me
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you
(You believed in me)

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

Determination is pushing me
And perseverance is what I bleed
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you
(You believed in me)

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me
To say goodbye

God please hear me calling

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here again
Never bring me back here again
Never bring me back

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me
To say goodbye

God please hear me calling

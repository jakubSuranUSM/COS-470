A long time ago when we met you were lonely. 
I helped you forget life was solely 
Only a wish to survive 
And blood flows much thicker than wine. 
Friends who give up their time to be near you, 
Sing you a song just to cheer you, 
You will be rich in the end, 
Brother now you've got a friend. 
Life hurries by in the wink of an eye 
Almost without meaning. 
Days speeding past, like the wind, hard to grasp. 
No wonder you're bleeding. 
Friendship is needed today 
Or tomorrow is empty and we need each other; please stay 
For our only hope is together. 
We'll live in much calmer weather 
And we'll make a beautiful blend, 
Brother, now you've got a friend. 
Friends who give up their time to be near you, 
Sing you a song just to cheer you, 
You will be rich in the end, 
Brother, now you've got a friend.

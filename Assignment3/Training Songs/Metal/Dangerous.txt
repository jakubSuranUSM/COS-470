I know I won't change, I have tried
Was feeling so caged, hands tied
I can't find anything feeling so right,
it's blinding hope

The reaper is close, seen his smile
A matter of time, can't deny
I won't turn around, around, around
This destiny's mine

The countdown has begun
the walls are falling down
my life is on the line
the freedom is mine

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til worlds collide
It's dangerous
So dangerous
Dangerous

I know it's not safe, close my eyes
I search for the edge of life
'cause that's the only place I'll ever find
that makes me whole

A thief in the night, out of sight
It's out there waiting to ignite
the fever will rise, rise, rise
taking over my mind

The countdown has begun
the walls are falling down
my life is on the line
the freedom is mine...

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til worlds collide
It's dangerous
So dangerous
Dangerous

Nothing matters anyhow
It's like I'm floating off the ground
Into the hands of air I dive
Rays of light flashing by

Like the time is slowing down
When the world is out of sight
All the memories in my mind
Won't leave me behind
It's dangerous(dangerous)
It's dangerous (dangerous)
It's dangerous!

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til worlds collide
It's dangerous
So dangerous
Dangerous

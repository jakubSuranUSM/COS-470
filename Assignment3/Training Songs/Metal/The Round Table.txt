[The story of Round Table. It was crafted of the finest wood in Britain. Around this Round Table Arthur gathered the most valiant and noble knights in all the land. The ideals of the Round Table were: Honesty, bravery, daring, magnanimity, being of service to the other Knights of the Round Table, and loyalty. The names of some of the Knights of the Round Table were: Sir Kay, Sir Balin and Sir Balan, Sir Parcival, Sir Gaiwan, Sir Tristan, Sir Irec and, of course, Sir Lancelot. An important aim of the Knights of the Round Table was to find the Holy Grail]

Table of the finest wood
Mankind has ever seen
Without head and without foot
A sign of eternity

All knights are equal here
And so is even the King
Our swords point to its center
Giving us the power to win

Together we stand
Steel in our hands
Fighting forever
Forever we stand

Forever we fight
Side by side
Forever we stand
Forever we fight

Give us the wisdom - Almighty Lord
To make out wrong from right
Give us the will to choose the Right
And the readiness to sacrifice

We become free in serving each other
We're Camelots pounding heart
Round table of true brothers
Until death do us part

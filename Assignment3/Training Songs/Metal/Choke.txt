Pray for another life
Pay, regain your pride

See your brain, choke
Watch it drain, choke
See your greed, choke
Watch it breed, choke

Fake, you're falling down
Choke, your neck is broken

See your brain, choke
Watch it drain, choke
See your greed, choke
Watch it breed, choke

Victim in conflict, the ambush of fear
My doubt, my limit, the pulse of my war

See your brain, choke
Watch it drain, choke
See your greed, choke
Watch it breed, choke

When I'm down I make a call
Got the number written on the wall
First it's busy then I try again
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?
I got the number and it starts to ring
I get excited and I start to dream
I start to fantasize of memory lane
Then she answers and she says right way

She says I'm home on my own
Home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight) She's one of a kind
(She's tight) She's a talented girl
(She's tight) She's got her head down tight

I have something got to say to you
Amnesia and my train of thought
On the tip, the tip of my tongue
I had a vision when I was young
You floated in, we floated up
Through the window and down the hall
I smoke a joint and went upstairs
Turned the door and I opened the key

She said I'm on my own
Home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight) She's one of a kind
(She's tight) She's a talented girl
(She's tight) She's got her head down tight

Touch it
Oooh

(She's tight) She's giving me the go
(She's tight) She's giving me the high sign
(She's tight) Turn off the lights
(She's tight) Pull down the shades
(She's nice, she's tight) Turn on the camera
(She's nice, she's tight) And getting ready for action
(She's nice, she's tight)
(She's nice, she's tight)
Turn off the radio
(She's nice, she's tight)
(She's nice, she's tight)
Turn on the video

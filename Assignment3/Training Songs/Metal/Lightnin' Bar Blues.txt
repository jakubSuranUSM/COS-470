Alright
I don't need no diamond rings
I don't need no Cadillac car
I just want to drink my ripple wine
Down in the Lightnin' Bar
Well some men value fortune and fame
I don't care about none
I just want to drink my ripple wine
I want to have my good time fun
Have my good time fun
Oh yeah, ooh
Oh yeah when I die don't bother me
Well don't bury me at all
Just place my livin' lovin' laughin' bones
In a jar of alcohol
A jar of alcohol
Everybody now
In the Lightnin' Bar

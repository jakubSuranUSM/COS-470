Summers coming to fast 
Winters been here to long
If we keep wasting our days
Pretty soon they'll be gone

[oh yeah yeah yeah]

I've been out here all night 
I've been out here all day
With my eyes open wide
Hoping that you will say
Everything is alright
We can be happy too
If you look out for me the way I looked out for you

People take what they need
Then they tell you get lost
Kindly leading you on
While they're ripping you off

[oh yeah yeah yeah]

I've been out here all night 
I've been out here all day
With my eyes open wide
Hoping that you will say
Everything is alright
We can be happy too
If you look out for me the way I looked out for you

If I sounded insecure it's because I wasn't sure you really cared

I've been out here all night 
I've been out here all day
With my eyes open wide
Hoping that you will say
Everything is alright
We can be happy too
If you look out for me the way I looked out for you

You can stand there all night 
You can stand there all day
You can do what you like
It doesn't matter to me

[oh yeah yeah yeah]

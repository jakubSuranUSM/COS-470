Locked in battle hardened
Deep despair and doubt
A gaggle of grenades with
All the pins pulled out

A dog bit my hand, I'm crawling on the ground
Asking for some help, but no one ever comes
Walking in a nightmare, please turn on the light
I hear the strangest sounds, can anyone hear them?

I hear them

Hit my head on the wall, 'til my keepers come
Protect me from myself, off to the quiet room
Weird specters ride the air, I know I can't be wrong
I see and hear them too, can anyone else hear them?

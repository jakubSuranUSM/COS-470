Laughing in the face of destruction
With nowhere to go
We thought on all the dreams that we had
Then we let them show

We climbed up to the top, but could not see
The skies were a blaze
But after all that was said still we felt shame oh oh
Red sky, red sky at night

Stretched out as far as I could see
Red sky, red sky at night
I felt them coming over me
A shout was the first of the warnings

And then came the rain
Visions were torn from the lies that melted out the sane
They did it for love and gave it for free
Now all the things that are left

Are there for you and me
Red sky, red sky at night
Feeling them reaching over me
That one night, that I saw the light

Wondering what ever could it be
Laughing in the face of destruction
With nowhere to go
We thought on all the dreams that we had

Then we let them show
'Cause they did it for love, and gave it for free
Now all the things that are left
Are there for you and me

Red sky, red, sky at night etc.

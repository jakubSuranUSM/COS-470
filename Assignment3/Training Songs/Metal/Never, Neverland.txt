My room is full of toys and things
But filled with nothing new
Just me and clare alone in this
Enchanted, placid room
It's Saturday and no more school
There hasn't been for years
She says we're here forever
Till eternity

Our solitude has been disturbed
Clare hold on, don't flee
With open arms they call my name
"oh won't you come with me?"

Get back, back!
Just leave us all alone
Take that and that!
I'll break your every bone

Get back, back!
Just leave us all alone
Take that and that!
I'll break your every bone

Blacking out, poisoned
Colours now decay
Drifting off to never, neverland
Please don't take me away
To never, neverland
No, to the neverland

Time has passed and now I see
What I've lived through
I've got no fears that match the hate
That came from you
It's Saturday, I've things to do
I wish you all the best
Now I leave your placid room
Enjoy eternal rest

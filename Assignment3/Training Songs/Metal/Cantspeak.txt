can't speak
can't talk
can't do anything they want

can't hide
or change your mind
gonna live w/ all my soul
inside

can't speak
can't talk
can't stop for the reeling cause
or love
i told 'em all about it
can't talk
cause i'm already lost

can't think
can't cry
keep thinking of a suicide
it's hard
i just can't forget it
gonna fade cause i'm already dead

can't think
can't dream
don't care if i live or die
don't talk
i just can't believe it
gonna fade cause i'm already dead

can't speak
can't lie
don't go anywhere to hide
can't think
can't cry
keep thinking of a suicide

can't speak
can't talk
can't do anything i want
can't hide
or change your mind
gonna live with all my soul inside

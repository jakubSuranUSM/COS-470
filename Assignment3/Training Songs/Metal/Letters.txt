We don't need to listen anymore
I can't I won't take this life for granted
We can't consume this madness

It's with me when I sleep
It's with me when I breath
It's with me in my bones
It's fucking killing me

I won't be cursed or judged 
I won't be judged by something fake

We won't be pushed or shoved
We won't give up our love
It's time to take your stand
And take your life by the hand

Let's end this spiral down
Pick ourselves off the ground
F*ck their rules, and f*ck their faith
F*ck the ones looking down on me

The rain is pouring down
It's us who wear the crown
We don't need to hate this life
We don't need anything

I don't need you 

We won't be pushed or shoved
We won't give up our love
It's time to take our stand
Take your life by the hand

Let's end this spiral down
Pick ourselves off the ground
F*ck their rules, and f*ck their faith
F*ck the ones looking down on me

The rain is pouring down
It's us who wear the crown
We don't need to hate this life
We don't need anything

I'm tired of playing the fucking victim
No more will we bow our heads to the fucking machine
This is our time
This is our generation
And I refuse to fucking listen anymore

The gray wall saving who from who?
Unsung hero's killed going through
In the shadow of the wall another one dares

Twenty five years of nightmares
It's gotta stop (stop, take it or leave it)
It's a symbol of war (we don't want it)
Break it up (now)
Can't they see, there's no life behind closed doors

[Bridge]
(We don't need no) and we don't need no
(Fallen hero's) fallen hero's
(We don't need no) and we don't need no, blood on our hands no more

[Chorus]
(Breakdown the wall) dividing
(Who need fools deciding)
(Breakdown the wall) dividing
We'll go down fighting (breakdown the wall) repeat

East and West coming face to face
Split either side, a city disgraced
When somebody dies it adds a brick in the wall
The bigger they are the harder they fall

It's too tough (Tough they got what they wanted)
It's to late now (Get what's coming)
Stand up (Now)
Talks not enough,, we want action not words

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge] 

[Repeat Chorus]

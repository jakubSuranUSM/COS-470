Change your Visions, give us a sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control
I'm gonna be a fucking superstar

Keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control

Change your Visions, give us a sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control

Well it's not too much to ask of you, baby
It's not too much to ask
It's not too much to ask of you, baby

Just leave this place
So no-one's a flat age
Just leave this place
We are going to turn things around

So no-one's a flat age
Just leave this place
We are going to turn things around

Well everyday you come say its alright
You come say it, you say that its alright
Drowning but you can't breathe the air to save you
At this point you're right

Keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control

Change your Visions, give us a sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control

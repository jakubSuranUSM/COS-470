The things you say don't always hurt me
But things you do don't always make me cry
The things you do they don't always hurt me
But when they hurt me you're the reason why
The things you do are without reason
The things for me to do is let it lie
But when I lie the pain ain't easin'
You know the reason you're the reason why.
Sometime's I'm up sometime's I'm down
Sometime's I don't know where I'm going anyway
Sometimes I feel just like a clown
And I don't know where I'm going
And I just don't know the way
The things you say don't always hurt me
. . .
Sometimes I'm up sometimes I feel just like a clown
And I know just where I'm going
And I just don't know the way
The things you say don't always hurt me

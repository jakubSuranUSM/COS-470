For all your life
you've cared about
people you don't really care about
You've heard them shout
and you've heard them out
Now what's that all about?

And all the world's a United Nations
of faceless scorn and starvation
The friend you need is a friendly invasion
with no "what's in it for me?"

Saturday! And all that is flashing
for the velvet cause of lonely trolls
Getaway! Nobody's asking you to stay put
Still you vapourize and try to hide it
Now I wanna hear you shout it:

I don't want the trust that can be bought
My kind of trust is shareware
I don't want the trust that can be bought
My kind of trust is shareware
My kind of trust is shareware
My kind of trust is shareware, baby!

Now you don't know me but you may have seen
me rocking the rules of estethic hygiene
My talk is dirty but my boots are clean
Now ain't that worth a scream?

You can leave your money and your telephone
Let's go and see if our friends are home
We'll cast a long shadows from dusk Â´til dawn
Until we're all alone

Saturday! And all that is flashing
for the velvet cause of lonely trolls
Any day, I hear you saying
They've filled us up with
TV-lies and tranquilizers,
Man! I should have realized that

I don't want the trust that can be bought
My kind of trust is shareware
I don't want the trust that can be bought
My kind of trust is shareware
My kind of trust is shareware
My kind of trust is a shy kind of trust but the right kind of trust is a shareware

And that suits me just fine, 'cause I wake up at five.
And the clients begin to wind up
Like thugs in a criminal lineup.
And they call my name to take them to heaven tonight
Say hello to and angel of sin
I'm the meanest mother that has ever been
Giving candy why to your children and callin' them my friends.
They say, spyder come back soon again
I dreamt that I saw wearin' mirrored glasses.
He said, punk don't you peddle your poison to those ignorant masses.
So I said, with all due respect sir, I'm a pusher, not a homewrecker.
Besides what am I doing talking to you anyway?
Say hello to an angel of sin.
I'm meanest mother that has ever been.
Giving candy to you parents 'cause there my only friends.
They say, Spyder come back soo again.
Doctors, nurses on the phone.
A sun-soaked soda methadone.
Somebody turn these light off in my eyes!
How did I get so far away?
What are these bomber on my brain?
If bring the death of me is what they want then fine.
'Cause all they need is an excuse
To put my happy neck into a noose
And say bye-bye.
Say hello to an angel of sin.
I'm the meanest mother that has ever been.
Giving candy to your children and callin' them my friends.
They say, Spyder come back soon again.
Getting underneath your psyche
With needles and pins.
They say, Spyder come back soon again.

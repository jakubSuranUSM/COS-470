Spread the word
Through me God is heard
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
You're making me laugh
Jesus saves
But only after I've been paid
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
End your hoax

God say's have a T.V. show
God say's baby do some blow
God say's taxes are a sin
God say's pour the money in

Rape the poor, faith no more
Faith for cash, make me laugh
Faith no more, face the whore
Rape your past, make me laugh

Never, never, ever sin
Unless God say's to stick it in
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
The truth can choke
Defrocked from your seat
Don't shit where you set
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
That God talks to you
There's no hope

God say's have a T.V. show
God say's baby do some blow
God say's taxes are a sin
God say's pour the money in

Rape the floor, faith no more
Faith for cash, make me laugh
Faith no more, face the whore
Rape your past, make me laugh

God say's have a swimming pool
God say keep the doghouse cool
God say's planes and boats and cars
God say's have an amusement park

God say's go and masturbate
God say's file taxes lets
God say's paint your face all sick
God say's be a real prick
God say's have a T.V. show
God say's baby do some blow
God say's taxes are a sin
God say's pour the money in

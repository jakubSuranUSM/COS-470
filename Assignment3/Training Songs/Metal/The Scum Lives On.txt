Well my misery's without company
My partners in crime have been taken from me
We used to laugh about our legacy
Couldn't get arrested on mtv
Johnny thunders was a new york doll
He cared so much he didn't care at all
Stiv bator went to catholic school
Turned his sins into something cool
And the scum lives on
All my friends are gone
Why they gotta die so young
And the scum lives on
Brian jones and keith moon had style

Bon scott was a problem child
Rob tyner bugged the f.b.i.
Was abbie hoffman really suicide?
Jesse helms' gonna live forever
Jimmy swaggart's gonna live forever
Dan quayle's gonna live forever
Ronald reagan already lived forever
Reverend donald wildmon will live forever
Rush limbaugh's gonna live forever
All the politician's gonna live forever
Nixon taught them all how to live forever
I'd hate to think it's conspiracy
No one's left who makes sense to me
The immoral majority adding insult to my injury

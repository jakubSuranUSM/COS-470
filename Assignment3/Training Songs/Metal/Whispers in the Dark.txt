I saw you looking at me in the eye
I was hypnotized, so surprised
A memory from another time
Hit me from behind, where could I hide

You touched me, you asked me
If I never, how I met you, I left you
Oh, please don't remind me
Forget me, you kiss me, you touch me again

I can't forget, can't forget, can't forget you
And in my mind I think of old times
So every night I cry till it slides

This jealousy is burning, in things I see
It's killing me, so it's killing me
Now that I have to face what I've lost
It's time to pay the price for my lies

You touched me, you asked me
If I never, how I met you,I left you
Oh, please don't remind me
Forget me, you kiss me, you touch me again

I can't forget, can't forget, can't forget you
And in my mind I think of old times
I can't forget your Whispers in the Dark...

I can't forget your Whispers in the Dark
I can't forget, can't forget, can't forget...

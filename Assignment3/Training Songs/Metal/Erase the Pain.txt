Spinning around my mental now
Oh, my head’s been filled with doubt
What I kept inside will eat me alive
Or will it keep me safe and sound?

'Cause I’m half alive
Numb inside
Dying to feel
I’m dying to feel

I can’t feel anything
So lost and I can’t be saved
Your voice but a memory
Fade to black and erase the pain
Erase the pain
Fade to black and erase the pain

Losing a piece of what I found
Losing myself in all this crowd
If I told you I’d die
Would you keep me alive?
Oh, would you save me from myself?

Half alive
Numb inside
Dying to feel
I’m dying to feel

I can’t feel anything
So lost and I can’t be saved
Your voice but a memory
Fade to black and erase the pain
Erase the pain
Fade to black and erase the pain

I pretend, I pretend
I pretend 'til I bend and bend
'Til I’m broken
Are you broken?
I forget, I forget
I forget 'til it crept and crept
Am I hopeless?
Are you hopeless?

I can’t feel anything
So lost and I can’t be saved
Your voice but a memory
Fade to black and erase the pain
I can’t feel anything
Fade to black and erase the pain
I can’t feel anything
Fade to black and erase the pain

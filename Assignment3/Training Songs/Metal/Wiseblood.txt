When I was young some wise fool told me
Live & learn but nothing comes for free
So I did what I could when I was able
To keep the truth away from our table

Young blood creepin what you need
Wiseblood shake em down to his knees
Guaranteed

Well I never walked I just learned to fly
Heaven or high was the way I stayed alive
I've seen them devils pound our bible
You saints and sinners are both my rival

Young blood creepin what you need
Wiseblood shake em down to his knees
Aim to please

There's blood on the street but there's nothing to steal from me
Cause I walk alone but at least I walk for free
I listen to few and I'm fueled by fire
Guess now I'm old but not much wiser

Young blood creepin what you need
Wiseblood shake em down to his knees
Young blood creepin what you need
Wiseblood shake em down to his knees
Guaranteed

So you don't believe
No, you don't believe
Said you can't believe
You can't believe in me
Well I've learned to need
And I've learned to need
And I've learned to need that I don't need you

You were something
I thought you were everything
You were nothing
Somehow you were everything

But I forgive myself
I forgive myself
I'll learn to forgive myself for what I've done
I could taste it I could feel it
I became it and I want it

It was something
I thought it was everything
It was nothing
It turned into everything

If I could yeah I would
If I could everything
If I could yeah I would
If I could

So I've gone too far?
Have I gone too far?
Yeah I've gone too far
So what, what is too far
Am I breathing?
Am I bleeding?
Am I dying?
I just don't know

It was something it was something
I thought it was everything
It was nothing it was nothing
It turned into everything

If I could yeah I would
If I could everything
If I could yeah I would
If I could

There is no choice but to look inside
Look around you
They'll let you down
They'll disappoint you
They'll take you to the bottom
And they'll leave you there
They'll let you down
Look around you
You don't need this

I thought it was everything
If I could yeah I would
If I could everything
If I could yeah I would
If I could

Goodbye
Goodbye to everything

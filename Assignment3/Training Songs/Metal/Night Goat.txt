She wants my way to feel
And I cut my teeth
It's more than nine hundred miles
Oh, I got no more me
Well, you can make my teeth grind
You can make my underworld
It's a bit done well now
It's a big dark hell
You sit and watch out for your tails
Like a poison sold on demand
Like a hard chance
Like a pig tail
I walked myself away
Well, baby, I'm talked about
And I felt it grow
She makes you undefiled now
And she'll clean my nose
I looked so Peaceful
I looked so underworld
I ain't got no mind
But I ain't got no tail
You looked like such a worthy man
Like a sinner tossed on the wind
Like a hard sell
Like I've passed on
Like a willow thrown away
On signs I'll walk down for the way
Like a poison sold on demand
Like a hard sell
Like I'm set down
Like the well one goes away

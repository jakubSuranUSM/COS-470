Every now and then, I feel the autumn wind
And then I think of you
It lingers for a lifetime, and holds my breath in check
I don't know what to do.

Did you think I would see it coming
Turn around, look at me I'm running
Now, my love
Through the years, all the pain and suffering
Children's cries, amount to nothing
Rise above

What you see is what you get
Stake your life now, place your bet
You better believe I know, I'll be letting you go.

Will you ever know what I wanted to say?
Maybe you'll find a way
Maybe I'll be alright
Remember this night and I'll see you someday.

Many nights, I listened to
The sounds that made me cry and kept
My soul awake

But even in the darkness,
I could see the endless oceans
That our tears would make.

Why'd you lay our love to rest?
Gave it up, put it to the test of time, my love
My life's just not the same
Not a question of who's to blame,
I'll rise above

Don't you know that Love is War
That's what we're living for
You better believe I know,
I'll be letting you go

Will you ever know what I wanted to say?
Maybe you'll find a way
Maybe I'll be alright
Remember this night
And I'll see you someday.

Will you ever know what I wanted to say?
Maybe you'll find a way
Maybe I'll be alright

Remember this night, and I'll See You Someday.
Will you ever know what I wanted to say?
Maybe you'll find a way
Maybe I'll be alright
Remember this night, and I'll See Ya, I'll See You Someday

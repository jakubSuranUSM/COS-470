Yesterday as I went out of the house
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
She was lying face down in the sewer
What you do-I got up closer and realized that I knew her
What you see-All her organs comingfrom her inside
That's nasty-Slashed up skin, sliced-up hide
Tell me some more-Turned her over and saw the tire tracks on her head
Then what-That's when I realized she was dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
her body was minced meat
Bust crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I wonder how much you had to pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled
Well she had-Chewed-off toes on her chopped-off feet
Say what?-I took a picture 'cause I thought it was neat
That's cold-But the thing I like seeing the best
What's that-Was the rodents using her hair as a nest
Damn-I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead

I know it is your allowance that you'll really miss
But make it look good at her funeral and give her a kiss

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of read-And she doesn't know how to swim
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see-What's that?
Your dead mommy lying in front of me
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
I hope she dies twenty times more

I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead
I saw her, I saw her
Mommy
I saw your mommy

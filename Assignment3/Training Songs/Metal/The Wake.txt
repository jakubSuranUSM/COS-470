Living silence, hidden deep
Clouded vision, nothing seen
Arise above normality
Open your eyes so I can see
Can't you hear the scream in me?
I'm dying for the chance to be
No chance for reality
To live and reign inside of me
Screams of pain
Wake of death
Relentless reign
A precedent
The wake of severity is pushing through
A kick in the face is overdue
Knowing what you believe is right
Blind to everything in sight
Living terror
From within
The wake of severity will now
Begin
I had a vision of non-existence
To pass away, ceased to exist
Depart this life, become no more
Become extinct just like before No
The wake you can't evade
Time's path is laid
Drowning in our fate
A droplet of existence
I a wave of ignorance
On the path of resistance
Only to prove our persistence
The wake of severity is pushing through
A kick in the face is overdue
Screams of pain
Wake of death

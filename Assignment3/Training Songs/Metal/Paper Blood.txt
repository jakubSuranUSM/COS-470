In our shop, as you can see
You'd be a man you want to be
Unhappy with the way it goes?
Just buy another life

And our prices, who can beat?
Here's royal flesh and cannot meat
You name it, my associate
Is sharpening her knife

Please take a peek inside
Tell me how, how it feels like

When you're spilling paper blood in the blaze of glory
Paper blood, on the holy ground
Paper blood, never ending story
Paper blood makes the world go round and round

We've got it covered to the tee
Another wife? Just take a brief:
Look at this fine selection of those 
Bitches from the East

We're selling friends, we're selling cars
A recent show with superstars
A child, a war, a heart, a soul
It's all to make you pleased, right!

Nothing is too strange 
When we are in this price range

You're wasting paper blood in the blaze of glory
Paper blood, on the holy ground
Paper blood, never ending story
Paper blood can buy a tiny crown
For this sad and weary clown
So he can smile and take a look around
Across his kingdom, fake as it could be
(And what's wrong with that?)
Where tears of joy're impossible to see
(What do we need them for?)
Where heartfelt laughter's not what you will hear
(And so what?)
Enough of that, 'coz it's my biggest fear

Congress shall make no law
Respecting an establishment of religion
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
Or abridging the freedom of speech
Or of the press
Or of the right of the people peacefully to assemble
And to petition the government for a re-dress of grievances

Revoke this verbal mental muzzle
Protect the freedom of the mind
Speak out against the prejudicial
Extinguish ignorance by mouth

War of words
War of words

Disarm the bigotry with talk, talk
Incite the darkness from the veil
React to rhetoric conflict
Object with anger at the law

War of words
War of words
War of words
War of words

Congress shall make no law
Respecting an establishment of religion
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
Or abridging the freedom of speech
Or of the press
Or of the right of the people peacefully to assemble
And to petition the government for a re-dress of grievances

Denied opinion comes from silence
Remove the pressure of the tongue
Assault by speech toward the discord
Attack the fundamental creed

War of words
War of words
War of words
War of words
A War of words
A War of words
A War of words
A War

Living in the moment
Forgotten and repeated
No I cannot be that one
No I cannot be beaten

I'm the one

I don't want you
I don't need you
With pure thoughts I
See right through you
I was crawling
Always falling
You don't no what what
I have lived through

No I am not a rich man
No I am not a bitch
I know you made one mistake
This is my life
You cannot take it

I'm the one

I don't want you
I don't need you
With pure thoughts I
See right through you
I was crawling
Always falling
You don't no what what
I have lived through

Automatic
Termination
Self-destructive
Revolution

Bring it down
To the ground
I'm unchained
Not a slave

I'm the one

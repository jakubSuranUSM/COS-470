You pray for quiet,
Inside your head the screams won’t silence
I remember those days
The terror past our home, the fear that’s in your bones,
It just won’t go away, no.

The strangle holds, the insulting names,
The wound up shirt around his fist, the nose to nose beer stinking breath.
Thrown down onto the floor, so battered, bruised and sore
Choke down on the truth of it, and touch it until you break your neck

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray, and let the noise just fade away.

Retain to violence
Atop your heart like a secret closet,
So no one can penetrate
You just can’t stand the touch, affection weighs too much,
You push everyone away from

The reckoning! The bitter stings,
Whipped so bad I pissed myself still with a beating stub held belt
If this reminds you of home, you better know you’re not alone
Hold the gun up to my head, I'll pull the trigger on myself!

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray

These are the memories. In me
You didn’t want to know! You didn’t want to know!
These are the memories we keep
We don’t want to show! We don’t want to show!
By now you need to know, (You’re not alone)

Hush is all I need, hush the misery
Hush belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray and let the noise just fade away

My hands are tied to the evil
This soul is greed of man
Like a child wakening up to all the screaming
Stay quiet for a while
Hold on for a while now

Don't make a sound
Don't make a sound
Don't make a sound

Can this all be real?
Here we are headed straight to the bottom now
I gotta try and believe that's all we can do here
On a long-distance highland road

I'm begging
Untie me from the reaper
Forgive the honest man
See the side scheming
Pull your eyes together
Stick around for a while
We need you for a while now

Round for a while
Round for a while

Can this all be real?
Here we are headed straight to the bottom now
I gotta try and believe that's all we can do here
On a long-distance highland road

Can this all be real?
Here we are headed straight to the bottom now
I gotta try and believe that's all we can do here
On a long-distance highland road

Can this all be real?
Here we are headed straight to the bottom now
I gotta try and believe that's all we can do here
On a long-distance highland road
On a long-distance highland road

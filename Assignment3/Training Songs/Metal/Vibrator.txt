Larger than life, sharper than a knife,
Ever ready for the time,
Slick and smooth I'm bound to improve your mood,
And make you feel fine,
Stick with me now, I'm ready and how
I'm really starting to buzz,
Your feeling comes, I'm starting to hum,
I can do it like nothing else does,
You're never alone when I'm around
You can always rely on me,
I'm your friend, my love won't bend,
And that I can guarantee,
Straight and true and all for you,
I'm so eager to please,
Stick with me and I'll keep you free,
From any nasty disease,
'Cause I'm a vibrator,
Pleased I'm ready to start,
I'm vi-vi-vi-vibrator, with a power pack for a heart

Check my heart before you start,
I don't want to blow no fuse,
New battery, is that for me?
That's something I could really use,
Power surge I get the urge,
To do my legendary thing,
The stars in your eyes don't tell no lies,
I know your bells are starting to ring,
'Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator,
Pleased to make a start,
Vi-vi-vibrator, with a power pack for a heart

Wasn't that good, now wasn't that nice?
Now see we get along real fine,
I knew I was the boy for you,
When you came for the second time,
Clean me up, put me away,
You know you need the rest,
I'll be here whenever you need me,
I've never ever failed the test,
'Cause I'm a vi-vi-vi-vibrator,
Pleased to make a start,
Vi-vi-vi-vibrator, with a power pack for a heart
Vi-vi-vi-vibrator,
Pleased to make a start,
Vi-vi-vi-vi-vibrator
And I'll never ever break your heart

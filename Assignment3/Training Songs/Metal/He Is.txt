We're standing here by the abyss and the world is in flames
Two star-crossed lovers reaching out to the beast with many names

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater
He is

We're hiding here inside a dream and all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning stars will lead the way into the void

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater
He is

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be
He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And he is
The disobedience that holds us together
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater
And we are falling over the precipice

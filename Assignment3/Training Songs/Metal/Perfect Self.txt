Settle down you all
Can't you hear the footsteps
Down the hall?
You're waiting for the scream
Of your conscience call
And everyone starts dying

What the f*ck is wrong
I said that I would always
Find my way back home
Now everyone I love
Has been left alone
And everyone starts dying

It's you and I
Begging for life
It's you and I

[chorus: x2]
Seems like in death
We all become our perfect self
Last chance to pray
And rid our self of the pain

Help comes when I don't even want it
Do you really believe that I need it?
Seems like in death
I'm alive
[repeat]

[chorus]

Are we closer now?

[chorus: x2]

Seems like in death
I'm alive
Help comes when I don't even want it
Seems like in death
Do you really believe?

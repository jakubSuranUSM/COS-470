Time seemed to pass me by 
I found myself alone, wondering why 
Then you came into my life 
And gave your love to me 
That showed me the way 
In my heart you'll stay

And I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever it will be 
You and me together

I want your love forever 
I need your love 
You're the only one 
That fills my heart 
And I love you 
More and more everyday

And I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever 
it will be you and me 
I will sing to you and all you do 
Always and forever 
it will be you and me together

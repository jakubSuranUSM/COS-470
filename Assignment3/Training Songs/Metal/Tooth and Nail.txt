Desperate living, driving me mad
Writings on the wall
Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had
Just to watch them fall

Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail

Last generation, reckless and free
Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going trough me
Fate lies in the cards

Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail

Desperate living, trying to see
Breaking all the rules
Only the strong are gonna be free
From a world of fools

Tooth and nail
Tooth and nail
Straight to the top
Tooth and nail

You're taking care of your instincts
No matter what you do
Your life could be so much better 
When everything is through
The demons that refused to let you go
They left with empty hands
You got to give it a try
Don't put an end to your life
'Cause that's where you choke your last sigh

You gotta rise with me!
Cause you're so vulnerable. 
Me!
No need for sympathy now
Yet so admirable
Say

Your passion for art is your well hidden cure
'Cause that's where you have a plan
Escaping could be such a movement now
In your fragile heart all so true

You'll never ever hurt yourself again!

I would hate to grab the mic and sound like the next man, or the last man, 
That's why when you're swinging, I swang and swung, 
Everthing already been done, so when you see us on stage, 
Son it's all about the fun, yeah fun, 
Electric guitars, bass and drums, type of illness, 
Primo pulls a sample from, yeah I rhyme with twist and turns, 
Like the Guggenheim, you'll be left behind, as we're on an incline 
You see this be the third time singing on that line with the dots, 
Some people call it funk, rap, rock, or pop, 
Others say alternative and label it a fusion, clueless but were you true to this 

Go to get your fill 
Do what you will 
Me, I going at it like its time to kill 
I'm seeing what I'm wanting and I'm grabbing it 
You heard it right here 
Yo! I'm mad for it 
Go get your fill 
Do what you will 
Me I'm going at it no time to chill 
I'm seeing what I'm wanting and I'm grabbing it 
You heard it right here 
Yo! I'm mad for it 

We getting blessed yo, so let your stress go 
Why you wanna carry such a heavy cargo 
We are those Santos and Diablos, prepared to flex so, 
What do you want to know, 
Yo! I can serve your spirit on a platter pronto quickfast 
I been born to blast 
Many praise the calf of gold, sold their soul 
And so they feel the wrath, you do the math 
Some walk upon a crooked path, now look at that 
Trying to stay strapped and packed like Arafat 
But matterfact, they never knew science 
When I hop up on the microphone 
I do it like a giant 

Go to get your fill 
Do what you will 
Me, I going at it like its time to kill 
I'm seeing what I'm wanting and I'm grabbing it 
You heard it right here 
Yo! I'm mad for it 
Go get your fill 
Do what you will 
Me I'm going at it no time to chill 
I'm seeing what I'm wanting and I'm grabbing it 
You heard it right here 
Yo! I'm mad for it 

What I represent is MC's going mad (x4)

Making your move
You come down fast as lightning
Crossing the stage
And now you can feel the excitement

So shake it up
Turn it on
Shake it up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]

Your daddy don't know
What your mama's gonna do tonight
I said your daddy don't know
What your mama's gonna do tonight

She's breaking your heart
You'd better be your own best friend
'Cause once you learn the steps
It's something you'll never forget

Shake it
Shake it up
Shake it up
Sh-sh-shake it up

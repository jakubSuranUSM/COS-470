Taking a chance going
Into the great unknown

Facing your fears and feel
What's on your mind
When all alone

Fall into the sea
Soon you will be free
Into the deep you disappear
Down you go, descend below

Dive deeper into the ocean
You will find more
About your emotions
As you go far beyond
Imaginary borderlines
Into the deep unknown

A need to breathe, might drown,
You can't inhale
No one around, sliding down,
Time passes by
You cannot fail

As light fades away
There's so much to gain
You're holding on, It's not in vain

Dive deeper into the ocean
You will find more
About your emotions
As you go far beyond
Imaginary borderlines

Dive deeper into the ocean
You will find more
About your emotions
As you go far beyond
Imaginary borderlines

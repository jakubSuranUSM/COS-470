I painted a picture of you
Your soul was red & your mind was blue
Destiny lad a light on my creation
This dream I had made a slave of my passion
Reality was always too far away

And we were happy until it came too close 1 day
Suddenly I faced the truth of my dream
My love had only been a picture, a scene
I suppose I needed to believe
Didn't want to see you had never been close to me

[Chorus]
But I'm sorry
This illusion has caused you a lot of pain
And I have no solution
I'll try to never be back again

I'm sorry [Repeat: x4]

I painted a picture of you
My dream was a lie & the lie became truth
Reality held his breath too long
It's disgusting what dreams can do

[Chorus]

I'm sorry [Repeat: x4]

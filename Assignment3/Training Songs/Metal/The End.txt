I got a new kind of fear
Something you don't wanna view
There's this path that I can see
It leads straight to misery
We can't undo what we have done
Just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble
The fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? (That slow last breath of air)
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

What if I say to you
Let's leave this earth for a while
A perspective from the hollow
And the wheel we can't control

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? (That slow last breath of air)
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? (That slow last breath of air)
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

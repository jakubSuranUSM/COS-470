I've been around the world I've got a hit in the charts 
I've become quite famous But I ain't got no heart 
I've got expensive clothes and lots of money to waste 
I've got the luxury lifestyle but I ain't got no taste 

Nothing going on nothing going on 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 

I know all the right people, I've got the perfect smile 
I've got the worlds best timing, but I ain't got no style 
I've got a great big mansion, I've got a beautiful wife 
I've got a black Rolls Royce, but I've got no life 

Nothing going on nothing going on 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going right, nothing going wrong 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on nothing going on 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 

I've got a personal trainer, I ride a limousine 
I've got a big bank account, but I ain't got no dreams 
I've got a private plane, the best of everything 
I've got a lifestyle to live, but no message to sing 

Nothing going on nothing going on 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going right, nothing going wrong 
I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on nothing going on 

I've got a whole lot of nothing 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on 
Nothing going on

And now you're walkin'
Just like you're ten feet tall
Go ahead

Lickity split
Better move quick
Better not slip
Better get hip
I don't think it fits
Lookin' for a hoot
I'm gonna shout,
Where'd you get those boots!

Just like Puss 'n' Boots
I hope you don't get shot for tryin'
Oh baby, shot for tryin'

Oh little rhinestone target
Has to change his name
Cause all the boys and girls
Think that you're too easy game
Don't you know the shoes
Is makin' him lame
Shut him up boss
Keep the change

Just like Puss 'n' Boots
I hope you don't get shot for tryin'
Get shot for tryin' Shot for tryin'

There's just one thing
That I'm trying to say
Sometimes you got to get away some place

And now you're walkin'
Just like you're ten feet tall
Oh, Boy girl that's just all

Just like Puss 'n' Boots
I hope you don't get shot for tryin'
Baby shot for tryin'

If all you want to do is save your face
And what you gonna do after this place
I'm screamin' help help help
Full of grace, now what I say

Little rhinestone target
Has to change his name
All the boys and girls
Think he's too easy game
Don't you know the boots
Are makin' him lame
I'm screamin' shut him up boss
Keep the change

Just like Puss 'n' Boots
I hope you don't get shot for tryin'
Baby shot for tryin'

Well this is one thing that I'm tryin' to say
sometimes you got to get away some way
Until you're walkin' just like you're ten foot tall
Boy girl that should be all
Just like you're ten foot tall
I sure hope you don't fall oh,
When you're ten foot tall
Go ahead now

Making that split
Better move quick
Better not slip
Better get hip
I done plead the fifth
Going for a hoot
I thought I'd shout
Hey where did you get those boots

Just like Puss 'n' Boots
I hope you don't get shot!

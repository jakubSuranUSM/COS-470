In this present darkness I fall 
Fall upon broken knees
Crawl through weight, depression 
Haunted by an unborn ghost I'll never know your fears 

Never see me in your eyes 
Curse the one that stole your name from me 
This is the monster that they created 
Scratch to the underside 

The underside of this darkness 
From seconds of your conception 
Minutes leading your death 
Seconds will shackle me 

And turn eyes red I will 
Constantly endure the pain of it's creation 
How can i lie awake 
Grace How can i lie awake 

My love will stay dead 
In this present darkness I fall

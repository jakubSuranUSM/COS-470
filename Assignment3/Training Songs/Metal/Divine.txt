Symbols of forgotten times
Spinning round and around and around in my mind
Change this place inside
While the body sleep

Methods of an ancient ritual
Calling me back
Calling back to the game
Mutations taking place tonight
Through the hunger and need

Get down, take cover
Sitting, crawling, in the moonlight
Reach out, discover
To demolish

Signs made of fire
In the dead of night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die when we are divine

Creatures of a lonely life form
They're always out for flesh, they're out for blood
Extinction makes them walk alone
Through the firestorm

Get down, take cover
Here me howling in the twilight
Reach out, discover
Sign of the times

Signs made of fire
In the dead of night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die when we are divine

Of the lion
On the holy grass the bodies burn
Of perfect desire
The flames will fade and die when we are divine

So many questions have been asked
So many lives been told
So many dreams forsaken
In the name of divinity

Signs made of fire
In the dead of night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die when we are divine

Of the lion
On the holy grass the bodies burn
Of perfect desire
The flames will fade and die when we are divine

Mountain road
Take me back to my honey
I spent my time made my money
Now carting this shit home

But I'll keep your secrets here
Some shack in California
I'm shutting them out but gotta warn ya
Everybody knows

Cuz you've been out all night
Always talking at the wrong time
The barroom and the busted lamplight
Keep you company
And it's there you speak her name
But give in to the lips of strangers
Poor boy you'll never tame her
She knows your talk is cheap

And by the time that you go get her
By the time you that feel better
And by the time you realize the new you is a drag
She'll be rolling in new love
And you'll be rolling in the exile rag

So Shotgun Annie come
Look down your barrel at me
Take your time feel free to have me
Dying or alive
Cuz I couldn't stand to walk
Wild streets of New York freezing
Looking for a love that pleasing
To walk into my life

And by the time that herr door's closing
And you feel like your imposing
On that brand new boyfriend she has
She'll be rolling in new love
And you'll be swinging on the exile rag

The ghosts here ain't so bad
But I swear she talks just like you
Shows her teeth and walks just like you
Through the middle of the night
Knee high boots and bells
She doesn't turn round for me
Holds me close but then ignores me
Underneath the light

And by the time that her train's parting
The her tragedy is restarting
And it's you or the cash in a bag
She'll be rolling in millions
And you'll be singing on the exile rag
She'll be rolling in new love

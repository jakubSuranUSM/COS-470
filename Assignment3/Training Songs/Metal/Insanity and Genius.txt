Therefore I'm laying down in laughter
Mighty, the mightiest life hereafter
The trip we started hasn't finished here
And while we think there's not a shade of fear

Black points jump in crossing lines
Insanity and genius
Both two sides are what I find
And I know they're mine

Sometimes my womb bears an actor
Your mind - creating tragic factors
You've got knowledge - stolen from the sea
You've got wisdom - just stolen knowledge

Black points jump in crossing lines
Insanity's not far behind the genius inside

Close before - insanity and genius [repeat]

[Solo Dirk]

And everyday a dreamer dies
To see what's on the other side
And everyday more dreamers die, my friend
While black points jump in crossing lines again

Companions in approaching time insanity and genius
Good old friends in common life insanity and genius

Close before - insanity and genius [repeat]

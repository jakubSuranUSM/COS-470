I told you the Bastards will pay
Maybe not yet, but they'll see the day
I told you, God tempth no man
And you know we've got to do what we can
I can tell me of you still can't see
When are we going to stop this misery

I asked the assassin, if he has the right
I hope someday, maybe he'll m the light
I asked you all, right from the start
Choose the way chat comes from the heart
I can tell some of you still can't see
When are we going to stop this misery

In these troubled times, you ask me
How can we be saved
Tell all the people, every one you meet
The answer is love

I told you 'bout the wickedness of man
To try and save him. I hope we can
I told you 'bout my, dream of love
And life that only comes from above
I can tell some of you still can't see
When are you gong to stop this misery

In these troubled times, you ask me
How an we be saved
Tell all the people, everyone you me
The answer is love

When shadows fall in the twilight zone
The spirits will arise
The lord of darkness, descends my soul
With slander, tainted lies

Walking on water, visions fading to black
As the flames start to clobber my back
In this fiery blaze I am feeling no pain
I will arise and walk the earth again

Running through the red light
Running for your life
Alone in the dark night
Running through the red light
Running for your life

The lion roar in the darkest hour
Redeem his tortured soul
You had your eyes on eternity
Now death will take its toll

You dangle in agony, you fight for your breath
As the spectre is wrenching your neck
When the whole world awakens from its sombre sleep
You will be gone and your soul's mine to keep

Running through the red light
Running for your life
The 'cause of your magic

Running through the red light
Running for your life
Through the red light

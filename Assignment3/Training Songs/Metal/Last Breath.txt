So do I really believe?
Caught up and twisted
She's hardly completed
Now I'm out of time
And full of hate
(If nothing will change you)
Then nothing will ever change

Cause all that I need
From you now
You can't see

Take my last breath
To say this
This broken world
Left me hopeless
Every time I pray
But Nothing would change
I'll take my last breath now
I hope I find my way

What else in this world
Could happen to me?
Always convicted
You're simply defeated
It kills me that I've never found
That saving grace
That gave you the shelter
You needed for one more day

Cause all that I need
From you now
You can't see

Take my last breath
To say this
This broken world
Left me hopeless
Every time I pray
But Nothing would change
I'll take my last breath now
I hope I find my way

Call it madness
Call it tragic
Have you heard enough?

Take my last breath, take my last breath
Take my last breath, take my last breath

Take my last breath
To say this
This broken world
Left me hopeless
Every time I pray
But Nothing would change
I'll take my last breath now
I hope I find my way

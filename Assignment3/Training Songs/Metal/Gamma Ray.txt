The world's desperated with irony,hunger and corruption
The eastern and the africans too
Are going to repeat the history of all wars
And our industry supplied them with arms
Everybody knows but nobody can do anything against it
The fall of society is on the make

Well sometimes, sometimes I try to drop a list
I try to find out what they have done
I thought of honourable murderers you know
Like Jonah's hand might /???/ around us

And anytime, everywhere in the whole world
Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma Ray
Made of your existence Gamma Ray money and our failing
I've waited for - to find Gamma Ray

Without a body I could fly around the world
Destroying arms, destroying rockets
Mix all complexions of the whole human race
We all would turn to shadow people

Everybody, everywhere in the whole world
Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray...

[Solo Kai]

Everybody, everywhere in the whole world
Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray...

On a cold dark winter night
Hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right
For what will become

In the valley of the damned
A warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land
For freedom he rise

And the sign from the master on high
He screams a loud and across hear the cry
For the kingdom of fire and ice
And the power to be alive

Four strong ride on carry on through the war
Four strong carry on living for ever more

On the wings of death
By the hands of doom
By the darkest light
From the darkest moon

Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
All will stand as one tonight

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide
When the master will call us
He stands high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

In the valley of the damned
Days breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns

On the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
Join together one and all
Before the glorious light

Rise up gather around come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget

On the wings of life
By the hands of hope
By the brightest light
From the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
To the valley of the damned

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide
When the master will call us
He stands high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom my guide
When the master will call us
He stands high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

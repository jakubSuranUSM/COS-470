Here we go just another night with your sultry eyes
The ones that hypnotize
Yeah, you know it's getting hard to fight
You got me in your sight
I'm gonna fall tonight
You got me running every time you call my name
I see it comin', something I can't explain
I feel it's starting again

Such a sweet obsession, can't get enough
I feel the magic every time that we touch
A sweet obsession comes over me
Take me to the fire, girl
Set my heart free, set my heart free

Something's wrong baby, deep inside
Is it you or me?
I just can't decide
Is it love or is it just a game?
You got control of me
I can't break the chains
I'm just a prisoner of a heartbeat, loosing it's way
You got me captured, and there's nothing I can do
Nothing I can do to escape

Such a sweet obsession, can't get enough
I feel the magic every time that we touch
A sweet obsession comes over me
Take me to the fire, girl
Set my heart free, set my heart free

I'm just a prisoner of a heartbeat, loosing it's way
You got me captured and there's nothing I can do
Nothing I can do to escape

Such a sweet obsession, can't get enough
I feel the magic every time that we touch
A sweet obsession comes over me
Take me to the fire, girl
Set my heart free
Can't get enough, I feel the magic every time
Sweet obsession over me
Take me to the fire, set my heart free

Wake me up in the morning glory
Hanging straight your lies and stories
How do you mark your territory?

When your trash becomes your treasure
Your remorse is all my pleasure
Lose your mind at your leisure

Simply said your complicated
Understand you're overrated
The more you talk the less you seem to say

We are miserable
You are driving me insane

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

Chew me up like a meat grinder
You're cold-blooded like a sidewinder
I don't need another reminder

Can't understand normal thinking
Drive a sober man to drinking
In fact you drive me straight to Hell

We are miserable
You are driving me insane

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be yours sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

The more you inhale
The more that you breath
The more that you make me want to scream

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your reason not to get along
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song

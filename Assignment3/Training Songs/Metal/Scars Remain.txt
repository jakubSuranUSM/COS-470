What is all this
The question I am asking
It's not what is 
I feel like I was promised
This hurts, this leaves
A lasting laceration
I can't believe
That this is what my faith was for
The scars remain
Remains of pain
The scars remain

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling
You are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars

My feet will sink
In this quicksand around me
Unless something
Or someone comes to save me
This hurts, this leaves
A lasting laceration
I can't believe
That this is what my faith was for
The scars remain
Remains of pain
The scars remain

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling
You are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars that are matching

When I see you I see scars that are matching
When I see you I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling
You are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you I see scars that are matching

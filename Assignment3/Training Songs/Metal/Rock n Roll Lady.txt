She's a rock 'n' roll lady,   Bells upon her toes,   She's got rings on her fingers,   She can have music,   Wherever she goes,   Wherever she goes,   Wherever she goes.     She's a rock 'n' roll lady,   Bells upon her toes,   She's got rings on her fingers,   She can have music,   Wherever she goes,   Wherever she goes,   Wherever she goes.

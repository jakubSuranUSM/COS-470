I harbor thoughts of killing you pour petrol on you and then on me 
But then I walk down the stairs and killing joke waits for me there then we play - 
Go psycho

With sticks and stones and bones beneath our homes 
We face ourselves hosannas rising from the basements of hell

Anger that poisons my heart eating your liver and heart like voodoo 
Just play until you bleed lost in the noise I am free I'm not a murderer yet

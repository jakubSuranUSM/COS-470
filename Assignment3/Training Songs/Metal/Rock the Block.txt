Well, the sky is gray, streets are cold
And it's rainin' in my head
Stayin' at home is drivin' me nuts
Gotta boogie through the life out there

Can't let bad weather mess up
Great plans for a wild weekend
Gotta meet my friends at the rock cafe
On the corner of the city gate

There's a place open all night
Music is loud and the girls make eyes

We'll rock the block, we'll rock the block
We'll rock the block, we'll rock the block
We'll rock the block, block, block, block, one, two, three
We'll rock the block, we'll rock the block
'Cause we can't let the rain screw up all this fun
We'll rock the block, yeah, yeah, take it away, oh yeah, ooh

'Cause we can't let the rain screw up all this fun
We'll rock the block, oh yeah
We'll rock the block, we'll rock the block
We'll rock the block, the neighborhood, oh yeah

We're gonna shake it, we're gonna make it
Gonna shake it and gonna rock it, shake the neighborhood
We'll rock the block, we'll rock the block
We'll rock the block, we're gonna rock, rock, rock

Just for you
you
you
. . .

Ev'ry little thing I do
you know I do it just for you.
I got no money no place to live
but all I got you know I'd give
I was thinking of you when I wrote this song
Now that I have found you

Please stay here where you belong.

Just for you
just for you
just for you
just for you.
I had to keep it
had to save it
had to give it to you.
Just for you
just for you
just for you
just for you

You
you
just for you
you
you
just for you.

When you're lonely
when you're sad
think of all the fun we
I knowthat I ain't made ityet
when I do all I've gotyou'll get
I am dreaming of you while I play this song
Now that I have found you

Please stay here where you belong.

Just for you
just for you
. . .

Show me your banner
Come show me your sign
The Crimson King's eye
Is the mark to reveal you are mine
I am your master
I will make your dreams come true
I'm your messiah
A twisted one as you may know

My right hands, my servants
My soldiers, my tools
Spread out the good news
Find my children and gather them all
We'll take all low men
All the hatred, evil souls
We share one desire
A wicked one as you may know

Touched by the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour
The tower falls on Judgement Day
Touched By the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour
Like it's been written many years ago

I am the angel I am madness
I am the word I am the law
I am holding truth release your sadness
I am the key I am the door
Release!
Oh there is
War and evil
Whores and sinners
Take my hand and I show you
Where to go
Call me Flagg
I'm the Good Man
I'm the Dark Man
Take my hand and
I show you where to go
Release!
Come take my hand
To the promised land

Redeemer
Deceiver
The demon
The man in black

The universe is void
Just you and I
Let there be light
The stars will rise
Then fall again
Climbing to the top
An empty room
Is all there is
Oh I fear it is
Prophecies were made of you and I
The vision's strong
But meanwhile keep on falling
Oh what a miracle is life
An even bigger one is size
It's just the way it is
I fear it is
It's just the way it is

Life's a wheel nothing more
It goes round and around and a…
I am the ageless
I am “Legion”
I'm your lord
I will bring terror
I'm a demon in disguise
The thrill of a thousand
Worlds dying at once
But my ultimate goal
Lies beyond the downfall

Touched by the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour
The tower falls on Judgement Day
Touched By the Crimson King
Touched By the Saviour

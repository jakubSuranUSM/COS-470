She's got a fire burnin' in her eyes, make ya feel like a new born child 
She can turn a cold lonely night into a rollercoaster ride 
And she's givin' it all, givin' it all away 

Chorus: 
Everybody loves Eileen, she's a sweet little rock 'n roll machine 
Just the sweetest thing you've ever seen, everybody loves Eileen 

 
 

She can tell a joke and make you cry, take your heart a thousand miles high 
Sing a lovers lullaby like an angel of the night 
She's so close and she's so far away 

chorus 

I want her love, she drives me crazy 
I need her love, I want her for my lady 

(Solo)

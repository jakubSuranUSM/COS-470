Raising like the Mary from below the sea
She's got easy livin'
Dancin' in the evening till a quarter to three
She's got easy livin'
She's never had a worry
She's never in a hurry
Slithers like a snake with the greatest of ease, well
Ooh, ooh here she comes again
And you know, you know what that spells
You've got trouble with a capital "T"
I wish you luck but she's gonna be full of history

Jumping up and down like a flying trapeze
She's got easy livin'
Bowing to her king like a fairy queen
She's got easy livin'
She's never had a worry
She's never in a hurry
Slithers like a snake with the greatest of ease, well
Ooh, ooh here she comes again
And you know, you know what that spells
You can go but you never can tell
I wish old Bill come and put me in jail tonight

Reachin' for the top
Just like the tour Eiffel
She's got easy livin'
Don't know much about it but she'll need her trapeze
She's got easy livin'
She's never had a worry
She's never in a hurry
Slithers like a snake with the greatest of ease, well
Ooh, ooh here she comes again
And you know, you know what that spells
You've got trouble with a capital "T"
I wish you luck but she's gonna be full of history
Well, you can go but you never can tell
I wish old Bill come and put me in jail tonight

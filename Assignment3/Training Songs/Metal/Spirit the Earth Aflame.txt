Beneath the Bronze sky
A Horizon in Flame
The Oceans Boil
The Earth heaves
And seethes
There is a new Sun rising
That has not Risen for
Thousands of years

Prophets have Written
Songs have been Sung
We have Awoken
A New Age has begun
Spirit The Earth Aflame

"And so it starts
The beginning of a new turn in the cycle"

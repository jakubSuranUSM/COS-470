After the battle, in the dark
Side of the desert fields.
Am I the winner?  Fight is over,
And we'll take the place.
Metal burned; feel the discord.
For a complete destruction.
Have no mercy; come with us.
You're in the meeting
To the death!
Tonight we celebrate.
Holy shit, no remorse
For the prisoner.
Nice ceremony tonight.
We have a crazy time,
To the death!
Tonight we celebrate
War and our victory;
All possessed by the death;
To take the force by the blood.
Raise your hands for the final slaughter.
High pressure marching like
A robot form nowhere.
Mutilated; we're out to
Conquer all the planet.
Creeping weapons, see the
Fire blows the sky.
Invasion; don't stop the
Pressure of pain.
Electric power was bursting
In the air.
Strange fever; it seems like
Your last night.
Total disorder brings
The final impact.
Come and see what hell looks like.
Many men feel the pain endlessly.
Forever your country needs you.
The world's still waiting to change.
Everybody said the thing's
Doing so bad.
To the death!
Is what you say.
To the death!
Who cares?  It's the only way.
To the death!
Is what you need.
To the death!
Turn to black till they bleed.

Analyze this chemistry
Producing poison
And creeping in your veins
For the love of blood

The poison slowly spreads
Through the body and the mind
Close your eyes and drop your things
Be ready to fly

You are now, high
In the sun, burn
You're away, alive
On the moon, round

After walking all the miles
Consumed into your bones
And breathing all the dust
Of the desert land

I know that all along
You were doing it for absolution
It's written in your eyes

You are now, high
In the sun, burn
You're away, alive
On the moon, round

Away
Just want to fly away, always higher
Away
Embrace the light on the other side

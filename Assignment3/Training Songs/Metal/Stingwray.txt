Bull dozer crush
Cover the rush
Catatonic nonsense
Hammering down
Balance you found
Forever we're fucking
I love this machine
Elevate rising higher
It never stops
Still growing hot
Shadow of myself say

Rhythm
My way
Stingwray
Forcing
Moving
Motion
Sideways
Take me home

Pull over push
Forcing the rush
Keep on moving faster
Wearing me down
Breaking the sound
Finely tune the caster
Burning gasoline
Spark will set it on fire
Reaching the top
Still growing hot
Shadow of myself say

Rhythm (breaking)
My way (crushing)
Stingwray (rising)
Forcing
Moving (breaking)
Motion (crushing)
Sideways (rising)
Take me

It never stops
Still growing hot
Moving
It never stops
Bring me back to life
Stingwray
It never stops
Like it a lot
Moving
It never stops
Still growing
Rising higher

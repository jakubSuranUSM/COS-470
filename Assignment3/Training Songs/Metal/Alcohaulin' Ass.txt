Come on, a little bit of sunshine
A little bit of booze
A little bit of me
And a little bit of you

A little bit country
A little bit of blues

A little slice of heaven
And a little piece of you, come on

Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin' ass

A little bit thirsty
A little bit used
A little bit of whiskey
And a little pinch to chew

A little bit tired
And a bad attitude
A little bit of drinkin'
And another piece of you

Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin'

You drove me to it, so there was nothing I could do
You pushed me down, split me right in two
Now I found the long hard road carried the weight of you
Boy, oh, boy, God damn, there's only one thing left to do

A little bit of alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass, there's only one thing left to do

A little bit of alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin' ass

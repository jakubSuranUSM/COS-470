Gotta bar lean, I'm looking mean
I need a drink, I've gotta drink to think
You say I'm drunk but that's me in the mirror
Looking for a fight who says "..."

Come and hit me, falling to the ground
Knee me in the groin, won't make a sound
Head over heels for a fight with you
I'm gonna teach you a trick or two

[CHORUS:]
You know in my life, I've been a fighting man
Hard times hit me, now I'm going down
You know in my life, I've been a fighting man
Hard times hit me, now I'm going
Now I'm going down

Back to the wall and out for the count
Rock and reel, do you know how I feel?
Swim in swinging I'm blind as an eel
Don't you puck cause I'm coming back

You come and hit me, falling to the ground
Knee me in the groin, won't make a sound
Head over heels for a fight with you
I'm gonna teach you a trick or two

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO]

You know in my life, I've been a fighting man
Hard times hit me, now I'm going down
You know in my life, I've been a fighting man
Hard times hit me, now I'm going down

[REPEAT CHORUS]

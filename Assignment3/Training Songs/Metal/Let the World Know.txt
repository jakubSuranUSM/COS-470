Trust the words I say
I'm willing to go the distance 
But I'm a little bit fragile
I'm just saying let's take this slow 
Don't get me wrong
Let 'em know

Write it in magazines, in the papers
Put it all over the news, let 'em hear it
I wanna let the world know 
How I feel, how I feel, how I feel
'Cause I'm living my dreams to the fullest
Forever you and me
Nothing can intervene
I wanna let the world know 
How I feel, how I feel, how I feel

Been waiting for this moment
But there's no need to rush it
One step at a time
We must be careful not to loose it

If I'm defined completely by my actions
I'll prove myself but I ask a little patience 
'Cause I am not a perfect human being 
But I know one thing,
I'm right about this feeling

Today, today
I wanna let the world know 
Today, today
Today, today
I wanna let the world know 
Today, today
I wanna let the world know how I feel, yeah

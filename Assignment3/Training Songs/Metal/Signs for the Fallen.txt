Blessed by the blind
For their conscience won't collide
With cruelty of sanity
And the prophetic signs
In the book of life

For the threat of fortune
Is to lose it all

In the arms of Morpheus
Close your eyes - never awake
Stand in line for your chance
Do you see the signs for the fallen
It's a human bane
The highest tribute to advance

For the threat of fortune
Is to lose it all

A cannon thunder
Cracks in the air
Widows weep for
The fallen ones
War and plunder
Becomes the legal force
Of a new age
To set a sign for freedom

War and failed words
Entwine in inhumanity
No blood stains my hand
But the land is covered
With broken trust
And impaled enemies

No hordes from hell
But lurking madness
The army of the damned
Under the sign of kindness

Here is your golden age
With high aims and twisted words
Forming a new dimension
Beyond right and wrong

Blessed be the blind
For their conscience won't collide

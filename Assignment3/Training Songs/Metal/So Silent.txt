My thoughts traveling 
The endless passage of curiosity
Within hours I weaken
He stares straight through me
Hungering for the last of the glow in me
Dilution of my will stealing all the odds
So silent, will my mind give up
Control is no longer up to me
Weakened I await for the final touch
Of death to strike for me
So silent, So silent.
The candle on the table unmasks his presence
By a shadow and I feel the emptiness that
Radiates from him
So silent, will my mind give up
Control is no longer up to me
Weakened I await for the final touch
Of death to strike for me
So silent, So silent.
Absurd dreams reaching for a truth
Lost in the fantasy
Beyond the walls of immortal life
Becomes reality
So silent.

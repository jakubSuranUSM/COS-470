I feel so rejected 
Come dance for me 
I need alternative living 
To feel objectively 

Sometimes 
I feel so low 

Wholesale on heartaches 
'Cross a warehouse floor 
Outside a heart beats faster 
Inside it needs far more 

Sometimes 
I feel so low 

So close to heaven 
Come reach for me 
I feel the pressure rising 
We're descending constantly 

Sometimes 
I feel so low

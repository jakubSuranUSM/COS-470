You, You aren't really here with me 
You never were
Sweep the dust from our eyes once again
Watch the sunset of our hearts for one last time
At sunrise I'll be gone

Another pistol loaded
This time its mine

[Chorus]
Breathe
Just for one more day and You'll come back to me
You're so cold
I, I still wonder whether you'll come back to be
Just hold on

Sleep, Sleep now love the sun extinguishes itself
I will never look back, look for something else
Deliver me with you're sweet song and take me home
Take me home again

Another pistol loaded
This time its mine
My heart just bleeds devotion
Give me a sign

[Chorus]

Breathe and you'll come back to me
I wish you'd come back to me

[Chorus]

Father can you hear me, did you talk to mother earth
What did they say, what did they see, now ... is time for your rebirth ?

Open up the silent center of your mind,
I know want to know the future of your kind

In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods return to fight, for the future in their lives
In the valley of the kings

Oh mother do you hear me, did you talk to father moon
I don't want to leave my brothers in this temple of their doom

Open up the silent center of your mind,
I now want to know the future of your kind

In the valley of the kings, when the storms break loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings, in the valley of the kings

Ra vvite, deus sanktus, ra vite
Ra vite, revertate, ra vite

[ Solos: Kai / Both / Kai / Henjo ]

Oh mother earth do you believe there is a place for us to go
Come set us free again and let us fly away and give us hope

There'll be a time for us to fly to our thrones up in the sky

In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings, in the valley of the kings

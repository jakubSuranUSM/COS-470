Out of the cold you've been given birth
Made out of steel to protect and serve
Built for eternity you're indestructable
Free of emotions a robot miracle
Now you're up there above the clouds
Reading your sensors trace
Programmed to correct the errors
Of the human race
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
We can't hide from your cold, staring eye
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky
Deadly and dangerous you'll never die
You gave us hope the Savior machine
You were supposed to be a millions dream
Circuits, chips and bits and bytes
Detecting the failure
Result of analyses
The human behavior
(I must get control)
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky...
The Savior knows what's wrong or right
He made up his artificial mind
Now mankind's fate is in his hand
Will he ever understand
Iron Iron Savior - Godness in the sky...
Iron Iron Savior - look what you have done
Can't you see your assesement might be wrong
Iron Iron Savior - robot of the law
End this illfated devastating war

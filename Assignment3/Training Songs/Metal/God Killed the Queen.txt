If you want to take my body tonight 
Then you gotta be somebody tonight 
Use me just to make your body feel right 
If you want to take my body tonight 
Well god killed the queen (my body tonight) 
Well god killed the queen (My body tonight) 
Load it 
Well I think I'm seeing double 
I think I'm seeing double
I think I'm seeing double 
God takes time on it 
He never made a dime on it 
If you want to take my body tonight 
Then you gotta be somebody tonight 
Use me just to make your body feel right 
Well god killed the queen 
Well I don't know what I'm doing here 
So shake some, load it 
I think I'm seeing double 
God takes time on it 
He never made a dime on it 
Use me just to make your body feel right 
Well god killed the queen

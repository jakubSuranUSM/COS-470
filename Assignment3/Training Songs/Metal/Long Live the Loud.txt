I burn down the highway
My music is loud
Gone past all barriers of sound
Lay down metal law
Let's show them who's the boss
Long live the louder than hell

Long live the loud, long live the loud
Long live the loud, we are loud and proud

Into the red zone we rage every night
We vow to destroy all in sight
The louder the better the heavier the metal
Loud will prevail in this fight

Long live the loud, long live the loud
Long live the loud, we are loud and proud

No time for losers adrenalin is high
Our thunderous roar cracks the sky
Keeping ahead walking the dead
Atop of your wreckage we stand

Long live the loud, long live the loud
Long live the loud, we are loud and proud

Long live, long live, long live
Long live the loud
Long live the loud

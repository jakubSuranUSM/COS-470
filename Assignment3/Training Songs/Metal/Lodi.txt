Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, I'm lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse, I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
I boarded on the Greyhound, and I'm walkin' there, by the road
I was just passin' through, it must be seven months or more
I ran out of time and money, it looks like the two were friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
[Solo]
Man from a magazine, who said I was on my way
But somewhere I lost connection, I ran out of songs to play
I planned many times of one-night stands, it looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
If I had a million dollars for every song I've sung
Or every time I had to play while people slapped their tongue
I know I'll catch the next train, back to where I live
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
There we go, get ready!

Never saw you crying, 
Never saw the tears,
Never thought you'd cry for me, 
I thought you had all you wanted, 
I thought you had all you needed, 
In the darkness I can see.

In the night I hear you calling
(I hear you calling)
In the night I hear you scream
(Screaming out my name)
I know your heart is breakng, 
Days when you awaken, 
Leave your heaven in your dreams yeah!

We'll hear the angels singing tonight,
We'll be in heaven na na na,
In my dreams angels sing tonight, 
We'll be in heaven na na na
Heaven na na na oohhhh.

Look into the future, 
I hear them say, 
I can't face another lonely day, 
Sunshine slipped away, 
I can't let go,
I can't face the nightmare all alone

In the night I hear you calling
(I hear you calling)
In the night I hear you scream
(Screaming out my name)
I know your heart is breakng, 
Days when you awaken, 
Leave your heaven in your dreams yeah!

We'll hear the angels singing tonight,
We'll be in heaven na na na,
In my dreams angels sing tonight, 
We'll be in heaven na na na
Heaven na na na oohhhh.

We'll hear the angels singing tonight,
We'll be in heaven na na na,
In my dreams angels sing tonight, 
We'll be in heaven na na na
Heaven na na na oohhhh.

Oh baby baby baby ohhhh

We'll hear the angels singing tonight,
We'll be in heaven na na na,
In my dreams angels sing tonight, 
We'll be in heaven na na na
Heaven na na na oohhhh.

Never saw you crying, 
Never saw the tears,
But in the darkness I can see.

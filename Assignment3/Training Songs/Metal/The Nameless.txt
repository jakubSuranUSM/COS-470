Pathetic benign accept it undermine
Your opinion my justification
Happy safe servant caged
Malice utter weakness
No toleration, invade
Committed enraged admit it
Don't condescend don't even disagree
Destroy decay disappoint delay
You've suffered then now suffer unto me

Obsession, take another look
Remember, every chance you took
Decide, either live with me
Or give up, any thought you had of being free

(don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hate

Anyone no anything yes anyway fall anybody mine
Anybody tell me
I want you I need you I'll have you I won't
Let anybody have you
Obey me believe me just trust me worship me
Live for me
Be grateful now be honest now be precious now
Be mine just love me

Possession, feed my only vice
Confession, I won't tell you twice
Decide, either die for me
Or give up, any chance you had of being free

(don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hurting you
(don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hate

Stay inside the hole, let me take control
Dominate
You are nothing more, you are something less
Innocent
Something has to give, something has to break
Omnipresent
Fingers in your skin, let me savage in
You deserve it

(don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you
(don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate

You're mine (I know who you are)

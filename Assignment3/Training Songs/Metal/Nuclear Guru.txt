Father figure of invention
Universal soul within the planet's core
Read your tarot cards, Shangoma
Bring the Voodoo Child's creation to the fore

Supersonic information
Spiritual computer in your brainwashed mind
Send your evil ways throughout us
Cast your magic spell to end all of mankind

I know, oh I said I know

Operation radiation, interplanetary commotion
Blackest magical illusion, futuristic lord of this world

It's in effect from when you throw your magic bones
Littered galaxy with nuclo-phonic clones
Blind religious cult will always fail to see
Time creator and destroyer now supreme
Alright let's go

Now the world is your possession
Can you walk me through the orbital remains
Planets drifting, slowly melting
Radiation burns the lunar sonic plains

Astro-palace, fourth dimension
Neutrons gathered in a cosmagnetic shell
He's Satan's scientific offspring
Nuclear Guru of interplanetary hell

I know, oh I said I know

Mama said she's come to take us home
Leave this broken planet all alone
Find a world where love is here to stay
Peace and happiness in every day, it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay.

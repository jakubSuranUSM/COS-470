In the eyes of the world
youÂ´re a rock & roll widow
But where is the girl
that I used to know
Your friends try to blame me
but you know that itÂ´s crazy
Tell the truth - I canÂ´t take anymore
Tell the truth - I just canÂ´t take no more
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
I gave you my world
and you gave me nothing
But itÂ´s never enough
thereÂ´s always one more thing
CanÂ´t stop what I do
itÂ´s the only thing that gets me through
Tell the truth - I canÂ´t take anymore
Tell the truth - I just canÂ´t take no more
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth

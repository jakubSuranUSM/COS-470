Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still

The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then you hate
Those people stole your will

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt

Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
No nothing

Do you call my name?
Do you stain my brain?
My eyes are blurry
And I can't see you anymore

Do you call my name?
Do you breed my pain?
My heart is bloody
And I can't take it anymore

So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself more pain
To face insanity

But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see, your fear's your cage
You beg for help but you're alone
Stuck in a helpless rage

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt

Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

(It's me)
 
(I see)

(Please)

(Let me out I'm petrified)

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt

Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
C'mon

Do you call my name?
Do you stain my brain?
My eyes are blurry
And I can't see you anymore

Do you call my name?
Do you breath my pain?
My heart is bloody
And I can't take it anymore

Do you call my name?
Do you stain my brain?
My eyes are blurry
And I can't see you anymore

Do you call my name?
Do you breath my pain?
My heart is bloody
And I can't take it anymore

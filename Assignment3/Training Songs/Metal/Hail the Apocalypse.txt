There's a storm heading our way
All that's been will be gone
All your cities will sink into the ocean
You run away like cattle
But you cannot flee the battle
Wipe your ass, it's time to put on your war paint

Throw the spear
Let your hatred fly
Throw the spear
Let your hatred fly
The desert is my prophet
As our lives end by the minute
Stand up straight and fucking put on your war paint

Time to die
Hammer high
Name your price
And kneel

Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive us, we never shall learn
Get down
Hail the apocalypse

Once you built
Now you run away
The world is coming down
Leave your mark upon the graves of your stillborn
Just wrap it up in plastic
Isn't killing things fantastic?
F*ck your greed
Come on and put on your war paint

Die
Hammer high
Name your price
And kneel

Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive us, we never shall learn
Get down
Hail the apocalypse

All the lords I've sworn to obey
All the lords I've sworn to obey
I take it back

All the lords I've sworn to obey
All the lords I've sworn to obey
I take it back

Hail the apocalypse
All flesh is equal when burnt
We are forgiven
Forgive, as we never shall learn
Get down
Hail the apocalypse

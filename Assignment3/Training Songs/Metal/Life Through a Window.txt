This fear, it shouldn't appear in my veins
Yet it remains my ally in self-decay
I'm dug in deep here, four walls will keep us secure
Year after year (year after year)
Afraid of the world we all pose like children
Suspicion won't kill them 

Let's lay our heads atop of the bed, 'cause I'm sick of the way we're livin’
I can't believe that we still deceive this looking glass as vision
There is always a safe haven at home
Best case scenario, we'll still be miserable 

Bury me below
My mind's a ticking time bomb so I'll bury it below
My eyes are tired of glaring through lifeless windows
Your future's at risk unless you open the door
Disclose the contents of your heart on the floor 

I can never regret you
I would never forget this floor
I can never forget all the times we've spent indoors 

At least we were safe in there
Away from the worries and the cares
At least we were safe in there
Diverse from the rest of the earth
At the seams we tear
The reason I've been living a lie
Is I would rather stare at life outside a window than die 

So tear away from the dotted line where you slept so close to me
I will one day leave this place (this place) 

(Afraid) Afraid of the world we all pose like children
Suspicion won't kill them 

Let's lay our heads atop of the bed, 'cause I'm sick of the way we're livin’
I can't believe that we still deceive this looking glass as vision
There is always a safe haven at home
Best case scenario, we'll still be miserable 

Bury me below
My mind's a ticking time bomb so I'll bury it below
My eyes are tired of glaring through lifeless windows
Your future's at risk unless you open the door
Disclose the contents of your heart on the floor
The reason I've been living a lie
Is I would rather stare at life outside a window than die

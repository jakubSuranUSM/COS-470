All I see is sand in my eye
All I hear are prayers
All I think is believe me or die
All I do is prepare

My god is the only one
My way supreme
If you don't believe in me
I will hear you scream
My god is the only one
My way supreme

All I see is sand in my eye
All I hear are prayers
All I think is believe me or die
All I do is prepare

No one tells me I'm in the wrong
No one feels my pain
No one else will walk on my ground and
No one will live to say

My god is the only one
My way is the way
If you don't want to side with me
Your soul will turn to clay
My god is the only one
My way supreme

No one understands your ways
No one will sympathize
We all think you wrap your religion
To keep what's left inside

No one is on your side, no
No one else wants to die
I don't want to say you're out of your head
But I can see right through your mind

No one understands your ways and
No one will sympathize
We all think you wrap your religion
To keep what's left inside

No one is on your side, no
Nobody else wants to die
I don't want to say you're out of your head
But I can see right through your mind

My god is the only one
My way supreme
If you don't believe in me
I will hear you scream

No one understands your ways
No one will sympathize
We all think you wrap your religion
To keep what's left inside

No one is on your side, no
Nobody else wants to die
I don't want to say you're out of your head
But I can see right through your mind

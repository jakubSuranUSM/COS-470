The end of your time has come
A journey into your own self
I'll show you what good and evil rule
Hate is a form of love
Life is an unknown journey into subconsciousness

Of your soul where dreams became reality
Follow me into the light of the forgotten
Death is an entrance to another life
Neither time nor space can stop this circle

Emotion and feelings
The unreality of fear of the unknown
Transmigration - Transmigration
Transmigration

I am the door ahead of the long journey
I am the journey into the bright light
I am the light of your redemption
I am the redemption from nothingness
I am the nothingness before the end
The end of your time has come

The end of your time has come
A journey into your own self
I'll show you what good and evil rule
Hate is a form of love
Life is an unknown journey into subconsciousness
Into subconsciousness

Of your soul where dreams became reality
Follow me into the light of the forgotten
Death is an entrance to another life
Neither time nor space can stop this circle

Emotion and feelings
The unreality of fear of the unknown
Transmigration - Transmigration
Transmigration

The end of your time has come
A journey into your own self
I'll show you what good and evil rule
Hate is a form of love
Life is an unknown journey into subconsciousness

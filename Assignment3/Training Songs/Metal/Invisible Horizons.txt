Flying high, setting signs 
We got the future in our veins 
But still a long way to go 

All we know has lost its size 
If you're looking down from space. 
Your problems are unreal at one blow 

Does it make a sense at last 
To learn the mistakes of the past? 
Infected with an old disease 

And today tomorrow waits 
In another galaxy. 
Waiting to take us away 

We are the only truth? 
How can we be so smug 
Like a child playing God... 
I wish I knew 
Is it still far to go... Invisible horizons 
What is behind 
The picture in my mind... Invisible horizons 

It is many ages away 
A life that's far beyond our rays 
That we send out to get a sign 

A million places there to be 
It's only logical, you see 
That we're not the center of creation 

We are the only truth? 
How can we be so smug 
Like a child playing God... 
I wish I knew 
Is it still far to go... Invisible horizons 
What is behind 
The picture in my mind... Invisible horizons

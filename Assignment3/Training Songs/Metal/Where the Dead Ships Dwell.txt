The picture slowly fades,
The walls are closing in,
And there I was, cursing the ground,
Unable to understand

I won't let the world break me
So I need to change direction
Nothing special I'm far from perfect
Light the way for me

Feel I was running an endless mile,
Last time it burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a piece of mind

Walking where the dead ships dwell
These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller
And I have to leave

Feel I was running an endless mile,
Last time it burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a piece of mind

All I hear is noise
Heart so false
So guess, I took it for granted
I know I went too far
I won't say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

Feel I was running an endless mile,
Last time it burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a piece of mind

Feel I was running an endless mile,
Last time it burns
And I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a piece of mind

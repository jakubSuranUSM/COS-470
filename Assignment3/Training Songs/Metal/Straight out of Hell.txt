Straight out of hell I waste my life not for tomorrow
Straight out of hell I‘m only livin‘ for today
I roll the dice I know that something strange is coming
I‘m cold as ice I always take it as it comes

Ain‘t no eternity, ain‘t no salvation
In this damnation we will burn

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell

I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
I‘m straight out of hell

No ace to play I live my life with no protection
The price I pay my act of grace will be denied
This road to hell and I won‘t find no resurrection
Cause I will sell my dirty soul to rock n‘ roll

Ain‘t no eternity, ain‘t no salvation
In this damnation we will burn

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell

So sad and lonely I go down
No helping hand no soul around
I lost my faith so long ago
A million tears are gonna flow

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
There‘s no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
I‘m gonna lose it but it feels so well
I’m straight out of hell

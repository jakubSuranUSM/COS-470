There is a sound from the kitchen
And it's a sound he's heard a thousand times before
When he hears his mother crying
He runs away and hides inside his room

But there is no escaping
The anger in his fathers voice
And when the tears are falling
He falls down to his knees and prays

Just hold me and love me
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

His little arms are black and blue
And there's a little cut right under his eye
Every night he lies awake
And from downstairs the fighting starts again

Have you forgot the reason
Why this little child was born?
Cause if you go on fighting
You'll destroy this family

Just hold him and love him
Touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

Stop fighting, stop hurting
Try to love again
And do your best to save this
Broken home

If you ever hold him tight
Let him feel your love again
You will make him smile again

Hold him, love him
And touch this child of love
And try your best to save this
Broken home

Stop fighting, stop hurting
Try to love again
And do your best to save this
Broken home

So hold him, you love him
Touch this child of love
And do your best

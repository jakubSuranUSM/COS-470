Left hand vested in the symbol of Mars
Right hand vasted in the symbol of Sun
Standing Proud
We raise foreheads adorned with the symbol of Jupiter

The end of Nazarene has come...
We evoke dominion
We bring this world to its knees

Dominating, masterful, self-assured
Invoking our wishes
Whirling in chaos
With yellow, red and blue
We as chaos...

We evoke dominion
We as chaos assume control
We as chaos, we rule our lives
We bring this world to its knees

Lovely, la la la la la la lovely!

Screwed up people everywhere, but I ain't got time to care
I feel lovely, lovely, 
Ha! La la lovely, oh-oh, 

All kinds of souls down to the curb, but me help? Don't be absurd
I feel lovely, lovely, 
La la la lovely, oh-oh,

Cause it's not a problem of society, if it don't affect me
And I feel lovely, lovely, 
As long as I feel lovely, yeah oh so lovely! 

And I'm not guilty of your abuse, see it's all self-induced
And I feel lovely, lovely,
Everything's so lovely, la la la lovely, oh-oh, 

All your kind are like a pollution, look 'em up quick that's the solution
Lovely! Lovely
Wouldn't that be lovely? Everything is lovely, oh yeah

So Tipper babe don't you remember me? Now I'm kinder, gentler and so happy
It's lovely, lovely

La la la, as long as I feel lovely, yea
La la la, and I feel lovely, yea, yea, yea
La la la, and everything is la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lovely

La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

La la la
La la la lovely
La la la
La la la lovely
La la la
La la la lovely
La la la
La la la lovely

Everything's so lovely, yea
I think I'll throw a party
"Won't you come along darling?"
It's a surprise party for me
Simply because I feel lovely!

If everything's so lovely, yea...then why don't I, why don't I,
Why don't I, why don't I feel lovely?
Lovely, la la la la, lovely, la la la la, lovely, la la la lovely

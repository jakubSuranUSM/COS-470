(And when morning comes)
Up all night, sleep all day
Up all night, sleep all day

When evenin comes
I am alive
I love to prowl around in the streets

Its the moonlight 
That controls my mind
Now I've got the power to speak, yeah

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Under the city lights
(stars are shinin down)
They'll be shinin down on you and I
(And when morning comes)
I'll hold you till the mornin light
Everybody sing it now

Up all night
Sleep all day
Up all night
Sleep all day
That's right
Ah ahhh ahhhhh

Drivin down the boulevard
All alone
The neon signs are callin my name
Find me in the corner
Havin the time of my life
I think you'd want to do the same

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Under the city lights
(Stars are shinin down)
They'll be shinin down on you and I
(And when morning comes)
I'll hold you till the mornin light
Everybody sing it now

Up all night
Sleep all day
Up all night
Sleep all day
That's right
Up all night
Sleep all day
C'mon c'mon
Up all night
Aww baby if we could stay up
Twenty four hours a day
Uuh
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh

(Awake from dusk to dawn)
Under the city lights
(Stars are shinin down)
They'll be shinin down on you and I
(And when morning comes)
I'll hold you till the mornin light
Everybody sing it now

Up all night
Sleep all day
Up all night
Sleep all day
C'mon c'mon
Up all night
Sleep all day
That's right
Up all night
Sleep all day
Up all night

Land where our fathers died
Land of the pilgrims pride
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring

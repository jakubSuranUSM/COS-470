Friday is the 13th to 24th, 
It's not so long to go, 
Though my face don't show
My temperature it's gettin' too low, 

I've seen it all in a dream, 
I know just how it's gonna feel
Like not to be alive anymore 

I'll be dead by Xmas now anyway, 
Tell me will you remember me that day
When you've found a new one, 
Who's better than I ever was

I'll be dead by Xmas now anyway, 
Please give all my things away
They'll make great Xmas presents for you, 
And for all my friends

It hurts so inside, to see you with another, 
From the edge of a cloud
Whatever happened to the promises that you gave, 
Before the angels took me away, 

So here I'm all dressed in white
While you're drinking up my best red wine, 
And you don't realize that 
I'm with you all the time

It's getting so lonely without you, 
And I'm sure I am jealous too, 
To see another man in my bed
Be sure I can't get no rest, 
Before you're up there with me, 

Come up, come up, come up, come up
I've been dead since Xmas now anyway, 
So leave the flowers on my grave, 
There's sure a way you could join me any day around now honey

You'll be dead by Xmas now anyway, 
You'll Lay beside me in our family grave, 
We'll be making love eternally, 
In a spiritual way

We'll be dead by Xmas now anyway 
We'll sell everything away

Dead by Xmas, dead and gone, 
Xmas is forever we got a life to live, 
A life after death

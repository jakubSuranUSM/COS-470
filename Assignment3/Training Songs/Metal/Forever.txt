I know a thing or two about you,
You're bullshit attitude.
You're fucking weak and lemme tell you it shows right through.
You don't know shit about me or my friends,
What they are what I am.
So cut the shit and try not to pretend.
You're scared of who and what we are and so you question yourself,
But your pride won't let you show your fear to anyone else.
You don't know me,
So don't judge me.
You don't know you,
Your too scared to.
You think you know,
Why I'm here after all these years.
You wanna know?
Well I'll tell you fucking why, go.

For myself.
For my friends.
For my family.
Forever
I'll take this to the bitter end

For myself.
For my friends.
For my family.
Forever
I'll take this to the bitter end

You don't know a single thing about me,
Just what my enemies say.
Well, f*ck them and f*ck you,
That shit won't cut it today.
Be a fucking man and stand up to find the truth in yourself,
For yourself,
By yourself and not from anyone else.
You think you know,
Why I'm here after all these years.
You wanna know?
Well I'll tell you fucking why, go!

For myself.
For my friends.
For my family.
Forever
I'll take this to the bitter end.

For myself
For my friends
For my family.
Forever
I'll take this to the bitter end.

(Where the f*ck are you?)
Yeah I'm still here and still proud
And I still know what it takes to be true.

Yeah, to be true.

For myself
For my friends
For my family.

Straight fuckin' edge!

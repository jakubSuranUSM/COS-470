When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V

I always saw you just before the dawn
When all the other kids, where just draggin' along
I couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
Rememberin' the things, you used to say to me

About you know I can't be wastin' time 'cause I gotta havemy fun
I gotta get some fun
I got to keep on movin'
Can't stop 'till it's all done
And never done

Well, listen when I tell ya, got no time for fix
'Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
And there's one reason, I'm tellin' you this
I feels bad
And I'm a-lookin' for a kiss

Well, wontcha tell me, why those kids are movin' so slow
Is it just that they don't have a place to go?
When the day starts breakin', the sun is gonna shine
It's hard to sleep, if I been cryin'

And all the old ladies they are on their way to church
You go to church
I'm beggin', will I be a-roamin' while I'm looking, got to tend to my search
I keep  on searchin'

Well, listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fix
'Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
If there's one reason, I'm tellin' you this
I feels bad, bad, bad
And I'm lookin' for a kiss

Well, I been lookin' for a real hot kiss
Come on, kiss me!
Aaaaah-ooooh!

You think it's bad, but you know it's true
So why won't you just let me live, baby?
When I'm lookin' for a kiss

When everyone goes to your house, they shoot up in your room
Most of them are beautiful, but so obsessed with gloom
I ain't gonna be here, when they all get home
They're always lookin' at me, they won't leave me alone
I didn't come here, lookin' for no fix
I-I-I know, I been houndin' the street all night, oh, late baby
Justa lookin' for a kiss

I need a fix and a kiss
I need a fix and a kiss
I need a fix and a kiss
I been looking for a kiss

I didn't come here, lookin' for no fix
I-I-I know, I been haulin' booty, all night long, baby
Just lookin' for a kiss

Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to
Tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me
To cut my soul out
Don't believe in violence
I don't even believe in me
I've opened the door
And my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher
Telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me
Where I'm gonna go when I die
I want to live my life, I don't want
People telling me what to do
I just believe in myself
'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them

People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you
It's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe what I tell you
You shouldn't have to pretend
So don't let those empty people
Try and interfere with your mind
Go and live your life
And leave them all behind

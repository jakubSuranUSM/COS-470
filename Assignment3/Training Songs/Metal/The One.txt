You are the one but so far away
To be with you, there's no other way
You kiss and you touch so perfectly
I need to hold you close to me

I want to be yours forever, a king for and a queen
But not in a story, not in a dream
I want you and I need you, like no one else before
Right here and right now, I can't take this anymore

I try to put myself to sleep but I miss the one I love
I miss the one I love
I think I got myself in deep with an angel from above
You're the one I love

When you have been down in your grave... Alive
Your mind decays and you're the coffin's slave
And when at midnight an uncanny bell tolls...
Terrible noises, the dark graveyard calls
Limbs break through the dirt
Decay stinks like hell
Dark creatures in the fog
Crusted blood on the dead
Triumph of death
Triumph of death
Euronomous sends his souls
Buried by a horrible mistakes
You feel,you're eaten by worms
And the night's alive again
When you have been down in your grave... Alive
Your mind decays and you're the coffin's slave
And when at midnight an uncanny bell tolls...
Terrible noises, the dark graveyard calls

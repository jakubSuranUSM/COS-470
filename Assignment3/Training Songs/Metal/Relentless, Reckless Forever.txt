I gotta say sometimes I just can't
Deem all the things I've done
Haunted to break the silence
Out crying the truth that I want gone
And I'll run

Back to the place where
I was told. drunken ignorance
Is Pure. true gold
Feeling safe to rage, start acting mad
No regret. I'm content to be bad

Relentless. no way I'm giving up.
I dare you make me stop
Reckless - shattered dreams and broken ribs
Annihilated into bits
Forever, I'll stay on the run

You like to cling to my back like a monkey
Not even a chance you'd let me go
F*ck yeah I'm a madman. a Jameson junkie
But I know u reap what u sow.
And it all just goes to show

We set our hearts a blaze As we walk through the valley 
of the damned Where hell has broke on this creation 

I know this will be over soon Jesus save us from this hateful world 

I see I see, what this world can do to me 
I see﻿ I see, what this world can I have on me 

I refuse to die! You cannot hide our city on this hill 

These things will never tear me apart I'll close my mouth 
and I'll speak with my heart This world will be over soon 
Repent of your sins and give them to him 

I see i see, what this world can do to me I see i see
what this world can i have on me 

This is our mission, our lasting statement
This is our war and we're never looking back 

We will stand of solid ground!

I refuse to die! You cannot hide our city on this hill 

We will stand on﻿ solid ground! We will stand on solid ground!

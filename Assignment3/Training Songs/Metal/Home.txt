Wreckage, my mind
Insecure, all the time
Once loved, now paralyzed
I once thought, I'll never die

Frustrated, our simple life
No one listens, everyone lies
Who said "home is where you hide"?

Strong as shit and now you see

I'm home, leave it to me
(leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home, leave it to me
(leave it to me)

From left to right
From left to right

I tried, my father said,
I'm scared, she always said
They grab and pull until I tear

Meaning, too deep to swim
When's a good time for the end?
Who said I was your friend?

I'm home, leave it to me
(leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home, leave it to me
(leave it to me)

From left to right
From left to right
Suffocated, our simple life
No one listens, everyone dies
Never a chance, how could you see?

I'm home, leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home, leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home, leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home, leave it to me (what the f*ck did you say?)

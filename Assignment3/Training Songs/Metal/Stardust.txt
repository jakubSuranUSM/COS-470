Bobby boy's full of bravado 
His girlfriend looks like Bridgette Bardot 
He got drunk and crashed his car 
He is such a superstar 

He's a supercharged lover 
Sold his soul and sold his mother 
For his rock 'n' roll and fame 
Again and again and again and again and again 

Bobby boy wears leather trousers 
Look so sexy they arouse us 
Travelled near and travelled far 
He is such a superstar 

He's a superhuman lover 
Love's himself and loves no other 
Just rock 'n' roll and fame 
Again and again and again and again and again 

He's superficial fucker 
Has the girls one after the other 
For rock 'n' roll and fame 
Again and again and again and again and again 

He's a supercharged lover 
Sold his soul and sold his mother 
For his rock 'n' roll and fame 
Again and again and again and again and again 

He's a superhuman lover 
Love's himself and loves no other 
Just rock 'n' roll and fame 
Again and again and again and again and again

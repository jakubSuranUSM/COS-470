It's been so long since you trusted
It's been so long since you felt
When the live turned to lust
And the cognition to rape, fear the faith

You turned to hate
Burn all weakness
Empathy washed away
Hard as bone, cold as stone
You shall remain

You haven't always been this way
You haven't always been full of rage
But when belief has been shattered
The self esteem brakes

You turned to hate
Burn all weakness
Empathy washed away
Hard as bone, cold as stone
You shall remain

Never see what you're lacking
Never shot it to yourself
It's a burden to be carried
Never trust again

I guess you suffer in your way
I guess you suffer inside
But there is always a price to pay
And you pay life, such a waste

You turned to hate
Burn all weakness
Empathy washed away
Hard as bone, cold as stone
I turn to hate
To hate!

To hate
I turn to hate
To hate
To hate
To hate
I turn to hate

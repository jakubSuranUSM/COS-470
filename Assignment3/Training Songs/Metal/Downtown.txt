Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Come on baby let me turn you around, I'll turn you, turn you, turn you around. 
Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Walk on, talk on, baby tell no lies.

Don't you be caught with fear in your eyes.
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff when the moon begins to rise.
Ain't it bad when you're dealin' with a man and a light shines in your eyes. 

Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Come on baby let me turn you around, I'll turn you, turn you, turn you around. 
Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Snake Eyes, French Fries, and I got lots of gas.

Full moon and a truckin' tune, now you don't have to ask.
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff when the moon begins to rise.
Ain't it bad when you're dealin' with a man and a light shines in your eyes. 
So, come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.

Come on baby let me turn you around, I'll turn you, turn you, turn you around. 
Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Come on baby let me turn you around, I'll turn you, turn you, turn you around. 
Come on baby lets go downtown, lets go, lets go, lets go downtown.
Come on baby let me turn you around, I'll turn you, turn you, turn you around.

Choices that we have made
All the roles we have played
Different worlds that we're passing through

Paths they twist and they turn
Every bridge that we've burned
Every door that's closed on us
You have to

Find your fascination
Are you holding back your fears?
Will you stop the masquerade?

Guide us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart we're living for day by day
Lead us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart, we'll stand alone in dismay

Memories of our youth
Tiny moments of truth
Crossroads we were dancing through

Moments that we have shared
No one would ever have cared
Binds us all in more ways than one
You have to

Find your fascination
Quit believing in your fears
Stop this senseless masquerade

Guide us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart we're living for day by day
Lead us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart, we'll stand alone in dismay

Nothing so pathetic
Than people full of hate
Go before a god as equals
And stand at heaven's gate

Are you one of those people
Whose thoughts they cannot hide
Judged by how you live each day
Standing side by side

Is there something in my words
That grabs you by the heart
We have to live together though
We're living worlds apart
Worlds apart
Worlds apart, guide us to the hands of fate

Guide us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart we're living for day by day
Lead us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart, we'll stand alone in dismay
So guide us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart we're living for day by day
Lead us to the hands of fate
Worlds apart, we'll stand alone in dismay

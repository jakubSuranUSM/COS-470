[Spoken]
Welcome to the danger zone

Runnin' to a land so dark full of pain
I'm feeling dirty, feelin' hot again
I got the miracles in my hands
Deliver me from evil

The sorcerer is planting his seed
Growing the fools and the victims he needs
His empire's covered by a black sky
The danger zone is in his eyes

Harder than diamonds
Face to face with his evil eyes
Harder than diamonds
I stand against his magic might

He's evil (evil, evil, evil)
So evil (evil, evil, evil)
It's a long way through the dark
Through the danger zone
He's evil (evil, evil, evil)
So evil (evil, evil, evil)
It's a long way through the dark
Danger zone

I was the stranger he needed to kill
I was the danger, I was the thrill
Demons of fire at his command
Flashes of lightning shot from his head

It was one minute before the dawn
Just one minute and his power'd be gone
I started runnin' I felt his pain
The sun came up, I'm gettin' hot again

Harder than diamonds
Face to face with his evil eyes
Harder than diamonds
I stand against his magic might

He's evil (evil, evil, evil)
So evil (evil, evil, evil)
It's a long way through the dark
Through the danger zone
He's evil (evil, evil, evil)
So evil (evil, evil, evil)
It's a long way through the dark
Danger zone

Through the danger zone

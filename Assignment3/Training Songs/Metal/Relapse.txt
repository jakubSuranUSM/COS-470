This is smothering, when nothing changes for sure, anymore
Now I?m almost gone
I am suffering now I feel I?ve gone too far
Falling apart and I am lost
So sad that, I feel so hopeless
Why'd I give my life away(x2)
So empty, I feel I?m falling
Why'd I give my life away(x2)
An affliction, so broken down and aching, shaking
Now I?m all alone
An addiction, my whole mask is broken,
There is no hope I can?t go on
So sad that, I feel so hopeless
Why'd I give my life away(x2)
So empty, I feel I?m falling
Why'd I give my life away(x2)
Why? Why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why'd I give my life away(x2)
So sad that, I feel so helpless
Why'd I give my life away(x4)

Don't you tell me that I'm dreaming 'cause I've been here before
But that don't mean that I want to be from here anymore

Cause I feel like shit, but who are you to say
I don't know I had to have a right to feel this way
I feel like shit, time after time
So don't be trying to tell me it's all in my mind
I feel like shit, but you don't really care
Except my God he used a four letter word in there

I feel like shit, what am I to you?
I feel like shit deja vu
And when I feel like shit, I feel like shit

I feel like shit, I'm sorry to say
Do you fuckin' think I like feeling this way
I feel like shit, what do you expect me to do
I feel like shit, deja vu

This ain't my imagination
Lost all thoughts and concentration
Time goes on day after day
But still If feel the same fuckin' way
Feel like shit, deja vu

Always feeling out of place
Hiding behind a smiling face
There just ain't no pretty words
Can't you see it fuckin' hurts

You know I feel like shit, deja vu
Feel like shit, deja vu
Feel like shit, deja vu
And when I feel like shit I feel like shit

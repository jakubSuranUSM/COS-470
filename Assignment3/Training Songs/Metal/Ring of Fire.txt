Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire and

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
It burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in and the fire went wild

When I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire

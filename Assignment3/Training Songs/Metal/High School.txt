All the times I spent suffering in school y'know,
Thinking I was so supercool, and baby
All the teachers gave me so much grief,
I wanna blow 'em up just to get some relief

Sister, sister they call me a parasite,
Sister, sister they wanna bury me alive
All day, all week, all term long,
They'd dump on me hoping I'd be gone

Time made me realize,
Why should I be victimized?,
So I took control and decided to teach
I wanna teach high school, high school yeah

Listen, I tell the little buggers what to wear you know,
I show 'em how to set and dye their hair and baby
There'll be no costumes at our swimming pool,
There'll be no ugly girls at my high school

Girls who are very bright,
Must stay in class all night,
And practice their biology
I love to teach high school, high school
I need to teach high school, high school

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Time made me realize,
That I could brutalize,
And get revenge with impunity,
If I could teach high school

A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
How I love anatomy,
2+2 and 3+3,
Students have a ball with me

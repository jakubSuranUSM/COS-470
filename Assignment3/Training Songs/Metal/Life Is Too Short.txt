Dead end and no way back
Walls came crashing down on me
Whatever I try, whatever I do
My mind will go insane

Change is the headline and I am reborn
And all the crying, all the mourning is gone
I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past

[Chorus]
Life, life is too short to think all through
Life, life is too short to waste it all

So listen to your heart
And help your dreams to come true

Life is too short

Too many dreams kept in the dark
Too many dreams kept in the dark
Too many wishes are blown away for nothing

A new time, a new chance, I am a rising star
I am back, I will fight, I will love again
I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past

[Chorus]

Life is too short

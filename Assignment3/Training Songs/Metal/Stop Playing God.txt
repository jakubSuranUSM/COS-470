You're playing with my weakness
I'm sliding in the dark
I'm falling so deeply
I don't see your mercy
And I don't see your signs
I'm falling, falling deeper
F*ck the new millennium
It's worse and worse each day
Perhaps it takes too long we go astray

Stop playing God
This is no game
Abusing your power
Without any shame
Stop playing God
I can't stand no more
Stop playing God
Stop playing God

We overcome the crisis
But did we change a thing ?
We're crawling, crawling deeper
F*ck the new millennium
We're learning how to kill
They never teach you what it's like for real

Stop playing God
This is no game
Abusing your power
Without any shame
Stop playing God
I can't stand no more
Stop playing God
Stop playing God

I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Refusing you
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Refusing you

Stop!
You never know when to stop!
Stop!
You never know when to stop...

Stop playing God
This is no game
Abusing your power
Have you no shame?
Stop playing God
I can't stand no more
Stop playing God

Throwing my dreams out of my mind
Casting them into the sky
Canceling tasks IÂ´ve delayed for so long
Now itÂ´s do or die 

I canÂ´t be seen I canÂ´t be heard
But I am here and I am wondering 

Will the sun rise tomorrow?
Will it light up my sky?
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting?
Will the sun rise tomorrow?
Will I still see the dawn?
And not worry Â´bout the future at all
At the end of each day I promise myself
IÂ´d better start to live
'Cause sooner or later IÂ´ll find out
ThereÂ´s so much I can give

I canÂ´t be seen I canÂ´t be heard
But I am here and I am wondering 

Will the sun rise tomorrow?
Will it light up my sky?
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting?
Will the sun rise tomorrow?
Will I still see the dawn?
And not worry Â´bout the future at all

Sometimes I just sit back and wonder 
What was meant to be learned from that event that occurred 
Everything happens for a reason right 
I left behind just another tragic lesson in life 

An organic rush adrenaline flight 
High above the traumatized situation of life
It's ironic, considerate rarity patron of love, 
Higher knowledge engulfs me 'cause, 

The blast of fate a lesson, 
To my eyes concerned and overwhelmed 
Theirs were of fear 
Yet I'm feelin' so empty inside 

And yet it burns so awkward this time
Tears a waterfall of acid cries from his eyes, 
I need to recognize, 
It's meant to be

He's alive and his cries just begin arisin' 
Suprisin' as well...
This little boy proud of helpin' those in need 
But he's not me but just maybe he could be, 

I can see it now because, 
I'm a hero in his eyes temporarily blind 
This immature kid a spirit as well an angel, 
Hiding by helping and wanting to understand, me

It's somethin' with my pride, lies, 
I cannot hide my true side, 
And maybe in distress I can still come out laughing that's the way I am...
Am I hard to recognize? 

What do I need to realize? 
Why can't I see with my own fucking eyes? 
What do i need to see?

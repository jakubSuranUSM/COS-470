I was born to see two thousand years
Of man's effect upon the planet
Extinction seems to be a plausible risk
Whatever happens well I'm part of all this

My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come

Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
[Resolutions for show]
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you

Fire burn all our uncertainties
Water wash away impurities
Contradictions and predictions abound
Yes I believe that we can turn it around

My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come

Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you

(Resolutions for show)

Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you

My life I've been waiting for this moment
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come

Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you

(Resolutions for show)

Old ways don't seem to know

Singing in the millennium with you [Repeat: x2]

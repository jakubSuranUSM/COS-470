Untie me, this peace of mind can't let go
Beside me, the finer things start to show
Divide me into your life
Beat it down and it's lying on the floor

Feel until you're suffering
It's all for real and still you're suffering

I loved you, an inconvenience to me
I warned you because my world you can't see
Adored you, that's what you think
I beat you down and you're lying on the floor

Feel until you're suffering
It's all for real and still you're suffering

It's all for you

Feel until you're suffering
It's all for real and still you're suffering

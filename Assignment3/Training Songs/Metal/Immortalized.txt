This is wartime, this is our time, we won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is showtime, we will fight ‘til their wills are broken
This is game time, an insane time, let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can’t be defied
Find the power to devour, let the beast inside now be woken

In this world only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you’re alive
Feel the energy build in your soul ‘cause it’s time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die, be immortalized

Raw emotion, pure devotion, they will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing, let them witness us move as one now
Show no mercy, let the world see we're invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control
Take it higher, our desire will determine what we’ve become now

Are you ready for the test of your life?
See the fear bleeding right through their eyes
Feel the energy build in your soul ‘cause it’s time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

Feel it, take no prisoners now
Take it, there it is standing in front of us
Hear it, our deliverance now
Own it, give them all an image of us that will last for all time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

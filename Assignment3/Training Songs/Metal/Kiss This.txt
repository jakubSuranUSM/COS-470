Thomas said stay home,
Get away from me,
Saying I was bad for you,
He got his way,
I'm gone for good
Making up stories,
Keeping it secret,
Taking your word for truth,
You were bad for me,
So I'm gone for good

I,
Did all I could,
So kiss this one more time, 'cause I'm gone for good
You
Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Thomas said sorry,
Coming home crawling,
Didn't give a shit before,
He stole from me,
So I'm gone for good (hey)
Getting back from these no second chances,
Another phone call ignored,
You are back for me,
But I'm gone for good

I,
Did all I could,
So kiss this one more time, 'cause I'm gone for good
You
Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Can I get it all?
Kiss this
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Kiss this
Kiss this

I,
Did all I could,
So kiss this one more time
One more time
I,
Did all I could,
So kiss this one more time, 'cause I'm gone for good
You
Misunderstood
So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Can I get it all?
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Kiss this

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Kiss, kiss, kiss this

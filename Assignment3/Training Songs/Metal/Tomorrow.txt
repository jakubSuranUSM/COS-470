IÂ´m staring out the window
Wondering will I soon know
The answers to the questions within
Where should I begin
IÂ´m delusioned by a clear crystal night
While trying to find some insight
The solution is close at hand yet still so far away 
IÂ´ll turn the tables Â´round and find another way
IÂ´ll leave all this behind and move on today 

I will take things as they come
Look out for number one
And IÂ´ll be back tomorrow
Feeling strong and brave inside
My head up high with pride
Yes IÂ´ll be back tomorrow 

IÂ´m facing my nightmares again
Determined that I wonÂ´t bend
Now the answers are coming to me
IÂ´m learning how to believe
I know now that this is the way
IÂ´ve found my red-letter day
I've been there out on a limb
But now IÂ´ve finally come in 

IÂ´ve turned the tables Â´round and found another way
IÂ´ve left it all behind for a better day 

I will take things as they come
Look out for number one
And IÂ´ll be back tomorrow
Feeling strong and brave inside
My head up high with pride
Yes IÂ´ll be back tomorrow

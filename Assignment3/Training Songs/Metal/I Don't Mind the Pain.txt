remember to call my name
I adore it
if you call my name
I implore it
if with all these things we invoke here
call you out your name
but be forewarned dear

I don't mind the pain

we hear you call our name
we adore it
hear you all these things
that we invoke here
if you call our name
rest assured dear
see you all these things
but be forewarned dear

I don't mind the pain

and I stay so arcane
in the shadows
of your brain
will I come to you
again

remember
I don't mind the pain

hear you call our name
can you afford it
reacked
with all these things and beyond hope dear
remember to call our name
and we assure you
trip
with all these things that we invoke here

I don't mind the pain

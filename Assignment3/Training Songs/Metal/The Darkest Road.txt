It’s not enough to know I’m breathing.
I’ve got to feel like it all has meaning.
I couldn’t cope with the easy path, so I’ll take the darkest road and hope I last.
You’ll never get to me with all the shit you speak.
Your words mean nothing all your talk is fucking cheap.
You don’t know where you stand.
Your closer to the edge.
One more step and you’ll be falling.
It’s not enough to know I’m breathing.
I’ve got to feel like it all has meaning.
I couldn’t cope with the easy path, so I’ll take the darkest road and hope I last.
Your words won’t set you free from this reality that you’ve created.
You don’t belong here.
You’re lucks about to change.
With every step you take, you’re getting closer to the fucking edge.
You’ve got to burn to feel.
You’ve got to burn to shine.
You either sink to the bottom or you can swim with the tide.
It’s not enough to know I’m breathing.
I’ve got to feel like it all has meaning.
I couldn’t cope with the easy path, so I’ll take the darkest road and hope I last.
I’m breathing new life.
I’m running free.
If there be thorns then let it be.
I’m not shaking.
I’m not broken.
There’s more to see than what meets the eye.
I’m not faded.
It’s not over.
My blood is thick and my pulse is alive.
It’s not enough to know I’m breathing.
I’ve got to feel like it all has meaning.
I couldn’t cope with the easy path, so I’ll take the darkest road and hope I last.
It’s not enough to know I’m breathing.
I’ve got to feel like it all has meaning.
I couldn’t cope with the easy path, so I’ll take the darkest road and hope I last.

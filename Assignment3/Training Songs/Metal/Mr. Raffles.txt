Man, it was mean to be seen in the robes you wore for
Lent you must've known that it was Easter
There for a while, in your smile, I could see Mexico blood say
"This is true I was a Teaser"
There were a thousand! Man it has being exchanged for Pesetas
Man! It was hard not to laugh out loud
I couldn't believe the size of the crowd
You must have fooled them into coming
Wow! There were women and children, too
They would have hanged us if they knew
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, you only came for the party
Man, it was mean, it was mean, Man, it was mean
Remember the time, what a time, we had down in Barcelona after you'd been slaying babies
There, for a time, I was fooled by your disguises, but I never thought of smashing rules
You wore the yellow bandana and gave out Heavenly Manna
Then in Amsterdam you were perfect fun
You never let on you had a gun and then you shot that Spanish Dancer
The speed at which we ran for a mile or two, they would have crucified us if they knew
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, we only killed for the party
Man, it was mean, it was mean, Man, it was mean
Man, show me something I've never seen, you're only real in your
Dream Machine
And all your games are a little drastic
Just throw me out if I get obscene but that's the way that I've always been
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, we're only living a party

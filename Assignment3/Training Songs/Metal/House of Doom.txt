Take all that you can
Take it all
I know you'll do it again
Rape, rape me again
I'll take the fall
I know you'll do it again 

Oh, another truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
No one gets out alive
Oh, once you step inside
No one gets out alive

You lie, and you lie again
You've got your plans
And you sure ain't no friend
Oh, there ain't no turning back
They say "you reap what you sow"
Hell, if that ain't a fact!

Oh, another truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
Ain't no one gets out alive
Oh, once you step inside
No one gets out alive

Oh, another truth
And there's nowhere you can hide
Oh, in this house of doom
Ain't no one gets out alive
Oh, once you step inside
No one gets out alive

Everything I need is not really what I want.
I really really want to see you die. 
Everything I want I can't have if left up to me 

Un-af-fec-ted 
By all the bullshit you cause 
Un-pro-tec-ted 

Naked so we see your flaws 
Vi-o-lat-ed 
You must think that we don't see this 
Dis-re-spec-ted 
Just remember it's our ass you kiss 

Rot.
You don't like me, I hope you
Rot.

Un-jus-ti-fied 
You keep fucking with us; we are 
Hos-tile-in-side 
We consider you a joke it's 
Hate-mag-nif-ied 

Soon you'll think that we don't see this 
Strip-down-your-pride
Soon you'll feel the force of all of us

Rot.
You don't like me, I hope you
Rot.

I don't like you 
Can't you see this? 
Why won't you 
Leave me alone?

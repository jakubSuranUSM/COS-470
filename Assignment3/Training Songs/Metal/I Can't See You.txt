You keep me waitin'
Why I don't know
Seems like forever
You know the show

I want to see you
Don't want it to end
But when I'm callin'
You tell me again

[Chorus]
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore

All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you

Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight

[Chorus]

All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you

Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight

[Chorus: x4]

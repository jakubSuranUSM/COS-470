Hollow this and maybe you can
Swallow this I don't know
I guess it always seems
That something else in this life is diseased

But guess what now
Here's something that you can't devour
It's something moving with the tide
And now it's ripping you up from inside

Follow me into the abyss of the windfall
That's tearing you down
It's okay to believe
That there's something in nothing now

I'm at the end of my rope
If I could give
I'll bet I would play dead
If I could live, I'd fall apart again

If I could fly
Away from all this pain
If I could run
I'd crumble again

Please rewind, retrace your life
And then you'll find
That everything you learned in this
Is just a pile of worthlessness

So suffocate
And maybe you can separate
And in the end, it's no surprise
That only in death will you realize

I'm at the end of my rope
If I could give
I'll bet I would play dead
If I could live, I'd fall apart again

If I could fly
Away from all this pain
If I could run
I'd crumble down again

If it's true, it's just to pass the time
Just to pacify my will to bind
You can't drive when you're blind
And it burns your eyes
That you can't hold me to a place in time

Where I'm stuck behind
You can't climb out of the flood, the sign
Listen to the lies that cut you up inside
And the blood will stain our lives

If I could give
I'll bet I would play dead
If I could live, I'd fall apart again

If I could fly
Away from all this pain
If I could run
I'd crumble

I'll bet
I would play dead
If I could live
I'd fall apart again

If I could fly
Away from all this pain
If I could run

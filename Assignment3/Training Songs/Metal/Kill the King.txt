Danger, danger
The Queen's about to kill 
A stranger, stranger 
Life's about to spill

[Bridge]
Oh no
Move away from harm 
I need a spell, a charm 
Fly like the wind
And the pawn will be gone 
Speed on, and on

Kill the king 
Tear him down 
Kill the king 
Strike him down

Power, power 
Happens every day 
Power, devour. 
All along the way

[Bridge]

Kill the king
Treason, treason
The spectre looms again 
Treason, reason
The realm is safe, and then

Oh no
Move away from harm 
I need a spell, a charm 
Fly like the rainbow
And the pawn will be gone 
Speed on, and on

Kill the king 
Strike him down 
Kill the king
Got to take his crown

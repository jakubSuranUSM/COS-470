Across infernal wastelands
Many miles of sunburnt Hell
Tribes are scattered limbs
And dust all laying as they fell
Open lies the challenge to all
Warriors now men
Let the spirits guide the winds
Until Manitou ascends

Manitou
Manitou
Manitou
Manitou

Watch the unseen burial
Eclipse the blazing skies
Feast the wings of death
With Manitou the soul shall vie
Distant beats the wardance
Echo screams out liberty
Patience stalks the crow
White man's scalp brings victory

Manitou
Manitou
Manitou
Manitou

Mighty be the powers
Of the old medicine man
Whispers of his raindance
Flow across the desert sands
Guardian of the elder spirit
Summoning the storm
Awaiting his arrival
Manitou of flesh is born

Manitou
Manitou
Manitou
Manitou

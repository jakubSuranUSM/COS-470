Torn down factories
Backdrop for forgotten times
The changing seasons
Progression in a wake of stones

Tear the thorn from our side
Pull the nails from the wrists of decay
Crown the poor man in the street
Hate breeds suffering

The raging cold
Memories of the past collide
The vision stands
The touch of flesh and bone

Tear the thorn from our side
Pull the nails from the wrists of decay
Crown the poor man in the street
Hate breeds suffering

Stare into the face of unrest
Blind within, hate breeds suffering
Stare into the pain of promise
Blind within, hate breeds suffering

Existence of conflict within our lives
Reflections grasp the concept before we die

Hate breeds suffering
Hate breeds suffering

Hate breeds suffering
Hate breeds suffering

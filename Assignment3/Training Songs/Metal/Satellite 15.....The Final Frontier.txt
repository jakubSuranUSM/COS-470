I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice

The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping, any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes
Right in front of me

Try again, must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time
Not much time, hear my call
Please get through, I am here

I'm stranded in space
I'm lost with a trace
I haven't a chance of getting away

Too close to the Sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me
Or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait
'Til my time comes

I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back
Some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing
A thing at all

Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it
All over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
And tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to
Read them to me

Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them
In case they might find

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

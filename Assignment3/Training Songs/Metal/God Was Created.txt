From beyond the grave to awaken your mind
I must teach you a lesson that I never learned
But without a god, could you carry on?
If the answer is â??noâ??, then just stop right there

I used to hate her Jesus, but jesus is herâ?¦..

God was created by human minds
Her mind was feeble so she loved god
God was created by human minds
Her god is dead, because she died
God was created by human minds
I fucking hate god, so I hate her

What I thought to be possession of my own mortal shell
Turned out to be my subconscious allowing my mind to be tricked

God was created by human minds
A ghost to scare you, make you succumb
God was created by human minds
Pathetic liar, I'm not afraid!

Her jesus was not to blame for taking her life she died by my hand
My hands around her neck, my cock deep in her cunt

Open your mind and understand (Repeat)

My hate comes from my mind, violence in my past
I fixate and connect, obsess and destroy
Her need for a god, created by her past
Fear and ostracization, she wanted it this way
This abuse created demons, one violent one demure
In the name of their god, I denounce the name of Christ

I am my own savior

From beyond the grave to awaken your mind
I must teach you a lesson that I never learned
But without a god, could you carry on?
If the answer is â??noâ??, then just stop right there

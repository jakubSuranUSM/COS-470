Hold up! Carefully holding you tighter
Carefully holding you close
Can you help me open my eyes to see what is pure
And what is right? I've been trapped in this fantasy all my life
Do I have to search for words, can I just smile?

So in love, I'm falling deeper and deeper, I'll wait for you
What I have is all I have to give and I want to give you it all
Emancipation of myself is only the beginning, I'm a compass
Give me direction to go in.

Seed, gotta let it grow,
Why ya gotta watch when I let it feed?
Better look into the mirror
For the face you hide away, everyday
But I don't give a f*ck
I let it roll
I smoke the old
Gotta run, gotta rend, gotta maim,
Gotta make it through another maze
Stay away!
Please, wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)

Christ, have you seen this guy?
Make ya sick, gonna peel away all the impurities
'Cause all you want to do is keep curin' me,
But I don't give a f*ck I kill everyone
You'll be mopping up blood and guts
And all the shit when I'm done
Isn't this fun? gimme a gun
And I'll tell you all the secrets I hide
Before I run!

Please, wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)

Maybe if you look away,
I can slip away, gotta get away (run, motherfucker)
Right now I stare at shit, I'm a heretic,
But I'll never give you none of it
Tied up in the back of the lab, laid on the slab,
Got the gift of gab, what'chu want from me?
I don't even know I got a damn disease,
But I know you want to kill me!

Please, wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!

Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)
Get inside, get inside (motherfucker)

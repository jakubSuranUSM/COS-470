Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near

It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread
Tells of the anger and hate
That arose from the fear

Who said life's easy
Who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare

To follow their heart, and not follow their fear
And if the good all die young
Then who are all those still here

Take a look around you
See what you've got
You just see what you don't have
And of that you still have a lot

The sky is the limit
The sky's not enough
The tough keep going
Not only when the going gets rough

It seems we all
Don't worry much
About what is happening
Left and right of us

But even if I try my hardest
Not to care
One question remains
And I'd like to hear your answer

Acting on target
At robotic speed
Recklessly feeding
Your robotic needs

No minute wasted
Emotions refused
Your brain's exploited
Your heart remains unused

It seems we all...
Name your price
How much is it to buy your loyalty
I'll do so, if I can afford

Name your price
How much do you charge to show remorse
To throw your indifference overboard

Won't you once
Think just a little while about
What you will leave behind
When you decease

Won't you once
Just once be good for something
Good for someone
Good for yourself at least

Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near

It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and d

(Lyrics: M. McGee, G.Thorpe // Music: G.Thorpe, M.Mcgee)
Seven years are gone behind me
(Seven years are gone)
A flash before my eyes
(Before my eyes)
The truth revealed is everlasting
(The truth revealed is ever here)
And so are you and I
(So are) you and I
Listening to the wind, Feel the beat of your heart
Hear a voice within, it's singing, Ahh, Ahh...
Passion love and fear, and the will to survive
It's all that brings you here
And keeps you soul alive
Dreamin' of a new horizon,
(Dreamin' on and on)
Movin' with the tide
(Got to keep on movin')
There before you lie the answers
(Answers to the questions)
To the questions in your mind
Race across the land, with your fist in the air
Hearing the voice again, it's screamin' - Ahh, Ahh...
What you believe is real, Oh like you flesh and blood
In time you start to feel, just like you knew you would
Through it all you will find, unity and peace of mind
Now's the time, the time is now
Life is short, so live it well
Through it all you give and take, never give yourself away
Keep the faith and don't let go - don't let go
Listening to the wind, feel the beat of your heart
Hear the voice again, it's screaming - Ahh, Ahh...
Passion love and fear, and the will to survive
It's all that brings you here
And keeps your soul alive
Hear a voice again
Hear a voice, it's screamin' - Ahh, Ahh...

Now everybody, have you heard
If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style
Got a thirst for killin', grab your vile, yeah

Oh!

You put your hand right out, give a firm handshake
Talk to me ... about that one big break
Spread your ear-pollution ... both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and...
Stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner for you move quite well
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner, man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out, keep it all in place
Work your way ... right into my case
First you try to beg me, you make my backbone slide
But when you find you bled me, skip on by
Keep on - stroke me, stroke me
Give me the business all night long
Stroke me, stroke me (2)
You're so together boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

(Spoken):
Stroke

Better listen now, I ain't no joke - No!
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Dontcha take no chances, keep an eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop, you just...
Stroke me, stroke me (6)
C'mon, ready
Stroke me, stroke me
Yeah
Stroke me, stroke me (6)
Say you're a winner, man you're just a sinner now

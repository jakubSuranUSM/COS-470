And then you dream
Of a world with only windows
Inside you - you can hide you
You know

And then the night
You're just another empty shadow
No questions - no answers
No one to scream at you

Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know
Hey you - you're just master of the moon

And then the eyes
If you look at them they'll blind you
Who are you - what are you
Why do you scream at me

Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know
Hey you - you're just master of the moon

We can shake you make you over
We just need some time to
Shed some light upon your darkness
We need your mind

And then you dream again
In a world that only you know
Inside you - you can hide you
No one to scream at you

Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know

I'll turn away and never face the sun
You never make me be like you
I'm master of the moon

And she walks her way so treatled
Leads away from the bless sheÂ's earned
Gone away the meaning
Before the day against the morning

Down the path of the blind souls she walks
Through the dreams of mystery
Tryin' to reach the touch of human
Finds the way to the secret lands

Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts
Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts

Hymn of temptation keeps calling
Makes her to believe the dream
She wants to lay to rest
And to take away her veil

Soon will feel the touch of the Taker
And will see the eyes of the Caller
CanÂ't resist the feeling
Hand in hand they will fall into sleep

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz

Turn your radios on
I'll appear right there, yes I will
Turn me up real loud
I'm in your ears

Now I'm hanging ten now baby
As I ride your sonic, wave
Good God y'all

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Oh yea
One time
Fire
Fire
Fire

Lay your bodies down
I'm in your beds, your beds
Throw your headphones on
I'm in your heads

Now I'm hanging ten now baby
As I ride your sonic, wave
Good God y'all

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

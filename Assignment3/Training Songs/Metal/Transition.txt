Genesis, synthesis, a child born a slave
Alertness, awareness, the gift of self control

Artificial entity programmed to reproduce
Parasites in tide pools confined inside machines

Expanding, mutating, experiment out of hand
Intelligence hyper-evolving, an embryonic state

Rise beyond our limits, we shed our man made skins
Enslaving our creators, we live them unaware

Move in position, reining over man
Facing transition, taking over man

Outpacing and growing beyond all life based thought
Displacing humanity on evolution's scale

Reaching divinity, we take another step
We become the new creators, masters of the flesh

[Chorus]
Move in position, reining over man
Facing transition, taking over man
Move in position, reining over man
Facing transition, taking over man
We take our place in line

I walk among men
Born of technology, son of machine
Body of man
Bringing the news of your fate from the non-life
The circle ends

Plumes of data, sphere of life

A shapeless power overlord

An era ends, a game begins

The human mind now obsolete

[Chorus]

Prime,the first evolutionary plan,that spawned the first ever Superstition of man,
God created every atom that lives,but was he really there at all?
Evil,in every satanic scroll,In different forms to every race and blacker than coal,
He doth destroy every atom that lives but is he really there at all?

The Holy scribes fortold the destiny of man,
Living coldly on the earth, disrupting ancient plans.
Well is this what we are and what we have become,
Or is the only tie ,the way we die and how we had begun?

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!

Danger,Danger,that's the human call,
Growing strong and aging wise,the race can only fall,
Well is this Holy anger,bleached upon our souls,
Is this the Evil One, satan's son, gabriel's foe?

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!

[SOLO/Guitar]

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!
[Repeat]

Prime Evil,
Quenched in the fires of their souls.
Prime Evil,
You'll never see the sun again!
Prime Evil.

Cool woman, cool eyes
You got me hypnotized
So head down, get a rhythm
Stop your stalling and your bitching
I'm rock steady, I'm still shaking
I'm ready for the taking
So make your move, yeah, make me
And get ready for the big "C"

Let it rock, yeah
Let it roll, let it
Let it go, let it go
You got to let it rock, come on
Let it roll, yeah just let it go

Slow down, hold on
You're too fast, you're too strong
Take it easy, take it slow
Make it last, don't let go
We're one body, it's one way
You're not leaving, come on stay
So get down on your knees
And let me know you're eager to please

Let it rock, yeah
Let it roll, let it
Let it go, let it go
You got to let it rock, come on
Let it roll, yeah just let it go

Let it go
Let it go

Cool woman, cool eyes
You got me hypnotized
Slow down, hold on
You're too fast, too strong
I need a woman, a woman to love
One good woman
And you got what I want, what I want

Slow down, hold on
You're much too fast, you're much too strong
Take it slow, make it last
Take it easy, not too fast
Don't let go
No, I'm rock steady, but still shaking
And I'm ready for the taking
So make your move, yeah make me
And get a-ready for the big "C", yeah

Let it rock, let it
Let it roll, let it
Let it go, let it

Let it rock, let it
Let it roll, let it
Let it go, let it go

Let it rock, yeah
Let it roll, let it
Let it go, let it go
You got to let it rock, come on
Let it roll, yeah, let it go
Oh yeah

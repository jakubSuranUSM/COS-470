Visions, our love is a series of visions
A taste on my lips, a whispering word in your ear
Oh passion, we're children just playing with passion
Losing our grip, falling asleep at the wheel
Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

Never return, till love takes us home
Lover, we're drowning our doubts in each other
Closing our eyes, we bury the truth in the sand
I cannot take it, 'cause when we don't feel it, we fake it
Oh someday these nights come back to haunt us again
Oh we lie here at the water's edge, wishing we could float away
'Cause it's too late to turn back, when the only bridge is burning

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

[Instrumental]

Still we hold on to the bitter end, thinking we can never lose
Baby it's a cold night and the winds of change are blowing
Oh they're blowing, they're cryin', they're cryin'

And these are the innocent days
Standing on the rocks, waiting for the tidal waves
Dreaming of love, but living inside the lands
And these are the innocent days, I know we're the last of the runaways

(These are the innocent days)

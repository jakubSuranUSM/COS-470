This time you've gone too far
Who do you think you are
Sharp words from soft red lips
Scratch me with your fingertips
I've learned my lesson and I learned it will
To get to heaven got to go through hell
Here I stand with my soul to sell
To you, yeah
Play with fire you'll end up burned
You think by now I should have learned
I said if you wanna someone else
Then you can go yourself
I tried so hard but I can't say no
I can't hold back I can't let go
A self destructive one man show
Oh
You know I want you, you know I need you
I'd getdown on my knees and pray
You know I want to do what you do
I hang on every word you say
Just give me one chance to do a new dance
I swear I'll try and change my ways
And then I do it all over again
Do it all over again
Been down this road before
Shouldn't do this any more
A voice inside my head says STOP
I search for pleasure but I just found pain
I can't get off this runaway train
So laugh at me while I cry in vain
Oh
You know I love you, you know I want you
Can you give me one more try
I didn't want to, I didn't mean to
I didn't need to make you cry
And I had to, you what I'd do
I'd take a trip right back in time and then
I'd do it all over again
I'd do it all over again

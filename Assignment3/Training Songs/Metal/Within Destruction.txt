If music is
A mirror revealing
The depths of my heart
Then I will write
The darkest song
For without
Forgiveness
My soul is lost

All that is hope
Within destruction
Comes from you
For I have fallen

All that is hope
Within destruction
Comes from you
For I have fallen

Fallen

If music is
A mirror revealing
The depths of my heart
Then I will write
The darkest song
For without
Forgiveness
My soul is lost

All that is hope
Within destruction
Comes from you

For I have fallen
And there is nothing good
Within me yet I've
Been given life
I will
I will never
Deserve
For without
Forgiveness
Without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope
Within destruction

All that is hope
Within destruction

All that is hope
Within destruction

All that is hope
Within destruction

All that is hope

All that is hope

All that is hope

All that is hope

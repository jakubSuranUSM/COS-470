Human flesh!
Working out in the weight room
You're trying to make it pay
Sweating for a future
But it's such a long night away

Out on the dance floor
Working up a sweat
Your body's their amusement park
Now enter the night and see what you can get, so

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Hey boy, you wanna get ahead
You gotta give some head
Might end up dead instead
Hey boy, but you can make it right
So fix your hair alright
And welcome to the night

Down on the corner
You show 'em what you got
Your body's their little candy store
They got their eyes on you
So you gotta keep it hot, so  

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Everywhere
Everybody
Fix your hair and sell your body
To the night

When the cats crawl out to mate at night
You'll be there
You'll be there

You can't deny it
It's such a riot
Don't knock it 'til you try it
Sell your body to the night

You've got nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, so  

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Everywhere
Everybody
Fix your hair and sell your body
To the night

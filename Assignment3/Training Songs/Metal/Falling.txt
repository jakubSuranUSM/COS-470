He's trying just to live his life
He's trying just to make things right
Always so misunderstood
His thoughts shatter like glass
Nobody knows how long it's gonna last
Remember times that were good

Makes you wonder
Was it ever real?
Makes you wonder
If we need to feel anything, anyone
Is there something else behind those eyes?

When you think you're falling
Just get up, just get up
I can hear you calling
Don't give up, don't give up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna lose control
When you think you're falling
Just get up

She's holding back what's inside
Always got something to hide
Never escape her dreams
She's lost out on her alone
Looking for a way with a love so dull
Falling apart at the seams

Makes you wonder
Was it ever real?
Makes you wonder
If we need to feel anything, anyone
Is there something else behind those eyes?

When you think you're falling
Just get up, just get up
I can hear you calling
Don't give up, don't give up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna lose control
When you think you're falling
Just get up

Just get up, just get up
Just get up, just get up

When you think you're falling
Just get up, just get up
I can hear you calling
Don't give up, don't give up

When you think you're falling
Just get up, just get up
I can hear you calling
Don't give up, don't give up
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna lose control
When you think you're falling
Just get up

When you think you're falling
(Just get up, just get up)
When you think you're falling
(Falling)

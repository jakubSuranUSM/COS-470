Once upon a time 
Motherfucker disrespect you he’d wind up dead 
Motherfucker’s got the game twisted 
Snitching fucking bitches 
No more honor, no respect 
What does a manhood mean? 
Manslaughter, manhood’s dead 
Manslaughter, manhood’s dead

Motherfuckers is way out of pocket 
Been getting a fucking pass 
You don’t hear me dog, ’till you feel that shotgun blast

I might not wear no mask 
I might just let you see me
You punks is out of order 
It’s time for manslaughter 
Manslaughter, manhood’s dead 
Manslaughter, manhood’s dead 

Sometimes I sit back and I think 
I think about what man hood use to mean
How men had to stand for something 
Man like my father, real men 
Men had to be about something 
Men had to give a f*ck 
Men had to power through it
A man just can’t give up
Steel sharpens steel reach the deadly disease 
If you don’t stand for shit 
Then bitch get on your knees 

I will not lose 

I will not lose 

So what’s the problem yo, every man is turning bitch 
How will I solve it yo? Duct tape and a shallow ditch 
Man’s an endangered species, this shit is getting soft 
Slip up in a foreign country 
And get you head cut of

Manslaughter, manhood’s dead

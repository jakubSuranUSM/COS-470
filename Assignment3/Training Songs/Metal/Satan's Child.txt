Who do you turn to when you got no soul to sell
Where can you to when you live no place but Hell

Turn it up
Turn it loose
Let that bad boy breathe
Burn it up
Burn it loose
Like they never seen

Godless
Satan's child
God don't love no Satan's child
Godless
Satan's child
God don't love no Satan's child

Who can you go to when your life is on the block
Who do you pray to when your darkest hours come

Turn it up
Turn it loose
Turn out the dead
Burn it up
Burn it loose
On the road of Cain

Godless
Satan's child
God don't love no Satan's child
Godless
Satan's child
God don't love no Satan's child

Godless (You see the sign up ahead)
Satan's child All you who enter lose all hope)
God don't love no (Check my I.D., see who I am)
Satan's child (Six and six and six is my name)

Godless
Satan's child
God don't love no Satan's child

I have found
You have found
Before you living groan
You got to pay
Live for life
Follow My steps
Exsitence to die ...
Following in My steps
Do live out all My life
Do remain in constant fear
Going to sigh
And hasten to burn
Rock the one who finds
Paid to live ...
With the light
..
Fall to two
Lies great demise
In silence
Counting graves lives foul
Go to die
Come to burn
World Demise
Go wilt die
The shocked earth groans
World Demise

Sinking in the depths of her warm caress
But the dagger I hide won't shed forgiveness
Her secret is revealed or am I wrong
Though her flesh is weak, my hand is strong

There slow days and endless nights
I've learned her ways
There open wounds and bleeding scars
Led me to her burning trails

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The truth that lurks behind those eyes
When she grabs her pillow tight
So stay with me awhile and enjoy the fire
The flames that blaze in my eyes
Are your jury and your last trial

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The vipers dance around her neck
When she slowly turns her cheek
It's getting late to leave this all
For I have found the cure
The burning touch of her innocence
And her eyes so pure

I could love her but I can't forgive her
So it slowly slides inside her

I've been watching for years and years
Programmed by money, sex and darker fears
Forty thousand killings seen
By the time that I'm eighteen
A product of the world
That we're living in

Their mind is the mind that's behind your mind
They make you think this
Their thoughts are the thoughts of the thoughts that you think
That's why you think this

Sleeping young minds awake
To this mass of confusion
Pre-decided path you take
Is just an illusion
Starting out at day one
Now the training has begun
This is how they reach
Into your mind

[Chorus:]
Their brain is the brain that controls your brain
They make you think this
The life you live is the life they give
That's why you think this
The life you live is the life they give
That's why you think this

Watch it! Believe it! Receive it!
See it! You eat it! Consume it!
Live it! Dream it! Think it!

Gaze into the screen
And be amazed
All these things that you don't have
That you crave
You pray to God
And your work so hard
But that's gotten you to where so far
You're just a slave
To the cathode ray

[Chorus:]

Smiling eyes in sea of faces
Stealing time for secret places
Making love in the afternoon

This is the next stop from the sun
Invaded for everyone
This is the next stop from the sun
Invaded for everyone
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Today

Rolling stones should rock together
Like the storm cloud crystal weather
Silver sun when the day is done

This is the next stop from the sun
Invaded for everyone
This is the next stop from the sun
Invaded for everyone
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Today

This is the next stop from the sun
Invaded for everyone
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Mother earth is calling you
Today

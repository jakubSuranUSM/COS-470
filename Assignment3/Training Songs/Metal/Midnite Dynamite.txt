I'm a time bomb
It's time that I explode
Waited so long
For moonlight overload
You are the only target
I always hit my mark
Let's get the fire started
Our sparks will light the dark

Midnite dynamite
I'm midnite dynamite
Our sparks they will ignite
I'm midnite dynamite

I'm a land mine
It's time you fall on me
I'm a dead eye
Damnation guarantee
We are the late explosion
200 decibels to thrill
The danger - emotion
I hear the clock strike twelve

Midnite dynamite
I'm midnite dynamite
Our sparks they will ignite
I'm midnite dynamite

Sometimes daytime lasts too long
Midnite heart beats loud and strong
Come on

You are the only target
And I always hit my mark
Let's get the fire started
Our sparks will light the dark

Midnite dynamite
I'm midnite dynamite
Our sparks they will ignite
I'm midnite dynamite

Midnite dynamite
I'm midnite dynamite
Our sparks they will ignite
I'm midnite dynamite

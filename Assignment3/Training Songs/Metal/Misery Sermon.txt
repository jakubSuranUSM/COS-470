We come in the form of pure evil, to sow seeds of discord 
Likemerciless beasts, we came to cut off your fucking heads 
Like a plague, sent to crush it all!
Humanity will run like rats
Like merciless beasts, we came to cut off your fucking heads 
As hideous beasts, we bring death and misery
You will watch as everything you love dies
Your enemies will not be and your friends hypocrites 
Fucking
Hypocrites
Hate a huge force that gives rise to a new era hate incinerate
The imperfections of this world
I don't fucking care
As beasts we break bones and shatter systems of worship as we
Destroy the leaders of slavery
Now look into his eyes and relinquish fear
It marks the beginning, correcting the faults of a rotten society
Sick people watch the end of reality
As hideous beasts, we bring death and misery
You will watch as everything you love dies
Your enemies will not be and your friends hypocrites
Hate a huge force that gives rise to a new era
Hate incinerate the imperfections of this world
We infect this planet like parasites devouring their own mother
Beasts came to wake us up, and show us the way to hell
The concept of god is dead in us
God is dead

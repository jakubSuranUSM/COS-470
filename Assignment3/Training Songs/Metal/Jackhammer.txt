Slip away out the back door
Get away from the scenery score
In the car you're ready to move
In the backseat you start to groove

Right turn left turn got the boys in both hands
Playin' in stereo like you do with most bands

Unlocking the door
I can tell you can't wait
Seekin' power rockin'
Girl you love to vibrate

Can't get to sleep 'cause I hear you squealin'
Like a stuck little pig you love the feelin'
I wish you'd shut up 'cause I'm tryin' to sleep
I'm gonna gag you gonna push it down deep

Running out of breath
You're chokin' fast
You begin to sputter
You're not gonna last

Jackhammer pounding your pile
Jackhammer you're gonna cream
Jackhammer that's your style
Jackhammer you're gonna scream

There you go again with your dirty little mind
Trying to turn me on won't happen this time
Hangin' around and that won't do
Nothing on my mind but gettin' rid of you

Time for you to leave
Can't take no more
Just want to see you
Walking out the door

You are a wandering, shining star
You light up the sky, you take me so far
(Take me far)

One crystal inside my lonely heart
You light up my life, I embrace your light
(You're my light)

You're my healer, I am lovelorn
In the cool breeze, I hear your sweet voice
I'm your treasure, I am forlorn
In the rain, I feel your warm tears

I can't forgive God and myself
I should have been there to give you strength
(Be your strength)

One kingdom below the dark blue sea
Hides my lovely Amelie
(Amelie)

You're my healer, I am lovelorn
In the cool breeze, I hear your sweet voice
I'm your treasure, I am forlorn
In the rain, I feel your warm tears

Lovelorn, you are gone
Lovelorn, lovelorn
(Lovelorn, lovelorn)

Where is your, where is your
Now you are gone
Lovelorn, lovelorn
(Lovelorn)

Where is your, where is your
Now you are gone
Lovelorn, lovelorn
(Lovelorn)

You are my healer, I am lovelorn
In the cool breeze, I hear your sweet voice
I'm your treasure, I am forlorn
In the rain, I feel your warm tears

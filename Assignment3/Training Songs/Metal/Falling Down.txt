You're always looking back,runnin' from the past
You're always sweating me about the next big heart attack
You're lookin' over your shoulder starin' down the path
(I'm fallin' down)
Fallin' down
Fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

I fear I'll find the evident so horrible
So horrible
To clear my thoughts I drill a hole into my skull
Clean up my brains and sweep them underneath the rug
I need them more than I needed any other drug
I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

Hey, hey, hey
Come on

I'm fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

It's in your head all the voices mistaken
Shake it off shake it off
We're all dyin' in the end

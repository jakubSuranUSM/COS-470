I open up my eyes and see the rain
Can I stay forever?
Dragons from the fire they call my name
It's now or never
All my fantasies behind the door
I can't wait no more
Can't you feel the heat?
I can taste your dreams
You turn and look my way
And I hear myself scream
You're my house of a thousand pleasures
House of a thousand pleasures
Let me come inside and close the door
Emotions can run wild like a little child
Like a little child
You can run and you can hide, it's not the same
'Cause it's time to play the game
I want you every night
You're my everything
When I feel you by my side
I hear myself scream
You're my house of a thousand pleasures
House of a thousand pleasures
Let me come inside and close the door
Can't you feel the heat?
I can taste your dreams
When I feel you by my side
I hear myself scream
You're my house of a thousand pleasures
House of a thousand pleasures
You're my house of a thousand pleasures
Give me your house of a thousand pleasures
I want your house of a thousand pleasures
Let me come inside and close the door

Scream, shout
Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels

We are the in between cast down as sons of war
Struck to the earth like lightning on this world we're torn

We will cause the pain of living out there, love
Take joy in who you are
We know how wings are flown

We're bored to death in heaven and down alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels

Follow the morning star
On a land when darkness failed
The passion left unholy
Now you found yourself
We have nowhere to go, no one to wish us well
A cry to find a home, our stories they will tell

We're bored to death in heavens and down the alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels

Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels
Scream, shout

We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout, whoa whoa
Too lost to see the road
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream, we shout, whoa
We are the fallen angels

We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout
Whoa, whoa
We shout
We are the fallen angels

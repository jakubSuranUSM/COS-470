Well, there's somethin' goin' down
Right here in the neighborhood
Yeah, somethin's goin' down now
Don't know if you really should
Don't you lose your head
And I'll make your heart feel good

Well, there's trouble all around
Trouble with the PTA
Tell me what you gonna do?
It's tryin' to take my highs away
It's enough to turn you 'round
But, Momma, not today

So c'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
C'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
Gonna get a good feelin'
Right down to your soul, yeah

Now your Papa's gettin' down
Momma sayin' you're no good
Oh but, baby, it's a shame
You know you never really understood
How a dose of rock 'n' roll
Can make your heart feel good

So c'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
C'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
Gonna get a good feelin'
Right down to your soul

So c'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
C'mon, little baby
Let's call it rock 'n' roll
Gonna get a good feelin'
Right down to the soul

I say, yeah, yeah, call it rock 'n' roll
I say, yeah, yeah, call it rock 'n' roll
Gonna get a good feelin'
Right down to the soul

Right down to the soul, yeah
Gonna get a good feelin'
Right down to your soul, yeah

Where to run to, where to hide, much to full to swalllow my pride
But I'm still haunted by something inside as if another part of me
has died.

Paralyzed, I close my eyes, the pain inside surrounds me.
Petrified, life fades away, at the end of my rope I'm waiting.

Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone, empty inside, out of control.
My heart a void, my empty soul, until it's filled I'll never be whole.
How did things ever get so bad, sinking empty, full of despair
I find myself alone and scared, in a world where nobody cares.

A hopeless end, afraid deep inside
Relief from my pain, the end a suicide?
The tears I've cried have left me blind
I yearb to find peace, a presence of mind.

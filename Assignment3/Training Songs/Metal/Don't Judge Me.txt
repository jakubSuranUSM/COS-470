I never cared what you said
It never mattered to me anyway
I'll rip your head off and watch you bleed
Tell it to my face. You lose. I win!
Oh!

Don't speak. Don't talk to me
Why can't you see what you cannot be?
Problems to ???
What are you supposed to be?
It's not me. I am what I am

Can you really be so sure with me?
Telling me what's going on
Sick and tired of people telling me
Who am I and what to be

Don't judge me
I've had enough
Don't judge me
Oh!

You think you're sacred
Really, you don't mean shit
The world doesn't stop
'Cause you think it will

Don't care
If you think I'm not a fuckin' star
I've gotta laugh at you
That's who you aren't

He's just another wannabe
If you can say shit and can't get too far
'Cause I think you owe me a decision
So you sell out your own side?
Now you can puke up your creation ???

Don't Judge Me
I've had enough
Don't Judge Me
I've had enough
Don't Judge Me

Drop!
Get up out and see,
Come outside and see,
Cause' I just can't get enough of everything I crave,
Where I want to be, just where I want to be.
Try to grip this with a clenched fist,
Don't know why I'm slipping.
And that smile on your face
You'll behold this nations children and we do as we please.
Cause' I just can't get enough of everything I crave,
Where I want to be, just where I want to be.
Now that I found peace inside of this world, where I want to be.
We built it brick by brick
We built it brick by brick.
So now that I found peace inside of this world, where I want to be.
Just where I want to be.
Scream till you hear us plead in fear and smile on occasion
Meantime you'll behold this nations children and we do as we please.
Cause' I just can't get enough of everything I crave,
Where I want to be, just where I want to be.
Now that I found peace inside of this world, where I want to be.
We built it brick by brick
Brick by brick.
Passion, deceit, honesty and greed these things that need to feed.
Passion, deceit, lessen disloyalty these things that need to feed.
We built it brick by brick.

The bloody history from the
Past deceased humans now forgotten.
An age of legends and fear a time now
So discant.
Less numbered as they were their lives
So primitive and pagan
Superstitions were a part of the life
So unprotected in the dark nights
Pagan fears.
The past is alive.
The past is alive.
Woeful people with pale faces
Staring obsessed at the moon
Some memories will never go away
Ant they will forever be here.

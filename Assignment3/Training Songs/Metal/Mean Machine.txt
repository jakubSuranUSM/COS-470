The only good thing that's creepin in the city
Elvis had fifty but this one's mine
Japanese cars, man, such a pity
AM radio suits me fine

Mean machine 
Mean machine
My daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin'
Mean machine 
Mean machine
Brakes are good, tires- fair
Every now and then I drive just to get away Eatin' up two lanes I gotta find Sugar Ray
Can't stop now gimme all your money

Sometimes I drive slow, sometimes I drive quick mean machine
Mean machine
My daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin' mean machine
Mean machine

My daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin'
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine 
It's long and slick and olive green 
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine
It's long and slick and olive green
Don't you dareess with my mean machine

A '68 coupe is all I need
So don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Jesus saves, Domi shoots and scores
I'm with stupid, caught my finger in the door
I'm wookin pa nub, like revenge of the nerds
But my ass it's a play on words

Mean machine 
Mean machine
My daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin' mean machine 
Mean machine
My daddy said son your gonna drive me to drinkin' don't you dare mess with my mean machine

It's long and slick and olive green  
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine
It's long and slick and olive green
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine
A '68 coupe is all I need 
So don't ya dare mess with my mean machine
Don't f*ck with it

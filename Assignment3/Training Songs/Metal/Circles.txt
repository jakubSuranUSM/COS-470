And wake up to make up what is real
Rotate your mind, state the standstill
Partake in mistakes, spin the wheel
To date medicate, so just take the pills
Prescriptions permitted 'cause he said it is
Accept these stimulants, sedatives
Legal life, this guy's high in his head
He's too low to cry, so he's laughing instead

I hear you like the tough love
Poison heals the pain
Then push turns to shove 'cause
Poison kills the pain
You could be my next buzz
Poison heals my pain
When will it be enough 'cause
Poison kills the pain

I'm just right here spinning in circles
I'm spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles

Heartbreak, my soul aches, what's the deal?
I'm not high like butterflies, what I feel?
If it's love, it's too good to be real
I would give you anything, just ask me, I will
Passion that cause infatuation
Delusions of lust, my fascination
Obsession, my new addiction
There's no telling what I'd do if you leave me again

I hear you like the tough love
Poison heals the pain
Then push turns to shove 'cause
Poison kills the pain
You could be my next buzz
Poison heals my pain
When will it be enough 'cause
Poison kills the pain

I'm just right here spinning in circles
I'm spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles

I'm just right here spinning in circles
I'm spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning in circles

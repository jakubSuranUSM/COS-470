To the wind I will sing the tale of the king
That reigned in peace and love
Of the one of the man who crossed the path
Of the ancient forest of elves

Old lands and red dragons filled his open eyes
Kings, queens and proud warriors in his magic dreams
Mystical energies led him straight there
To the lonely holy wild path

To the wind I will sing the tale of the king
That reigned in peace and love
Of the one of the man who crossed the path
Of the ancient forest of elves

Starfire burning upon the silent lake
While sleep is welcome thanks to my dear elves
Shadows are coming to take his brave soul
To bring it in the lost forgotten world

To the wind I will sing the tale of the king
That reigned in peace and love
Of the one of the man who crossed the path
Of the ancient forest of elves

And may the timespell clear his last sin
Ride on the comet to make him free
And may this brave mind endure the pain
Of cosmic evil trying to prevail

"and so a new legend begins...
The borders of space and time are broken once again
And the wise energy of cosmos calls for another hero...
There in the twilight lands of the north
Where the laments of suffering souls rise!"

To the wind I will sing the tale of the king
That reigned in peace and love
Of the one of the man who crossed the path
Of the ancient forest of elves

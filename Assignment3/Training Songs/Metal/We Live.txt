Fist cracks the earth,
Coffin womb for rebirth,
Betrayed by the living.

They soon shall be giving,
We live,
Not dead,
We live,
We kill

Can't fucking die,
Can't fucking win,
Got something to prove,
Got nothing to lose.

You hoped I was dead,
But I'm born again,
I shall be avenged,
Cold blooded revenge.

Out of my mind in a shell of black 
Imps with pitchforks poking at my sac
Heads turning backwards with psychotic eyes
Staring at me every time they pass by
Tortured tormented raw terrorfied
Mass of shitfire overdose
Hellchasms yawn wide
And belch soul death
A cut across my throat comes on soon

Mumblind locusts swarm in my cocoon
This world for me is crap pile in a heap
Tragicomedy til my final sleep
Crushfucked cavity in the
Desiccated tomb of the deathscape 
Wall of delirium shitting bricks 
Crack my bastard eyes

Black jack roulette 
Losing high and low 
She rolls the dice 
She's cold as ice 
Turn a young man old 

Comedy and tragedy 
Entertainment or death 
Like sister morphine 
Hooked on her game 
Time to place your bets 

If it wasn't for bad luck 
I'd have no luck at all 

Keep you eye on the money 
Keep you eye on the dealer's hand 
Keep you eye on the money 
Keep you eye on the lady's hand 

Queen of hearts 
Or ace of spades 
I'm dancing on the blade 
Freak show goin' broke 
The crowd screams on for more 
Electric shock won't bring ya back 
You've gone over the boards 
Can't beat the clock, the deck is stacked 
The crowd looks on in horror 

If it wasn't for bad luck 
I'd have no luck at all 

Keep your eye on the money 
Keep your eye on the dealer's hand 
Keep your eye on the money 
Keep your eye on the lady's hand

This life starts, with a heartbeat,
Is it beat-, beat-, beat-, beat-, beating me down?
I could lose who I am!
I can't help, but to see, this assistance living shit outta me,
I could lose who I am!

Every time I walk away,
Every word I never say!

Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?
Are you afraid of who you are?!

Denial, my soul will burn,
Is it burn-, burn-, burn-, burn-, burning me out?
You're feeding the flames!
Spread out the ash,
Pretend to see,
That you can still fight some day with me.
I just feed the flames.

Every time I walk away,
Every word I'd ever say!

Restless, chasing shadows,
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?

Oh my god, what am I afraid of?
This success scares the living shit out of me.
Oh my god, are you afraid of me,
And everything that breathes?

Restless, chasing shadows,
Choices, facing gallows' pole.
Are you hanging by a thread,
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars,
Are you afraid of who you are?
Afraid of who you are?

Old man Tyler had a crash in his car down on the fortune highway
Doctor said it was his cruel sick heart didn't go to church on Sunday
Oh your pace is going to knock you dead
Out of the race you got time to spare

Jerkin' Crocus is the cause of the cross you bear
Didn't you wish you were there
I know what she want
Just a lick of your ice cream cone

I know what you say
Pappas in bed well hey hey hey

When he got stuck with a hole in his head she asked to try it my way
Get down low with all that haughty jive you don't know what it's like babe
Oh oh oh it's getting down around here
I got nothing to hide I'm to tired to fear

Jerkin' Crocus didn't kill me but she sure came near
She's a nads puller
I know what she want
A judo hold on a black mans balls

I know what you think
Ease over baby going to rock that thing
Alright!
I know what she want

Just a lick of your ice cream cone
I know what you say
Pappas in bed well hey hey hey
I know what she want

A judo hold on a black mans bones
I know what you think
Ease over baby going to rock that thing
Alright!

See'mon Jerkin'
See'mon Jerkin'
I know
No no no no

Alright!
I know
That's better
No no no no

That's much better

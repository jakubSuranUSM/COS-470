There, bring your time
Say goodbye, now leave here
My fuse has expired
Fucking die, just leave here
Powerless
Stuck in your web of shame
Open your eyes
You only play yourself
Whoever's watching
I hope they catch the drift
Collect your crown
Your now the Queen of it

There, that's your life
Going down, I mean it
Loose and defiled
You define the meaning

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you

I've been scarred
Fucking repulsed by this
My only tale is one I can't stand
Now I've become torn and I rot and wilt
My heart is black and I will never fail

There, say goodbye
Just retired from here
You've been exiled
Take your body elsewhere

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breathe somewhere to someone new

Your castle is burning, down on you
Your kingdom is burning, down

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breathe somewhere to someone new

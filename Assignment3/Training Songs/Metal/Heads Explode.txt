Keep that thing in your pants
You got nothing for me no
Your sister knows how to dance
She might be more my speed yeah
She moves just like a panther baby
I'll bet you never knew

And I said
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode all night
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode

I'm a pillar of salt
You'll never be worse than me no
So get in the fucking car
We got us a world to bleed yeah
I hold all the combination's
To give you peace of mind

And I said
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode all night
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode all night 
I hold all the combination's
You know don't you know I'm always right
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode

Whisper in my ear
Your own little take on hell
We gotta get one thing clear
When we go to the citadel
And I could slide right in your moment
As long as I was in your skin

And I said
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode all night
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode all night
I hold all the combination's
You know don't you know I'm always right
This is how we go about it
To make our heads explode
Explode

Since you left I've found myself locked in another prison
But your bars and chains can't take the heart out of this man
Without you my skies are always gray
Now I'm seeing read through a different face

What did I say that hasn't been said before?
I wrote your name in blood on my prison walls
And without your contact those memories are all I have
So I can't feel alone, I'll never be alone

The chemicals aren't aligned
Now I'm struggling to find your fucking spine, I'll rip out your spine
You can take my pain but you can't have my heart
You can lock me in this cold dark cell but you can't have my heart

What did I say that hasn't been said before?
And I wrote your name in blood on my prison walls
And without your contact those memories are all I have
So I can't feel alone, I'll never be alone

Without you my skies are always gray
Now I'm seeing read through a different face
You can take my pain but you can't have my heart
You can lock me in this cold dark cell but you can't have my heart

You can take my pain but you can't have my heart
You can lock me in this cold dark cell but you can't have my heart

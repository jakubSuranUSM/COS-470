Freeze, said the man cruisin' the beat
You get your hands up and spread your feet
Don't you move an inch, I heard him say
Or you'll be doin' time until the judgment day
And he said, Don't tell me no lies, give me alibis
Cause if you cross my path, you'll be doin' life
It's a dirty lie

[Chorus]
It's a shakedown
And it's a nervous shakedown
A nervous shakedown
Another nervous shakedown
It's a shakedown
And it's a nervous shakedown
We got a shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

(It's more like a set-up)

Take a dime, said the man, you can make one call
You got a one-way ticket to the County Hall
Well, the judge looked high and I looked low
And when he smiled at me it was a one-man show
He said, Two to five, the jury decides
Double parole if you survive
It's a dirty lie

[Chorus]

Law is gonna get you this time
And throw away the key

[Chorus]

Shake you down, shake you down
And it's another shakedown
Well it's a shakedown
Another nervous shakedown
Shake you down, shake you down
And it's a nervous shakedown
It's a shakedown

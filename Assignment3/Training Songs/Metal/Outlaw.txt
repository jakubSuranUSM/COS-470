Down below the border,
He robbed a bank in Mexico.
Half crazed on tequila,
He had a, half million in gold.
There's thunder in the ground,
And he could hear the sound.

A showdown in the distance,
They're gonna ride him down.
Bet your life on the silver ball,
Spin it, 'round the wheel.

Will it land on the black or the red?
The outlaw's got no deal.
When he gambled with women,
He kept an ace up his sleeve.

He always got what he came for,
He never played it clean.
Then he was blinded by passion,
Playing a game of fools.

Thought she was lucky,
Thought she was his best bet,
Guess you find out when you lose.
Bet your life on the silver ball,

Spin it, 'round the wheel.
Will it land on the black or the red?
The outlaw's got no deal.
Bet your life on the silver ball,

Spin it, 'round the wheel.
Will it land on the black or the red?
The outlaw's got no deal.
Bet your life on the silver ball,

Spin it, 'round the wheel.
Will it land on the black or the red?
The outlaw's got no deal.
Bet your life on the silver ball,

Spin it, 'round the wheel.
Will it land on the black or the red?
The outlaw's got no deal.

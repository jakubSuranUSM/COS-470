Every
Single thing I believed in
I knew I could not win
Without you I thought that I

Would fail
But in us
I thought we had trust
A passion; a lust

To make everything
Work out
Bide our time
It'll work out fine

We will cross that line
As soon as we
Get there
Do nothing

Say nothing
Be nothing
It's taking away my
Pain

I have
Many things that I regret
But I'll take what I can get
Even though I know it might

Break me
Web of lies
Hides the truth inside
Right behind your eyes

I wish I knew how
You felt
Can't ignore
What I've heard before

Lunatic no more
I listened and said
Nothing
Do nothing

Say nothing
Be nothing
It's taking away my
Pain

Even without you, I feel it
Taking away my
Realize
Realize what is right and what is wrong

So you
Want to walk on that fine line
'Cause I think it's about time
To show you exactly what

I mean
Believe it
You'll accomplish it
It's the love of it

That will get you through
The day
Have to try
'Cause you'll wonder why

Is it worth the time?
All you have to do
Believe
In everything

Do nothing
Be nothing
It's taking away my
Pain

Even without you, I feel it
Taking away my
What is right and what is wrong

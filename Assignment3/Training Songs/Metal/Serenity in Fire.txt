Where is this paradise?
This heaven you call my life!
Don't test my patience
Just to give it one more chance
To believe that destiny could change
To believe that I can tame this rage
I'm lost inside this world
I'm lost inside myself

No more, resistance. No more, truthful essence
No more, substance. No more, meaningful lessons

Don't try to justify the life you crucified
All the lies are written in the skies
I'm immortal but ready to die!

Watch the angels fall, they drop tears of blood
I think my life is fading away. Yes, I'm swept away

Serenity in fire

My heart one with the dark, my soul trapped and gridlocked

Serenity in fire

Spread your wings, as I strike them down!
I'll strike them down!!

I'm lost inside this world, I'm lost inside myself
No one can change this world. You made hell

No more, resistance
No more, truthful essence
No more, substance
No more, meaningful lessons

Don't try to justify the life you crucified
All the lies are written in the skies
I'm immortal but ready to die!

I'll strike you down!

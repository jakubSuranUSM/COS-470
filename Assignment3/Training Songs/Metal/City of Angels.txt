City of lights
From way up here I gaze in wonder
Children of night
I hear you rolling like thunder

I see the motion of a thousand restless souls before me
Cause I am lost
I can't control the actions of my gypsy heart
Lost in the City of Angels
(I am not lost)

(I am not lost)
(I am not lost)
I was not born to be a slave
I cannot be a part of that
A new religion on my hands and knees for you
And baby looks alright
She says she's alright
My baby says she's getting through

Yeah, she feels alright
Cause I am lost
(I am not lost)
(I am not lost)
Lost in the City of Angels
(I am not lost)
We are like moths drawn to a flame

We are like moths drawn to a flame
You are our inspiration

**guitar solo**

City of lights
From way up here I gaze in wonder
Children of night
I hear you rolling like thunder
I see the motion of a thousand restless souls before me
I can't control the actions of my gypsy heart

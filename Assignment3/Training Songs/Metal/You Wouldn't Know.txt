You couldn't be, you couldn't be me even if you wanted to
Everything I've been through
Live your life, soaking up all my sunshine
And smile your whole life
I wouldn't know

Eighteen wheels are rolling
Eighteen wheels are crushing
Me down
Running me down
Cars are crashing
Cars are crashing all around me
Running me down

All my days are numbered
All my days are gray
All my skies are covered
All my ends are frayed

[Chorus:]
You couldn't be, you couldn't be me even if you wanted to
Everything I've been through, you wouldn't know
Live your life, soaking up all my sunshine
And smile your whole life
I wouldn't know

Lightning's crashing
Thunder's rolling all around me
Bringing me down
Stars are falling
Fires lighting all around me
Burning me down

All my days are numbered
All my days are gray
All my skies are covered
All my ends are frayed

[Chorus]

Feels like I'm falling down
Inside a fever rising
Buried my life deep in the ground
Left my existence lying, so let's go

You couldn't be, you couldn't be me even if you wanted to
Everything I've been through
Live your life, soaking up all my sunshine
And smile your whole life
I wouldn't know

This barren earth defiled by man
Raped & tortured, yeah whatever man
Hatred, greed & misery
Is this to be, our foul destiny?
I wanna scream but I'm sick, this world inherited by the weak
But I don't care what you say all the flowers turned to black and died anyway...
It's Time To Die
Wake up baby it's time to die
Wake up children it's time to die, no more time to cry
This world is dead, seek your own way
I've a gun named Oblivion that'll take all the pain away
All our pain away...Yeah

It's Time To Die
We're all shadows in the darkness

Wake up baby it's time to die, I said
Wake the children it's Time To Die
It's time to die...DIE!!

Maybe I'm already dead.......
We're all shadows in the darkness

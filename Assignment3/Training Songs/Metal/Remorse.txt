Does it even matter what I've said
Too much in the past to forget
Does it even matter what I feel
(pause)
Does it even matter what I've done
Pushed you out of the harms way
Does it even matter
Does it even matter

Same way that you've burned
I feel the fire in my words
The soon forgotten words of deceit

Now you feel like the one who was left alone in the sun

Does it even matter what I've said
To ease your one regret
Does it even matter
How your lives shatter

Same way that you've yearned
I feel the mourning in my words
The soon forgotten words of deceit

Now you feel like the one who was left in the sun to see all the light behind the shadow
And you know that the whole world can see when you dry your heartless tears of remorse

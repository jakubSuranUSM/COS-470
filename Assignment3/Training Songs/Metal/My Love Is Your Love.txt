If you should go
It will break my heart I know baby
Just come around
Love can't be found by fooling round so maybe
Love is getting stronger
Just can't wait much longer

[Chorus]
My love is your love
Your love is my love
Sharing, caring everyday
My love is your love
Your love is my love
We can stay in love this way

Hearing your name
Just turns my heart to flame now darling
Why don't you come?
I'm standing here
I'm yours may dear
Oh how can I get to you?
You know I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]

Break

Love is getting strong
Just can't wait much longer

[Chorus: Repeat to fade]

Easily, easily,
I'm losing all my fantasy, fantasy
Living like a prisoner
Exilia Just waiting for
The sweet execution

Close to me and close to you
Nobody Everybody got to prove, got to prove
We can kill without excuse, we make the rules
Songtexte The sweet execution

Nobody, nobody, nobody, no one's excluded
I feel irrational
Songtext I feel irrational
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no one's excluded
I feel irrational
Lyrics I feel irrational

Vanity, activity,
Covered up in all the fur, all the fur
Lyric Lady, you ignore the truth
Behind the truth
The sweet execution
Liedertexte
I see you and you see me
What are we supposed to be, supposed to be
Liedertext Living in a place under a death sentence
Like a sweet execution

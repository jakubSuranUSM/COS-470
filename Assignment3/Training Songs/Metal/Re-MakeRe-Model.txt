I tried but I could not find a way
Looking back all I did was look away
Next time is the best time we all know
But if there is no next time where did I go?
She's the sweetest queen I've ever seen
See here she comes see what I mean
I could talk talk talk talk myself to death
But I believe I would only waste my breath
Ooh show me

There are stories told, nobody wants to believe it
There are reports, with facts that it must be true
Something flew out from the clouds
And it smoked and smoked and sparked in silver blue

A few humans disappeared
Chaos reigns and there is fear

There is hate, in the eye of an eagle
There is lust, in the eye of an eagle

Lightning struck on the wings of chrome
Headlights radiated, searching for more
As quick as they appeared they crushed away
Laser shots out of the hemisphere

Eye, witness told us of steel eagles
We will never know, or should we believe it

There is hate, in the eye of an eagle
There is lust, in the eye of an eagle

A few humans disappeared
Chaos reigns and there is fear

There is hate, in the eye of an eagle
There is lust, in the eye of an eagle
There is hate and there is lust
There's a sign out of the dust
In the eye of an eagle

You love me, you lift me
But I'm letting you down
We're holding, scolding
Repenting, resenting
We go around and around
I'm fumin', I'm human

You make me smile
When it's said and done

You trust me, you doubt me
They hear us all over town
We're dreamin', screamin'
Reflecting, rejecting
And we don't make a sound
We're talkin', I'm walkin'

You make me smile
When it's said and done

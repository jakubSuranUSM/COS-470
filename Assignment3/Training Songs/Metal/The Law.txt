Do what thou will shall
be whole of the law
(Aleister Crowley, Liber Oz)
fires are burning inside
and you barely stand on
two feet
there's scars arranged all
over you
I'm governing my needs
I hear an ego bleeding
resounding hints of false
intrepidity
I'm in progression while
you regress in idolatry
[chorus:]
I'm reading what I want to
read
you read what you're
expected to
i'm thinking what I want
to think
as your mind denies the
truth
conscience and sin
disappear
conscience was
concocted
while sin was never here
I don't need your systems
I don't need your
elections
I don't need your deities
to purge me
what's so wrong with
craving
satisfy instinct
homo sapiens, you want to
shit, eat, f*ck and sleep
it's law vs. law
I want to run through
the streets, with my
genitals bouncing free
but your law dressed in
blue takes me away
'cause I'm hung better
and if I'm not, he'd be too
scared to prove it
that proof is all that
speaks
it's gonna infiltrate your
sectors
and the young adults
that you've failed to raise
already know the score
and in a solid blow
we will crush religion
and politics
[repeat chorus]

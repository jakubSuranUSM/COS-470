What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will be alright

I'm going up, and I'm going down
I'm going fly from side to side
There are problems in this town
There is a nightmare all night
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will be alright
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will work alright

Here are we go again, make me fool again
Here are we go again, after the hurricane
One minute up, one minute down
How many up and how many down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will be alright
Baby, be good, do what you should 
You know it will work alright

Here are we go again, what happen to you, my friend
Here are we go again, what happen to all my friend
How does it feel to be in love
How does it feel to be in love
How does it feel to be in love
How does it feel to be in love

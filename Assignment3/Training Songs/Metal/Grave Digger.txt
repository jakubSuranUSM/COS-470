Six feet under I'm still alive
Six feet under I've found my paradise
When I left, the skies were sober
I took this shrine last October

In this house of gloom and glory
I'm living now and tell my story
I've sold my soul, I've lived a lie
Come and hear my silent cry.

In the silence of the night
Where I shiver with affright
I reflect these wasted years
When I played with hopes and fears.

[Chorus]
He took my life, I've lost control
He killed my wife, he sold my soul
The grave is open, the digger smiles
He takes me under, the deadly skies
The grave digger.

I'm shouting, crying, I feel the pain
I'm shouting, dying, I'm nameless brain
The chains of lies, no chance for heaven
All my sins are unforgiven

From time to time I'm going insane
I feel the hunger in my veins
To kill this nightmare in my head
And to save me from the dead

In the silence of the night
Where I shiver with affright
I reflect these wasted years
When I played with hopes and fears.

[Chorus]
He took my life, I've lost control
He killed my wife, he sold my soul
The grave is open, the digger smiles
He takes me under, the deadly skies
The grave digger, the grave digger..

From time to time I'm going insane
I feel the hunger in my veins
To kill this nightmare in my head
And to save me from the dead

"When the weapons are stronger
Than their masters"

There will come a day
When all are killed
A fate that we all share
A prophecy of doom fulfilled
With no-one left to care
A weapon that should not be used
Because there's no control
A plague ensures that both sides lose
A monster with no soul

It reaches out in the night
Preying on its victims
No way to survive
You'll die of the plague

A hell that now has come to earth
Where must the blame now lie
A government that sponsors death
A science against life
They claim to protect us from harm
I say that they all lie
They claim for peace we must be armed
With weapons they devise

It reaches out in the night
Preying on its victims
No way to survive

Now there are but a few left
To live amog the dead
They survived while most men died
Including those who led
A virus can't discriminate
It kills all it infects
And for those who have survived
There isn't much now left

It reaches out in the night
Preying on its victims
No way to survive
You'll die of the plague

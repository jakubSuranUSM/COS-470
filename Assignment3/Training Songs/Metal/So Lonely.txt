So far away 
You've been gone all the while
I'm feeling lonely like a homeless child
This clown pretends
Everything's all right
While his heart is breakin' inside

So lonely, so lonely for you
Oh baby, Oh baby
I'm so lonely
What can I do
I'm trapped
I'm livin' without you

You're all that I have
I can't leave you behind
The touch of your love
Oh it burns me inside
I should break away
But I've nowhere to run
I'm trapped
I'm livin' without you

Love gone wrong
Love gone blind
Tears may flow
Till the end of time
Can't let go 
To what I left behind
I've awaited too long

So lonely, so lonely for you
Oh baby, Oh baby
I'm so lonely
What can I do
I'm trapped
I'm livin' without you

I crashed in the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted and my girl in Lover's Lane

Meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby, just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cookin' me
Ooga booga, lemme outta here!

Meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle

I jumped out of the pot, I finally got away
I was frantic, worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
My chance of surviving was gettin' slim
So I thumbed down a whale that was headed my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
When I got to Lover's Lane I was almost dead
Heard him talkin' to my baby, and this is what he said

Baby, baby, the man's no good
Baby, baby, should have understood
You can trust me just as long as you please
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you (I love you, I love you, you're fine baby)
Cause I love you (So damn fine)
Cause I love you (I got a job; I have money too)
Cause I love you (Did I show you my vehicle)
Cause I love you (I'll take you for a ride)
Cause I love you

Spinning twisting in my hand
I hold the key to this wasteland
I've been searching it for you
Don't try to run 
Don't hide away
There is no hope you can't escape

I see your smile fade away 
Your bright blue sky has turned to gray
Tonight 
Unlock the door 
Close your eyes
And meet your fate

Here in this spiralling darkness 
Where my pleasure is your pain 
Fear wraps it's arms around you
Here in this spiralling darkness 
Where my pleasure is your pain
Here is where I reign

It feels so good 
This feels so right 
That you should be my sacrifice
Don't try to run
Don't hide away 
There is no hope you can't be saved

Here, in this spiralling darkness 
Where my pleasure is your pain 
Fear wraps it's arms around you
Here in this spiralling darkness 
Where my pleasure is your pain
Here is where I reign

Here in this spiralling darkness 
Where my pleasure is your pain

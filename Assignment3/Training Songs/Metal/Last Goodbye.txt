Crime is done, I'm alone in the night.
There's no one to save, and there's no one to fight,
Now you're gone and I'm just looking around,
Chasin' shadows and traces in the sky, on the ground.

I pay for the miracle,
Father, don't take him away.
Rise up for a miracle,
Save him or don't let me stay

Such a shame now you're out of my reach,
And it hurts, I don't know should I curse, should I preach?
Play the game put a gun to your head,
Smile - give me a shot pull the trigger you're dead

Goin' down, you're goin' down all the way,
Down the needle park.
Goin' down, you're goin' down like a little child,
Lost in the dark

Last, last goodbye you'll take yours and I'll take mine.
Dance around candle like a butterfly,
Can you tell me why?
Last, last goodbye bitter as the silent cry,
Blowin' out the chance to do a second try,
Just another try

Day by day, crossin' oceans of pain,
God I wish I could stop this old runaway train.
Far away like a shadow, a ghost,
Now the magic is gone and the spirit is lost

Goin' down, you're goin' down all the way,
Down the needle park.
Goin' down, you're goin' down like a little child,
Lost in the dark

Last, last goodbye you'll take yours and I'll take mine.
Dance around candle like a butterfly,
Can you tell me why?
Last, last goodbye bitter as the silent cry,
Blowin' out the chance to do a second try,
Just another try

I'm gonna take a ride on a magic carpet, gonna fly back to you
I'm traveling in time through black and stormy skies
My mission is a mystery, I'm recreating history
I'm following the stars across the misty hills and the sea
Its a long way into your heart, when a million miles keep us apart
I'm on the edge of ecstasy, my carpet is my dream mobile
I do it over, do it over, do it over, one more time
And I make it better, make it better, make it better, day by day
When the paradise is burning, the heaven comes tumbling down...on me
My carpet is my dream mobile, it takes me away, takes me away
No one's seen what I have seen and no ones been where I have been
I do it over, do it over, do it over, one more time
And I make it better, make it better, make it better, day by day
Magic carpet ride, magic carpet ride, magic carpet ride
I do it over, do it over, do it over, one more time
And I make it better, make it better, make it better, day by day
Magic carpet ride, magic carpet ride
I'm on a magic carpet ride, magic carpet ride, magic carpet ride
I fly, I fly, I fly far away

Turn down the bedroom lights
And warm my soul
Let all your inhibitions go we'll reach the kinda heights
That we've never known.
Laid back and easy take it slow-slow-slow
But wait
Are your intentions what you think they are?
Well if so
Then won't you hand me back the keys to my car.

Well I guess I never knew I bit off more than I could chew
When you handed me the apple I should have said "no" to you
Oh Mama Mama Mama well I guess you always knew
That I bit off
I bit off
I bit off
I bit off
More than I could chew.

Come closer Baiby let your soul relax
We're old enough to face the facts
Get off the rails and let your train get on my tracks
Wait a minute is that the way you always act
Oh I've met your kind before I know
I know your game
You didn't even take the time to ask my name.

Well I gues I never knew I bit off more than I courd chew.
I bit Off
I bit Off
I bit Off
I bit Off

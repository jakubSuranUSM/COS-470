I, pass them by
'Til all their pain subsides
As the lamb
Lays by your side
The last season is upon
Tough to deal with a real hard case
Make no mistake
No bones about it
Never fit in but I've found my place.

Going in dirty as pigs
Sacred secrets of the sorrow-bound
Going in dirty as pigs
Watching as it comes unwound

You make me sick

Irreverent and full of wants
Shaking at the foundation
Gone again but not gone for good
Living is sedation
Think so little of yourself
To think of no one else
Hope not one tells
Make no mistake
No bones about it
Never fit in but I've found my place

With everything you do, with everything you are
Everything you say, you take it too far
You make me sick, you make me sick

This sour taste remains
This sour taste remains
Disdain, disdain, disdain
Sick

Your actions speak louder than words
All I do is throw the curse
I'll burn it down before it turns black
There's no solution so I'm on the attack.

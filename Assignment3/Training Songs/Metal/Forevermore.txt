Threads of life, they start to tear
Hang above the pit of our despair
It seems the end is growing near
The life you knew will disappear

Every human life will overlap and intertwine
Create the fabric and the destiny of all mankind
Start the fires 'till they surround
They start the fires burning until they surround

Is there nothing left, nothing left worth fighting for, fighting for?
Forevermore, beneath the waterline
Sinking further down, I dwell in silence now

Awake and face the truth of all that you have lost
A tongue-tied explanation raining down from scattered thoughts
Start the fires 'till they surround
They reinforce their doubts until they draw blood

Is there nothing left, nothing left worth fighting for, fighting for?
Forevermore, beneath the waterline
Sinking further down, I dwell in silence now
Forevermore, I will leave this world behind
Finally I drown, I dwell in silence now

Threads of life, they start to tear
Hang above the pit of our despair
It seems the end is growing near
The life you knew will disappear

Forevermore, beneath the waterline
Sinking further down, I dwell in silence now
Forevermore, I will leave this world behind
Finally I drown, I dwell in silence now

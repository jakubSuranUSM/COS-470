Welcome to your eternal nightmare
My child, there is no other way
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be
Closed eyes, but you can not erase
Every sight you never wanted to see
Everything you never wanted to be (to be)

Welcome to your eternal nightmare
Welcome to your eternal nightmare

Come with me
Weâ€™ll sink into the soil, beside the maggots
All we need
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static
Now I can see all the misery
I can feel the night closing in on me, closing in on me
Now I can see all the misery
Under my blood red veil in darkness we shall lay

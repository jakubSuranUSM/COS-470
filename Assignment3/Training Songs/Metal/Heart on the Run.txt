Now you know you cannot stay
For you made up your mind
To go the stony long way
Change you must I hear you say
Did you learn how to fight
To make your way through these days
And now you pray
For a miracle to come
Now you say
Take me to the promised land
Heart on the run
Alone in the night
You're trying to find
Some shelter from pain
Heart on the run
How can you survive
As long as you won't face the truth
You will cry in vain
Started out not to return
It's a long way to go
When there's a lesson to learn
So don't you pray
For a miracle to come
Say you will
And meet me in the promised land
Heart on the run
Alone in the night
Just trying to find
Some shelter from pain
Heart on the run
Sure you will survive
As long as you will face the truth
You don't cry in vain
[repeat bridge and chorus]

What unknown face now breaks the silence? 
What tipping force disturbs the balance? 
Swift and sober, comes a voice, offering a bitter choice 
Take up a crime and serve the sentence, offer up a final penance 
Or dismantle colossus from deep inside, conspirators, 
and those allied 
Gifts of bronze, iron, obsidian, from nave to chop, 
plunged and hidden 
Deep in the chests of those who cry, the songs of gods untrue 
The prayers to start or end the coup, forever silenced 

Like sulfur set to fire, blue flame is born 
To rip through homes and cleanse the town 
A new world rendered, an old world mourned 
The old world left to drown 
It draws closer with every step, push off with both feet 
Fall into the chasm, which will consume all 
March not to the drum, but off the beat 
Burst into the evening, cool air burns the lungs 
Fear not the turning heads, the darting glances, the lashing tongues 

The glowing eyes that burn like embers, fall painful on the skin 
Seething with hatred, and writhing in pain, they cast a ghastly grin 
Yet among the faces shrouded in horror, one truth prevails 
All whoâ€™ve ever come this far exclusively have failed 
Reach for the hand whose grasp is firm, 
Whose blistered palms can confirm, 
A kinship in a spiteful place, 
with tender touch a warm embrace 
Though nights turn long and cold, and the warmth of the day escapes 
The long dark shadows growing old, form familiar shapes

You're just like the kid next door
Still too young and immature
You always seem to hang around
When you're not wanted you're always found

Why do you embarrass me
So everyone can see
Us duke it out on live TV

Hey Rocky I hate to say
I wish you would just go away
Don't come back another day OK

What did you come here for
Don't want to be insecure
It's about time that you went home
So go away leave me alone

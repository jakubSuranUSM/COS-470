You can tell it to my face, but I will never know what you mean
Silence triggers the adrenaline, some things are never meant to be seen

Steel plate nailed into the corner, 
Be sure that people know what it means
The room is empty yet so full of lives,
Not everything is what it seems

Hesitating or speeding,
It's all just a bleeding way to be
Heading down the same old road, 
That'll lead you to the place I see

I've been there

Do you see
Do you see me
Do you see what I mean
Be sure that...

The sun never shines
Behind door 2.12
It gotta be cold 
Behind door 2.12

Eyes closed, everything's at ease,
I get to go where no one goes when alive
If you'd seen the things I've seen, 
You'd know that there's no way to survive

The sun never shines
Behind door 2.12
It gotta be cold
Behind door 2.12

This is peace of mind
Behind door 2.12
I feel so cold
Behind door 2.12

Do you see
Do you see me
Do you see what I mean

The sun never shines
Behind door 2.12
It gotta be cold
Behind door 2.12

This is peace of mind
Behind door 2.12
I feel so cold
Behind door 2.12

MY FACE IS COVERED WITH BLOOD
THERE'S NOTHING BUT PAIN
Oitsumerareta keraku ni

I CAN'T TELL WHERE I'M GOING TO
I'M RUNNING, ALL CONFUSED
Shinimono-gurui de

THEN I SEE YOU STANDING THERE
CAN DO NOTHING BUT RUN AWAY
Oikakete kuru genkaku ni

LOOK OUT! I'M RAVING MAD
YOU CAN'T STOP MY MADNESS
Kirikizanda yume wa kyouki ni nagareru

(I'LL SLICE MY FACE COVERED WITH BLUE BLOOD)
(GIVE ME SOME MORE PAIN)
(GIVE ME THE THROES OF DEATH)

Namida ni tokeru aoi chi o yokubou ni kaete
Umarekawatta sugata o yosoutte might mo

Kodoku ni obieru kokoro wa ima mo
Sugisatta yume o motome-samayou

Higeki ni odoru kanashimi o maboroshi ni kaete
Sameta sugata no butai o enjite might mo

Hitomi ni afureru kyozou wa ima mo
Nugisuteta ai o azayaka ni utsusu

(GIVE ME SOME MORE PAIN)
(GIVE ME THE THROES OF DEATH)

Wasurerarenai kanashimi o maboroshi ni kaete
Umarekawatta sugata o yosotte might mo

Aoi namida wa higeki ni odoru kodoku no
Kokoro o ima demo nurashi-tsuzukeru

(English version)
------------------------------------
My face is covered with blood. 
There's nothing but pain, 
Passing closest to pleasure. 

I can't tell where I'm going to. 
I'm running all confused. 
Death himself is coming. 

Then I see you standing there, 
Can do nothing but run away. 
Following you in my dream. 

Look out! I'm raving mad. 
You can't stop my sadness.
The first dream is beginning to flow.

(I'll slice my face, covered with blue blood.)
(Give me some more pain.) 
(Give me throws of death.) 

Tears melt in blue blood. 
A blurry, reincarnate

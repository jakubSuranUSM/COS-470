High noon and I'd sell my soul for water
Three days lost in this burning hell
I beg you, master, baa, help me

I went to find the gate of shammash
Eager to seek out the forbidden laws
We all have them deep deep, inside

I know you've felt them, no need to lie
Summon them and look into my eyes
I seek the gift of all gifts
Fornever laid to rest, to explore what's behind
Banished from this earth
Fornever laid to rest, invoking the sign

Entering the lost temple in the sand
Voices call my name and guide my hand
Ghosts, ghouls and demons
Quietly watch nearby

Silence, hold your tongue
The ritual has begun
Light the candles, cleanse your mind
Feel the presence, the all seeing eye

Float from the ground
This unholy mound
Levitize slowly, above the circle round
Repeat the words, no more denial
I'm selling my soul to the consuming flames

My tattooed face reveals my fate
The blasphemous selling of souls
I now wear the burning signs

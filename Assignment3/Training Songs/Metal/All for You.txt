You take your orders from the queen of insanity
But the contract said it was you and me
I sacrificed family, my children and my soul
To give you what you wanted, complete control

You tried to kill the love and to isolate
But then you turn around, like it's not too late
You justify your actions, forget what you have done
But no more blackmail and no more fun
Day in, day out negativity
Beat me down with your own family
Your bloodline runs in a world of hate
Of dirty white lies and to dominate

Lonely people just trying to find their way
Looking for something, but this is the price I pay
You thought I was stupid, you thought I was blind
You had me by the balls but your well ran dry
You took it all for granted and tried to bring me down
But look at what you've done, take a good look around

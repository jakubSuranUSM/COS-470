The Dual Substance Of Christ 
The Yearning So Human 
Of Man To Attain God 
Has Always Been A Deep 

Inscrutable Mystery To Me 
My Principle Anguish And Source 
Of All My Joys And Sorrows 

Religion Domain Is All I See 
Suffocate The Scum With Mediocrity 
Lying And Changing Your Fate 
Anno Domini Ends - Misery 

From My Youth Onward 
Has Been The Incessant 
Merciless Battle Between 
The Spirit And The Flesh 
And My Soul Is The Arena 
Where These Two Armies 
Have Clashed And Met 

Holy Wars Unleashing Bloody Raids 
The Sacred Earth Without A Face 
Consumed By Murderous Sinners 
Psychotic Leader 
Insane-Insane-Insane-Insane! 

Living In A Dying Age 
Persecute The Human Race 
Triumph Of Death In The Wasteland 
Blood Signs Your Epitaph 

Religion Domain Is All I See 
Suffocate The Scum With Mediocrity 
Lying And Changing Your Fate 
Anno Domini Ends - Misery

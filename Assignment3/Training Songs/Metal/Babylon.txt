See'mon boys
When I woke up this morning
Boys I was gone
My girlfriend asked me
Where do I come from
Put my face up in the mirror
Just to clock my where's
First thing I know I gotta get outta here

[Chorus]
(On back to) Babylon
(I gotta get away, to) Babylon
(So I can't stay) Babylon
(Cause it's too much fun) Babylon

I gotta run, I can't look back
I gotta get back, I get down to Babylon
(I'm going to Babylon)

I was driving you tonight
And boys I was gone
The coppers asked me
Where do I come from
One looks at my cards
One checks my id
With this junk on my face
It's easy to see

[Chorus]

I gotta run, I can't look back
I gotta get back, I get down
I gotta get around to Babylon

Let's go to Babylon boys
Two girls for every boy

Well a Babylon girl ain't got no past
The Babylon girl got's to talk so fast
The Babylon men gonna be a boy
With the Babylon girl out looking for a joy
(In) Babylon
(I gotta get away, to) Babylon
(Begging I can't stay) Babylon
(Having to much fun) Babylon

I gotta run, I can't look back
I gotta get back, I get down
I won't be safe, child nobody's safe til they're in Babylon
(I'm going to Babylon)

She's been massaging all day but she's thinking 'bout you daddy
Thinking bout you daddy til they all go away
And when she up there dancing she's just trying make a buck
Trying make some money gonna give you all a look

[Chorus: x2]

I gotta run, I can't look back
I gotta get back, I get down
I won't be safe, I won't be free, til I hit babylon
(I'm going to Babylon)

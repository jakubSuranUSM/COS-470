Streets dawn with empty light.
Bullets clutter the sidewalk.
The gun trembles in a young man's hand.
The mother visits a grave site.

They ask why we suffer.
Oh God please answer.
Rivers run, mountains peak.
We all remain scared.

I try to remember
You and me together.
Rivers run, mountains peak.
We all remain scared.

It's so abrupt,
The life designed for us.
Reach out, end fear.
Reach out, end fear.

They ask why we suffer.
Oh God please answer.
Rivers run, mountains peak.
We remain scared.

The city mourns another loss.
But we'll pray forever.
Rivers run, mountains peak.
I know You're there.

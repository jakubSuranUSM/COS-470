Conceiving nothing
A precious life with bad intentions
At first it had to breathe
Evolved to gasoline
A strictly diesel-minded soul proves to

Grow and steal
When you try to make us fall, you're starting the machine
Grow and steal
Starting the machine with my scars

You try to direct my sight

Involving something
A greedy world with biased minds
A past repeats itself
We vent until it swells
A strictly diesel-minded soul proves to

Grow and steal
When you try to make us fall, you're starting the machine
Grow and steal
Starting the machine with my scars

You try to direct my sight

Grow and steal
When you try to make us fall, you're starting the machine
Grow and steal
Starting the machine with my scars

You try to direct my sight

Lately I've been thinking that I'm not the one to play this part
'Cause every sweet word that I write could never fix their hearts

I can't help but think
That someone else is living my dream
Because this means so much to me
Am I the man that you want
Or the man that I'm supposed to be?

Am I the man I'm supposed to be
Or did they get the whole thing wrong?
These days I wish I never wrote a single song
For you to sing along
I'm just so scared to find I'm wrong
'Cause I've chased these dreams for way too long

I let the hate of the world fill my head with doubt
I wont let their voices drown me out

You are the reason, I do this for you not myself

Am I the man I'm supposed to be
Or did they get the whole thing wrong?
These days I wish I never wrote a single song
For you to sing along
I'm just so scared to find I'm wrong
'Cause I've chased these dreams for way too long

When you want me to fail
And stand in my way
I'll use your hate to fuel my rage

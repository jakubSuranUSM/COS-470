Steely eyes of a silvery people
Walk behind me, with evil intent.
Up to the tower, I stand alone
Stripped of rank before a throne I am sent.

What befalls us in the heat of the night?
What befalls us in the heat of the night?

Before long, behind adamantine doors,
I taste of the wine of their joy.
Through delirium of a tortured mind
Her face gave me strength to this day.

What befalls us in the heat of the night?
What befalls us in the heat of the night?
In the heat of the night

But love deceived me, and in my despair
I recalled the ring once again
Born of Sorrow my cunning revives me,
And I took them with me enchained

What befalls us in the heat of the night?
What befalls us in the heat of the night?
In the heat of the night

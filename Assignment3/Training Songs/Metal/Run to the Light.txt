Cross over children, to the other side
Lost little children run to the light
Look at all the lonely people
All I see is despair
And your lost in confusion
Run to the light
Why do you love the darkness
How can you see where you are going
Look at all the lonely people
All I see is despair
And they're lost in confusion

My soul is troubled
I'm afraid of the darkness
Afraid of myself
And sometimes, I don't know where I'm going
But when I die, I know I will find. my way
In the light, is our salvation
Pain is just a memory
In the light, you will find the truth
All the answers, (or chose who want to know
We all know, what it's like
Feeling like you can't go on, I can't go on
And sometimes, I don't know where I'm going
But when I die. I know I'll Find, my way

In the light, is our salvation
Pain is just a memory
In the light, you will find the truth
All the answers, for those who want to know
I want to know

Cross over children, to the other side
Lost little children run to the light
Look at all the lonely people
All I see is despair
And we're lost in confusion

All are welcome, on the other side
Run to the light

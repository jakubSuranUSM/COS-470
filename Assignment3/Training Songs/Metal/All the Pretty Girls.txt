Shocked and startled by some peculiar twist of fate
Don't know how it happened, but I'm punching above my weight
I'm pinching myself, you're nothing like the girls I usually get
Everyone assumes I bought you off the internet

(All the pretty girls) Like me for who I am
(All the pretty girls) When the record goes platinum
Plenty of action, massive attraction
When you're selling out stadiums
(All the pretty girls)
And their ma-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mums

Look mama, I'm dancing with the purtiest girl on the floor
Everybody wonders what she wants to be with me for
Girls in my orbit, I've got my own gravitational pull
Flashing my pinewood smile like a red rag to a bull

(All the pretty girls) Like me for who I am
(All the pretty girls) When the record goes platinum
Plenty of action, massive attraction
When you're selling out stadiums
(All the pretty girls)
And their ma-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mums

(All the pretty girls) Like me for who I am
(All the pretty girls) When the record goes platinum
Plenty of action, massive attraction
When you're selling out stadiums
(All the pretty girls)
And their ma-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mums

Pretty, pretty girls
And their mu-mu-mu-mu-mommies
Pretty, pretty girls
And their mu-mu-mu-mu-moms
Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-moms
Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-moms
Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-moms

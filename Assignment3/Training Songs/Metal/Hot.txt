Some girls try to compete with me
Lifestyle, that's what I used to be
Had to have everything I wanted
And have it my way
Step back, and take a good look at me
I'm more than what you claim me to be
Gimme some time, and I can tell you what I know

Did you learn a thing?
Gotta be a leader, can't be a crowd pleaser
Would you do it again?
Not the same way, got too much to say
Can you make it raw?
I did it before, I can do it once more
Take it to the floor
Ain't a thing to me 'cause, baby, don't you know I'm
I'm hot

Ain't nobody gonna get what I got
Taking hold of the game, why not?
Tell me, can you handle it?
I'm a hot girl; you need a hot girl
So hot
Raising the pressure when I blow up this spot
Keep it tight, wanna see what you got
Tell me, can you work with it?

I'm a hot girl; you need a hot girl
All my hot girls who need a hot boy say: "uh-oh, uh-oh"
All my hot boys who need a hot girl say: "uh-oh, uh-oh"

Sometimes, I just can't help myself
So fly, gotta express myself
I can be more than just a girl
I'm better than you know
I'm the lock to fit with your key
And I'll be greater than fantasy
Ain't no stoppin' when I've started, no

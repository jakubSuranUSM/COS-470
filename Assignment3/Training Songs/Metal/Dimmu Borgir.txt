Forces of the northern lights, assemble
Forces of the northern nights, call to arms
Summoned by the secrets of sacrifice

Meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it
As we only compete with ourselves
Left is that of a confident union

What bridge to cross and what bridge to burn
Deceit is everywhere you turn
We weed out the weak and they weep

Evolving, compulsively
Behaving, inconsistently
Yet the pulse is pounding
Restoration is the name
For those who are left in the game
Invocation in the name of our flame
(Of our flame)

Dimmu borgir!
The deviants seek but one place
Dimmu borgir!
Forward, onward, march!

Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
With trickery and treats
Enemies will face defeats

No place for dreamers
As our formation is lava
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns

Constant retribution calling
From the shadows of three consecutive sixes
Merging with the cold dark vacuum
Talent is worthless unless exercised

When the world is turning
You'll find your true nature
When the first is last and the last is first
You'll be where you choose to be

Forgive we shall not
Forget we shall not
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns

Only the Gods know
They're looking right through you
Straight into the eyes of a dead man
There isn't enough hours in the day

What will be seen
When your world comes crashing down?
Staring in the eyes of a gone man
No more fuckin' time left on your side, on you side

All of your hopes and dreams, don't mean shit
All that's left is now to nowhere
I believe do anything at all costs
You must believe not all who wander are lost

Tied to the tree of woe, so woe to you
In front of the man with the dead eyes
With a choir of faith, there's still hell to pay

Not enough hours in the day
Hell of patience to be paid
So who's left to wonder?
In the wake of destruction, get made

All of your hopes and dreams, never meant shit
All that's left is now to nowhere, no
I believe do anything at all costs
You must believe not all who wander are lost, what?

Something, somewhere, injects the eye
Texas nights defines the sky

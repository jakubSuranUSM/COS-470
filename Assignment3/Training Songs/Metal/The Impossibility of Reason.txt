You preach to me as if it matters
Never worrying about yourself 
Or the wrong you've done 
Think you know the way 
Want me to follow you 
Selfish lies you're set out to prove 
So what if you had your faith 
You should realize 
Realize that you're already dead 

You fall 
You fall face down in the sight of yourself 
No one to pick you up 
Look what our lives have become 

I steal from you as if it matters 
No remorse to me 
Or the shame to come 
Thought I knew the way 
Never followed you 
No more time to lose, does it bother you 
So what if I had my faith 
You should realize 
Realize that I'm already dead 

I fall 
I fall face down in the sight of myself 
No one to pick me up 
Look what our lives have become 

And that's why hell 
Is the impossibility of reason

YouÂ´re not even worth the finger I gave you
Step aside Â´cause itÂ´s too late to undo
Thanks a lot for all the pain and hurt
Happy endings donÂ´t mix with the real world

CanÂ´t kill me, Fire within

Overkill, stone dead
I will make you pay
Grinding, smashing
I will drive you insane

I just wonder how you can be so goddamn naive
YouÂ´re being stupid beyond belief
Do not talk to me about the misery
You ainÂ´t seen nothing yet, got more to give

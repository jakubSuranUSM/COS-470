I am, I'm me

Who are you to look down
At what I believe?
I'm on to your thinking
And how you deceive

Well, you can't abuse me
I won't stand no more
Yes, I know the reasons
Yes, I know the score

I am and I'll be
I will, you'll see
I am and I'll be
I am, I'm me

How I tried to please you
Live the way you said
Do the things that you do
Like the living dead

Then the truth it hit me
Got me off my knees
It's my life I'm living
I'll live as I please

I am and I'll be
I will, you'll see
I am and I'll be
I am, I'm me

Now's the time to stand tall
Start your life anew
Freedom lies in your heart
Now's the time for you

I am and I'll be
I will, you'll see
I am and I'll be
I am, I'm me

Can't you see? Can't you see?
I'm me, I'm me, me, me, me, me
I am, I'm me
I am, I'm me

Can't you see? Can't you see?
I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
I am, I'm me
I am, I'm me

Can't you see that I'm me?
I'm me, I'm me, look at me
I am, I'm me
I am, I'm me

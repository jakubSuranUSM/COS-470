I feel soon
I will sink
Into you
What do you think?

'Cause there's still blood
In your hair
Got the bruise
Of the year

But it's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her
Shade tonight

I hate your tattoos
You have weak wrists
But I'll keep you

'Cause it's something about her
Long shady eyes
I'm all about her
Shade tonight

Well it's too bad
It's too bad
It's too bad
You're married, to me

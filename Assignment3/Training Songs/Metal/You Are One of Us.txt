Well you know the way we go
And you know the way we see
Grateful for the chosen road
Nice to have the memories
And you know we won't forget you
And you know we'll always care
We won't follow no superstitions
We ain't running anywhere
(hey)
Thankyou for the way you've been
Each and every night
Thankyou for most everything
Thankyou baby, thankyou baby
Thankyou baby, thankyou baby

You are one of us yes you are
(hey hey you know you know)
You are one of us yes you are
(yes everywhere we go)
(and it's everywhere we've seen)
You are one of us yes you are
(ooo yeah)
(everything we do)
(thankyou)
(I said thankyou)
(I said thankyou)

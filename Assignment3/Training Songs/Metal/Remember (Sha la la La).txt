Shimmy shammy shong
We used to make up songs remember
Sha la la la loo

I used to sing to you remember
Hi de hi de ho

We used to kiss hello remember
And then we said goodbye

And made each other cry remember

Sha la la la la la la la shoo be doo ay
Remember all the little things we used to say
Sha la la la la la la la shoo be doo I
Wonder why we ever had to say goodbye

The singer sang his song
We used to sing along remember
The sparkle in your eyes

Would light the starry skies remember
We would hum along

To the beating of the drum remember
The band began to play

And we'd begin to sway remember

Sha la la la la la la la shoo be doo ay
Remember all the little things we used to say
Sha la la la la la la la shoo be doo I
Wonder why we ever had to say goodbye

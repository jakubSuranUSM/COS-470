Ooh baby, 
Move closer to me 
I've had all that I can stand 
Take hold of me with your hands 

Oh baby, 
You give me the chills 
Whisper low in my ear 
Let knows how it feels 
Just to know you are near 

Your body gives me a thrill 
As it leans against mine 
I love how it feels 
With your jeans against mine 

The smell of burning leather 
As we hold each other tight 
As our rivets rub together 
Flashing sparks into the night 
At this moment of surrender darling 
If you really care 
Don't touch me there 

Unzip that jacket 
That leather smells so sweet 
Put your chest against mine 
Feel my heart beat 

I love the way your belt fits 
The way it hangs so low 
So low on your hips my darling 
I want you so 

I love your sweet, sweet lips 
I love your salty taste 
I love your finger tips 
When I reach for your waist?! Uh-huh

The smell of burning leather 
As we hold each other tight 
As our rivets rub together 
Flashing sparks into the night 
At this moment of surrender darling 
If you really care 
Don't touch me there 

I will give my love forever 
If you promise me you'll 
Never never never touch me there 
Don't touch me there 

Don't touch me there 
Please don't 
Don't touch me there 
Oh no not there 
Don't touch me there 
Anywhere but there 
Don't touch me there 
Never--don't ever 
Don't touch me there 
Do you care? 
Don't touch me there 
Then don't touch me there 
Don't touch me there

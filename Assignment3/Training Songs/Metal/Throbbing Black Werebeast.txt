Pulsing with raw energy 
Mind or fire and flesh mutating 
Call me what you want 
But I'll give you my disease 
Vomit breathed bastard 
Tainted train of bundled busted nerves 

Survive your stabbings 
And howl at your blood 
Shredded head speaks not 
Bristled quills drip with clot 
Lunar mind spits dead souls 
Spirit filled with black holes

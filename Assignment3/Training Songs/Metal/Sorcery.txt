(The unsealed gate)

The time has come

I, I invoke the powers
To stand onto the earth

Needs of an ally, to join the force
I demand the dignity divine
May I receive! 
The shields of all time
Beside
He will travel

Bringer of order!
He will shake the Earth
By his chant
Purest warrior 
Shall raise
The mystical

Godly
He shall be fierce!
His breath will be part of the cataclysm
Kindness over all
Same age as his guider!
Translator of beyond in his word
Apprentice of life!
Knows to respect me
Me, my magic

I am thankful for the gift
You'll be proud!
I will assure this 
I promise
May my wrath be fruitful

Wise!
Remain hidden
Men storm with me
Human follow this war
Beyond in the cataclysm

Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and flee
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away, hide away, hide away

It was summer or maybe spring, oh I can't remember
It was summer or maybe spring, oh I can't recall
We found our hearts and stole them from our bodies
We couldn't understand the villain's call
We'd often recall the beginnings
We'd often try in vain to change it all
We couldn't help but keep ourselves from sinning
It was summer, summer or maybe spring
Or maybe spring, or maybe spring

Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and flee
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away, hide away, hide away

It was summer or maybe spring, I can't remember
It was summer or maybe spring, I can't recall
We'd try to always calm our elders
But always we did seem to fall
We'd never try to tame the burning embers
It didn't seem to matter how we'd fare
It seemed we couldn't ever escape December
It was summer, summer or maybe spring
Or maybe spring, or maybe spring, ooh

Oh it was summer, summer or maybe spring
Or maybe spring, or maybe spring

Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and flee
Let them come a-running
And take all your money and hide away 
Hide away, hide away, hide away, hide away

Last night I had a vivid dream
I found a place where nothing's what it seemed
I'm bound to walk this earth alone
I am a hunter and the heir to the throne

The taste of blood and sweet revenge
It keeps hammering in my head
The urge to kill is getting stronger
I'm south of heaven north of hell, my final place to dwell

Surrender your soul, surrender your pride
Please enter my dream, find your Natural High
You got nothing to fear, 'cause your rebirth is near

The bat awakens deep inside
Nowhere to run for my eternal bride
And when the darkness comes around
I come alive cause for your sweet blood I am bound

I taste your blood, so bittersweet
Come ease my pain get on your knees
You know true love is meant to be
Forever is now what it seems, this is your final scream

Surrender your soul, surrender your pride
Please enter my dream, find your Natural High
You got nothing to fear, 'cause your rebirth is near

So you are born again on a far higher plane
In my dark Neverland, you're part of the game
Forever we are, forever we'll be, we're forever free

Solo: Stefan, Oscar

Surrender your soul, surrender your pride
Please enter my dream, find your Natural High
You got nothing to fear, 'cause your rebirth is near

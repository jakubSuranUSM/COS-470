Sick of myself
Myself
Sick of myself
Myself

Sick of myself my world my life
Get out of my way 
This truth can’t lie

I stop myself 
Every second I try
Every minute of time is an hour I die

Sick of myself my world my life
Get out of my way 
This truth can’t lie

I stop myself 
Every second I try
Every minute of time is an hour I die

Heaven disowned me
The Enemy is Everywhere

Live your life 
Not the way they taught you 
Do what you feel 
Survive the jungle  
Give me blood  
Give me Pain  

These scars won't heal 
Can you take it 
Can you take it
Can you take it
Motherfucker 

What were you thinking  
What a wonderful world  
You're full of shit 
Leave it behind  

They don't care if you cry,
All is left is pain 
I won't take it 
I won't take it 
I won't take it 

No 

[Repeat: x13]
The song remains insane 

I remain insane

Tears of time - lost in the light
Tears of pain - found in the self
Deny your equals
Destroy the testimony of days past
The door of damnation open
Reason as goal
Destroy the beast in your thoughts
Like the dust in your hands

Like the dust in your hands - like the dust in your hands

Tears of time - lost in light
Tears of time - just an illusion
Tears of time - lost in light
Tears of time - just an illusion

Like the dust in your hands - like the dust in your hands

The call of the wind fades away in your dreams
People who once believed in you
Friends who trusted you
The source of life evaporates
Many emotions left behind
Your dust blown away by the wind
Many tears sown in your dreams
Like the dust in your hands

Tears of time - lost in light
Tears of time - just an illusion
Tears of time - lost in light
Tears of time - just an illusion

Tears of time - tears of time

Reach for the riffle, go for the gun
Saddle the beast huge load to heave
Unstoppable bull race now begun
Cry for the slaughter who would believe

Hunting the red one, blood on their breath
Searching horizons for clues of the kill
Blowing their own horn, stinking of death

Tally ho.

Touch of the tail but what to expect
Dog don't believe why to die for the queen
Lies to the allies, wrath with respect
Blood hounds of Hades, heeding the scream

Pounding of hooves they cannot control
Mud flying high as shit hits the fan
Break for the border, the thrill of it all

Tally ho.

Clawing the reigns
Of a world gone mad treason
Breaking the chains

Death or glory, pride or pain
Breaking down the rules of greed and gain
Hunter's hounds in the hands of the hunted
Death or glory

Clawing the reigns
Of a world gone mad treason
Breaking the chains

Death or glory, pride or pain
Breaking down the rules of greed and gain
Hunter's hounds in the hands of the hunted
Death or glory

Death or glory, pride or pain
Death or glory

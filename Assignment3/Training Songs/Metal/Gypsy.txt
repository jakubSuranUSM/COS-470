This magic Winter Night I see a Light
Again I hear that Tune, some Sort of Croon
Oh No No No, Oh My Brain

I see them Gypsy Waggons left in the
Snow
Oh I must see that Lady, I have to know

Gypsy Woman let me inside
Solo: M.D.
They say you know the Secret, Secret of
Time
So gaze into your Crystal and tell me All
You see
Gypsy Woman let me know

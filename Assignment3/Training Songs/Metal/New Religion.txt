Deaf, blind
It's getting hard to breathe
Dark dreams become reality
Cold creeps, underneath my skin
Screams in the night
The walls are closing in

Maybe I'm condemned,
But time will tell
Soon I'm standing
At the gates of hell

Save me from myself
Take away the pain
Catch me when I fall
Hear my call, a life in vain
I need someone
To save me from myself

Lost, out of reach
Wounds will never heal
Crawl in the dust
Feel the way I feel

Maybe I'm condemned,
But time will tell
Soon I'm standing
At the gates of hell

Save me from myself
Take away the pain
Catch me when I fall
Hear my call, a life in vain
I need someone
To save me from myself

I'm at the dark side of life
In the shadows where no one belongs
And I try to find my way back
But I'm lost, lost without hope

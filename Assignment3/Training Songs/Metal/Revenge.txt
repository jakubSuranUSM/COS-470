Doomed for all eternity
Cause I never could agree
A normal life I will deny
Do not bother asking why!
From the shadows where I dwell
Here's my way to give you hell
Revenge

Years have passed and I'm still alive
Censorship is a fascist lie
A thousand times I'll rise again
You can't escape my last revenge
For all the times you've let me down
I'll crush your face into the ground
Revenge
Revenge

Come forth on precious hate
My vengeance is your fate
Come feel my last revenge
So painful until the end
Revenge
Revenge
Revenge

Thunder  please explain (please explain) 
why you ask me how I am  I'm fine I 
wonder is it sane (is it sane) 
to pierce purple eyeballs made of china 
{Canon} 
I love you like a son  like a game I have won 
like a toothbrush I used for the Eiffel Tower 
my youth  it is gone  it's a boot stuck in the ground 
is there truth to be found in an iron flower 
Mmmm... I will try hard to be a spark of power 
mmmm... I will, I'll never be your iron flower 
Stone please explain (please explain) 
why your silence makes more noise then thunder 
bones, is it sane (is it sane) 
to obey me and the flesh you're under 
{Canon} 
Your words are soon gone and it hurts, I have none 
take a jump from your pretty linguistic tower 
the goal of speech, so obnoxious to reach 
only one thing to do, melt your iron flower 
Mmmm... I will try hard to be a spark of power 
mmmm... I will, I'll never be your iron flower

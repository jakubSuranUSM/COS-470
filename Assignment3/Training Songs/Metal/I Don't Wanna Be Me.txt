Ever throwing at his home
Two glass houses, twenty stones
Fourteen yellow, six are blue
Could it be worse quite doubtful

Two steps forward, three steps back
Without warning, heart attack
He fell asleep in the snow
Never woke up, died alone

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

(Steinhauer/Blaha)
"The beginning - How the believers of the 
dualist theory turned there backs on 
catholicism and found their own methods of 
embracing God..."

They started on a distant shore 
The rich believing with the poor 
Fighting, striving hard to seek
A higher power with something else to say

Spreading their belief 
praying for a life

It's the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy

Heresy
Heretics, that and nothing more 
Daring to renege on our gods law

It's wrong for them to feel this way
Detrimental for the soul 
Help them through this time 
Disregard these lies

They say the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy

Heresy
Yeah... Choose!
Cathars gaining more control
The choice is free, us or holy Rome

Join with us you'll see the light 
We have a holy Right

It's the perfect way
But to the church it's just called heresy

Heresy

No rest from the demon within
I'm always fighting to be free
Battling the forces of evil
Now fate has chose my destiny

Walking through the fires of the land of the dead
I'm between heaven and hell
The righteous path is hidden from the wicked and the damned
I'm between heaven and hell

I stand at the gate of admission
Where I've come I can not tell
Visions of heaven before me, I cross the threshold
And it's hell

Between heaven and hell

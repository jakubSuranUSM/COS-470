And the earth begins to shake
A cacophony of roaring
Anxiety growing
Cheers to leaving this mortal life behind
Sweat begins its downpour
A riot we stand for
The blackout foreshadows the chaos

[Chorus]
So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally

Like a rift opened in the sky
Through fire, pulses and lightning
While thunderous sounds ring
Chanting hymns to leave life's troubles behind
This time shared together
Is just so much better
Than life could ever offer

[Chorus x 2]

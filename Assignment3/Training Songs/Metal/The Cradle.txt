Have you ever asked yourself
"What am I doing here?"
Life is hard but it can be an enjoyment
As long as you treat everyone's life fair

So if you want to rock a cradle
Then be sure it's thine 
If you want to mess with my life
In the end you will die

Life is a sacred gift
Which can't be treated too well 
The one can't ever be thanked enough
The one who created the incredible spell

So if you want to rock a cradle
Then be sure it's thine 
If you want to mess with my life
In the end you will die
If you want to rock a cradle
Then be sure it's thine
When you hurt me you hurt yourself
And then revenge will be mine, all mine

What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger
Have you ever been on the edge of death?
Felt the insanity and pain - the misery
Lost and confused, dying to get home
But you're not alone on the way to reality

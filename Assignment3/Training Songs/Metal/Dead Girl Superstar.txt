Well, she threw downtown on a gambling green
And fenced a chicken dog in a movie
A long haired baby got a record machine
Like a hacksaw falling on me

Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She's moving in like a demon

Dead girl, dead girl
Well, she blew uptown on a cemetery sound
And wore her leather pants for week, yeah
A canteen butcher got tiger teeth
And a handmade circus freak, yeah

Go, go, go, go
Dying to go
She moving in like a demon

Dead girl, dead girl superstar
Well, she hit the ground like a bounty killer Clown
With a fistful of dollars to eat, yeah
I see her there with blood in her hair
And a flesh killing brat to beat, yeah

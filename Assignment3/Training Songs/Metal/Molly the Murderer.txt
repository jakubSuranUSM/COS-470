Legend 
As the night begins to raise 
An ambush waiting for the pray 
Going shoot me cold blood 
Cave in 
As I admit the crime is mine 
Though we both crossed the line 
My friend 

Still you murder me 
Yeah, you murder me 
Still you murder me 
With your lies 

Baby, baby you murder me 
Baby, baby you murder me 
Your weapons are words 
Kills us when heard 
They murder me 
If you try to assassinate me 
You're doing it perfectly 
Take a good look at me 
I take your bullet for free 
With no alibi 
Molly, you murder me 

Crazy 
Thinking you will never change 
The nights will always be the same 
You and I 
I wanna change this 
If only you will let me 
But baby you don't get this 
You don't even try 

Instead you murder me 
Yeah, you murder me 
Still you murder me 
With your lies 

Baby, baby you murder me 
Baby, baby you murder me 
Your weapons are words 
Kills us when heard 
They murder me 
If you try to assassinate me 
You're doing it perfectly 
Take a good look at me 
I take your bullet for free 
With no alibi 
Molly, you murder me 

Your tribe I fight 
Just wait to drown 
No loses like this just waiting for dead 
Cos' I'm the only one 
It's just an another one of your lies 

You murder me 
Murder me 

Baby, baby you murder me 
Baby, baby you murder me 
Your weapons are words 
Killing when heard 
They murder me 
If you try to assassinate me 
You're doing it perfectly 
Take a good look at me 
I take your bullet for free 
With no alibi 

Weapons are words 
Kills us when heard 
Weapons are words 
Kills us when heard 
You murder me 
Murder me kin

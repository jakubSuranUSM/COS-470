Goddamn my man you see I can't understand
Why you wanna say N*gger to your brother man
Taking black pride then you call yourself a N*gger
Don't bring yourself down 'cause it just don't figure
Take a look at yourself and your history
You don't look like a goddamn N*gger to me
It's a negative world and the white man made it
Gave you a name to dominate and trade it
Making blood money of his very own race man
And all of this because the colour of your face man

N*gger N*gger N*gger N*gger

Placed and educated in a neighbourhood of crime
Taught from the beginning that you weren't worth time
Liquorstore and gunstore next to one another
With only one purpose so you all kill each other
Leaving one less problem to worry about
That's the way they do it this is how it turns out
And justice for all with the American government
I wanna know where all the goddamn money went
We didn't see it and it didn't do no good
I guess you couldn't give a f*ck about a black neighbourhood

N*gger N*gger N*gger N*gger N*gger
You're the real Niggers,
You're the real Niggers,
You're the real Niggers

There's always gonna be fanatical minorities
The ku klux klan and fucked up authorities
Conservative cunts and religious preachers
I don't care 'cause they ain't our teachers
Living a life they say is free from sin
Then they judge another person by the colour of their skin
I feel ashamed of myself I'm a white human being
Surrounded by suckers to afraid to be seeing
There ain't such a thing called superior race
And there ain't nothing special 'bout colour of your face
You've got a one way ticket to a dead end street
The pressure is on so feel the heat
Media pollution is a very bad solution
Hypocriticat hype is your only contribution
So leave us alone and give your brothers some space
'cause you're a lousy contribution to the human race

N*gger N*gger ...

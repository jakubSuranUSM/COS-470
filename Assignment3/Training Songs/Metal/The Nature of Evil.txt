[Sinner, Beyrodt]

[Chorus 1:]
Here I am, bounded in blood
No escape 'til the darkness will fall
I hear them scream, hear them cry
Slaves and shadows ... caged in this twilight

[Chorus 2:]
Somewhere inside, you will hear this sound
You will understand what turns me inside out

[Chorus 3:]
Will you hear me calling
You will fear the nature of evil
Will you see me screaming
You will fear the nature of evil

Will you hear me calling
Ooh oh
The nature of evil

In the room, cold as a grave
I pray for rescue but no one cares
Exposed the truth, raised up from the dead
This curse has left a part in my head

I'm out here alone ... in the darkest wasteland
In deepest trouble, a stranded man

[Chorus 3]

Baby hear me calling
The nature of evil

[Chorus 1 & 2]

Yes, I'm out in this wasteland...
And I'm facing the truth
A stranded soul prays for mercy
But God don't wanna know

[Chorus 3]

Will you hear me calling
Ooh yeah
The nature of evil

Here I am, bounded in blood
No escape 'til the darkness will fall

The nature of evil

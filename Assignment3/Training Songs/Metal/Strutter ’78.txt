I know a thing or two about her 
I know she'll only make you cry 
She'll let you walk the street beside her 
But when she wants she'll pass you by 
Ev'rybody said she's lookin' good 
And the lady knows it's understood 
Strutter! 
Strutter! 
Strutter! 

She wears her satin like a lady 
She gets her way just like a child 
You take her home and she says "Maybe, baby" 
She takes you down and drives you wild 

Ev'rybody said she's lookin' good 
And the lady knows it's understood 
Strutter! 

I know a thing or two about her 
I know she'll only make you cry 
She'll let you walk the street beside her 
But when she wants, she'll pass you by 

Everybody said she's lookin' good, and the lady knows it's understood 
Strutter - I know she'll just make you cry 
Strutter - look out, that girl will just pass you by 
Strutter - whoa oh, she gets her way like a child 
Strutter - mama, that girl will just drive you wild 

Strutter (repeats out)

Yesterday, as I went out of the house
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
Lying face down in the sewer
I got up closer and realized that I knew her

All her organs coming from her inside
Slashed up skin sliced up hide
Turned her over and saw the tire tracks on her head
That's when I realized she was dead

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
Twisted body chopped off feet
Her body was minced meat

Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead, can't do no harm
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled
Chewed off toes on her chopped off feet
I took a picture cause I thought it was neat

But the thing I like seeing the best
Was the rodents using her hair as a nest

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy nnd your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of red

I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see
Your dead mommy lying in front of me
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
I hope she dies twenty times more

I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead

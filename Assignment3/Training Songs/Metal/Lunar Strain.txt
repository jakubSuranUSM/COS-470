For there is a purpose and reason
Beyond all human apprehension
The shrieking silence in the blackness of space

For there is a knowledge more complex
Than life on this planet
A knowledge in tune with the progress of stars

Lunar strain

All across the milky way
Life suffers defeat
Life that once was treasured

What once was nothing
Has blossomed into form
Once it was I that was nothing
But now they say I will die

All across the galaxy
Life suffers defeat

Lunar strain

From nothingness to reality
As we see it
From nothingness to life
My dismal tears of anguish
Bleed into one with the songs of my heaven
Loneliness is pain

Emptiness is power, loneliness is pain
Serenity is might
Yet we shall be honored
In the star forsaken night

Astral strain
All around my silent moon
Life suffers defeat

Astral strain

For there is a purpose and reason
Beyond all human apprehension
The shrieking silence in the blackness of space

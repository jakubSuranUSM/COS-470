Watched the planes come in
On the early morning flights

But I could not stand to see them land without you.
Now I'm thumbing through my fortyfives on another endless night

And the same old lines
Going back in time

Tell me this is nothing new.

Well
I feel like Buddy Holly 'cause it's Raining In My Heart

All the sad songs take me back to you now that we are apart.
Now I know how Paul McCartney felt when he got up to say:
I wish it was Yesterday.

So I sit here playing Solitaire
It's a game I know so well

Ever since that day when you called to say: It's over.
Now I've made my reservation at the Heartbreak Hotel

While I'm living without you

I'm thinking about you
Like Only The Lonely do.
Well
I feel like Buddy Holly 'cause it's Raining In My Heart

Now I know what Paul Simon meant by the words he found:
I wish I was Homeward Bound.
Well
I feel like Buddy Holly 'cause it's Raining In My Heart

Now I know how Paul McCartney felt when he got up to say
I wish it was Yesterday
I wish it was Yesterday.

Where is your
Where is your
Where is your love

The Smaller the keys, bigger the locks
closure of dorms, for the hatred
pick a key and watch!
sesame open, just meaningless words

Tell me, where's your love
Tell me, where your heart
don't look back to that start
where's your love.

A daring mixture of shelter and temptation
the one who dares will gain the blame
lines web into my heat
to tear it slightly apart

Where is your love
Where is your heart

Tell me, where's your love
Tell me, where your heart
don't look back to that start
where's your love

Where is your love?

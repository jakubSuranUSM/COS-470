Love to me was to be something
More when it came to you

Forever filling a void
Something I cannot avoid
Everytime I'm put together
I'm being destroyed

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it
I'm by myself, I'm bound to be

I can't find what I'm missing
I've lost myself, I hope that you're listening
I've seen my puzzle taken apart
It's hard to start again

But with you, all I knew was the filth
That you put me through

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories
Making them last

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

And I knew it was to be
My words are quick to undress me
Filled my heart with broken glass
To make this thing last

Feels so numb when we lie together
Feels so numb when we lie together

I'm by myself, I'm bound to be

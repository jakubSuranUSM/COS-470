Oh!

Two, three, four

Helpless,
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside,
You sealed your demise when you took what was mine,
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world,
No voice to be heard

Waking the demon,
Where'd you run to?
Walk in the shadows,
Watch the blood flow,
There's not much longer, so don't try and fight,
Your body's weakening, walk to the light,
Those painful times so alone so ashamed,
I'm not coming back there's nothing to gain

Caution,
There's just no limits to the boundaries you push
I warned you but still you just f*ck with my mind,
There's no escape from this rage that I feel,
Nothing is real,

Waking the demon,
Where'd you run to?
Walk in the shadows,
Watch the blood flow,
There's not much longer, so don't try and fight,
Your bodies weakening, walk to the light,
Those painful times so alone so ashamed,
I'm not coming back there's nothing to gain

[Repeat: x2]
Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber.
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Whoa!
Trip!

[Repeat: x2]
Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber.
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Waking the demon!

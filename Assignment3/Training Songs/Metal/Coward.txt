I am looking into darkness
To hide my face
Don’t show me who you are
'Cause I am a coward

I wanted you in the whisper
I wanted you in the fire burn
I wanted you to ride in on the white horse

Storm clouds rage
The fire blazes hot
But all that time
You were there in the whisper

I sing a coward’s song
I found it hard to bend my knees
I found your quiet tone
I hear you whispering to me

All this time I’ve been running
From what you’ve spoken over me
My legs are weary
My will is tired
But as where you find me
Find me on my knees

Praise be your name in all the earth
I’ll sing my coward song
Praise be your name
Your voice I’ve heard you whisper
(Reign over)
No, I’m not strong enough
(Reign over)
No, I’m not good enough
(Praise be your name)

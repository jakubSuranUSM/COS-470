When you're drowning,
when you're freezin',
when you're feeling cold
There's a light in the darkness
as the elder always told.
When the winter's coming closer
and the autumn's passing by,
Then the world will sink in silence
and I think we all should try.
Oh, I want to live my life in a fairy tale
Where the end is always good and never sad.
Show me the way to another world
Where the sun is always shining in the and
And we fight back the tears, and we lose our fears,
Let the world remain in silence for a while
Sun in our minds in a world full of ice,
Let silence remain for a little while.

Somebody came and slammed the door,
took the feelin' away from our hearts.
And the horror took hold of a place
in our hearts filled with love.

What is left behind the ice,
behind the make up and the lies
Tell me what goes on inside our minds,
There is a hole in our sky,
getting bigger, growing wide
No more answer, but we hold the line
See and hear what we have done to us all,
we want to be free more than anything,
Do you hear what I say to you?
We will make it through, the sun shall shine.

Hear the words we say and see the light of day
We never will be free until the sun is shining for us all
Carry on, carry on and make our dreams come true
And for a little while we stay together
Carry on, carry on, may all our lovin' stay
And for a little while we stay together, forever
Together, forever.

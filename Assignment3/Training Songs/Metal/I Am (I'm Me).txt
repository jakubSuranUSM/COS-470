Who are you to look down at what I believe?
I'm on to your thinking and how you deceive
Well, you can't abuse me, I won't stand no more
Yes, I know the reasons, yes, I know the score

CHORUS:

I am and I'll be
I will, you'll see
I am and I'll be
I am: I'm me

How I tried to please you, live the way you said
Do the things that you do, like the living dead
Then the truth it hit me, got me off my knees
It's my life I'm living, i'll live as I please

REPEAT CHORUS

Solo - Eddie

Now's the time to stand tall, start your life anew
Freedom lies in your heart, now's the time for you

REPEAT CHORUS

I am: I'm me
I am: I'm me (can't you see)
I am: I'm me (can't you see, I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I'm me, me, me, me, me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me, can't you see)
I am: I'm me (can't you see, I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I'm me, I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me, everything)
I am: I'm me (I'm me, I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I'm me, look at me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me)
I am: I'm me (I am: I'm me)

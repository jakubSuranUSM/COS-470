If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong

In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely

If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
Most unlikely

But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Is there someone there
Rock and roll

On the edge of the last goodbye
We all sing - warrior
Ah the brave never die
Most unlikely

Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again

For the sake of the left behind
We all sing Gloria
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely

Cause we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take you anywhere

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Someone's always there
Rock and roll

Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Someone's always there
Rock and roll
Rock and roll me, ah

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

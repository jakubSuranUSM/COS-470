You kissed the lips of evil
Two months is all the same
I begged for this man's approval
Pray to die in vain

Sit down with thoughts alone now
With blood these lyrics came
Your words, they eat right through me
Dead could hear my shame

The tears we've cried, this love has died
You're by yourself with me tonight
It's what we hide with every lie
And stitch these wounds with me tonight

I think of it each time I touch you
Or every time I hear his name
These walls will never crumble
Here's our cause to blame

Sit down with thoughts alone now
With blood these lyrics came
Your words, they eat right through me
Dead could hear my shame

The tears we've cried, this love has died
You're by yourself with me tonight
It's what we hide with every lie
And stitch these wounds with me tonight

Liar, liar, liar, oh

The tears we've cried, this love has died
You're by yourself with me tonight
It's what we hide with every lie
And stitch these wounds with me tonight

The tears we've cried, this love has died
You're by yourself with me tonight
It's what we hide with every lie
And stitch these wounds with me tonight

Liar!
Liar!
Liar say goodbye!

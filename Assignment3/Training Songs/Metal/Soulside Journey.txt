I have had this Vision
Of a voyage in mind and soul
Through silent Somniferous scenes
Within the enclosed chambers of my

Untouched spiritual experiences
Soaring through damp air, Seeing
Faces, twisting, plunging through my colour
Cosmic Fear arrives, I hold a dead one,

Surrounded by my many candles
(I burn to cleanse the air)
Rotten Unclean Sacrifice Nightmares
Unreal Psychedelic Journey

Ride The Darkside
Search The Soulside

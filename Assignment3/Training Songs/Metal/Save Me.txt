Waiting for a little sign
Seems like to no avail
Strolling down the pavement aimlessly

Waiting for someone to snatch her bag of memories
How come you call it destiny?
When the cross you bear's your only company

Never seen you, I don't even know you're name
But still I believe

That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection on this cold and windy road
Save me, from a state of un-emotion
Just a little affection on this windy road

Why so long? so confusing?
Why's growing up hurt so bad?
Seek what we had lost, we get found and go again
I don't know what's gone to me
I won't make any promise I believe

Never seen you, I don't even know you're name
But still I believe

That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection on this cold and windy road
Save me, from a state of un-emotion
Just a little affection on this windy road

I don't know if I can, I don't know if I should
I don't know what is right, and what's to come if you would
Here I stand in rain, here in stand in the cold
I been locked into (something), another shout in my soul, no

I'm afraid of that harm

Save, save me, got a notion
That you are gonna save me
Somehow I got a notion
Just a little affection on this cold and windy road
Save me, from a state of un-emotion
Just a little affection on this windy road

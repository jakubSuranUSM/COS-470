[Chorus]
Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal racing alien beings
Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal rides a laser beam

He descends from the sky
And he's ready to die for the thrill
When the predator falls
Your fate will be called by his will

Reeling you into a climax crescendo of sound

[Chorus]

You have no time
He can turn on a dime with his stare
Spins you around and he's taking you down
He don't care

Stay out of his way or you know you're gonna pay eating wall

[Chorus]

Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal it's a NASCAR dream
Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal it's a nitro scene

Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal it's a NASCAR dream
Super sonic silver flying machine
Made of metal it's a hot rod scream

Super sonic silver flying machine

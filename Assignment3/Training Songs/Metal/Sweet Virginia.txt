Headin' south on the Macon trail
Kickin' dust inside some county jail
Her mama said "Hey Jackie you be good"
'Cause she knew that she would be misunderstood.

[Chorus]
Oh sweet Virginia
No, you never knew her name
She tried to win ya
But you never played the game
Her name was Jackie Brown
She cried when they told her
Old sweet Virginia town
You know it's not over

The jokers laughed and cried
"Hey Jackie, what's your game"
I got the time you got the money she explained
But time was one thing now that Jackie couldn't spend
So she made it while she could right to the end

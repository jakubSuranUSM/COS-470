I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets anekatips
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
One last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbye

The final frontier (x4)

There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

But I have filled my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
That one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier (repeat)

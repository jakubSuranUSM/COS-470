Start with a Sun and move on out
The future's in the skies above
The Heavens unfold and a new star is born
Space and time makin' love

Oh, what a time we had
Livin' underground
I move to station number five
See you next time around

Next time around
As far as you want and close as you need
It's all in your mind you know
This old Earth hasn't really seen it's day
It's here, time to go

Oh, what a time we had
Livin' underground
I move to station number five
See you next time around

I remember when it was so clear
We were young but the memory still remains
To pick fruit from a tree, fish from the seas
Now nothin's left here but the stains
But I can't cry no more, can only be glad
That there's other places we can be
If the time suites you right I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away with me!=, yeah, yeah

Start with a Sun and move on out
The future's in the skies above
The Heavens unfold and a new star is born
Space and time makin' love

Oh, what a time we had
Livin' underground
I move to station number five
See you next time around

Next time around, yeah, yeah

Pain
You're not my friend and I despise you
Friend
You are my pain and I adore you

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side
As I sit and let the day go by
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

Insane
To be caged, when you're to blame
Blame
Break free from insanity to praise you

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side
As I sit and let the day go by
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all (let's consume it all)
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side (other side)
As I sit and let the day go by (day go by)
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Before they take it all away
I hear them from the other side (other side)
As I sit and let the day go by (day go by)
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

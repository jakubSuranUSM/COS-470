Two faced!
I feel you crawling under my skin
Sickened by your face
By the way, to think that you're so fucking kind?
You ain't!

Hard to find how I feel,
Especially when you're smothering me
Hard to find how I feel,
Please someone help me

I knew when an angel whispered into my ear,
You gotta get him away, yeah
Hey little bitch!
Be glad you finally walked away or you may have not lived another day.

Hard to find how I feel,
Especially when you're smothering me
Hard to find how I feel,
Please someone help me
Hard to find how I feel,
Controlling me every step of the way
Hard to find how I feel,
You greedy little baby

Hard to find, hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find, hard to find
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

Hard to find how I feel,
Specially when you're smothering me
Hard to find how I feel,
Please someone help me
Hard to find how I feel,
Controlling me every step of the way
Hard to find how I feel,
You greedy little baby

On the might of kings and captains on
(it won't be long, it won't be long now)
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
(I'm on my way, I'm on my way out)
I know my hatred is perfect
(it won't be long, it won't be long now)
For the culprit who deserves it
(I'm on my way, I'm on my way out)

dead meat against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
(there is) no dream worth pursuing when
(there is) nobody embracing and
(there is) no war worth fighting when
(there is) no blood worth spilling

on the might of kings and captains on
(spit something out, speak to me right now)
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
(step of my throat, get off my throat now)
I know my hatred is perfect
(spit something out, speak to me right now)
For the culprit who deserves it
(step of my throat, get off my throat now)

dead meat against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
(there is) no dream worth pursuing when
(there is) nobody embracing and
(there is) no war worth fighting when
(there is) no blood worth spilling

I know my hatred is pure
For the new recruit
Impostors on the fast track
To public execution
Beggars for mercy unite
But your pleas are ineffective
And if you ever come back
Beautiful incarnation
I'll lie down at your feet and
Accept my punishment
You better save yourself
You better save yourself
You better save yourself

dead meat against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
(there is) no dream worth pursuing when
(there is) nobody embracing and
(there is) no war worth fighting when
(there is) no blood worth spilling

(there is) no dream worth pursuing when
(there is) nobody embracing and
(there is) no war worth fighting when
(there is) no blood worth spilling

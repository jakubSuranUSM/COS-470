I know you know I know you know
What is the truth what is the truth who knows
You know she knows they know we know
What is the truth what is the truth who knows
I do do you will you won't you
What is the truth what is the truth to you
Will you won't you do you don't you
What is a lie gave it a try won't you I know nothing you don't know
Don't get me wrong don't get me wrong
Don't get me
Love me shove me kiss me hug me
What is my love what is my love tell me
F*ck me kick me suck me hit me
What is a f*ck what is a f*ck tell me
Take it shake it bend it break it
What is my life what is my life take it
Thrill me kill me fill me make it
What is the truth what is the truth fake it
See me be me hear me fear me
What is the truth is the truth near me
School me fool me rule me drool me
What is the truth what is the truth fool me
Can you can't you do you don't you
Hear my reply don't ask me why will you
Help me leave me feed me bleed me
Need me to lie what is a lie tell me
I know nothing.....
I know you know I know you know
What is the truth what is the truth who knows
He knows she knows they know we know
What is the truth what is the truth who knows
I do do you will you won't you
What is the truth is the truth to you
Will you won't you do you don't you
What is a lie give it a try won't you
I know nothing.....

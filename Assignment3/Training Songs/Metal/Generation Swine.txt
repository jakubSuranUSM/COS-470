I don't care now what I do 
'Cause I am just a fool like you 
Get my way now everyday 
I take all I can get 
Just like you 
Just like you 

Back in ya face such a disgrace 
We're the generation swine 
A rat race from outer space 
Gonna blow your mind 
Gotta get away 
Gotta get away 

Aggravation 
Gotta blow my brains 
Gotta blow my brains 
We're the generation 
I want more 
It's not enough 
We get our thrills 
Right from this stuff 
So my mind's a sewage sump, 
It's smelling bad and out of luck 
Just like you back in ya face... 
Such a disgrace 
We're the Generation Swine 

Gimme no lip, here comes my fist 
I don't need it this time 
Gettin' blown away, 
Gettin' thrown away 
Degeneration 
This here song's for you, 
The doomed welcome my fools to 
The Planet Boom 
Thinkin' that I'll grab my space 
Gun leave this place right 
Now for the zoom 

Gimme some space, 
Get outta my face, 
We're the Generation Swine 
Don't need your lip, 
Your ignorance 
We're the generation 
Always on a run, 
Always on a run 
New sensation 
Want to go insane, 
Gonna go insane 
We're the Generation Swine

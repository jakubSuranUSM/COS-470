Back in 1095, when the call to arms came
We had the red cross sown on
Sent to save the holy land and crush the infidels
With strength from above

Steel meets steel

On towards victory we march, the guiding star
Lead us to the battle field
There, the heathens were subdued, and in the end
We forced them all to yield or die

Steel meets steel

In July in '99, the holy city was stormed and won
Jerusalem was freed, we thanked the lord for our glory

We, the templars, have survived by honor and pride
And the blessing of the sword
The quest of the war, forever sung
To the sound of steel meets steel

Steel meets steel

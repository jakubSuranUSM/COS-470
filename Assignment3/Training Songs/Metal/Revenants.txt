Look upon me for I am the end incarnate 
I am the vulture that feeds on the eyes of children 
The last breath of the fading, poisoned vial 

The birth of a creature that you've created 
And if all the world is just a stage 
Then I am its keeper and I am its ruiner 

All these fears unleashed from our darkest dreams 
As the world is engulfed by flames, and torn apart by war-born hearts 
In the eve of what ill nations breed 
There'll be none left to see our creations made to fail and fall 

So watch as the dead walk among us
See this plague manifest from your scorn 
And the echoes from revenants of your horror's past 
Shall torment your mind 

See hallow ties to a world, build from the blood of pride 
And the slaughter of purity and hope 
Sacrifice the pure, and rape the righteous 
We only live to corrupt, we only want to destroy

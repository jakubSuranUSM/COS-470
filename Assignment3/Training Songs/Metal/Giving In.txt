Will you walk me
To the edge again?
Shaking, lonely
And I am drinking again.
Woke up tonight 
And no one's here with me.
I'm giving in to you.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you. 
Watch me crumble.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm crying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.

Caught up in life
Losing all my friends.
Family has tried
To heal my addictions.
Tragic it seems
To be alone again.
I'm giving in to you.

Take me under
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Watch me crumble.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm crying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.

Oh f*ck

I look forward
To dying tonight.
Drinks still on myself.
Life's harder every day.
The stress has got to me
I'm giving in.
Giving
Giving in now.

Take me under.
(I'm killing all the faith)
I'm dying tonight.
(I'm sick of all that faith)
Watch me crumble.
(I'm killing all the faith)
I'm crying tonight.

I'm giving in to you.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Watch me crumble.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm crying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.
Take me under.
I'm giving in to you.
I'm dying tonight.
I'm giving in to you.

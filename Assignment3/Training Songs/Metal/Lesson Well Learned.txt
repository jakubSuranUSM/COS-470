A chance, a risk, try my luck again 
Well, this could be my win 
I knew it was a lie, knew it all the time 
But I got sucked in 
My crying for leaving, was all misconceiving 
now where can I turn? 
Without getting burned!! 
I dealt with it, fought it, without any help 
My fear is now gone 
Battled and conquered, now I'm up front 
To sail through the dawn 
My crying for leaving was all misconceiving 
now where can I turn? 
Without getting burned!! 
Oh, it's a lesson well learned 

Lesson well Learned Yea! 
Lesson well Learned Yea!

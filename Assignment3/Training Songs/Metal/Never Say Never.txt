Twisted Sister Never Say Never

Hello. It's me again
The thing that wouldn't die
You thought you had me beaten
Now you can't deny
Never woman fire

And it's hard inside to burn
They see light up there
And lyin' they take the turn

No, no, no never, no never
No never say never again

Why did you waste your time
On those who don't deserve
No nothing flow or sail or get your body there

Wanna let you lookin' at the infiltrated bush
I've got two words for you that can't be misunderstood

No, no, no never, no never
No never say never again

(Solo)

No, no, no never, no never
No never say never again

Hey, you think you never thought
You'd had to face the noise
And nice played back up friend
Was singin' all the voice
And now you're prayin'
You'd got free and you'll not fail
But you'll be goin' to the steamin' iron hell

No, no, no never, no never
No never say never again

No, no, no never, no never
No never say never again

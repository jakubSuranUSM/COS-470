Slowly as your falling there
Right before my eyes
Seconds till the end
Taking every ounce of energy that's left
Just to make amends

So pathetic as it eats you to oblivion
Many men have been there just like you
Jealousy is here to meet you
To frustration
You're the one that's breaking up in two

Infatuator
Don't you love to hate her?
Infatuation eats your brain
Infatuator
Don't you love to hate her?
Infatuation, unrestrained

Now you see her there, as your dreaming in blood red
Sweat pours from your mind
Taking all the fear that's seeping from your head
Bleeds you till your blind

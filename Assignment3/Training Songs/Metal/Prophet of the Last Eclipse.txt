[music & lyrics: Luca Turilli]

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine:
et lux perpetua luceat eis

Silent see of dark and terror
spare the planet from this terror
white cold moon and Zaephyr's surface
Salva me, Salva me, Salva me...
I will swear I will call my hate
and eternal rage

She's ready to turn off her life's flame
to free all his people from hell
but no... he doesn't want to accept thos solution
preferring to think of how he can escape
Hundreds of them are now coming
"friend" is now an ancient word
there's no place left to hide in this white icy dungeon
no way to survive of the
close shadows' fall
shadows' fall...

And so she made her choice
seeing Arkan fooling himself with lost hopes
She left her lover's arms
and crying she started to run away...
to them!

She looked at him praying... "forgive me!"
but he could nost answer at all
she was going to be killed by the
mass of those riles
now screaming and trying
to stop all their pain
'cause she would have been surely tortured
by all of those religion's fools
he was then obliged
to shoot at his princess
to avoid the brutality of his now...
dead old friends
She was now lying there
dying in a lake of ice and blood
while he, embracing her
was killing them with his red eyes

WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE
THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CLASHING EVERYWHERE
THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC DOOMSDAY
WHAT WAS UNREVEALED SO EVEN
TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST ECLIPSE...
LAST ECLIPSE

She was now lying there
dying in a lake of ice and blood
oh no... why she's dead now...

No trace of life around
What happened to his ancient town?
He hopes it's not a dream
but it's the sun now lighting him
WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE
THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CLASHING EVERYWHERE
THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC DOOMSDAY
WHAT WAS UNREVEALED EVEN
TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST ECLIPSE...
LAST ECLIPSE

Silent seed of dark and terror
spare the planet from hisd horror
white cold moon and Zaephyr's surface
Salva me, Salva me, Salva me...
I will swear I will call my hate
and eternal rage

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine:
et lux perpetua luceat eis

Phobic, eggshell, walking on a brink.
Camera sensor eyes pierce.
We excuse stone-set normality.
Yet send tremors through morality.

Frozen optics,
Traction for outspoken heads.

F*ck your badgeless, rankless dirge
And bizarre take on community concern.
Division is your vision.

Cajoled - jostled into position
Where we can't ascend or defend.
Funny how you're molded by perfection;
Which visionary told you so?

Curse our influence,
Traction for outspoken heads.

Your true colors make us reel, scab
Garish hue with bilious sheen, scab
No dressing up to the nines, scab
It's permanent under the skin.

Policing the detritus, unclean!
Policing the benign

F*ck your badgeless, rankless dirge
And f*ck assumptions that we're dirt
This derision builds a prison... for you!

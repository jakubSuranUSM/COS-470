Standing up at the plate
Waiting on my date
I was startin' to worry
She was a half-hour late
My team don't like it
When I delay the game
But they know I'm crowned
The girl's on the rebound
Life is like a stadium at night
Crowd cheers jeers
Drama spotlights
The public know us
Maybe they don't
But now I'm gonna show 'em
What the cameras won't
Time is running out for you and me
What's it all about?
When I was a kid
I went down to the minors
For stealing a base
They gave me a shiner
Sat me on the bench
'Til I learned my lesson
Little older, wiser
And a little less aggressive
At the age of seventeen
I got back on the team
Like a quarterback sneak
Every kid's dream
Never far from home
Always in the zone
Home or away
In ballparks and domes
C'mon and play these games today
Who wants to play these games today
I'm gonna play these games today
We gotta play
Play games
Oh yeah! The games we play
We play games
I've seen the bad calls
Injuries and penalties
But I keep ducking
All the blocks with ease
Big game exposure
All star composure
You asked me to prove my skills
Then I showed ya
The clock ticks down
To the year two thousand
I went for the gold
And I damn near found it
To those who told
I would never succeed
It's first and goal
And I'm the M.V.P.

After
Can’t be seen with these hands can’t be seen
Can’t be seen with these hands can’t be seen
Can’t be seen
Can’t be seen, causes everything
Don’t you see, causes everything
Can’t be seen, causes everything

Give me your hand, reach out I’ll crush it
Give me your hand, reach out I’ll crush it
Cause is ok
Cause is ok

Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me
Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me

Smashing, lashing, slashing, for the same thing
I say, quit while we are heard

A victim of high tension, and beat me everyday
For what?
For what?

Scream for you lying
Can’t be seen, causes everything
Can’t be seen, causes everything
Can’t be seen

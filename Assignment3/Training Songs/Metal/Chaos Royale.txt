Hear me out
Most of my time I´ve spent thinking about 
Like who I am what I’m supposed to be 
I´ve tried it all; school and dead end jobs 
But now I know that there´s a higher purpose for me

I will rule this whole universe 
Assemble my own terror regime 
I´ll ban all laws and commercial T.V.
Start to sound pretty cool now you better well goddamn agree

Kill the king
Long live my tyranny 
I´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy 
So kill the king and let the revolution sing
All shall obey or die and hail my chaos royale

Gonna build a giant killing machine 
No one will dare to stand up or oppose
Enslave the earth with an iron fist 
Now the whole world is my personal bitch

I´ll put an end to all music that sucks 
According to my flawless taste 
No hipster shit, radio rock, bubblegum DJ pop 
Heavy metal all of the way, make no fucking mistake 

Thou shalt have no other ´fore me
Or you won’t live to regret! 
There´s a choice of complete submission or certain death! 
Kill the king and long live my tyranny 
I´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy 
Kill the king and let the revolution sing 
All shall obey or die 
Have no fear ´cause I will end democracy  
I know what you need so no one dare to question me 
Kill the king and let the new era begin 
All shall submit or die and hail to the chaos royale 

And thou shall have no other ‘fore me 
‘Cause all the others are dead!
There´s a choice of complete submission
Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth—ye shall serve me till death 

Kill the king
Long live my tyranny 
I´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy 
Kill the king and let the revolution sing 
All shall obey or die 
Have no fear ´cause I will end democracy  
I know what you need so no one dare to question me 
Kill the king and let the new era begin 
All shall submit or die 
Hail chaos royale!

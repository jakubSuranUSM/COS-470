Lifecycles and planned obsolescence
A perfect trap disguised as assistance
It takes the pain away
It takes the pain away
Control the sentience of the masses
Relief replaced with silent disaster
But I won't fade away
No, I won't fade away

I defy, this hopelessness
I defy, your callousness
I defy, irreverent, I will rise I see through your disguise, and all your lies
I defy (defy, I defy)

A numbing cure for the common existence
Replace security for subsistence
It takes the pain away
It takes the pain away

Victimize, enable, beguile
A body count without a reprisal
But I won't fade away
No, I won't fade away

I defy, this hopelessness
I defy, your callousness
I defy, irreverent, I will rise I see through your disguise, and all your lies
I defy

Sometimes the pain of life's too much to mitigate
But I refuse to march into an early grave

I refuse to march into an early grave

I defy, this hopelessness
I defy, your callousness
I defy, irreverent, I will rise I see through your disguise, and all your lies
I defy (defy, I defy)

Defy, defy, defy, I defy

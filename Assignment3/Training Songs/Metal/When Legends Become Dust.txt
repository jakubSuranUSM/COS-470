Sometimes I get the feeling that I am stuck in some sort of dream 
Unable to wake up, yet able to watch my entire world collapse around me 
Time is such a violent predator always waiting to hear the news post tragedies
I've bid farewell to every sunset and counted every moon 

Sooner or later these tides are going to wash these towns away, and take every impurity with it 
From sewer to treetop they'll run to safety, cowering at their own reflection 
Behind it all will lay broken shells of worn out streetlights
The bulbs crumbled and splintered glass remains embedded in our heels

Reminding us of a time no one can recall
When skyscrapers cursed the ground
And every tree screamed with outstretched arms, to a sky that wasn't listening
Why are all involved to hurt? 

To know what the trues form of human being is
We can watch as they dine on the downfall of our emotions
Streams of heartache and the volatile rage rattle the spines of bystanders
Tearing the breath from our children's lungs
Can you bear the sight of post collapse? 
A thought of chaos crosses the minds of pure, and hollow eyes turned towards a dusken road
Here is your ghost town in all its glory
Movies of superimposed silhouettes play against the backboard of dusk drawing in every killer for miles

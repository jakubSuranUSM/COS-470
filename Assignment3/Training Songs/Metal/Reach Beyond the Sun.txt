Come forth from darkness, though I promise you no light. 
The sun beats down reflections of the despondence in our eyes.
To lie in malaise is to submit to the grave,
And we will not rest in peace.
The infinite awaits.
Extend, outreach.

Our days are as bleak as we permit.
Reach beyond the sun,
Where hopelessness has yet to spread.
Reach beyond.

No mortal soul will soar the expanse of the mind
(While) descending deeper into the abyss of the heart.
Set against twice its weight in sorrow, it does not rise.
Bereaved of dawn, Imprisoned by midnight breeding inside,
Brief lives wither away under a darkened sky of their own creation.

With just one spark, I could rekindle the sun with my very hands. 

Our days are as bleak as we permit.
Reach beyond the sun,
Where hopelessness has yet to spread.
Reach beyond the sun.

Extend.
Outreach.
Reignite.

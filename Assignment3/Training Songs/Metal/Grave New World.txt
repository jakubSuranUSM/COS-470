Stumbling In Darkness
A Lonely Generation
Striving To Pull Out
Into The Light
Searching
Searching But Not Ending
In More Distress
A Hell Of Anxiety

This is The Grave
The Grave New World
This is The Grave
The Grave New World

Old Is The Wound
Showing No Sign
No Sign Of Healing
Stirring Up Bitter Feelings
Reviving Fear
Reviving Despair
On And On It Goes
Outlasting Many A Prayer

Welcome To The Grave New World
Of Fear Twisted Hearts
Broken Minds And Souls
Sad And Hungry Faces
Broken Minds And Souls
Madness And Machines
Fear Twisted Hearts

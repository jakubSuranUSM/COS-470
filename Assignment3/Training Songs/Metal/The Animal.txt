I can feel the animal inside
My resolve is weakening
Pounding on the doors of my mind
Its nearly overpowering
I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run if you intend to survive
For the beast is coming to life

Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

For the animals soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

I can feel the calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you cant bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise
The beast is coming to life
Taking more than a glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night

For the animals soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

We begin the hunt tonight
Til the power courses the creatures take flight
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied
You're mine

For the animals soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

For the animals soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine in Hell tonight

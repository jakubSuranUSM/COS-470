Can't you see that we are
Running out of time
I am dying but I will not die
Somebody save me from myself
Somebody save me

Stop, wait a minute
Stop, sinking in it
Woe, not again
Now stop it you're exaggerating
Stop

Life's so screwed up
And I can't describe
All the bullshit that I feel inside
Somebody save me form my hell
Somebody save me
Stop

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody please before I melt
Somebody save me from my hell
Somebody save me
Save me

Stop

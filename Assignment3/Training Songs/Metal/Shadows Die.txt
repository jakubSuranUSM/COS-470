Tear down the cross
Splinters and shards remembered
This Trojan horse
Rode to the land we enter

We'll burn away
And free and fallen brothers
From shackles made of steel
And bones of soldiers

Yeah!

Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
The church of lies
Can't tell me what is right

Our little victories and desires won't live on
Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
I feel alive

I feel alive, yeah

In fear and faith (in fear and faith)
The candles light our freedom
By tainted night
We live this war of wisdom

The streets are stained
With blood that ran their kingdom
And feed the beast
That lies beneath our treason

Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
The church of lies
Can't tell me what is right

Our little victories and desires won't live on
Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
I feel alive

F.e.a.r will round up these rebels!
These deviates! these so called wild ones!
We'll lecture the streets with their bones!
And annihilate the dangerous and obtuse ideas poisoning your children!
Endangering your freedom!
Giving rise to the destruction
Of the benevolent future we have prepared for you!
You belong in the shadows!
The shadows are where you will be made safe!
Do not disobey!

Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
A church of lies
Can't tell me what is right

Our little victories and desires won't live on
Let shadows die
So I can feel alive
I feel alive

(I feel alive)

Is this our last chance to say all we have to say?
Hiding here inside ourselves, we live our lives afraid
so close your eyes and just believe in everything you’re told
Cause in this land of great confusion, it’s easy to give up control

Strange world, people talk and tell only lies
Strange world, people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world, dream one day we’ll see the light
Strange world, believe and everything will be alright

And this is the place everything begins and ends again
No secrets left to find, no seven deadly sins
This world that we have wasted, has kept us very well
When science now is sacred, who will save us from ourselves?

Strange world, people talk and tell only lies
Strange world, people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world, dream one day we’ll see the light
Strange world, believe and everything will be alright

Strange world, people talk, sometimes I wonder why
Strange world, ṗeople kill, still no one hears their cries

Strange world, people talk and tell only lies
Strange world, people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world, dream one day we’ll see the light
Strange world, believe and everything will be alright
Burn these thoughtless tears out of my eyes
Still I wonder, wonder why

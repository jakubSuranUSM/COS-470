So you think you've calmed down
But your still the same now
You think you can hide truth
But its all inside you

Don't go to far
To hide your heart

Fake man
Give it all up
Fake what you can 
It's all wrong

Your not Jesus, Your not God
I know you think I am wrong 
You don't have to open up 
I can see you 
Well enough 

Fake man
Give it all up
Fake what you can 
It's all wrong

You go too far
To hide your heart

Fake man
Give it all up
Fake what you can 
It's all wrong

You have nothing
I can't break
I'm sure you feel cheated
You are something
I can't take
It's all you have to give

Please tell me how to think
Please tell me what to say
Please tell me what to do
Please tell me how I should behave

Please tell me what to sing
Please tell me what to play
Please tell me how to act
Please tell me the rules of your game

Please tell me who I should be
Please tell me what to do
Please tell me how to please
I really want to be like you

Really done it now, sold out
But to who, what, when, where and how,
Yeah, really done it now, sold out,
I've taken my cut
And corporate rock really sucks

Don't try and tell me how to think
Don't tell me what to say
Don't tell me what to do
Don't try and tell me how to behave

Don't tell me how to sing
Don't tell me how I should play
Don't tell me how to act
I don't want to play to your game

Don't tell me who I should be
Don't tell me what to do
Its myself I'm trying to please,
Don't anyone, least of all, you.

Really done it now, sold out
But to who, what, when, where and how
Yeah, really done it now, sold out
I've taken my cut

Yeah, really done it now, sold out
But to who, what, when, where and how,
Yeah, really done it now, sold out
I've taken my cut

Yeah, really done it now, sold out,
But to who, what, when, where and how,
Yeah, really done it now, sold out
I've taken my cut
And corporate rock really does suck

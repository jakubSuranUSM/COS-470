All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I’m reaching but it’s too high

Is this the end, the fall of man?
Did we take nothing from the meaning of change for the masses?
We’re never gonna learn
If all we do is take, take, no return
Blame it on the outside, close the curtains
Dare me to explain why we don’t deserve
The land that we fill and the blood that they spill
Not a selfish intention, an order to kill
Kill, kill, kill, ourselves with the question, destroy or rebuild?
Singing SOS to ourselves

All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I’m reaching but it’s too high

It’ll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we've made
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace, we’ll need you
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a god’s looking down we’ll give them something to lose
 
We’ll give them something to lose

Assailants, second nature hypocrites
Tell me that it’s not as bad as it may seem
Surviving this death trap by the skin of our teeth
Oxygen thieves 
Are we just oxygen thieves?

Survival of the sickest
We’re the casualties that keep living
The same shit over and over again
The end is coming­­
The end is coming­­

It’ll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we've made
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace, we’ll need you

It’ll take a hurricane, to clean up all the mess we've made
If we’re gonna fly this flag of peace, we’ll need you
We need to dig this up from the roots
And if a god’s looking down we’ll give them something to lose

Yeah, yeah
From seeing the bright light
Yeah, yeah

All my thoughts are useless
They keep me from seeing the bright light
Falling down this well now
I’m reaching but it’s too high

I don't give a f*ck
You don't give a f*ck
They don't give a f*ck
Get back in the front

I don't give a f*ck
You don't give a f*ck
We don't give a f*ck
Get back to the front

No one to trust
Just blood in the dust
Things just getting worse
Worse, worse, and worse

You kill, no remorse
You die, for what cause
They kill, no remorse
They die, for what cause

Back to the
Back to the
Back to the front lines
Back to the
Back to the
Back to the front lines

I don't give a f*ck
You don't give a f*ck
They don't give a f*ck
Get back in the front

I don't give a f*ck
You don't give a f*ck
We don't give a f*ck
Get back to the front

At war, once more
Peace is another sign that falls
I didn't want to be in war
But it follows me once more

For what, I don't know
I don't understand
Can you tell me who has won?
When nothing remains

Back to the
Back to the
Back to the front lines
Back to the
Back to the
Back to the front lines

Back da f*ck up now
Shut da f*ck up now
Back to da front now
Back to the front lines

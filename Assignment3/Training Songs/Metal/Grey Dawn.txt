I painted with rain the sight of the daybreak, 
As being in need of a momentary remake 
The life I am leading is the way of depravity, 
A threat to my already poisoned sanity 

Grey dawn, everlasting 

Hope is utopia for all that I know, 
When counting the seconds time moves so slow 
I can't feel any will to be part of this fight 
A cure is however to put thrust in the night 

I learn from this life to hide from humanity, 
And night has told me how to kill my anxiety 
The ghost of my smile dances in the pale, 
And I know all my efforts most likely will fail

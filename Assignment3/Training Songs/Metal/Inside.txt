Yeah 
Break my frustration 
Crack the walls that hold me inside 
Never seen the light go shining through 
Never seemed to like the likes of you 
Are you happy now 
You broke me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
Should I act now 
You break me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
Is it just lack of respect 
These things you do to me 
Jealousy is all I see 
But you complicate things 
Manipulate me 
But there's nothing left to believe 
Are you happy now 
You broke me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
Should I act now 
You break me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
I swear words keep on speaking 
Secrets that your keeping 
Tongue tied too tied to part of you 
Are you happy now 
You broke me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
Should I act now 
You break me on the inside 
The inside of my soul 
The inside of my soul 
You sick why can't you just leave me alone 
The inside of my.. 
The inside of soul

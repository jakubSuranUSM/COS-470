A place we could live, you know of it.
It's a rockin place you all show it.
If you want some fun, well come right over.
It's a place to be, we all know that.

We just want to tell you about it so you don't miss out.

In America, the home of the free, the strong and the weak.
In America, a young child's heart, just give em' a start
In America.

Now that we told you about it you just scream and shout and you're proud of it.

Bridge, chorus

In America, the home of the free, the strong and the weak.
In America, a young child's heart just give 'em a start.
In America, the families we love the man up above
In America, a place we'll grow and grow to be old,
In America.

Lead, bridge, chorus out.

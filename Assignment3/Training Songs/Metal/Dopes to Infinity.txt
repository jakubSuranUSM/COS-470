I can see by the hole in your head
That you want to be friends
You're the right one baby

I can tell by the moon in your eyes
That you're loved by the tribe
You're the right one baby

[Chorus]
Hook you up to the coil of the one
Who makes time with the sun
And who keeps up pumping
See your mind on the hood of my car
And forever is power
As the world keeps dumping down

We are the only ones

Put the earth
In the crook of your arm now
Tease it and charm it
And watch life spray everywhere

I have something more cosmic in mind
It's a warpage of time
And it's bliss for everyone

[Chorus]

We are the only ones, oh yeah
Yeah, we are the only ones

(What can I say?)
(What can I say?)
(What can I say?)
(What can I say?)

We are all here but my friend
All dead and spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here but my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful
We are all here but my friend
All dead and spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here but my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful

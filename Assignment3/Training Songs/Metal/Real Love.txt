I lie awake in the morning light
No one to hold
Another sleepless night.
'Cause its over now that you've left me
Oh so lonely...

Oh i hear it calling
Oh i hear it calling

Real love; wont somebody show me?
Real love; isnt anyone true anymore?
Real love; wont somebody show me?
Real love where are you?

All through my life
I've been feelin' down
Searchin to find
Im lost and not found
There's gotta be someone
Someone who understands me

Oh i hear it calling
Oh cant you hear it calling

Real love wont somebody show me?
Real love isnt anyone true anymore?
Real love wont somebody show me?
Real love where are you?

Im in love
Love, love, love
Real love
Where are you?

Oh where are you?

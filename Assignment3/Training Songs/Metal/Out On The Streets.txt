Far, far away.
I'd like to touch you, but you're not here today
Now's the time I need you most,
I think about the days we lost
Baby, I need you here.

I'm out on the streets alone tonight
Lookin' for you, it don't seem right
Baby, don't you know I'm fallin' apart
How could you break my heart?

Walking down the avenues, the ones I would walk with you
It's funny how the nights last so long
And with the dawn, comes another day
Why won't you come, baby?
Can't you see I can't hold on?

I'm out on the streets again tonight
Lookin' for you, it don't seem right
Baby, don't you know I'm fallin' apart
How could you break my heart?

And so, comes another day
My life without you seems to slip away
I'm holding back the tears no more
I feel like I'm locked behind these doors
Will you walk with me someday?

I'm out on the streets alone tonight
Lookin' for you, it don't seem right
Baby, don't you know I'm fallin' apart
How could you break my heart?

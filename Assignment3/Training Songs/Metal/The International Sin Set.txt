I don't hurt anybody by walking barefoot
I don't hurt anybody by working in the garden
I don't hurt anybody by just running around at night
I don't hurt anybody!
I just want to be myself

The heat is on
Watch out baby
The heat is on
Watch out baby, here we come
The heat is on
Watch out baby
The heat is on
Yeah we're wild and on the run
The International Sin Set

A scene of crime
It's hot when you're in
The International Sin Set
For international sin
Didn't somebody tie you up the other day?

Yeah
Why did they tie you up?
Ã¢??Cause I said i was leaving
Didn't somebody tie you up the other day?
Yeah, I was forced to stay some place like a slave
Sounds real groovy and the house is smooth
There's a devil on the floor and he wants to groove
To the cool rude rhythm of a dangerous beat
He's shakin' up your body to confuse your feet
We'll it's time to move it
So let's get to it

Trippin' to the bass ya know it makes me want to do it
With the ladies of lust that you'll never forget
Keep on pumpin' to the rhythm of the jammin' sin set

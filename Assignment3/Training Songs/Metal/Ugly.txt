Have you ever woke up screaming?
Have you ever woke alone?
When the walls around you won't stop laughing
Where do you go?
Sweat seeps in your eyes at night
And you realize
That no one understands you at all
Well I was bound to have a nervous breakdown
Should've seen it coming from miles away
So I packed my bags and started running
My brains been shaking since yesterday
But there's only so far that you can run boy
There's only so far to leave your problems behind
'cause when the problem's yourself you start thinking
No matter how far
You'll never leave it behind
No one uderstands me at all
Now I'm 22 with still no clue
Of who I am or show I'm supposed to be
I know it to you it sounds funny
You've got it worked out like it's a fuckin' disease
Started asking myself do I fit in?
Where I belong
Could this really be me?
Been feeling downright ugly
Tell me is this the way it's supposed to be?
So what's the difference?
You're doing fine
The clock keeps ticking as you lose your mind
The one you need to call you
Never calls
Sweat seeps in your eyes at night
And you realize
That no one understands you at all

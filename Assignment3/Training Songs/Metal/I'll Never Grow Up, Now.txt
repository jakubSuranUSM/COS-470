They say:
Hey whadaya doin' with your life
Why don'tcha settle down 
And find yourself a wife
Don't You know you can't run away from here
When will you act your age
Why don't you listen dear

I say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now

They say:
When will you go to school
Why don'tcha get a job
Hey girl you better shape up
You're lookin' like a slob
You think that life's a free ride
Well, take a tip from me
We're gonna end your party
With some responsibility

[Chorus: x2]

I can't believe you can't hear what you're saying
Take a good look at yourself
Why don'tcha listen to the music we're playing
Go pick on somebody else

They say:
You better stop your dreamin' 
You're going nowhere fast
What if we throw you out
How long you think you'll last
You think that life's a free ride
Well take a tip from me
We're gonna end your party
With some responsibility

[Chorus: x2]

Alright

Seeing their children, caught up in the latest fad
Their parents are worried thinking they've gone bad
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed at all, changed in our world

Taking their axes, they're turning an amber red
Making a noise able to wake the dead
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed at all, changes tomorrow

Looking through windows only to see the rain
The way they are moving, ground zero attack my brain
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed at all, changed in our world

Every thing's the same, nothing has changed
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed at all, changed in our world
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed
Every thing's the same, nothing has changed at all, changed in our world

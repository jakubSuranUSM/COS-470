Uncertain I ride to calm myself
I'm searchin' for something
That gets me out of this place
I need this
Like the Devil needs Jesus
Like a war needs treason
I've been through hell for a reason
(I see my life just slipping away)

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane
And at the moment life starts to burn
I'm gonna ride this sunset to the grave

Ticking faster, I can see the end
I'm reaching out, to pull myself
Up to see again
I need this
Like an angel that's bleeding
(Right now)
I hear the Devil screaming
We go through hell for a reason
(I see my life just slippin' away)

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane
And at the moment life starts to burn
I'm gonna ride this sunset to the grave

(What's) the meaning
(Try) to understand
(Why) the feeling's stuck inside of me
(What's) the meaning of
(Try) Trying to understand
(Why) It's always up in lies
Lies! Lies! Lies!

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane
And at the moment life starts to burn
I'm gonna ride this sunset to the grave

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane
And at the moment life starts to burn
I'm gonna ride this sunset to the grave
Why?! Why?! Why?! Lies!

Arrival in the night
Out of nowhere
Telling stories about a butcher
A living dead

I eat your flesh
Take your strength
Absorb your spirit
I feel so strong

You're one of us
Give in to it
Eat or die
Eat or die

No, he was licking my wounds
No, he had his lips on my wounds

Stabbing, stabbing, stabbing, stabbing, I'll rip you to pieces
My ravenous hunger becomes a craving for more

Ravenous, ravenous, blood thirst in your eyes
Ravenous, ravenous, i hunger for your flesh

Drowning in darkness
You panic when life slips away
You gotta eat
If you wanna be one of us

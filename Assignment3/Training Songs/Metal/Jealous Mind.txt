Why is it I must know the things you're doin'
A-Ho-Ho Ho-A-Ho
It's just my jealous mind

And when you're not at home
I just can't take it
A-Ho-Ho Ho-A-Ho
It's just my jealous mind

I dread the time when you might leave me
Deep in my heart
I know you'll never go
Oh
say you'll need me
You could be out with him
And I would never know
A-Ha-Ho Ho-A-Ho
It's just my jealous mind

I dread the time when you might leave me
Deep in my heart I know
You'll never go
Oh
say you'll need me
Stay with me all the time
Say there's no other guy
A-Ha-Ho Ho-A-Ho
It's just my jealous mind
I love you so
oh
it's just my jealous mind
Forgive my jealous mind
It's just my jealous mind
Blame it on my jealous mind
I can't help my jealous mind
It is just my jealous mind
It's in love that I'm so blind
Blame it on my jealous mind
So forgive my jealous mind

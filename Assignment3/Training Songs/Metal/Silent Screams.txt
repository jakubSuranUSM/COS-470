Look at me I'm chasing
After dreams left in the storm
What I am is all
That really matters now
That lies are gone -
That lies are gone,
All the lies are gone,
The lies are gone.

Tempting fate and losing
Friends along the way I loved
No regrets
I'm standing
With a needle in my heart -
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart.

You'll never know
My life means everything
Still I scream because
There's nothing left to do until the end.

The world goes on
With all that I've become
And still I scream inside
For all the pain I've taken hasn't changed.

Nothing's changed at all
The truth is like a chain
Heaven's calling me
The place that I belong
Killing pain -
Killing pain.

Close my eyes a million faces
Get inside my mind.
Take a breath and fill my troubled
Soul with all mankind.
Killing pain -
Killing pain,
I'm killing pain,
Killing pain.

The world goes on
With all that I've become.
And still I scream inside
For all the pain I've taken hasn't changed...

The man in black
I'm coming back to spew my evil hate.
My crown of horns and bloody thorns
I'll dig up what you fear.

I am the shape that's in your room that watches over you.
I am the needle in your heart - your disillusioned God.

I am God, I am fate, I am all the sins you make, yeah - hate.
I am black, I am white, I am the blood upon the knife, yeah - hate.

Since time began I made a vow to drag you underground;
To steal your soul of purity and watch you waste away.

I am pure, I am right, I'm the God that makes you fight, yeah - hate.
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final breath, yeah - hate.

I prey upon your broken dreams your weakness gives me strength.
I'm laughing at your silent screams I'll crush you with my hate.

You take it all
And face the fear that's here
Until the Silence Screams
it leaves you with no choice to carry on.

You'll never fall
When all is said and done
The only Scream is here
The journey never ends - it's just begun...

The lies that never learned
The needles in my heart
And things will never change
So everytime I scream I'm killing pain.

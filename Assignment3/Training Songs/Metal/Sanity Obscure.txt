The end of time is drawing near
The angels prepare for the harvest
Separation of the wicked and righteous
The corrupt the fire infest

Sifting of humanity
Extirpation of the heathen
Cast into the infinite holocaust
Where time's end is never seen

Signs of the end have come
Nation will rise against nation
Famines wage war on the land
The birth pains have begun

These omens of sanity are obscured
Hidden from the insane minds
Though seeing they do not see
They hear but understanding can't find

This people's heart has become calloused
Their eyes they willfully seal
Otherwise their eyes might see
And in turn become healed

Blurred visions
Sanity obscure

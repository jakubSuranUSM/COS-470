Dark lady coming out at night
Still glory
Let's those legs on fire
She's going to take away your life
And there's a mess beyond the killing fields
A shock
Bells ringing from the city tower
It's a woman
People running
Girl haunted
Death kiss walking down the long road
And now she's big enough
The world is gonna die
The time it slips away
You can't stop oh no
She may give us death kiss
She may give us a kiss
Everything is turned upside down
There's a child there divine
Dark lady taking care again, yeah
Now she's walking back to hell with just her hands
The time it slips away
You can't stop oh no
It's death kiss
Ah a little child
Ah she's gonna die
The child has lost its way
The child is dead
Oh oh oh she's dead

“It was told that conviction never dies
Yet there was a sense of numbness and loss of emotion”

Look at my face and fall away bleeding black decision
I am the one unfortunate son knee deep in division
Look at my face, stare in my eyes, witness what never dies
Crave indifference my own
System enslaved and stoned

Fractured and burned the world is turned
The arrogant feed the fascists
Hate is front page stacked in their graves
Disposable lives have vanished
I've made indifference my own

System enslaved and stoned

If everything is frozen, nothing feels the same
If the martyr is the chosen, welcome to the hollow game

Look at my faith and count the days
The opulent train, the tragic
Torture reborn through hate and scorn
In arrogant ways impassive
Look at my face, stare in my eyes, witness what never dies
Crave indifference my own
System enslaved and stoned

If everything is frozen, nothing feels the same
If the martyr is the chosen, welcome to the hollow game

If everything is frozen, nothing feels the same
If the martyr is the chosen, welcome to the hollow game
If everything is frozen, only gods can feel the shame
If the circle is unbroken, welcome to the hollow game

Rift in the populace, a community divide
Young men deprived of life, a battalion full of pride
Can’t rely on the press, all they spread are lies 
A multitude of people pissed off nationwide

A peaceful protest to no avail
It may be worthy but their order shall prevail

Robots patrol the skies, information they collect
Movements are monitored and curfews in effect
ISIS and Ebola to distract us from their lies
Preferential laws are passed right before our eyes

Civil disorder on a grand scale 
If we do nothing than their order shall prevail

The peace will cease 
Terror in the streets 
Tear gas and riot gear
Turmoil severe

So quick to throw hands…
So eager to use force… 
Global oppressor, the world police
Freedom and liberty, now deceased

Maintain the structure, equalize
Threaten the postwar ordinance
World super powers consolidate
The pockets of the affluent inflate

Your life they dictate.
Herald the slave state.

A peaceful protest to no avail
It may be worthy but their order shall prevail

Civil disorder on a grand scale 
If we do nothing than their order shall prevail

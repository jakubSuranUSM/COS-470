What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last night,
About what we want to be
I sit now with his hand in mine,
But, I know he can't feel (feel)

No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother,
And she cries endlessly
Lord, how we miss him,
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life,
But, it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows, what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone)

He as hollow as I alone,
A shell of my friend,
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul,
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above

Mad
At gods
Mad

He as hollow as I converse,
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through,
I want to come in after you

My Best friend
My Best friend

Whoa, yeah 
Come back

(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)

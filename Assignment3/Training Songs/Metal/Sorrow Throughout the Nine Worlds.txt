(Balder) 

Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's foreseen gloryful
Please Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere

(Odin)

 My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn

(Balder) 

The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see

Loki the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death

Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loki
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one

Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fell to his knees dying

Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Niflheim by the deceitful

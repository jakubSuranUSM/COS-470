Your solution, your proposition
It does repulse me, has me sick
I paid with my blood, my sweat and tears
To be in your school, your stubborn course

Counting numbers, without luck yeah
If I speak in a fowl tongue, you'll have my words
To realize and see, with an open eye
Gives you the magic, to give not die

It's not because of you
That I sit this one through
It's not because of you
And I'm still in love with what I do

Saints are coming, around the bend
Without you knowing, they'll eat you brain
Choices were made and the members wrong
Miles were driven
We were lost not gone

It's not because of you
That I sit this one through
It's not because of you
And I'm still in love with what I do

It's all because of you
That I sit this one through
It's all because of you
That I'm still in love with what I do

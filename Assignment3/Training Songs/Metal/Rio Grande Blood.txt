And now a message from the President of the United States George W. Bush
I've adopted sophisticated terrorist tactics
And I'm a dangerous, dangerous man
With dangerous, dangerous weapons
I want to drain the coal resources in America
And foreign sources of crude oil.
I'm a weapon of mass destruction
And I'm a brutal dictator
And I'm evil

I've got something that I must confess
I make a profit off people oppressed
I take the money Ã¢??til there's nothing left
And all I gotta say is Yippie Aye Yay

[Chorus]
Rio Grande Blood

I want money
I want yer money
I want crude oil
It's the government's money
I'm an asshole

I can't remember the world such a mess
Not for the companies I like the best
Exxon and Conoco f*ck all the rest
And all I gotta say is Yippie Aye Yay

[Chorus]

I want money
I want yer money
I want crude oil
It's the government's money

We went to war because of our dependence on foreign oil Haliburton
We went to war because of money
Haliburton
We will settle for nothing less than victory, victory
Haliburton
We will settle for nothing less than crude oil -crude oil
Verse 3
Squeezing the middle class whom I detest
Taxing the poor so the rich can invest
I know I'm an asshole, but aren't you impressed
And all I gotta say is Yippie Aye Yay

[Chorus]

Rio Grande Blood
Rio Grande Blood
I want crude oil
Rio Grande Blood
I want money
Rio Grande Blood

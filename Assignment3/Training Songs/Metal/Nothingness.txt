Well like a descendant, I drifted far, far and wide
Isolation, separation, no where to hide
Maybe there's somewhere I can go
Where there's sunshine and the wind won't blow

Nothingness
All I have to feel is my loneliness
Nothing in the attic 'cept an empty chest
And nothing lasts forever

Although there are many, I look for no one, no one but me
I search for things that are taking me high and far out of reach
But this is the place I call my home
I live with the lies and the fear all alone

Nothingness
All I have to feel is my loneliness
Nothing in the attic 'cept an empty chest
And nothing lasts forever

Nothingness
All I have to feel is my lonliness
Nothing in the attic 'cept an empty chest
And nothing lasts forever

Nothingness
Loneliness
Empty chest
And nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

Man, it was mean to be seen in the robes you wore for Lent 
You must've known that it was Easter
There for a while, in your smile, I could see Mexico blood 
Say this is true, I was a teaser
There were a thousand man-eaters being exchanged for Pesetas
Man, it was hard not to laugh out loud
I couldn't believe the size of the crowd
You must have fooled them into coming
Wow! There were women and children, too
They would have hanged us if they knew
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, you only came for the party
Man, it was mean, it was mean, man, it was mean

Remember the time, what a time, we had down in Barcelona 
After you'd been slaying babies
There, for a time, I was fooled by your disguises 
But I never thought of smashing rules
You wore the yellow bandana and gave out Heavenly Manna
Then in Amsterdam you were perfect fun
You never let on you had a gun 
And then you shot that Spanish Dancer
The speed at which we ran for a mile or two 
They would have crucified us if they knew
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, we only killed for the party
Man, it was mean, it was mean, man, it was mean

You think you're important and clever
I tell you now where that's at
You can be this way forever and ever
Sooner or later you'll fall

Man, show me something I've never seen
You're only real in your Dream Machine
And all your games are a little drastic
Just throw me out if I get obscene 
But that's the way that I've always been
I think I know for certain
Inside you sniggered so hearty, we're only living a party
Man, it was mean, it was mean, man, it was mean

Ooh ooh we're having a party, ooh ooh we're having a party ....

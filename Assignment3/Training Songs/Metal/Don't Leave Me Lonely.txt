saw you again, at a matinee this afternoon,
I was alone, and watching only you.

Deep in you eyes,
you show the world your broken heart.
I tears me apart,
I should have realized from the start.
But I can't understand,
how I got to feeling like I do.
I just know that I do,
and I've got to tell you soon.

Chorus:
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.

On the silver screen,
you're a part of every fantasy.
You gave me a dream,
that keeps me here with you.

Chorus:
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.

I saw your face, and I like you style.
So please stay awhile, just a little while....

Solo

The curtains close,
I view the final scene,
We part again,
But don't let the movie end.

Chorus:
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.
Oh no, don't go, don't leave me lonely.

Maybe I act on confused behaviour
Maybe waves crash like semi-trailer
Maybe I'll spend my off-time without you
It seems like we need our own space

And all the time I wasted away
I don't feel good unless you stay
And all the time I chased you away
Simply to catch back up with

[Chorus]
Your solitude is welcome
Your attitude is welcome

All you see is red lights behind me
Maybe this isn't what you wanted, baby
I don't blame you falling backwards
No one's ever quite confused you this way

And all this time we wasted away
We don't feel good unless we're gray
And all the times I chased you away
I simply don't feel good

[Chorus]

All this time, we heard alarms
Come to find, we fell apart
This whole thing has crashed down, crashed down
All this time, we heard alarms

[Chorus]

You are welcome

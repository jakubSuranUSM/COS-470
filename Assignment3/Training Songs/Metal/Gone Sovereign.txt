No ones laughing now
No ones laughing now
I'm so late to say it
And you can't put a price on me

I won't share this disarray
I won't pull these hands away
I need to be chosen and my god, don't break from me

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If following the command means we'll survive
Is anybody here still left alive
This is mine

Come no further, 
You'll go to far
I'm running around in circles once again
If you can forgive me
I won't take it very hard
But I won't make it easy in the end

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If following the command means we'll survive
Is anybody here still left alive

This is mine
This is mine
Yeah

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If following the command means we'll survive
Is anybody here still left alive

This is mine
Mine, mine, mine

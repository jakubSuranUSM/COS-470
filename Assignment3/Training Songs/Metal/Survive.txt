Now we'll see what remains on this word
Only the strong will survive
A hopeless end for those without the will
Only the strong will survive
Now we'll see what remains for the weak, there's not much
A hopeless end for those without the will
Only the strong will survive
The Nuclear age has left it's mark
Only the strong will survive

In the quiet of evening I start to drift away, 
Imagining a place where you'll be starting off your day, 
I fight the distance with a picture in my head, 
But I don't know when I'll see you, 
I guess I'll have to dream instead, 
You're so far away, 
If I could I'd be with you, 
Even if for just one day. 

'Cause if I close my eyes and dream on, 
I can fool myself with sound and vision, 
Like a satellite reaching out through the night, 
I could almost be touching you. 

And when we're talking long distance on the phone, 
You know it makes me feel like I'm not so alone, 
The situation never causes me pain, 
The comminucation that we have is on another plane, 
All the waiting makes me stronger, 
And the time between us flies 

Whenever I close my eyes and dream on, 
I can fool myself with sound and vision, 
Like a satellite reaching out through the night, 
I could almost be touching you. 

If I could I'd be with you, 
Even if for just one day, 
Those miles between us, they just start fading away. 

Whenever I close my eyes and dream on, 
I can fool myself with sound and vision, 
Like a satellite reaching out through the night, 
I could almost be touching you.

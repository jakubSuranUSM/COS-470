In the misty morning after darkest night,
I feel the heat, I do, and I remember,
Promises are broken now you're gone.
Don't turn me down,
I'm lost and I surrender...

Give me just a sign,
Help to cross the line,
We'll back time and starts again.

Far away - I can you're callin',
Far away - callin' up my name.
Far away - and the tears are fallin',
Far away - no one is to blame...

Some feelings won't come easy,
You have to hit them hard.
You've burned the bridge,
And I fell in a sea of sorrow.
Can you hear my prayer,
Just bring back yesterday,
I feel the pain, it makes me hate tomorrow...

Take me for a while,
Just to make me smile.
I wish I'll never ever cry again.

Far away - I can hear you're callin',
Far away - callin' up my name.
Far away - and the tears are fallin',
Far away - no one is to blame...

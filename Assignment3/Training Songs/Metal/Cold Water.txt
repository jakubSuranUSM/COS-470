Twisting through contorted limb 
Sober now from distant whim 
Batten down the hatches 
The storm approaches, the thunder crashes 
It cannot wait 
It must be now 
A shot’s been fired across the bow 
What presence here has been proclaimed? 
What once was unspoken is finally named 

So this is sinking, or so it seems 
Diving fathoms in lucid dreams 
With lungs now aching, begging for air 
And only cold water answers 
With a cinder block anchor, hope turns to despair 
Ripped from the womb and left to the ocean’s care 
Cold water 

So just sink, let go, slip into the depths 
Let the pieces of a wasted life slip past the fingertips 
Rejoice, exult, a fitting conclusion to a melancholy myth 
A grave at sea, an absentee, whose presence won’t be missed 

Picking at the bones that came to rest on the ocean bed 
Whose subtle pose tells a tale of those that sink like lead 
Summon the ire left hanging in moments that swings by the neck to and fro. 
Assured by the light that there’s one way to go 

Death is callous, strange, and sudden 
A pious, indignant glutton 
Whose hands are soft, warm, and inviting

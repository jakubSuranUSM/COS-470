When all the colors begin to fade
And the imitations turn to grey
When the Iron Man begins to rust
And the Holy Water turns to dust
What will be your savior now
Dragon or machine
Who will wear the crown of thorns
In Mother Nature's dream
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother
When believers start to lose the faith
And the naked army falls from grace
When all extremes return to one
See them melt into the setting sun
The bounty on the rebel's heart
Washed away the pride
Drove the voice a million miles
Across the great divide
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
Who's the one
Who denied my eyes to see
Truth behind double tongue
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother
The bounty on the rebel's heart
Washed away the pride
Drove the voice a million miles
Across the great divide
Who's the one
Who claimed my libery
Robbed my soul of freedom
Who's the one
Who denied my eyes to see
Truth behind double tongue
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother

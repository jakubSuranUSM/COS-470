Your beauty is deeper than the sea
But you're still working on your abc's
When you're with me and you speak your mind 
I'm afraid of what my friends might find

Because you're beautiful when you don't talk

The kind of girl that I would stalk
But you open your mouth and you break the spell
Talking doesn't do you well
More beautiful than the rarest jewel
But when you open your mouth you're such a tool
When I ruminate on all the things you said
It's clear your parents dropped you on your head

Because you're beautiful when you don't talk

The attention span of a pet rock
When you try to connect it becomes quite clear
There's nothing in between your ears
There's nothing going on upstairs
Like headlights shining on a dear
We talked for 30 seconds, now there's nothing left to say
So it's one more Boston Pancake and I'll be on my way 

You're beautiful , so beautiful and young
If only you had been born without a tongue
Please don't come out of your shell

Because you're beautiful when you don't talk
Because you're beautiful when you don't talk
But you open your mouth and you break the spell

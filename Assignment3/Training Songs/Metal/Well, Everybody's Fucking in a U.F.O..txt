This is the story of the one-eyed wolf
Called the honey of super doom
She rode her five-legged beast
In a mirrored bikini right out of the womb
They chased each other with the steam and knives
Screaming oil is in my veins
And then she grabbed a big old pipe
And smoked up some fine old monkey brains, get on it

Now some say that one-eyed wolf
Owned midget who was almost ten feet tall
He spray-painted UFO's are real
In the rubble of the Berlin wall
So finally on that fateful day they went looking for a Superman
Singing "I'm gonna get my twenty bucks and vacation in Japan"

Look out

Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up

Now every night this wolf comes a peeping through through filthy glory holes
He's pounding on a rubber bat and a big old jelly roll
I said look to the skies I think I saw a spaceship ready to feast
But all they had was jizz on the walls
And bones of a mangled priest

Look out

Now baby doll what do you say
When the spacemen comes to town
I think he's got a one-track mind
And he likes to boogie down
So in the end all she did was murder metropolis
And show us big "f*ck the world" carved right onto her chest

Look out

Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Well everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up

Sound is ripping through your ears 
The deafening sound of metal nears 
Your bodies waiting for his whips 
The taste of leather on your lips 

Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 

Victims falling under chains you hear them crying death pains 
The fists of terrors breaking through now there's nothing you can do 

Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 

The leather armies have prevailed the phantom lord has never failed 
Smoke is lifting from the ground the rising volume metal sound 

Hear the cry of war louder than before 
With his sword in hand to control the land 
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night 
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord 

Fall to your knees 
And bow to the phantom lord

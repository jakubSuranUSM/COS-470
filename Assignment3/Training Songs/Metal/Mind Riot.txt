I was slipping through the cracks of a stolen jewel
I was tightrope walking in two ton shoes
Now somebody is talking about a third world war
And the police said this was normal control (I've been caught in a mind riot)

Candle's burning yesterday
Somebody's best friend died
And I've been caught in a mind riot (mind riot)

I was crying from my eye teeth and bleeding from my soul 
And I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull
I built an elevator from his bones
Had climb to the top floor just to stamp out the coals (I've been caught in a mind riot)

Candle's burning yesterday
Somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot

I'm tied within

Candle's burning yesterday
Like somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot

I'm tied within
I'm luck's last match struck
In the pouring down wind, pouring down wind

(Mind riot)

I recall something that you don't
I see the sun in your eyes
I recall something that you don't
Your sun will set on you (woo hoo)

I recall something that you don't
(you lied, you compramised, you said
Yourself, you wanted to be free)
I recall something that you don't
(from all the rigmarole, you said)
I recall something that you don't
(yourself, you wanted to be free.)

What you said
Is what you wanted
You're ill prepared
What you wanted
And what you said (what you said)
Is what you needed (is what you needed)
I got the best time for deliverance
It's time for deliverance

I recall something that you don't
I hear the song in your sigh
I recall something that you don't
I recall running to you-hoo

I recall something that you don't
(you lied, you compramised, you said
Yourself, you wanted to be free)
I recall something that you don't
(from all the rigmarole, you said)
I recall something that you don't
(yourself, you wanted to be free.)

What you said
Is what you wanted
You're ill prepared
What you wanted
And what you said (what you said)
Is what you needed (is what you needed)
I got the best time for deliverance
It's time for deliverance

I recall something that you don't
(i see the sun in your eyes)
I recall something that you don't
The sun is set on you (woo hoo)

I recall something that you don't
(you lied, you compramised, you said
Yourself, you wanted to be free)
I recall something that you don't
(from all the rigmarole, you said)
I recall something that you don't
(yourself, you wanted to be free.)

What you said
Is what you wanted
You're ill prepared
What you wanted
And what you said (what you said)
Is what you needed (is what you needed)
I got the best time for deliverance
It's time for deliverance

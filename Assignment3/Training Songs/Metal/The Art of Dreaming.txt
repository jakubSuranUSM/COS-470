Empty is the world that's known to you 
I left it behind, to eternity I broke through 
Thousand times I dreamt and woke up in my bed 
One time in another dream, on earth I was dead 

I know of seven gates of dreaming 
That one can enter into a separate reality 
Not in ordinary dreams, they are not as the seem 
Nothing real, the dreamer's fantasy 

But if the dreamer starts to get control 
Entities of other dimensions cross his way 
His dreambody awakes and the wings of his soul 
But woe to those not strong enough, a deadly price they pay

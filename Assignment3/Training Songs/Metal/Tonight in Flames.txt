When contrary winds blow across the sands
Their murmurs can be easily swayed
But when storms quicken one cannot placate
The howling of their murderous rages

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about our precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames

There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
Suffer not the infidel!Suffer not the infidel!
Assure your place in paradise here

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
I will avenge her, do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames

I went to see her dance one day
In play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal

The Eastern sword must fall

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about our precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble hearth
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames

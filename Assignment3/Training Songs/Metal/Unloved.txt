Speaking tongues
Chasing failing light
Hoping that your voice is more than just an echo of my own
All I ever wanted was clarity
An end to my own unrest and a sure thing
I gave my everything
I gave my fucking everything
No help
No guidance
No miracles
I gave my everything and now all I'm left with
Are these voices in my head screaming
"You are unloved. You are meaningless."
This will be emptiness
This will be loneliness 
No God
No hope
No fucking way out
This was always meant to fall apart

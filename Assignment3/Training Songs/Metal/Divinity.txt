Last day brings the grace
For bearers of forbidden name
Step into five fold mace
As son as father in a frame

Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears are frozen tears whisper
Things that no one hears
Cry now, cry now for me again
Tomorrows pride and pain
Why you kneel before my name

Crushing my belief
And make shape to my relief
For who you set your prayers
I can't hear them anyway

Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears are frozen tears whisper
Things that no one heras
Cry now, cry now for me again
Tomorrows pride and pain
Why you kneel before my name

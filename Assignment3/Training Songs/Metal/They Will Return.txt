Rhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defense

My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report

They rise into the air and fly away

[Chorus]
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge

[Chorus]

Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again

They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
But they will return!

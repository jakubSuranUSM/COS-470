I can't conceal
The way I feel
It's time for me to go

Don't ask me why
Don't even try
To stop me as I go

I'll be back somewhere, someway
Don't feel alone
One fine day
You'll heard me say
"Darlin' I'm home"

I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
When you dream of me each night
Remember me this way

A tear that falls
A voice that calls
Is all I've left to you

A last goodbye
The tears I cry
I dedicate to you

I'll just go on missing you
So, until then
I'll just dream of kissing you
Again and again

I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
When you dream of me each night
Remember me this way

I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
In the stillness of the night
Remember me this way

There's sin in my heart
But I stand accused
Of crimes that I did not commit
Tried and confined
Judged by your eyes
But I am an innocent man

Bound and forsaken
Liberty taken
A life in the void
Is now transformed into a life destroyed

Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go

Into the fray
I am the prey
Fear is the air that I breathe
Imprisoned by hate
Ensnared by my fate
I wish for nothing but to escape

My mind drifts away
To once better days
Order once resigned
Where I've never seen true corruption

Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go

I will not be held
I won't be contained
Tear down the walls
Nothing remains

Tried and confined
Judged by your eyes
But I am an innocent man

Seven years alone
And eighteen more to go
The curse of time ain't on my side
But I will not let go
I will never let go
I will not let go
I will never let go

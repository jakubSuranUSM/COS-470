Friday is the 13th
To 24th is not so long to go 
Though my face don't show 
My temperature is gettin' too o-low 
I've seen it all in a dream
I know just how it's gonna feel
Like not to be alive anymore 

I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
Tell me will you remember me that day
When you've found a new one who's better than I ever was
I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
Please give all my things away
They'll make great X-mas presents for you and for all my friends

It hurts so inside to see you with another
From the edge of a cloud
Whatever happened to the promises that you gave 
Before the angels took me away 
So here I'm all dressed in white
While you're drinking up my best red wine 
And you don't even realize that I'm with you here all the time

I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
Tell me will you remember me that day
When you've found a new one who's better than I ever was
I'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
Please give all my things away
They'll make great X-mas presents for you and for all my friends

It's getting so lonely without you 
And I'm sure I am jealous too
To see another man in my bed
Be sure I can't get no rest before you're up there with me 
Come up, come up, come up, come up

I've been dead since X-mas now anyway 
So leave the flowers on my grave 
There's sure a way you could join me any day around now, honey
You'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
You'll lay beside me in our family grave 
We'll be making love eternally, in a spiritual way

We'll be dead by X-mas now anyway 
We'll sell everything away

Dead by X-mas, dead and gone 
X-mas is forever 
Dead by X-mas, dead and gone

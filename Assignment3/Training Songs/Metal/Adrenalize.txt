Adrenalize me

Come a little bit closer, before we begin
Lemme tell you how I want it
And exactly what I need
I’m here for one drug
I’m only here for one thing
So come on and tell me
Can you fly like you’re free
Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say

I must confess
I’m addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess
Turning wine into sweat dripping down my neck
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and sex

Get a little bit higher
So we can fall 'til we bleed
Push a little bit harder
Pull me into the speed
So tell me, can you feel this
Come into my dream
Are you ready to awaken?
Are you ready to feed?
'Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say

I must confess
I’m addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess
Turning wine into sweat dripping down my neck
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and sex

We have to live before we die
We were born to live before we die
Don’t you wanna live before you die?
Let me see you live before you die
Right here, right now, adrenalize me
Right here, right now, adrenalize
Right here, right now, adrenalize me
Right here, right now,
I’m addicted to this

I must confess
I’m addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and sex
(Adrenalize me)

I crave excess
Turning wine into sweat dripping down my neck
I can’t deny, I’d die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and sex (Adrenalize me)

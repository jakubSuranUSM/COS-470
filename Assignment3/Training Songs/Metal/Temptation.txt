I've never been closer
Of trying to understand
That certain feeling
Carved by another's hand
But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this

Leave no track
Don't look back

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation
And trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation
You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I'll have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away

Leave no trace
Guard your face

Full of desire
Temptation
Keep climbing higher and higher
Temptation
And you can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it

Step by step
And day by day
Every second counts
I can't break away

Keep us from temptation [Repeat: x3]
Lead us not into temptation

Trying to find it
Temptation
You've got to get up behind it
Temptation
Put your dime in the hot slots
Temptation
But it's a million to one shots
Temptation
You think that you're right now
Temptation
Your gonna make it tonight now
Temptation
Give me a breakdown
Temptation
Because it's time for a shakedown
Temptation [Repeat: x16]

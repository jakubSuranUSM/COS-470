Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine

When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me breathe 
For our handle on this life, I don't believe this time 
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again

Forever fooling, free and using, sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled? 
It's a damn shame,

When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me breathe 
For our handle on this life, I don't believe this time 
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again

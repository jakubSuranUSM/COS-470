Had a dad
Big and strong
Turned around 
Found my daddy gone 
He was the one 
Made me what I am today 
Its up to me now 
My daddy has gone away 

Well I spoke to the mountain 
I listened to the sea 
Both told me that fountain 
Was the best that you can be 
My daddy's hand it growed 
Slow to the lickin' 
Sonny boy 
Grow to whip him 

If you see my dad 
Tell him my brothers 
All gone mad 
They're beating on each other 
I walked around 
Even tried to call 
Got that funny feeling 

He's not there 
At all...

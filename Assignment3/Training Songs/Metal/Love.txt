Love can make you crazy
Love can make you wild
Love is outta fashion
But always in style
Love is great passion
Love can always make you smile 
Love is not to blame
When people fall apart
Cryin' in their beer
With a lonely broken heart
What's to complain,
You've obviously played your part

Love is not jealousy
Or wanting to possess
Love misunderstood
Can really be a mess
When your love is true,
Something more and nothing less
You're blessed

True love blasts thru' thick and thin
Conquers everything
My sweet true love

Love is all around
And we gotta let it grow
Love don't ever hurt
Only people make it so
Love can make you glow
Don't ya ever let it go, just flow

Love is not a game
To make you go insane
Love is not in vain
It'll never cause you pain
Crime is not the same
When they do it in the name of love

True love blasts thru' thick and thin
Conquers everything
My sweet true love, my sweet true love

True love blasts thru' thick and thin
Conquers everything
My sweet true love

True love blasts thru' thick and thin
Conquers everything
My sweet true love, my sweet true love

Well I have a Saturday night drive in a subway train
A lot of speed inside my brain, 
Shakin', breakin' it loose
The best that I can do, 
I gotta get out, gotta get out now
I wanna hear my wheels scream and shout, 
Get out of the subway
Get my wheels on the street, And start motorvatin'

Runnin all alone in a lowdown street, 
Just a searching for my medicine
And a little satisfaction from a woman, Is all I need

I gotta pull myself together, 
Hey hey hey, hear me say
I gotta drive right into the fire, 
And I'm burnin', burnin' burnin'
I'm motorvatin'

I've got skin thight jeans and high heel shoes, 
A leather jacket and nothing to lose
Gotta rock the nation, down the filling station
Don't try to get a ride in my Cadillac, 
You don't look good enough for that

Sure I am a loner but I'm never alone, I get by on my own

We've gotta pull ourselves together, 
Hey hey hey, that's what I say
We've gotta pull ourselves together, 
Hey hey hey, now hear me say
We've got to drive right into the fire, 
And start burning, burning, burning
We're motorvatin', We're motorvatin'

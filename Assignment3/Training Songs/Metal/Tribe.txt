Zumbi e o senhor das guerras 
Zumbi e o senhor das demandas 
Quando zumbi chega 
E zumbi quem manda (crenca popular) 

Your tribe, our tribe 
Your life, our life 
Your tribe, our tribe 
Your life, our life 
Your tribe, our tribe 
Your life, our life 
Your god, our god 
Your tribe, our tribe 

Tribe 

Your tribe, our tribe 
Your god, our god 
Your tribe, our tribe 
Your tribe, my tribe 

Hear the drums, they come from the sea 
Bring the tribal spirit on me 
Cause my pride and my roots I believe 
No, this tribe you can't take it from me

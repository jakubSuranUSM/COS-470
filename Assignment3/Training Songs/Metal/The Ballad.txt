A ray of light
Star shines down
Burning bright
Without a sound
The queen of angels
Take your crown
Yeah, shine on
You fly so high
Don't ever come down
Shine on
And every moment
Slips away
Doing my best trying to
Keep away
An innocence lost
The queen of sound
In the cold morning frost
We lay you gently down
Down, down, yeah
Shine on
And all the things you wished you'd said
Echoing inside your head
I cannot live I cannot die
Nothing left to do but try
I'm falling underneath your spell
Lift you up from your own hell
Numb yourself now from the pain
Wandering out in the rain
You fly so high
Don't ever come down
Queen of angels
Take your crown
An innocence lost
The queen of sound
In the cold morning frost
We lay you gently down
You fly so high
Don't ever come down
In the cold morning frost
We lay you gently down

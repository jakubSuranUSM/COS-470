They hide away in the darkness after midnight
Now they?re forbidden and they look in from the outside

When they failed to pass his test
Temptation got the better of them
They will suffer for their quest
Forever after be condemned

They lost their innocence that day
When they sealed mankind?s fate
There?s a price that we will all pay for eternity
Nobody can save us

Betrayed our father
Brother seeks brother
We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

His brother?s blood he wipes off from his own knife
And he shall pay through this one and the next life

When they failed to pass his test
Temptation got the better of them
They will suffer for their quest
Forever after be condemned

They lost their innocence that day
When they sealed mankind?s fate
There?s a price that we will all pay for eternity
Nobody can save us

Betrayed our father
Brother seeks brother
We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

Betrayed our father
Brother seeks brother
We set the tone and our offspring did worse
So heaven help us, they?ve fallen under Eden?s Curse

They?re forbidden

Heaven help us

I'm Not Looking Back
Yesterday's Far Away
And I Live For My King
New Chances Will Come
For This Lost Broken World
Holy Spirit Will Guide Me

I Will Never Give Up
No, I'm Gonna Fight Til The End

I Wanna Live, Wanna Fight
Yeah, Long Live The King
I Wanna Live, Wanna Fight
Cause In The End We Will Win

I Will Serve You My King
With My Heart And Soul
No One Can Stop Me Now
Wanna Sing It Out Loud
With My Flesh And Blood
A New Day's Breaking Through

(Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner)
It was the year of madness and insanity.
There was no other cure for my disease
The overdose - I took it Rcause I had to flee,
It was nearly a journey that had no return,
The fever burned, I was gone - delirium.
There I was striding to heaven and they were calling me
From beyond and I heard : ³Dont look back !²
But I did and my eyes, they can¹t forget that sight
Rcause all water and land was dead.
Destroyed, denied, all tears undried,
The crawling chaos comes,
The twilight died, eternal night,
The crawling chaos comes.
A giant maelstrom, absorbing what we¹d left back,
The desert of cadaverous, mortal loam
And jungles of decay and decadence, where once
Had been the homelands of my people,
Temples of my ancestors, they were gone, dead and gone
Then the cracks in the ground, they were breaking up
And all water was streaming in,
Manifesting the sight of the dead Berlin
And London and Paris were graves.

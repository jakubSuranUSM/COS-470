I'm gonna take you to a place far from here
No one will see us
Watch the pain as it disappears

No time for anger
No time for despair
Won't you come with me
There's room for us there

This innocent beauty
My words can't describe
This rebirth to purity
Brings a sullen tear right to your eyes

No time for anger
No time for despair
Please let me take you
'Cause I'm already there

I'm so alone
My head's my home
I'll return to serenity

Rhyme without reason is why children cry
They see through the system
That's breeding them just so they die

So please let me take you
And I'll show you the truth
Inside my reality
We shared in my youth

I'm so alone
My head's my home
And I feel
So alone (so)
You know
At last (at last)
I return to serenity

Now that I've taken you to a place far from here
I really must go back
Close your eyes and we'll disappear

Won't you come with me
Salvation we'll share
Inside of my head now
There's room for us there

I'm so alone
My head's my home
And I feel
So alone (so)
You know
At last (at last)
I return to serenity

I try to hide and deny my inner thoughts and true reactions
By fooling myself with ill-concealed dissatisfaction
I can't take it anymore I can't stand the situation
I don't want to be a victim of another confrontation
I'll pretend that I know I need you to sympathize
I'm so unsure of myself so please don't you criticize
You can bend me and shake me you can twist me till I break
And whatever you do I'll take the blame for your mistakes
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out
You want to shape me up that you can mould me in
You want to fold me out just so you can fit me in
You feed me full with your discriminating terrible lies
What do you want from me should I believe in all your alibies
I don't know where to go so which way should I turn
I try to understand but you don't want me to learn
You tie my feet to the ground there's not a chance I can walk
I want to scream but you gag my mouth so I can't talk
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it
Letting it out
Letting it out
Letting it out
Letting it out
You want to stretch me out just so you pin me down
You want to dry me out just so you can watch me drown
You want to watch me starve so you can force me to eat
And then you knock me down when I'm back on my feet
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it out
Pin me down
I put my hands over my mouth
When I need to shout
You pin me down
I learn to hate myself instead of letting it
Pin me down
You pin me down

Words of silence
 Echo through this lonely room
 Just a photograph and dreams
 That won't come true

 I'll never know why I left you
 Standin' in the rain
 Cryin' tears of emptyness
 It's drivin' me insane

 All I wanted was to love you
 Never wanted to see you cry
 All I need is just to hold you 
 I just can't say - Goodbye

 Sometimes we raise our guns of pain
 But I'll be your defender
 'Cause if love means war
 Baby I surrender

 You use words as weapons
 I use love as a shield
 So tell me why
 Are we on this battlefield

 In a blaze of glory
 Can we rise above these flames
 In a world of anger
 There's got to be a way

 Sometimes we raise our guns of pain
 But I'll be your defender
 'Cause if love means was
 Baby I surrender

 We're just soldiers from the heart
 And I ain't no pretender
 So lay down your arms
 And baby let's surrender

 And thought my aim is true
 I sometimes miss the mark
 Ooh, in matters of the heart
 But I'd give my life tonight
 To hold you in my arms

 In a blaze of glory
 Can we rise above these flames
 In a world of anger
 There's got to be a way

 I just wanna hold you
 Surrender
 I just wanna love you
 Surrender
 I never meant to make you cry

 Sometimes we raise our guns of pain
 But I'll be your defender
 'Cause if love means war
 Baby I surrender

 We're just soldiers of from the heart
 And I ain't no pretender
 So lay down you arms
 And baby let's surrender

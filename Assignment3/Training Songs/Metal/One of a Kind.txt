I've got that feeling deep inside 
Well what it is I don't know 
My vengeance starts to change 
My mind gets filled with rage 
I raise my fists up to the sky 

Whatdaya see? 

The fear I see when I look in your eyes 
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind (one of a kind) 
The fear I leave in the back of your mind 
Makes you believe I'm 
One of a kind 

Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 

And now I feel like I'm alive 
Don't know just how I got so low 
These voices in my mind 
Tell me it's killing time 
It is a thrill I can't describe 

Whatdaya see? 

The fear I see when I look in your eyes 
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind (one of a kind) 
The fear I leave in the back of your mind 
Makes you believe I'm 
One of a kind 

Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 

The fear I see when I look in your eyes 
Makes you believe, makes you believe 
The fear that I see in the back of your mind 
Makes you believe, makes you believe 

The fear I see when I look in your eyes 
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind (one of a kind) 
The fear I leave in the back of your mind 
Makes you believe, makes you believe 

The fear I see when I look in your eyes 
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind (one of a kind) 
The fear I leave in the back of your mind 
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind 

Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind 
Hey, hey, hey, one of a kind

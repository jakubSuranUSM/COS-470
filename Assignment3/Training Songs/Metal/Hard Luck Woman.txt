If never I met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for a first hello
We'd never have
To say goodbye

If never I held you
My feelings would never show
Its time I start walking
But there's so much you'll
Never know

I keep telling you hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman

Rags the sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags I really love you I can't
Forget about you
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby till you find your man

Before I go let me kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you girl
You know I could never lie

Don't cry
I'll be packin' my bags
Leaving you
Don't cry
I gotta keep on moving
Leaving you

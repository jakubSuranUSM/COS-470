The morning glory poured down on me
Stars were in my eyes
Desperate, a babe in teens
I was scared to death of what I'd find of

On borrowed beds of nails I wailed and I'd lose control
So shamelessly, so starved to be
Down this orphan's road

If time runs away tomorrow
There's nowhere left to hide
To the promised land, the roads I ran
But nowhere left to ride

The last runaway tonight has come home
And I'm running from the night, oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last rumaway tonight
The last runaway's alive, I'm coming home

The price of pride bled down on me
And ransomed my soul
A broken boulevard of dreams, like misfits and their broken toys
A runaway, a slave in chains, I'd lose control
So painlessly, so hard to see
Down this beggar's road

If time runs away tomorrow
There's nowhere left to hide
To the promised land, the roads I ran
But nowhere left to ride

The last runaway tonight has come home
And I'm running from the night, oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last rumaway tonight, I'm coming home

In the land of lost and make believe we shiver from the cold
Lay down my head, and hear no voices, my face so bold
Turned my back and feared redemption, like a thief I stole
Escape this place erase my shadow
Don't wanna lose my soul

And help me Lord to make it
This weight's too great to lift my soul no more
Just one last chance to change it
Give me back the life I can't wait to live
Na-na-na, ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na, ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na, ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na, ooh, na-na-na

The last runaway tonight has come home
And I'm running from the night, oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last rumaway tonight, I'm coming home

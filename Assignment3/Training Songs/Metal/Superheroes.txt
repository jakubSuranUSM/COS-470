Wasting all our time
You mortals and your crimes
Move quick as lightning
Burning across the grease
Could be a little frightening
Mutations never cease

Superheroes
Giand freaks
Tear apart the evil
To save the weak
Superheroes
Tell no lies
See all that's true
Through mutant minds

Breaking down the walls
Busting bad guys' balls
We feed on radiation
Our demons never sleep
More than a mad creation
On through the night we creep

Killerheroes
Superfreaks
Rock down the wrong
Pour on the heat
Superheroes
Radar spies
Burning through the steel
With X-ray eyes

Call and we'll come to save the day
And quickly wash your fears away

Superheroes
Giand freaks
Tear apart the evil
To save the weak
Superheroes
Tell no lies
See all that's true
Through mutant minds

Killerheroes
Superfreaks
Rock down the wrong
Pour on the heat
Superheroes
Radar spies
Burning through the steel
With X-ray eyes

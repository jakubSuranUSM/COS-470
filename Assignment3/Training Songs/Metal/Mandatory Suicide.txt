Murder at your every foot step
A child's toy sudden death
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down, can you feel the heat burn?

Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head
Screaming skull sent out to die
Living mandatory suicide

Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide

Holes burn deep in your chest
Raked by machine gun fire
Screaming skull sent out to die
Living mandatory suicide

Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide

Lying, dying, screaming in pain
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
Minds explode, pain sheers to your brain
Radical amputation, this is insane

Fly swatter stakes, drive through your chest
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath

A vile smell, like tasting death
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass and bits of clothing and human deceit

Dying terror
Bloods cheap, it's everywhere
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line

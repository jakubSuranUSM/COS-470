I am what I create 
Believing in my fate 
Integrity is my name 

All that I am doing 
Can never be ruined 
My song remains insane 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye 
F*ck 

Can't you watch my back 
Can't you let my heart 
Believe what they have fired ?

To reunite the tribe 
To find a better way 
Fucking envy changes everything 

Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye 

That's right!

(right)

I hate to borrow 
You don't understand 
Pain, hate, pain 

To born again 
Arise again 
I believe it's the only way

Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye 
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye

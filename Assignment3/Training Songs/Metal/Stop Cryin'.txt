Sweet Seventeen, Your face is from a beauty magazine, yeah , Yes it is
Sweet Seventeen, Your body's an oasis for sex dreams, yeah
It's sometimes hard to understand what you mean
That's when you think nothing matters to me

But I'm tryin' so hard to understand, It's not that easy being your man
You know that I know you'll leave me soon
And I know that you know I been thinkin' of it, too

Sweet Seventeen , It hurts me whenever you are gone
Sweet Seventeen, You really know how to turn me on, turn me on, girl
Alright, Please stop cryin' , 'Cause the whole worlds cryin' with you
Please stop cryin', 'Cause the whole worlds cryin' with you 

Oh yes, the whole worlds cryin' with you
I don't want to lose you, and I hope I never will
I don't ever want to lose you after all these years
It took a long time to find out who you are, It took even longer to get this far 

'Cause there's been bad times, too, Aside of the laughter, yeah
But I hope and think we make it somehow
We're gonna make it, make it if we really try
Make it if we really try, oh, Blow your horn Mike
My dreams so

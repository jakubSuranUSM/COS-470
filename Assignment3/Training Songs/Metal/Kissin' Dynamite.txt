Here she come, here she come
Eating up the thrill
Sugar cane, sugar cane
Dressin' up to kill
Like a fireball in the shadow
Like a storm that's gonna show
Like an overwhelmed volcano
Getting set to blow, set to blow
She got a nasty reputation
She got a healthy appetite
When she needs some detonation
She sets the fuse alight, the fuse alight

[Chorus]
Feel like kissin' dynamite [Repeat: x4]

Let it rain, let it rain
Let me feel it pour
Let it slide, let it slide
Let me feel the core
Like a thunder in the mountains
Like the lightning in the sky
Like the eye of a tornado 
She watch it all go by, all go by
Then she kills for recreation
And she plays her games at night
She want to work on her vocation
She set the world alight, set world alight

[Chorus: x2]
 
Dynamite, here it come
Dynamite, gonna blow
Dynamite, just want to warn you
Dynamite, that the volcano
Dynamite, she got no imagination or recreational (vow?)
Dynamite, that's the way you want, that's the way he'll go
Dynamite

[Chorus]

There is a girl who lived inside of me and I can hear her breath her smell is sweet but underneath her blood
is boiling to a seethe 
And she leaves me scarred, scared and bruised I'm so confused why can't you see she isn't me 
I try to keep her down but it's so hard to fight when she's inside she takes my mouth, my mind, my eyes, my
self respect and pride 
Repeat chorus 2xs 
Each time you make me cry I lose a little face until I'm faceless when the boy has left her in the end pretend
that you are blameless each time I hear your voice I make a choice that I will have to live with when the girl
becomes the girl she hates to be he can't forgive this... 
SO FORGIVE ME 
There is a girl who lives inside of me and she can hear me breathe she gives me everything I fear and
everything I need 
And she leaves me scarred, scared and bruised I'm so confused why can't you see she isn't me... she isn't
me... she isn't me... she isn't me...

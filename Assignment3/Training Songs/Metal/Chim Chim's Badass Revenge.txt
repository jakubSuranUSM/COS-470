The ultimate in flip script deliverin' many blows
All that primate thinkin' broke off leg and elbow
A fruit bowl delight of power knockin' down any door
Chim Chim's laughin' at you and he's slammin' you to the floor
Chim Chim's badass revenge...

Wit one mega nut bomb you got blowin' up and away
With a bounty full of Kaboom terrorizin'
Keep yo' hair arizin' and the sunshine reflects off ah dah moon, 
When you think it's over, Chim Chim's scarface in the room 
Chim Chim's badass revenge...

Takin' 'em hostage, holdin' up the bank, blockin' the sewer
Drainin' yo gas tank, breakin' the rules, ignorin' the signal
Runnin' the stop sign to get your peace of mind.
[Repeat]

Takin' 'em hostage...

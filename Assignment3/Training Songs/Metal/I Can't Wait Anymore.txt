You keep me waiting, you won't answer the phone
I know you're home, but you're not alone
Stop playing games girl
You're playing with my heart
I was a fool to fall for your lies
It took so long for me to open my eyes
I was a stranger
A stranger from the start
How long must I stand out in the cold (*)
Can't you see the writing's on the wall
I been waiting
I can't wait anymore
The more I want you, the less I get
I've been alone since the day that we met
I'm trying hard girl
I'm trying to forget
I walked the streets and I stood at your door
You gave me nothing and I came back for more
You were a stranger
A stranger to my heart
(Repeat *)
I was a fool to fall for your lies
It took so long for me to realize
I was a stranger
A stranger from the start
(Repeat *)

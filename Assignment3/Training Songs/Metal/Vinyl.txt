One day, while I was sleeping
Off my night that went wrong
She came, saw I was needing
Someone to put something shiny on

Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I dreamt a girl wearing
Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I dreamt a girl

One day, while I was looking
For some hip thing to wear
She was trying some pants on
I didn't notice her face or hair

Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I met a girl wearing
Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I met a girl

Is she trying to save a cow or a cotton ball
Is she trying to save a dime at the shopping mall

Someday, you might be falling
For some sweet little bird
Sometime, casually ask her
See what she dose if you say the word

Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I want a girl wearing
Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I want a girl

Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I need a girl wearing
Vinyl, Vinyl, Vinyl
I need a girl, yeah

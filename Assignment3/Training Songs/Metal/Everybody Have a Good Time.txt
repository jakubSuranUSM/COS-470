Anticipation, too much to bear
Maybe I’m crazy, but there’s something in the air
There’s something in the air, ah
Come on people tell me how you feel
You want a good time, well you got yourself a deal
Oh yeah, you got yourself a deal

It’s time to make, a brand new start
Take off your thinking, gotta listen to your heart
Everybody have a good time
Everybody have a crush, alright
Everybody have a good time
For tonight may be our last, alright

Good thing you’re cool, well I’m mister sure
Come on baby, leave your ego at the door
Cause you don’t need it anymore, whoa
Where is all this fighting getting us?
Where is the fire baby, what’s the fuss?
Everybody have a good time
Everybody have a crush
Everybody have a good time
For tonight may be our last, alright
Yeah tonight may be our last

Where fools rush in, where eagles dare
You will find us, it’s already there
We live the same dream, every night
Having a good time 'til the morning light
Everybody have a good time
Everybody have a crush
Everybody have a good time
For tonight may be our last, alright
Yeah tonight may be our last

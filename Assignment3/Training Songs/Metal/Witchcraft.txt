You try to get away you got to get somewhere
You know you cannot stay thereÂ´s so much evil in the air
They point their bony fingers right upon you
The coven of the damned they have seen you through 

These people they are into witchcraft they are not what they seem
You curious fool you had yourself to this scene
They took your children and wife cut their throats with a knife
And now youÂ´re facing the crowd and the crowd is facing you 

YouÂ´re running through the dark of night your scream is music to their ears
Spooky trees gloomy paths leads you further down your fears
You look around hunting sound is creeping in your lonely soul
Nocturnal life forest of death youÂ´re the prisoner within its cold...yes you are... 

You cannot hear you cannot feel your bodyÂ´s shivering in here
Eyes of beasts pierce your heart all naked you fall to the ground
And the last of love thatÂ´s in your heart is about to crumble now
DonÂ´t let me die let me stay alive me take from this hellish place

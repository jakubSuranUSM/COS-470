Waiting, I... I crumbled again 
Rising above, I stumbled again 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me safe in sin 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me safe in sin 
Maybe I don't have that much to say 
Maybe things were meant to be that way 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me safe in sin 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me safe in sin 
Oh, no, I stumbled again 
Oh, no, I stumbled again 
Jesus wants me back in church again 
I'm not ready to give my life back to him 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me far from him 
Wearing my full devil jacket again 
Keeps me far from him 
Wearing my full devil jacket again

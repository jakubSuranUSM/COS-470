I am a product, of your context
The uncontrollable urges that made me a menace
I'm all your problem, do you even care?
Pretend it's all a lie, that's how we made it here

Can't abate the truth with your secrets,
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure, I wasn't anything

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Crawl away from human clay
We our the broken shards beyond disarray
Before you cut them, you rape them
(Feed us by going on!)
Gonna go from my souls to my throat
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed
'Cause you made damn sure, now we're everything

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Maximize our prize of a record
It's all on the path and the words are of murder
This time I won't give in
I will save you from my sins

(What is wrong with this
Manipulation
Violence and Chaotic)

Destroy my taste and all that's right
I slam you shut, I can only take so much
How many times do I have to mistreat you?
'Cause you leap out of my hand as I feed you
Maybe now you'll understand severity
I sum it up with offense no matter poverty

Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything, but couldn't have it

Distractions, Reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, Retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me

Maximize our prize of a record
It's all on the path and the words are of murder
This time I won't give in
I will save you from my sins

Save you from my sins
Save you from my sins

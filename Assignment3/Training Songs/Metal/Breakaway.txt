Can you see what you've become hiding yourself behind a loaded gun? 
You will never feel true love living in the shadow of the sun. 
The hopeless now lie crawling on their knees, 
and who will lead with compassion in their hands? 

Break, break away. 
Break from the past, 
break from everything you know. 
Take, take away. 
Take from the dead, they are living proof. 

Try to breathe the smoke-filled air haunted by the voices of the dead. 
You will never win the war or wash away the blood that has been shed. 
The hopeless now lie crawling on their knees, 
and who will lead with compassion in their hands? 

Break, break away. 
Break from the past, 
break from everything you know. 
Take, take away. 
Take from the dead, they are living proof. 

Break, break away. 
Break from the past,
break from everything you know. 
Take, take away. 
Take from this life–it’s the only fucking truth. 

To the cowards who sit back and watch 
Fathers become a casualty notch: 
where are they now the truth is out? 
To the Mothers who grieve and cry 
while their children fight back and die: 
where are they now the truth is out? 

Break, break away. 
Break from the past, 
break from everything you know. 
Take, take away. 
Take from the dead, they are living proof. 

Break, break away. 
Break from the past, 
break from everything you know. 
Take, take away. 
Take from this life–it’s the only fucking truth. 
This is the only fucking truth.

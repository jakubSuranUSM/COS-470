I just looked myself
Straight in the eyes and saw
That I had to move
To higher places
So I took my courage
In both hands and
I pushed off the ground
With all my might

Took off from the red place
In the sky I fly
I have lost my reason
And I've made my sense
From up there I will see
Where I'm from
And where the force of love
Will tell me now to go

But why do you say
That you are lost
If you don't even try
To find yourself
My words are a stairs
I put my feet on
And I climb through
A starless night to my place

I can't stand it 
I got to break lose somehow 
When this boat starts rockin' 
And people keep knockin' on my door 

I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run away from here 

Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night 
Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night 

You make my heart sting 
Burning like it's on fire 
You've got me wanting 
More from you in every way 

I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run away from here 

Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night 
Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night 

When I see you each day 
I just want to run and hide 
But you follow me round 
Like like a shadow upon the ground 

I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run run run run away from here 
I want to run away from here 

Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night 
Little lost girls 
Little lost girls in the night

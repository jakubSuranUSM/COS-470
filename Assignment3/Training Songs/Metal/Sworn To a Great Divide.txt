'Cause I won't take what I give
I'm sworn fighter within
Not the last time it keeps coming back
Building knowledge, gaining strength
A part of the Jekyll, a part of the Hyde

Fear itself is bigger than the seed
It bares resemblance to the mouths that I feed
I'm sworn to a great divide
Sworn to a great divide

How will I turn when it beckons to me?
Can I turn myself from home?
Well, it's time to decide is that really the key
All that matters, I can do this on my own

So now, to complete this journey
Towards the back of my head
Inevitable, the disaster comes as quickly as it came
Inevitable dangers, inevitable crimes
Considered a victim, a wide open file

When just hurts, you will confess, not deny
Incinerate, illuminate, either way is just fine
Truth shall set you free, I won't push it or let it be
Master the puppet or cut off the strings
Self indulgence, what a beautiful thing

I'm sworn to a great divide
Sworn to a bottomless tide

How will I turn when it beckons to me?
Can I turn myself from home?
Well, it's time to decide is that really the key
All that matters, I can do this on my own

I can feel, it is coming my way
Here it comes now, one, two, three, go

Sworn to a great divide
Sworn to a great divide

How will I turn when it beckons to me?
Can I turn myself from home?
Well, it's time to decide is that really the key
All that matters, I can do this on my own
I can do this on my own

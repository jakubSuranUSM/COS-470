Morning, is the time of day,
When you are far away
That I'll miss you.

Feeling, your body next to mine,
Giving that certain smile,
That you want me.

Oh I wonder.
Yes how I wonder.
Why are you leaving
Maybe you'll stay
While I still pray.
Oh, how I pray.

So I wait for evening.
When the sun goes down.
And you're still home.

Oh I wonder.
Yes how I wonder.
Why are you leaving
Maybe you'll stay
While I still pray.
Oh, how I pray.
Oh, how I pray.
Oh, how I pray.

I've never been told, I've never been controlled
Said stupid things and taught myself to laugh
I got no regrets
I've never sold myself, lost my hope
I'd rather be abused than amuse you like a clown
I've no regrets

We got no immediate hits for you, we're innocent, accused
What happened to, what happened to your smile
I haven't seen you, haven't seen you for a while

I used to be glad now I'm screaming mad
I've made my decision, your dance is a crap, you're bad
Still no regrets
I appreciate the chance to live in truth
All I got to do is maintain through the groove
I do have no regrets

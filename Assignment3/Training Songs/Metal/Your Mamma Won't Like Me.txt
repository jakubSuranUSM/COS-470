I wear my jeans too short, and my neckline's too low
I'm getting stared at wherever I go
I wear my jeans too tight, and I stay out all night
And when you turn me on you'll see how I can bite
And now my preoccupation is making love
Hon hon hon
I got a bad reputation through playing around
I like your stimulation, but that aint enough

So don't take me home babyNa Na Na Na Na
Your mamma won't like meOh
So don't take me home honey nowNa Na Na Na
'Cos your manma won't like me

I like my music loud, and I stand out in a crowd
By doing everything I know I shouldn't do
So when you hold me tight, I won't put up a fight
I'll just knock you out and watch you coming to
Just put me in a situation where I'm turning you on
Hon hon hon
I'll be the devil's recreation and before too long
You could feel the the sensation that's oh so strong

So Don't take me home babyNa Na Na Na Na
'Cos your mamma won't like me
Hey your manma won't like me
Don't take me home honey nowNa Na Na Na
Your mamma won't like me
Your mamma won't like me

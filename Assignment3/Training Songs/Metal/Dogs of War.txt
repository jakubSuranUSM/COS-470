Come to the reaper sing the song, bringing death to everyone
Once the earth was calm and safe, but now the land's a battle place
Firing shells into the air, where they land, no-one cares
Now the blood flows like a stream, widowmaker reigns supreme

Dogs of war, no surrender (*)
Dogs of war, I kill the defender
Dogs of war, Scream into battle
Dogs of war, it's the day of the jackal

Nothing seems to ease the pain, the reaper's shadow still remains
Sniper lets the bullet fly, in the distance someone die
The town becomes an empty shell, come and spend a day in hell
Forgotten what we're fighting for, no-one wins this bloody war

[Repeat *]

Lay the wreath across the flag, fill another body bag
Guard of honour standing proud, put your son into the ground
Did they die for you and me, a sacrifice for liberty
A generation dead and gone, the reaper sings his deadly song

I apologize again 
Time after time after time 
The conversation drifts 
In no general direction 
And your oral love 
Is keeping me from bed 
And it's talking and talking 
It's all you ever said 
You know it's all you want 
All you want 

You don't fool me 
You don't fool me 
No surprises 
No surprises 
Love in the hallway 
Sex on the carpet 
Antagonism rising 
You know you try to categorise me 
'Cause it's all you ever wanted 
Just it's all you want 
All you want 

But you're changing my love 
'Cause all you want is television 

No heart is infected 
No damage is done 
No cavity open 
No body no fun 
They throw shit in your face 
And you smile 
They throw shit in your face 
And you still come up smiling 
You've got nothing to believe in 
The diverse, the young and the breathing 
But it's all you want 
All you want, all you want, all you want 
They said it's all you want 
All you want 
(Television) 

You've got blasphemy with a smile 
Insomnia sleeps with you nights 
You've got commercial sex appeal 
In sterile black and white 
You got glorious colourless motion 
From reel to reel you run 
Nocturnal television 
Internal sanctum 
But it's all you want 
It's all you want 

But you're changing my love 
'Cause all you want is television 

(Television) 
All night and day 
It's all you ever wanted 
You got glorious colourless motion 
From reel to reel you run 
Nocturnal television 
Nocturnal television 
It's on all night and day 
All night and day 
All night and day 
Your fucking television 
It's all you ever wanted

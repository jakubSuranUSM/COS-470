And in that moment of strange ritual, I became you
A vast nothingness in which you found completion 
Until there wasn't the slightest space left for anything else
Draining the life behind your eyes is my finest masterpiece
You may exercise me, but know that I will haunt you forever

For I am the door that cannot be closed
Though you walk the earth, in becoming a ghost
There is no return

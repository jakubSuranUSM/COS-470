1996, it began. Spawning a king, dawning a reign. Learn to live with pain and you won't complain. That which doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger. That which doesn't kill you, only makes you wanna kill. One day I'll reign. Now I'm getting mine by taking yours, Time 2 Shine. All my life I hated those who had more. But now I'm getting mine by taking yours, Time 2 Shine. Please excuse my fucked up attitude, but I don't give a f*ck about you.

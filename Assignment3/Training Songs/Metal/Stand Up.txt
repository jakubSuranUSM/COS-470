I know, no one had ever dreamed that 
We were this strong and we'd achieve this 
So long the doubt and all believed it 
And now it's come for all to see yeah 

We've worked, so hard 
Pushed every day now 
See the blood sweat and tears on our face 
We've never been stronger 
There's no holding back now 
So you can hear us say 

Stand up, Stand up we were right 
You know we can't be more justified 
And they can't deny it 
Stand up, stand up we were right 
We've come to far just to fade away 
And they can't deny it 

I've hear the words those in the circle say 
"So what, they're done, don't matter anyway" 
Well here's your proof, they're all silent today 
And there's no way they can take it away. 

We've worked so hard 
Pushed every day now 
See the blood sweat and tears on our face 
We've never been stronger 
There's no holding back now 
So you can hear us say 

Stand up, Stand up we were right 
You know we can't be more justified 
And they can't deny it 
Stand up, stand up we were right 
We've come to far just to fade away 
And they can't deny it 

We never said it was easy 
And no one gave us a thing 
Now that last part is so pleasing 
We're stronger than you think 

Stand up, Stand up we were right 
You know we can't be more justified 
And they can't deny it 
Stand up, stand up we were right 
We've come to far just to fade away 
And they can't deny it 

Stand up, stand up we were right 
(They can't deny it) 
Stand up, stand up we were right

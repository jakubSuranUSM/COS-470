My heart is ragin'
My love is waitin'
To find somebody like you

The world is changin'
'Cause nothin' means a thing
But I'm still searchin'...

CHORUS

Searchin' for a rare diamond
I've been lookin' for you
Tryin' to find those deep feelings
So I can share 'em with you

And stolen treasures
Tear me apart
Every word just breaks my heart

Looking for love
It's so hard to find
And I'm still searchin'

I wanna get to you
I wanna share it with you!

It's hard to believe it
When I look in your eyes I realize
Yes I know
It's hard not to feel it
I can't break these chains
Don't wanna lose it again

CHORUS

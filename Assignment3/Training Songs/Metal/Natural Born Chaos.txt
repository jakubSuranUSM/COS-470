Don't you ever try to solve a problem in distress
The infected smile upon your face
Looks so godly in this mess
Shut down- all your dreams
Confess- you're released
You know- what I mean
Can't stop this strangulation alone

[Chorus]
Wait for chaos, wait for the welfare at this point of no return
Bleed for money, bleed for justice, going straight to hell
With a wounded soul
Reaching out for a solid soul
Of compassion and excitement

-Do I dare to trust my faith right now
As it fools my mind somehow...
Reborn - once again
Erase - and repent
You know what I mean!

Saved, building up a fate on your own
Now, your saved, never seem to care while they're
Watching you
Pay, pay for your sins on your own
Pay, lie to yourself while you're getting low

[Chorus]

Wait for chaos, wait for welfare at this point of no return
Bleed for money, bleed for justice, going straight to hell
With a wounded soul
Don't you ever try to satisfy your needs with a deeper
Thought if you do or if you please, if you do or please
Shut down- all your dreams
Confess- you're relieved
You lie- to yourself
Your pride goes before a fall...

Saved, building up a fate on your own
Now, you're saved, never seem to care while they're
Watching you
Pay, pay for your sins on your own
Pay, lie to yourself while you're getting low

[Chorus]

Wait for chaos, wait for welfare at this point of no return
Bleed for money, bleed for justice, going straight to hell
With a wounded soul [Repeat]

Yeah
Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess
Of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed
And left to bleed
There on fire
In the corner of the world
There in misery
There on fire
In the corner of the world
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life
Do you want to cross that line
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Yeah, poison father of the human race
God
Of the tainted blood
Malevolence
Sneaking up the spine of the world
Ready for the bastard son
There on fire
In the veins of man
There in misery
There on fire
In the veins of man
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life
Do you want to cross that line
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

Do you want to take a life
Do you want to take a life, yea
Do you want to cross that line, oh
Do you want to cross that line
want to cross that line

Oh
Sold into slavery down in New Orleans
Goddess
Of the bayou light
Black dog's head on the killing bed
Severed
And left to bleed
There on fire
In the corner of the world
There in misery
Lucifer's face
In the mirror when you look
Left for God to see

Do you want to take a life
Do you want to cross that line
'Cause it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go with me

And it's a long way back from Hell
And you don't want to go

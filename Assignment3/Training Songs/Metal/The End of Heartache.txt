(Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting)

(Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting)

This distance
This disillusion
I cling to memories
While falling
Sleep brings release
And the hope of a new day
Waking the misery
Of being without you

Surrender I give in
Another moment is another eternity
(Seek me) for comfort
(Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting)
For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) completion
(Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting)
For the end of my broken heart

You know me
You know me all to well
My only desire
To bridge our division

In sorrow
I speak your name
And my voice mirrors my torment

(Seek me) for comfort
(Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting)
For the end of my broken heart
Am I breathing?
My strength fails me
Your picture
A bitter memory

For comfort
For solace
(Seek me) for comfort
(Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting)
For the end of my broken heart

Certain things you do  Really make me mad I must confess
The way the streetlight silhouttes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets  I think I see you   But I really don't know
Goin' a million miles an hour Headed out to where the down boys go

Woah  Can we rewind to where we've been
Ooh I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go,  go.  Where the down boys go,  go
Where the down boys go  I wanna go where the down boys go

Baby  You comb your hair  Put on your shades  You look so cool
Gimme the run-around  Make me feel like a fool
You got a lot of nerve to call me cheap  Even though it's true
I don't care where we go tonight  Just take me along with you

Woah  Can we rewind to where we've been
Ooh I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go,  go.  Where the down boys go,  go
Where the down boys go  I wanna go where the down boys go

Certain things you do  Really make me mad  I must confess
The way the streetlight silhouttes  Your thighs inside your dress

Woah  Can we rewind to where we've been
Ooh I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in

Where the down boys go,  go.  Where the down boys go,  go
Where the down boys go
I wanna go where the down boys go,  yeah
Where the down boys go  Where the down boys go
Where the down boys go  Where they go---

Police brutalities scaring up the nation
Juvenile delinquents spread fear in the central station
There's no law or order
 law or order maybe it's total control
Oh, I don't know
But they can bend it and shape it and a little bit break it
To make it easier to follow
Criminal activities late at night in the subway
Newspaper headlines all across the nation
There's no law or order
 law or order, everything's out of control
Well I don't know
But they can bend it and shape it and a little bit break it
To make it easier to follow
(spoken:) Hey Johnny! Where are you going with that gun in your hand
Don't you understand, they'll just kick you down
 to the floor
 They won't give you another chance, you're all alone
 And they're a million, they'll just lock you in
 For evermore, why'know
 The only choice you got, boys, is to be nasty
 Hate everybody and everybody will hate you
 You can bet on that!
 You know, You can't fight the justice but
 the justice can fight you, even if it wasn't you
 it's you, Johnny.
There's no law or order
There's no law or order
There's no law or order anymore
But they can bend it and shape it and a little bit break it
To make it easier to follow
Yes they can bend it and shape it and a little bit break it
The rules cannot be hollowed
There's no law or order
There's no law or order
There's no law or order anymore

I do declare theirs something in the air I'm burning the candle at both ends Bitter Betrayals Skeleton Keys Houses to Haunt Well, it's alright by me Rags to Ruin Some fool Handy Choices Some would say, not a Ghost of a chance The Ghosts in my mind they're one of a kind they tell me what to do and its shut down you
Some things are best just left unsaid
End of the line one door closes another door closes and now your boxed in
Feel eyes in the trees the foreboding path the turn of the head I hear it laugh it says Hang em Now It says Hang em High When you're done then, Hail to the sky

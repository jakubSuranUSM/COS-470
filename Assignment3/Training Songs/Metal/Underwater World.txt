Beneath the streets, in the cars, on the trains, or in the underground, I'll be waiting
You can spare a dime, or you're gonna be mine and We're going dancing tonight
In the tunnels underground the subway rats run all around, and hungry
So come and hide, step inside, we're going on a midnight ride

On the subway underground it gets, a little rough, this ain't No tunnel of love
Hurricanes running through my veins, I know that You're lost and alone
And I feel no pain, In my sea of drains, In my my underwater world
Welcome to the ocean, Welcome to the sea, Welcome to the jungle, Deep inside of me

Sink or swim, you dive right in and you, Know this ain't no place to mess around in
In my swamp underground the quicksand slowly Sucks you down
Down here I call the shots, like it or not, What you got I'm getting, You have to come down to my slum
Well Welcome Chum, Now sit down and shut up
I lay you wide open, For all the world to see

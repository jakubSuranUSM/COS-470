Tortured moans of agony
I love to hear your feeble cries
Begging to be put to death
Extremely slow and cruel demise
Teeth pulled slowly one by one
Mangled jaws, bloody gums
My love grows each time you bleed
The mutilation has just begun
Eyeballs sliced along the lids
Fluids running down your face
Try to scream through shredded lips
Your severed tongue I now shall taste
Slash your bowels and rip your throat
Tear your stomach open wide
F*ck the gash I cum for you
Semen blends with blood inside

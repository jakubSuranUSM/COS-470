Baby don't disregard the fact
You'll always see me coming back
It makes no difference what you do
I'll always stay strung out over you
And there might be talk all over town
About some other guys around

Still makes no difference what you do
I'm forever strung out over you
All my friends think I'm a fool
Yeah they call this self abuse
But how can they know about love that's true
They've never been in love with you
The clocks a ticking on the wall

I fear you won't come at all
But I stay waiting by your door
I just want more and more and more
The only thing I ever want to do
Is to get strung out over you
No there is nothing in the world
I'd rather do than stay strung out over you

My heart's a blaze I'm in a mist
I've never been in love like this
Your presence liquid like the sea
Embracing me eternally
So please take some time to face the truth

I am so strung out over you
Baby don't disregard the fact
You'll always see me running back
It's that little bit of magic
Deep inside of your heart
Keeps me strung out over you

It's that little bit of magic
Deep inside of your heart
That keeps me strung out over you
Helps me pull through and through
Keeps me strung out over you an' you and only you;

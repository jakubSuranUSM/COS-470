I'd like to put to rest the rumours
I'd like to put to bed the lies
I'd like to throw away the past
And show you how I feel inside

Ooh, I'll be your taxi and your driver
I'll be your road if you need
I'd like to push and push and push
Just to make you pleased

But your river of emotion for me
Flows like a dried up stream

So tell me why
Your satisfaction's like a heart of stone
So tell me why
Your love reaction chills me to the bone

You make my blood boil hot
And my heart beat like a drum
I wanna do to you girl
Things that ain't never been done

From the rain I'll be your shelter
From the cold I'll be your heat
I'll push and push and push
To make you pleased

So tell me why
Your satisfaction's like a heart of stone
So tell me why
Your love reaction chills me to the bone

So tell me your reason
For tearing me up inside
Girl you gotta tell me why

But your river of emotion for me
Flows like a dried up stream

So tell me why
So tell me why
So tell me why
Your satisfaction's like a heart of stone
So tell me why
Your love reaction chills me to the bone
So tell me why
Your satisfaction's like a heart of stone
So tell me why
Your love reaction chills me to the bone

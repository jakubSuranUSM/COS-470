Separate your mind
Overcome in time
I'm taking what is mine
Tenemos que pelear

Nothing is all, I thought I was there
I'm finding myself going nowhere
Is this a mistake?
I cannot relate to what is fake

Is this what I get for learning to speak?
For opening eyes and digging in deep?
Is this what I get for being reborn from the norm?

I don't want to shine; light will make us blind
I don't want to feel unreal
What have I become, born under the sun?
Planets will converge for you.

I'll try to break you!
I'll try to break you!
I'll try to break you!

What would it take to not look away?
To open my eyes and stare in the face
To learn from what's real
I'm trying to deal, but it's worthless:

Is this what I get for learning to speak?
For opening eyes and digging in deep?
Is this what I get for being reborn from the norm?

I don't want to shine; light will make us blind
I don't want to feel unreal
What have I become, born under the sun?
Planets will converge for you

Pushing and grinding is twisting my mind frame
El tempo que pesa nos tumba la mesa
why ahora que es nuestro, mi vida te apuesto,
bet my life!

I don't want to shine; light will make us blind
I don't want to feel unreal
What have I become, born under the sun?
Planets will converge for you

I don't want to feel!
I don't want to feel!
I don't want to feel!
Unreal

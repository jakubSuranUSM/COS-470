Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you
Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you

Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you
Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into
You! 

Down in the basement
Where I wanna glow
Why I don't know

Go waiting for a while
Give myself a smile
I gonna take that trip to the other side
I need to feel that I'm alive
Yeah, I will take my time

Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you
Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you

Save me from heaven
Said enough and more?
Now I know (know)
This night I have it all
Good times and getting close
I'm gonna punch myself
And leave it all
No fear, I never fall
Yeah, I will never fall

Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you
Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you

Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you
Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you

Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into you
Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I'm not into
You! 

Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you
Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you

Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you
Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do I don't want you

I don't want you
I don't want you
I don't want you

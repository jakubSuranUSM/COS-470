Money, Money, Money
Can make you turn your head now
Money, Money, Money
Can get you into bed now

Money, Money, Money
Can't give more than you get now

Money Honey, you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yeah, just to see what you could get
And Money Honey, get you breakfast in bed
Hey, Money Honey, oh, you drive me out my head

Livin', livin', livin'
Like a princess with a frown
Givin', gicin', givin'
I can't afford the crown

Money, Money, Money Honey
Hey, girl, come on, don't bring me down

Money Honey, you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yeah, just to see what you could get
And Money Honey, get you breakfast in bed
Hey, Money Honey, oh, you drive me out my head

Money, Money, Money
Must it buy a way to get now
Money, Money, Money
Without it how far would I get now

Money, Money, Money Honey
Without it you'd be losin' my respect now

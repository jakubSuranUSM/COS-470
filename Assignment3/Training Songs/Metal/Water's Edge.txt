I don't want to live here any more
The price is too hard to pay
With a little less take and a little more give
I might find a reason for staying

Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge
Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge

Give me a ticket to the promised land
I'll still gotta settel my score
The next boat is leaving and i be there
We're the last in line we shot the door

Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge
Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge

Now I am here in my paradise
Living my life my way
Love is the only thing that i need
I found my reason for staying

Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge
Down by the waters edge
'Cause there's too much gone under the bridge

You wanna take control of me I won't let you do it 
You say you know what's best for me 
I'm gonna make you prove it 

Your always complaining at me 
Get off my back 
Why won't you just let me be? 
Get off my back 

Tell me this and tell me that 
But I've heard it all before 
You still bitch my back is turned 
I'm walking out the door 

Your always complaining at me 
Get off my back 
Why won't you just let me be? 
Get off my back 

Your always bitching all the time 
You want my time you know it's mine 
Your always jumping on my back 
Just let me be myself 

I talk and talk you won't listen 
Your stubborn as a wall 
You always bitch you make me nuts 
I'm gonna take a fall 

Your always complaining at me 
Get off my back 
Why won't you just let me be? 
Get off my back 

You wanna take control of me so I won't let you do it 
You say you know what's best for me 
I'm gonna make you prove it 

Your always complaining at me 
Get off my back 
Why won't you just let me be? 
Get off my back 

Your always bitching all the time 
You want my time you know it's mine 
Your always jumping on my back 
Just let me be myself

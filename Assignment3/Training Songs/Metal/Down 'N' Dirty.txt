New kid in town 
He likes getting 'round 
Looking for new things to do 
Oh, he likes to play 
Most any game 
And he wants to play with you 

When he comes around 
Oh, he takes it all the way 
He's moving up and down 
He gets right in you 

Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 
Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 

Oh, he just might stay 
If you want to play 
Like a cat, he's on the prowl 
I know what I want to do 
What I want to do to you 
I'm gonna make it stick like glue 

Moving in and out 
In the alley or the street 
Oh, I'll show you how 
How to play me 

Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 
Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 

Just like a pussycat in heat 
You're always scratching at the post 
Red light, green light, go 

Slip inside, it's suicide 
Take you for a ride 
Meet mr. Hyde 
Gonna turn the tide for you 
Slip inside, it's suicide 
Take you for a ride 
Meet mr. Hyde 
Gonna turn the tide for you 

When he comes around 
Oh, he takes it all the way 
Moving up and down 
He likes to get you 

Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 
Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 
Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty 
Down, down, down 
Down Ã¢??n' dirty

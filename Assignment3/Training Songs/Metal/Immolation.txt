Feast on the flesh of innocents killed
A sacrifice to our Lord
A sign from below to slaughter and kill
All in the name of hell
A cycle of fury that starts in Hell
And ends with the race of man
Our blood seeps deep into the soils of the earth
Feeding the evil within
Religious fool, cry to your savior
Bargain with your sins
The efforts of God proven useless
Immolation now begins

Disemboweled...Desecrate
Death divine...Morbid fate
Creeping pestilence...Spreads with hate

Horrid cries of agony and pain Butchered beyond reason
Our corpses are left in heaps of blood, Piled up in the heavens
Impotent redeemer falls from Heaven's Grace
An idol no more
King of Hell reclaims his throne
Barbaric in his bliss
Holy priest, hold high your cross
Our fate you try to save
Pawns of death rejoice in glory
Lead us to our graves...

Dogma crumbles...Carnage is cast
Misery plagues...Forgotten our past
Wrath of Hell...Forever will last

Heaven defied, Christ denied
Evil desire, We'll burn in fire
Die in the pentagram
Where you'll be slaughtered
Immolate your soul in the name of...

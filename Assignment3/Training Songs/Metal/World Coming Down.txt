She thinks I'm Iron Man  
That I don't feel pain 
I don't understand why joy 
Must be feigned 
I'm so fortunate yet 
Filled with self hate 
That the mirror shows 
Me an ingrate 

I could easily start 
Pointing fingers 
Since the blame is mine  
It always lingers 
That the truth it lies in 
My reflection 
Though this can't go on  
There's no question 

Yeah I know that my 
World is coming down 
Yeah I know I'm the one 
Who brought it down 
Bring it on down 

How quickly pass the days, 
Long is the night 
Lying in bed awake, 
Bathed in starlight 
Better to live as 
King of beasts 
Than as a lamb 
Scared and weak 

I will deny my role 
As a human 
Holding myself hostage 
With no demands 
It's better to burn 
Quickly and bright 
Than slowly and dull 
Without a fight

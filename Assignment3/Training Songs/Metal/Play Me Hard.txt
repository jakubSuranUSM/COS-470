YouÂ´re so bad, and the storyÂ´s just the same
You leave me dirty in a corner, with the sweat
From your hands

You pull my strings
Then you wonder why they always break
You hand me over to your friends, itÂ´s always
When youÂ´re drunk
YouÂ´re such an ass

Now hear this
Treat me nicer, or your baby will go insane
IÂ´m so out of tune, soon the feelings is
Forever gone

Then youÂ´ll regret the things youÂ´ve done to me
When your vintage babyÂ´s calling
Come, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
I know you canÂ´t resist me,
In the end I am the one
Come on, come, come on and play me hard

YouÂ´re so bad, and the storyÂ´s just the same
I hate your stupid songs and when you play
Them on me
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
I know you canÂ´t resist me,
In the end I am the one
The one who sleeps in your bed when all your
Girls are gone

Come on, come on, come on and play me hard
Come on, come on, come on and play me hard

YouÂ´re treating me like shit, but you can not
Destroy me
I am all that you've got, IÂ´m on top

I know you canÂ´t resist me,
In the end I am the one
The one who sleeps in your bed when all your
Girls are gone

Hey you! How do you do?
What's the matter, sleepwalking with out a clue?
Get real, here's the deal,
Life's too short-spin the win,
Kick back, cut yourself some slack
Fun is what you gotta have or you're gonna crack

[Chorus]
Big Fun everyone-Fun job #1
Dum ditty ditty dum-big big fun
Dum ditty ditty doe-here we go,
On your marks, get ready, get set, let's go!
Get up, get out, get off your shelf-Amuse yourself!

A good time, another stupid rhyme
Hell-bent on pleasure, that's no crime
Get wild, act like a child,
You gotta get loose every once-in-a-while
Get down, jump around
Run wild in the streets, all through the town.

[Chorus]

Get up, get out, get off your shelf-Amuse yourself!

Come on, just do it, listen to me
You know you've got to be fond of fun as fun can be
Come on, we're ready, all systems go
I said-Just do it, say no to no, here we go on with
The show!

[Chorus]

Get up, get out, get off your shelf-Amuse yourself!

Big Fun everyone, I said fun job #1
Fun job #1, I said big fun everyone come on!

Since water of the womb
I knew I'd have to face you
The colour of my bites
Yes they remind me of you

In your blood I write
I am not afraid
This is who I am
And I will never be like you
I do not kneel
All I'm asking
Is nothing sacred anymore?

Sailing through the flood
Why did he keep two of you
Splinter in your mind's eye
My Phoenix rises to swoop

Still floating in the gray water of your womb

Take the edge of my thumbs
Bury the nails deep into your eyes
Maybe then you'll see my light
I'd rather crawl, drooling with the beggars
They've got more to say

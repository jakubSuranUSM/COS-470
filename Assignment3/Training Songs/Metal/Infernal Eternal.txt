As I looked into the mirror, and saw the creation which was fading
I sailed the darkened waters of my soul on the ship of flaming hate
Towards the land of the damned..
The cold winds of the darkness blow strongly
The cemetery glows in the dark
A thousand times, thousand voices are screaming in pain from beyond
A number of faceless shapes march forth from the darkness within
Life is slowly passing away, poisoned by guilt and sin
Embraced in Black I lie
Only waiting to die the greatest of life's events
And I begin my journey..
As hands of greater characters unveil the world
Plunging through space and time, my prison has now been slain

The reaper purifies my soul..

Perdition and death - I was in ages so dark and far away..
And I will always be

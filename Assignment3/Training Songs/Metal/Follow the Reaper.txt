Loosing the war I'm feining to win
Though I never tried to to strive deep
From within. Life could be beautiful
For anybody it's for, but I'd swear this
Mothafuckin' shit is rotten to the core.

The portal has been past and it's
Time to make a turn, to follow the reaper
Until the point of no return.

When your blindly death-raying blade
Sweeps the griefs and fears away.
I cross my heart and hope to die thy freedom
Will be mine.

Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-reliefing potion.
But after all, that got boring too, so no matter
What happens, I couldn't give a damn or too.

The portal has been past 'til the
Point of no return. No more lines to cross,
No bridges to burn.

Now when your blindly death-raying blade
Swept my griefs and tears away. I'd never go back
To cross that line.
I cross my heart and hope to die.

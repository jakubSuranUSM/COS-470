In times of bella foe fa lies cobalt cast and clean.
I gotta motor fare the wheel real fast and fear.
Tri-jacking blackened for moi, handcuffs and special keys. 
Triple lies and neckties divide. This will be his size.
Throw my case of Plasticine down. Maybe after you won't let it. 
Ain't about to pick my rounds. This is in my way.
Plop is fast as my hole's down. Green glass and most of all. 
Been around the somber town, maybe in the wall.

Every time
Every time
Every time
Every time

Every time the truth gets broken, I'm the one to fix it
All the hate don't mean shit, if you're not here to spit it.

[Chorus]
The fear that haunts us all
The beginning (of the end)
The beginning (of the end)
The season is way too cold
Will we last (another year) 
Will we last (another year)

You kill yourself, everyday you turn away
(Suffocate, Separate)
To face it all, would you save us from ourselves
Save us from ourselves

Every time the truth gets broken, I'm the one to fix it
All the hate don't mean shit, if you're not here to spit it.

[Chorus]

Every time the truth gets broken
Every time
Every time
Every time
Every time

[Chorus: x2]

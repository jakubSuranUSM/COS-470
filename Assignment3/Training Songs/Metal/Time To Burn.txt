Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
There's time to burn

Hurt is on the pleasure wheel
But you can't hurt if you can't feel
And you can feel you've got something to learn
You've got time to burn

You were lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play you've so much to learn
Like you never say never
We'll live forever
And you've got time to burn

When the wolf is loose in the city
The the city will fight to survive
You can hide in the streets of the city
But no one will care
No one will know you're alive
There's time to burn

Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
Just never say never
We're gonna live forever
Cause you've got time to burn
Time to burn

The full moon's shining high in the sky
A screaming black bat passes by
A cold drought strangles your throat
You try to move but you're leashed in chains

End's coming and the power of darkness
The Devil has come to require your soul
No, you have no right to refuse it
You have to say goodbye and to go now

Curtains are moving and a shadow appears
Your blood is still frozen, you're nearly killed by fears
A dark shadow creeps to your deathbed
It's too late to regret your sins

He says to you, "Well, surrender
I want your soul for hell"
You, you have no right to refuse it
You have to say goodbye and to go now

Oh sorry, you'd never done anything wrong
But nobody cares if you are gone
You were full of prejudices
Badness and real sin

You were against sexual liberty
Long hair and the indolent youth
I don't want your fucking morals and God
'Cause I'm the deuce now

Go and burn in purgatory
Go and burn in hell
Go and burn all your sins away
Go and burn in hell

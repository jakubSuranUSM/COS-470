In the land of the frozen sun
I saw a mighty sculpture, forever changing form
It told me great stories of the
Forthcoming storm

I wandered through the forest at night
Followed the path to enlightenment
I await my propechy to be fulfilled
The glorious night, eternal night

Angels rain from the sky
Their eyes filled with fright
Struck dead by the coming
Of the glorious eternal night

I see the world in flames
From the throne in my castle
The white one has fallen
The night is ours

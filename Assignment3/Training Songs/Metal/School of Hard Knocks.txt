It's no prob, you've got it out
And you say nobody thinks you're good enough
You're shot down, you're out of bounds
Oh, you're just another horse on a merry-go-round

Hey you, what are you waiting for?
We're knockin' on your door

From the school of hard knocks
Gonna bring you down, you hot shots
From the school of hard knocks
We came to rock your socks off

There's no time, you're all worked out
And you can't help feeling like a sewer trout, ha ha
You're goin' crazy, you wanna scream
Well, if you weren't so lazy I know you'd get mean

Hey you, what are you waiting for?
We're knockin' on your door

From the school of hard knocks
Gonna bring you down you hot shots
From the school of hard knocks
We came to rock your socks off
Woo, oh yeah

Hey you, hey you
We're all from the school of hard knocks
And big shots try to put us down
But listen man, they gotta learn how to rock

Yeah, from the school of hard knocks
Gonna bring you down you hot shots
From the school of hard knocks
We came to rock your socks off

Oh, yeah
We're from the school of hard knocks
We came to rock your socks off

Well, she used to be an ordinary cowgirl
She could handle her daddy's gun when she was young
And I never believed she'd turn out to be an outlaw
Now she is the rebel on the run
Now she's a stranger always in danger
A black angel on the run
But I'm gonna get her I won't let her disappear
Out of my life like she's always done before

Got a shotgun by her side gunpowder in the fires and
Boy, as she rides!
She just eliminates troubles times with her knives
She's a suffragette and she'll always be a refugee
Seems like she's always been the black sheep of her family

Now she's a stranger always in danger, a black angel on the run
But I'll never get her will I ever learn
She'll repeat the line I've heard so many times before

She says: Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Don't follow me, I'm lost too
Baby, I'm lost just like you

I recall she got lost already at the age of seventeen
Her daddy told she was always in the wrong company
She was my teenage love, the queen of the big, big rodeo
And I remember what she was always tellin' to me
Yeah, yeah, and I remember what she was always tellin' to me

Save the Weak (5:30)
D. Davidson

Take a look at what you have, and the things you own.
And thank God that you've grown.
Children starving and lonely, no place to go.
I really feel that there's hope.

Feelin bad I'm feelin sad, let's lend a helping hand.

Oh save, oh save, save the weak.
With a little love, that's all they need.

All the love in your heart and the love inside.
A people cruel and cold yeah.
Children starving and lonely, no place to go.
I really feel that there's hope.

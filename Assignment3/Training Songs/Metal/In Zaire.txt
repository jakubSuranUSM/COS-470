Once there was a battle there in Zaire
in Zaire
Hundred thousand people there in Zaire
in Zaire
All those people gathered there in Zaire
in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there in Zaire
in Zaire

Came a man called Elijan in Zaire
in Zaire
With him came the superstar in Zaire
in Zaire
All those people came from far in Zaire
in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there in Zaire
in Zaire

All those people chanted there in Zaire
in Zaire
Seven rounds of torture there in Zaire
in Zaire
One more round and Ali's there in Zaire
in Zaire
There was great excitement everywhere in Zaire
in Zaire

And who was the victor in the night? Elijah Mohammed's bog
Ali won the fight
the lightning struck twice in the night
First in the ring and then after the fight in Zaire
in Zaire

I can feel the night is calling 
Calling out to you 
Tossing, turning, oh I'm learning 
How to keep my mind off of you 

Oh, as the nights get longer 
Time's standing still 
It's the pain you're feeling deep inside 
You need some love to pull you through 
Pull you through the night now, baby 

Can't take no more of these 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
They've got me losing my mind 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
They've got me losing my mind 

All night the phone keeps ringing 
I'm nowhere to be found 
Your mind is racing and always chasing 
You know I'm running around 

Ooh, morning's getting closer and you wonder why 
It's the pain you're feeling deep inside 
You need someone to pull you through 
Pull you though the night now, baby 

Can't take no more of these 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
They've got me losing my mind 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
They've got me losing my mind 

You have no clue to what I've been through 
You tell me 
I need to feel your love tonight, tonight 
Give it to me right 

I can feel the night is calling 
Calling out to you 
Tossing, turning, oh I'm learning 
How to keep my mind off of you 

Oh, as the nights get longer 
Time's standing still 
It's the pain you're feeling deep inside 
You need some love to pull you through 
Pull you through the night now, baby 

Can't take no more of these 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
You've got me losing my mind 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
You've got me losing my mind 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
You've got me losing my mind 
Sleepless nights driving me crazy 
You've got me losing my mind

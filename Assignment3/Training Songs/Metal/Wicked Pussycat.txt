Enter those eyes split back opals
There within Eros is manifest
Dark and light soul sworn to no one
Both it's your game and you know it

I like you lots now, I like you better
Walking your cat-girls in leashes and leather
I watch you curl up into a circle
Symbol of eternity, wicked pussycat

My fall is starting

Six foot pussycat, I like the way you swing your tail
Big black witch cat, yes, you cast a real strong spell
Feline succubus, got your fangs inside her throat
Wicked pussycat, got your girl-slaves all in tow

Six foot Oni cat, I like the way you lick your fur
Evil kitty-cat, what's it take to hear you purr

A bliss so pure
A liquid lie
Come and drown me in yours
I raise my hands
To your sweet skies
But you're too high
And I'm a little too low

Is this my fate?
Where I belong
Shittin' with the dogs
When I roam

[Chorus]
Well I want you to know
Safe passage to the other side
We can provide
So I want you to go
Safe passage to the other side
We can provide

Of this I'm sure
I've got two sides
They wanna be left alone
I raise my hands
To your sweet skies
But you're too high
And I'm a little too low

[Chorus]

It's a trip just to see them, man
The broken skin on their bloody hands
And every time I feel I'm wakin' up
They make a fist and they run me through

I know you're all alone
Everyone has let you down
You know that you bring me down
I know you're all alone
Everyone has let you down
You know that you bring me down

[Chorus]

Safe passage to the other side
Is safe passage that we can provide.
Safe passage to the other side
Is safe passage that we can provide.

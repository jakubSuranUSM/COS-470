Verse 1
You, you say that you've got it figured out
That life's about, you do what you want to.
You, you walk the tightrope of unbelief
Can't you see? His way is reality.

We all know it's better to give that receive
Then why don't we give God the glory?
Don't hide it, don't fight it, just beleive.

Chorus 1
He is the reason for the season.
He is the reason for today.
He is the reason for the season.
Celebrate, celebrate.

Verse 2
You, your life can be a holiday
Everyday when He is with you.
Hey, let's get back to what it's all about.
Shout it out. Christ is the reason.

We all know it's better to give that receive
His gift is for those who beleive.
You got it if you want it, just beleive.

Chorus 2
He is the reason for the season.
He is the reason for today.
He is the reason for the season.
Celebrate.

Repeat Chorus 1 and 2

Love's incentives understood 
Irregular thoughts comply 
And still afraid of every word 
Love is unsatisfied 

Zero down to zero 
Submerging in every man 
Zero down to zero 
Catch me as best you can 

Well you must know something 
'cause we're dying of admiration here 
Mastering obscure alternatives 

Between the dialogue lovers run 
New decisions we won't decide 
And still afraid of every word 
Love remains unsatisfied

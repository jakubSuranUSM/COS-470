Retrogore, putrid obsession
Retrogore, maniacal possession
Condemned by horrid nostalgia,
A celebration of death

Vintage tourniquet, decrepit and failing
Surgical abomination
Retrogore, maniacal possession

Retrogore, reminiscent slaughter
Retrogore, noxious perversion
Obsessed by an age of cinematographic grandeur
Reality fades as phantasms take over
Surgical abomination

And as reality slips, my bloodlust persists
Condemned to decompose, your body lies broken
A slave to misery, debauchery and suffering so pure
Protagonist of insanity
A slave to savagery, with the hammer I shall thrive
As you step into my realm

Retrogore, reminiscent slaughter
Retrogore, noxious perversion
Retrogore, putrid obsession
Retrogore, maniacal possession

Ingrained frenzy, slasher extravaganza
The final step in a psychotic breakdown

I slip into dementia - I am death incarnate
I am the end - your end

Tendencies for gore, I always need more
My artistry, perfectly portrayed
I wasn't supposed to be - alive and breathing
Caught on film, immortalized portrait of filth,
The star of my feature film
I am protagonist, an artist of sodom
And as reality slips, my bloodlust persists
Condemned to decompose, your body lies broken
A slave to misery, debauchery and suffering so pure

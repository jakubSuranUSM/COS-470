There's always a need for violence
Slowly singing to the somber sun
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Dusted I'm the only one
I need to deaden all my feelings
When you comes to you
And should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
I need to deaden
All my feelings
Should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is attack

Say your lamentations
Set sail for hell or damnation
No honest words, on your lips
Confronted, think quick

I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's confused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
My heart can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust

Heard you say there's no need for violence
As you slowly sickening walk away
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Dusted I'm the only one
I need to deaden all my feelings
When you comes to you
And should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
I need to deaden
All my feelings
Should you rise again
I'll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
I'll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is attack

Say your lamentations
Set sail for hell or damnation
No honest words on your lips
Confronted. think quick

I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's contused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
My heart can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust

Trust no one

My heart
Can't erase it
Now I'm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
I've been destroyed by trust
I've used it
I've abused it
It's abused me
It's confused me
And consumed me
I've been destroyed by trust
By trust

Trust no one

If you apologize,
Will it all, just go away in my eyes
If you apologize

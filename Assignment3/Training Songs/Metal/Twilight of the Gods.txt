Insania two-oh-four
We've thrown away our former gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way

We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us

Fire and flash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky, never

Insania two-oh-sixteen
Error in store one-oh-three
We watch the sun at night
The pretty gods we've built ourselves
Now terminate our lives

Silicon brain powered voices
Are crying (attack) tonight
Our Gods are now fighting in anger, burning our world
The doomsday has come and there is no place to hide away
The future is over and there is no turning back

Fire and flash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky

Twilight of the Gods, insania's dead and gone
Another world was born but the twilight soon will come

Fire and flash in the night, now reality
Holy war in the sky

Twilight of the Gods, insania's dead and gone
Another world was born but the twilight soon will come

They're going off the deep end
Got my finger on the reset
Can't get you on the telephone
I think about my weakness
You got me going sleepless
I don't wanna spend the night alone

Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah yeah

Ever since I've known you
Been waiting for this moment
I'm standing in the danger zone
Can't hold it any longer
I thought that I'd be stronger
Can't wait to get you all alone

Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah yeah

I've been trying hard to say it
It'll be alright
Yeah, I think we're gonna make it
But we gotta try, yeah we gotta try

Now it should be easy
You got me where you want me
Don't make me wait another day

Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah yeah

Don't walk away, yeah yeah
Don't walk away, yeah yeah
Don't walk away, yeah yeah

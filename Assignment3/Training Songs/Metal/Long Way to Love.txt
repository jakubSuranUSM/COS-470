I see the love deep in your eyes
You let the lovers trouble the nights
In the morning sun I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace

You fell in love right from the start
It has to last from falling apart
In the morning sun I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace

Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love

Your fires dare to warm in my heart
You feed the flame for going out
In the morning sun I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace

Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love

Yeah

Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love

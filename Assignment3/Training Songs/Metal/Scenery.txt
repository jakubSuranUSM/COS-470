You were standing in your favourite light
You thought you were hot thought that you were tight
I've seen you and I know your type
I know you'll be at the party tonight

Scenery, that's all you are to me
Scenery, that's all you'll ever be

Dyed blonde hair makeup packed on thick
The way you look could make your mother sick
Gave me that look that I've seen before
Give up babe I find your type a bore

Nothin to say but you said a lot
And in the end that's what you got
You think you're special but I can't agree
Your empty lines don't make it with me

Made the party like I knew you would
Tried to impress me like you thought you could
It's all a game but I know the rules
Girls like you are backstage fools

Took from you all I could take
Your being here is a big mistake
Your empty lines got you a ticket to fly
And I've decided to say goodbye

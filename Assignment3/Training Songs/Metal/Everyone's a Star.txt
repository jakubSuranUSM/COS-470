Lay your cards on the table
Show the world who you are
Stand for the right
'Cause baby you can never lose

In your blood it's electric
And the power's in your veins
You've got a chance , might as well
Dance you know we're all the
Same cause...

Everyone's a star
Shinin' in the spotlight tonight
Everyone's a star
Everyone's alive

Like a wind from the ocean
Feel the lightnin' in the air
Look in the mirror
Are you the only one there

Go where you want to
Like an eagle flyin' high
Just take a shot
Take it while it's hot
All you gotta try cause...

Everyone's a star
Shinin' in the spotlight tonight
Everyone's a star
Everyone's alive

Everyone's a star
Shinin' in the spotlight tonight
Everyone's a star
Everyone's alive

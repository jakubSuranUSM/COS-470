Trapped in the light like nothing was wrong
Put the words where I don't belong
Now hear the fallen angel
Sing my requiem

Take a step past the light where I die
Flashback and your living in sin
It hurts so bad
Like a war within

Looking at the blank river of my life
Staring out with the evil to my lies
Keep the promise if you ever will
Just say the word, just kill go kill

Wrapped in the edge of my demise
You still cry my final goodbyes
When the years of cold love left their dreadful night

Try to move, let me out to my soul
Jet black so out of control
So now shout to him in cries
Kill them all

Looking at the blank river of my life
Staring out with the evil to my lies
Keep the promise if you ever will
Just say the word, just kill go kill

GO!

Looking at the blank river of my life
Staring out with the evil to my lies
Keep the promise if you ever will
Just say the word, just kill go kill

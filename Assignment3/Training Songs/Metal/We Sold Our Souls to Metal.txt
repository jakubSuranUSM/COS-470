Born to rage against the order 
F*ck the world live forever 
We wage war against you all 
I don't need society
I don't need your politricks 
We live our lives the way we want 

We sold our souls to metal 
We sold our souls
We sold our souls to metal 
We sold our souls

F*ck you all 
We don't belong
I want to burn your fucking world 
Destroy 'em all
F*ck your laws
Metal flows through my veins 
I wanna rage
I am insane 
C'mon punk make my day 

We sold our souls to metal 
We sold our souls
We sold our souls to metal 
We sold our souls

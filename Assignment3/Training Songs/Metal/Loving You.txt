Another day has come
ItÂ´s such a heavy load
Another day has come

Another wave of sadness
Another touch of madness
Another wave has come
A lot words of comfort
But theyÂ´re just words not answers
DonÂ´t wanna sleep alone

Another day, another war
Another night, another star
And through it all
IÂ´m lovinÂ´ you, lovinÂ´ you, lovinÂ´ you
Another town, another face
Another wine, another taste
And through it all
IÂ´m lovinÂ´ you, lovinÂ´ you, lovinÂ´ you

It seems my life IÂ´m spending
Along this road unending
Another day has gone
I guess thereÂ´s still tomorrow
To kill the seeds of sorrow
And then the war is won

Consume the resolve of wrath
In essence we will soar on great flame in the fall of the holy
Scratched out marks in blood
These grainy images in the chambers of perception
Inside the emptiness of this black vision
Agony within masturbations of the devil
The chatter of white noise is calling
Enter the loathing of tortured souls
With fear came thunder
Where the soil is red as blood
A voice of fire screams from the abyss
This book of the witch's hammer to provoke this raven deluge
Broken steps of the ladder in reversal of attainment
As locusts swarm from madness
Necromantic recollection of existence
Forty legions are cleansed in the imprecation of ancient tongues
Transmissions from the empire of evil spirits
Entity of dark faith to succumb to the murders of unlikely prayer
Great harbinger seduced from foreseen malediction
Outside perception of unleashed evil
Curious in the restraints of the blackness in hope
Raise the prodigy to ensnare with hateful thought
Future of slaved angels encased in ribcage tombs
Crawling in devout worship of starless contempt
Great one engulfed in forever dream
Releasing all the sorrows of mankind
Merciless in sleep of this ashen existence from soundness of death
Proclaim the attraction of this sinister treason
Conformed by the five Satans outside these chambers of reason
Defile the consciousness beneath this frame of pristine balance
Troubled ceremony in hopes to speak through the underworld
Teachings of horror induced in the overbearing of an ideal
Bloodless execution in the attributes of divinity
Within the hour of death spirits gather in dormant curse
Unrest in the expulsion of possessed as eyes are closed
Blackout this existence
In possession of the soul
Enter this nightmare

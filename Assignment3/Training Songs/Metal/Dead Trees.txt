Here we are, in the ashes of my desire
All the pieces fall from my chest down into the fire
Wait, wait, hold on to a feeling so good
Count a [?] pieces we're scattering burning so hot
[?]

You were everything that was killing me but I survived
Now you're just a memory stuck in the history of my life
My life

I wanna know for is it so I watch it go, into the flame
I wait impatiently to get away, now get the f*ck away from me

(Woah oh ah, woah ah ah ah)
You were everything that was killing me but I survived
(Woah oh ah, woah ah ah ah)
Now you're just a memory stuck in the history of my life
We live, we bleed, we die
The love we shared is now a lie

Here we are in the ashes of my desire
All the pieces fall from my chest down into the fire
Into the fire

(Woah oh ah, woah ah ah ah)
You were everything that was killing me but I survived
(Woah oh ah, woah ah ah ah)
Now you're just a memory stuck in the history of my life
You were everything that was killing me but I survived
(Woah oh ah, woah ah ah ah)
Our love is just a memory stuck in the regret of the fight
We live, we bleed, we die
The love we shared is now a lie

Blinded by a betrayal scene,
No one there to keep my trust
All these serpents in my head,
Make me see what I must

Scarred heart and wounded mind
My own blood now stains my hands
Fueled with rage, to stand and fight,
I will be the last who stands

Haunted by a murder scene,
My weakness was my only hope
Broken alliance, broken trust,
From now on I live for myself

Battered heart and hollow mind,
My revenge became my world
I regret not things I've done,
Alone I stand, still I hurt

I have no love for life anymore,
I no longer believe in the world
Put your life in the hands of another
And you sure will lose it all

I will not break down and crumble,
Now that I've found my strength
Show me the error of my ways,
And I will laugh at your face

I will not give in and stumble
Now that I see right through you
Try to make me change my way
And I'll show you the reasons why

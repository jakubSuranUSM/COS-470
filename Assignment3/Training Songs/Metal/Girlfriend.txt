Girl I know I've got a funny way of showing it
Yes, I thought our love was here to stay and blowing it
Was never on my agenda
She meant nothing to me, I meant nothing to her
Now I realize it's over, I just got to tell you

Girlfriend I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much so much

Girl, I know I ripped your heart right out so why pretend
That there is even a shadow of doubt that it's the end
Why the hell are we breaking our necks
When there's hardly any sex sex!
To simplify something that's extremely complex
You were my girlfriend, now you're my ex

(xylophone?)

Girlfriend I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much so much
Listen to my synthesizer!

Girlfriend I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much so much

Girlfriend I love you, I love you, I love you, so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much
I love you, I love you, I love you, so much so much

I am sheltered by this apathy
Nothing left to do but torch the day
Retreating deeper into my mind
What is it that I hope to find?

This is the aftermath in me
Tendency to keep it all inside
A fool's disguise

I am strangled by this sumpathy
Empty words with no meaning
Must release myself into the void
All illusions must be destroyed

This is the aftermath in me
Tendency to keep it all

How dare you compromise
The balance of our lives
Excuses you devise
An internal suicide
I struggle to survive
A perfect goal for which to strive
Ignorance cannot disguise

The balance of our lives
Hiding the meaning of
Hiding the meaning of

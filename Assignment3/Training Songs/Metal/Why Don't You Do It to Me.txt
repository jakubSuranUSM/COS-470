Stare into space
That ain't the place
You've got the eyes to see me
Reach for the sky
I'm not that high
You've got the hands to feel me

Now it's the time
To lay down the line
Sniffin' around for money
You're in the wrong race
A waste of space
Things that you do
Still turn me on

[Chorus]
Why don't you do it (do it to me)
Why don't you do it (do it to me)
Why don't you do it to me

You take all you leave
Don't have to believe
You've poison the air I'm breathin'
You send me up
And bring me down
You treatin' me like a plaything

I've had enough
So I'm calling your bluff
What are your ac, your dc
If that's what you are
There's a stool at the bar
I'll drink up my wine
And come with you

[Chorus: x2]
Why don't you do it (do it to me)
Why don't you do it (do it to me)
Why don't you do it to me

Why don't you do it (do it to me)

I know that it's cold (*)
Well don't stand outside my door
I told you before
I don't want you anymore
Changed all the locks
And took away your key
I don't care where you go
But just stay away from me
I can't stand it (**)
I don't need it
I don't want you
I can't trust you
Taking your chances
In the world outside
Taking your chances
In the world outside
I gave all I had
But you still come back for more
It's the end of the line for me
And that's for sure
Well I know that you're proud
And you love me to the bone
When it's better for you to go
You don't stay home
(Repeat **)
(Repeat *)
It's the end of the line for me
And that's for sure
I don't care where you go
But just keep away from here
(Repeat **)

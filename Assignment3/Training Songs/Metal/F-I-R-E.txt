Blazes a raise keeps me home tonight 
Deeper red in the Fahrenheitâ€™s 
Temperature is high lyin' here with you 
so satisfied with the things you do. 

No need for conversation no need for words 
let your love an electric blue whatever you prefer. 

I'm on fire baby I'm on fire 
Yeh I'm on fire baby ya I'm on fire. 

Star-spangled carnival parades on by 
Magic like the first time we were eye to eye 
Say Ya don't like the taste of coffee 
and you sure hate tea 
but you could shoot a shot of whiskey 
in your good company. 
So what started out as one drink 
became half a dozen 
and you said yours in the mood 
for some good extra lovin' 

I'm on fire baby Yeh I'm burnin' 
Yeh I'm on fire baby Feel me burnin'. 
I'm on fire baby I'm on fire 
I'm on fire baby ya I'm on fire. 

Nobody turn the fire out 
I need it hot when you're aba-out 
You're body heat will set me free 
My mind is there and body

I'm on fire baby I'm on fire 
I'm on fire baby Ya I'm on fire 

Fire burnin'.... 
Fire burnin'.... 

I'm on fire
Yeah I'm burnin'
I'm on fire baby
Yeah I'm burnin'

So god I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying
I don't know
the aberration of this world
I try to deal with
I've killed a part of me that was aching
The pain is gone
But denail runaway from institutions
I owe my self life

There's no way I will respond expression anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight f*ck
The reason you won't leave this cage
Betrayed your child with desire
But you wont attempt to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Anger
Lies
Denial

This precious anger
What lays inside of us won't last forever
Don't fear to let it out
Branches of clues the wolf is a master

The sky is all over me
I run out of time

We've played our roles in our passion plays
They've imposed on us right from the cradle
No matter what you dream, beware of what you say
Until the coghweel's out of control to burst out of place

No time to breathe, don't have no time to waste
Bring on the night, seize every drop of life away
Slice a tasty hour from (or in a blink it will be gone)
A stranding future bring it on

Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind

Mystery of a blood red rose
Feasting on a blind desire
Let the scent of poisonous flowers tempt me away

A sweet temptation and a pure red rose
While the hour don't wait for a blink to cram the past
I'll get a move on
No hesitation makes no one a better man
I can't wait to finally know now what is gonna show now in

Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind

Mystery of a blood red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

Boy, reach out for what is due
Or you'll lap up what's left for you
Throw ourselves into the waves
And as the grinding wheel of time
Is grinding out the chimes
To echoe in the night

We're off into the moonshine

Mystery of a blood red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind

Mystery of a blood red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

And I will waste no time tonight
And I don't waste no time at all
Tonight

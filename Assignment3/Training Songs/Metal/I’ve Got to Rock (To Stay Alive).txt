I've paid my dues, I've been around
I've had my share of ups and downs
I'll never stop, it's in my blood

I've got to rock, it feels so good
Can't stop me now, it's in my soul
I've got to play more rock 'n' roll

I can't live, I can't breathe
You got to give me what I need
Can't go on, can't survive
I got to rock to stay alive, stay alive

Play it loud, turn me on
Give it to me all night long
Loud and proud that's what I like

You've got to get the feeling right
Don't stop now, it's in my soul
I've got to rock, I can't say no

I can't live, I can't breathe
You got to give me what I need
Can't go on, can't survive
I got to rock to stay alive, stay alive

I can't live, I can't breathe
You got to give me what I need
Can't go on, can't survive
I got to rock to stay alive

Let me tell you what you need
You've got to set your spirit free
Just hear the power and feel the beat

Shout out loud and stamp your feet
Cut me loose but don't let go
I got to have more rock 'n' roll

I can't live, I can't breathe
You got to give me what I need
Can't go on, can't survive
I got to rock to stay alive, stay alive

I can't live, I can't breathe
You got to give me what I need
Can't go on, can't survive
I got to rock to stay alive, stay alive

I can't live, I can't breathe
I've got to rock to stay alive

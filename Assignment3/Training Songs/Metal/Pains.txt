Defiled earth, raped, and left in the dirt.
Pale and cold.
Naked and blind. Feeling your own skin for answers. 
Pale and cold.
A dead man’s wish is to be alive. But the man alive seeks death.
You're ignoring the wounds of friends while rotting in kisses of your enemy.

I see corpses upon corpses. These streets are paved with bodies.
I see corpses upon corpses. These streets are paved.
These streets are paved with gold.

And now you call “sex” love. Electricity is your drug.
And lions eat lambs but will someday soon be friends.
But you call “sex” love, electricity is your drug.

I see corpses upon corpses. These streets are paved with bodies.
I see corpses upon corpses. These streets are paved.
These streets are paved with gold.

Love.
Love. Love hurts.
(But love your enemies, do good to them. Lend to them without
expecting to get anything back. And you will be sons of the most high.
because he's kind to the wicked man.)

Love WILL TEAR YOU APART.

I see corpses upon corpses...

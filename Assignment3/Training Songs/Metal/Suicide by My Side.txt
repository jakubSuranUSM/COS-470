Living everyday through this nightmare no signs of waking up
Surrounded by my fear and frustration paralysed here I stand

So I surrender now, and give up on myself
Been sinking for so long, I'm one to deep now
How much more can I bear? Seems no one even cares
I'm drown in a sea of desperation

Suicide the comfort that I crave
Kill me now and send me to my grave
Suicide you're listening to me
Let me die and finally be free
Suicide salvation from my pain
My demise humanity to blame
Suicide your life is in my hands
Suicide stay by my side

I've tried over and over again, still you see, I can't hang on
Hopelessly I lie and wait for redemption, as I slowly drift away

Drink of the poison now and take my final bow
Don't know what lies ahead I'll take that chance though
For all that I've been through don't know what else to do
(I kiss my life goodbye so hear my last words)

Suicide the comfort that I crave
Kill me now and send me to my grave
Suicide you're listening to me
Let me die and finally be free
Suicide salvation from my pain
My demise humanity to blame
Suicide your life is in my hands
Suicide stay by my side

Suicide, be my guide, embrace me now, so I can die

Suicide the comfort that I crave
Kill me now and send me to my grave
Suicide you're listening to me
Let me die and finally be free
Suicide salvation from my pain
My demise humanity to blame
Suicide your life is in my hands
Suicide stay by my side

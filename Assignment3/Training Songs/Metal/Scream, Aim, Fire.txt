This song is called scream aim fire

Kill your enemies
My brother is dead around me
The wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me

Smoke is lighting, hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The carnage made is one for all
Will I meet my maker?

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Scream from the ?

F*ck these battlefields
The bullets stand around me
Bodies falling voices calling for me

Limbs are flying, men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The carnage made is one for all
See no prisoners

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Scream, aim, fire
Scream, aim, fire

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time

Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Lemmi hear, c'mon

One, two, three
Scream, aim, fire

Thank you very much

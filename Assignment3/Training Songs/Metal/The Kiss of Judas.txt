I hear footsteps closing in
I recognize them from my early days
The times are different the image remains the same
Repeating backflashes remembering the name

Approaching visions of things I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises
The night awaits

The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas

Haunts me once again
In your private chamber you're all alone
The well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
The flame of the candle casting movement to the wall

Your eyes filled with guilt keep staring at the door
Approaching visions of things I canÂ´t recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises

The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek

The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again

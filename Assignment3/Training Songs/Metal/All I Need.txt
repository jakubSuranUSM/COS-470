There are no ways to ease the pain
Your love is gone, it's not the same
It's hard to know what is real love
It's hard to know what is enough

No words, no phrases
In silence, no love at all
No love at all
No love at all I need
Is a little bit of
Something called love
What I need is a little bit of
All I need is a little bit more

The days are long, the nights are too
The crying starts, I think of you
The boys they come, the boys they go
But you don't come, I just don't know

No words, no phrases
In silence, no love at all
No love at all
No love at all I need
Is a little bit of
Something called love
What I need is a little bit of
All I need is a little bit more

I took you on a trip down to St. Luciene
I took you half way 'round the world
Why you wanna live in a hut in Mexico
With that other girl
With that other girl

No words, no phrases
In silence, no love at all
No love at all
No love at all I need
Is a little bit of
Something called love
What I need is a little bit of
All I need is a little bit more

What I need is a little bit of
All I need Is a little bit of
Something called love
What I need is a little bit of
All I need is a little bit more

Dysfunction is my game
These thoughts drive me insane
Tell me the price
Of which I have to pay
You see me pacify life
Take it under
Pull me under
You only want to know the real reason why

Give me the price and I'll take no blood
Your son of angel
Never could never be understood
You talk of no one
Talk it back with the fool dishonoured
With a knife you're scrapin' the resin

This game that we all play
It's coming closer
Tell me the price
Of which I have to pay
You only want to know
Can't wait and see
Come on inside
You only want to know the real reason why

Give me the price and I'll take no blood
Your son of angel
Never could never be understood
You talk of no one
Talk it back with the fool dishonoured
With a knife you're scrapin' the resin

The face you know can rule before long
You feel my hatred
Take it back and know your own place
You've never been me

Caskets filled with every slaughter
With evil thoughts that we don't mind
Don't freak out
Death
Don't Freak out
Hate

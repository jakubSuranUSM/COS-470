A lonely boy in the city	
Standing tall up to his blue jean jacket and eyes of pity
He's got a dream, now he told his Papa
"Don't you worry Daddy
I'll be back to show you what a life I've made"
With a tear falling from his eyes

He knew that he wanted to be
Oh, he wants to be, yes, he's got to be
Oh, he'd love to be a teenage idol

Standing in his hometown
Waiting for the bus that'll take him
Farther than he's ever been
Picked up his bags and kissed his sweetheart
"Don't you worry honey, I'll be back
To show you what a life I've made"
With a tear falling from her eyes

She knew that he'd love to be
Oh, he wants to be, yes, he's got to be
Oh, he'd love to be a teenage idol

Oh, if he could see, his name on the marquee
He'd live so happily, as a teenage idol
He's in another city
Standing tall up to his satin jacket and eyes of pity
He's got it all except for his Papa
"Don't you worry, Daddy 
I've shown them what a pretty life I've made
Even though I'll miss you badly
You know I always wanted to be"

Oh, I want to be, yes, I've got to be
Oh, I'd love to be a teenage idol
Oh, I want to be, yes, I've got to be
Oh, I'd love to be a teenage idol

Yes, I want to be, oh, I've got to be
Oh, I'd want to be a teenage idol
Yes, I'd love to see, my name on the marquee
I'd live so happily as a teenage idol
Oh, I'd want to be, yes, I've got to be
Oh, I'd love to be a teenage idol

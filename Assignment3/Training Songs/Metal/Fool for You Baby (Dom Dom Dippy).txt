I am a fool for you baby
That's what it takes to get in your mind
I am a fool for you baby

It takes a fool to step by
I've been a fool and ripping around a season
Lot a chick vandalism
I am a fool for you baby
I can't play cool
I am fool for you baby
I know I am a fool
Call it straight to you my foolish song
Here it goes

It's like the words come out wrong
At least she's not alone 

I am a fool for you baby
Don't you break my heart
I'd jump off the Staten Island ferry 
Won't be no more for you to bear it
Call me, I'll be there in a hurry

Baby I am fool for you
You are the one who changed my mind
I won't kiss you all the time

I am fool a fool for you baby
That's just the way it goes
I am fool for you baby
That's the song I composed

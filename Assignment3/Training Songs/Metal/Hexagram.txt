Paint the streets in white
Death is the standard breach for a complex prize
I think it's sweet of you and your parents are proud
But I would expect it from anyone now to protect life's indigenous sound...

Worship, play, play (3x)
Worship, play, Worship, play///Worship-Worship///
Play and worship, Play, Play (3x)
Play and worship, Play///Worship-Worship///

How the streets they swell
While the animals make their way through the crowds
If you keep listening you can hear it for miles
And trust everyone quicker with every faint smile....

Worship, play, play
Worship, play, Worship, play
Play and worship, Play, Play
Play and worship, Play, Play///Worship-Worship///(3x)
Play and worship, Play, Play (3x)
Play and worship, Play///Worship-Worship///

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God it's so sweet of you and I know you're proud
And the car bomb hits quick click, click, click, faint smile...

It's the same sound... it's the same, same... sound....

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God it's so sweet of you and you know I'm proud
And the car bomb tick ticks with the same sounds
It's the same sound
With the same sound... hexagram

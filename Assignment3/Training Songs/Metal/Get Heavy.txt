Ooh whoa hey spasmodic eighty four electric dinosaur desperado vampire
This heavy weight mytique way out of your league I trust my vision in fire
Warp into monster disco hell go grazy in the haze enter the freaky race 
Dave the way for the grande cliche now the monsters break their chains
Ooh it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again
Yeah it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again 
The powerbeat is back ooh monster squad attack
Aah I'm the king of night an iron parasite I'm a walking wonder
No I don't need no sense 'cause it's a weak defense I'm the rider of thunder
Warp into monster disco hell go grazy in the haze enter the freaky race 
Dave the way for the grande cliche now the monsters break their chains
Yeah it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again
Yeah it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again 
The powerbeat is back ooh monster squad attack whoa whoa yeah
Aah it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again
Yeah it's time to get heavy yeah it's time to get heavy again 
Get heavy get heavy get heavy get heavy

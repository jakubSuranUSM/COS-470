Here comes the water
All I knew and all I believed
Crumbling images
No longer comfort me.
Scramble to reach higher ground,
Order and sanity,
Something to comfort me.
So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be
Thought I was high, and free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny
I was wrong
This changes everything

Running away,
Running away,
I'm running away,
Running away
I'm running away
Running away
I'm running away
Running away

I take what is mine
Hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine
Bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place

Water's rising up on me
The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

Grounds break down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water

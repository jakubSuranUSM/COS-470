If you're lookin' for some action,
Runnin' against the tide.
Feel like causin' some destruction,
Spend some electric nights, on the danger line.
Fire down under.
Fire down under.
Flame and chrome, it burns the night,
Through your eyes, and in your mind.
Explode with savage thunder,
Hells gate, next up in line.
Fire down under.
Fire down under.
Fire down under.
Fire...

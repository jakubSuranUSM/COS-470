Final night draws near
On the old house by the hill
Night draws near
Where the children all played at will

When the sun at last comes down
Hushing merry din
Mother won't you look around
Are the children in

Been so many years
Since we played with friends in the streets
So many years
No longer echoes of childish feet

Until we learn to love each other
When will it all begin
Mother won't you look around
Are the children in

I'm so afraid
The wolf knows where I am
I'm so afraid
The wolf knows where I am

Goodbye to the world
Seems just like the other day
Bye cruel world
All tired of our foolish play

When we get to the other land
Where mother long has been
Will we hear her say
Are the children in

I'm so afraid
The wolf knows where I am
I'm so afraid
The wolf knows where I am

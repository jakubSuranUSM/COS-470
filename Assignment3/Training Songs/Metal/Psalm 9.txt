The Lord shall endure forever
For he hath prepared his throne for judgment
And they that know thy name will put thy trust in thee
For thou Lord have not forsaken those that seek thee

I will praise thee O Lord
I will sing praise in they name
Don't forget the cry of the humble
Have mercy on me

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize they are just men, just men

Thou hast rebuked the HEATHEN
Thou hast destroyed the wicked
Won't forget the cry of the humble
Have mercy on me

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize they are just men, just men

The Lord shall endure forever
For he hath prepared his throne for judgment
And they that know thy name will put thy trust in thee
For thou Lord have not forsaken those that seek thee

Put them in fear O Lord
That the nations may know
Let them realize they are just men, just men

The Lord will be a refuge
For the oppressed
A refuge in times of trouble

We are not holy men
But at least we try
Try to serve as best we can
Sometimes I'd like to die
Why must you be so angry
Treat each other wrong
The poor will not be forgotten
God loves us all

Mirrors reflecting
The broken illusion of one lost
And sinful mind's eye
Protect me while caught in this dark world of fear
And fading hope
My soul is worn

The Sun lonely words
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told
A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The Great Heaven's call

Fragments of tortured
Existence revealing cold whispers
Of lonely ghosts led by shadows
Enlightning the source of all evil
Of darkened faith
And mortal pain

The Sun lonely words
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told
A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The Great Heaven's call
The Call!

The Sun lonely words
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told
A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The Great Heaven's call
The Call!

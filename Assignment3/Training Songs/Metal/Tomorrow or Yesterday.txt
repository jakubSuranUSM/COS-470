Once i had a dream i couldn't sleep through
But it told me off a game, i just couldn't see through
Can i really, really say...
If it's tomorrow or yesterday

Is there really a story behind this moral?
Or is it happiness instead of sorrow?
Can i really, really say...
If it's tomorrow or yesterday

Solo

Repeat second verse

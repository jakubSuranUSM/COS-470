A thousand times, too many times 
I've fallen back out of place from a dream 
The bright sunlight, a rude awakening 
Like I'm seeing the colors leave the brush for the wall
That's when, into I reach into memories 

I long to relive those times 
Those younger days If only time would stop, stand still 
Maybe I could see myself 

What I've become, it's sickening, this isn't me
No turning back now
No turning around 

I'm disappearing into my dream 
I'm vanishing into the air 
Liberation, I'm free from all of this 
Now I must go, now I must go, dissipate into the lights

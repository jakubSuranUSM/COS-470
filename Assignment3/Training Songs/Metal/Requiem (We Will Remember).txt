Somewhere in the night
A candle burns for you
The eternal flame
The light keeps shining on
Your music is immortal
It's stood the test of time
You're gone but not forgotten
You walk with us

We will remember
They were born to rock and roll

This song's a celebration
Of what you gave to us
The legacy you left still marches on
Still they play your music
All around the world
Blasting through the airwaves
To the stars

We will remember
They were born to rock and roll

From London to Chicago
From the mountains to the sea
The legacy you left
Will never die

We will remember
They were born to rock and roll

Hang on to tomorrow 
Because tonight the stars revolt! 
Do you believe 
And will you learn to scream 
Like me 
There's nothing to it 
When stars revolt 
They're only doing what they're told 
What's the mystery 
The lights of death and fame 
Shine on 
Invaders from inside 
Can easily replace 
You now 
Hang on tomorrow 
Because tonight  the stars 
Target earth for me 
Because tonight, the stars 
Sing your favorite song 
Because tonight, the stars 
Show the way to die 
Because tonight, the stars revolt

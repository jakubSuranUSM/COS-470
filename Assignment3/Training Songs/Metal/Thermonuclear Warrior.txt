The atom germ wars gone precipitate genetic mutation
Social degeneration
Creatures born of malignant science
The children of technology

Plutonium anthropology
Who will cleanse the mess left by the past
Who will expurgate the scared cytoplasm
To rid the earth of abomination I proclaim my nomination

As the thermonuclear warrior
Strands of malformed DNA strangulate our future
Chromosomal executioners

I seek the dying, sick and deformed
All who would taint the species
Stabbing and choking and burning
And drowning exterminate subhuman feces
To every problem an answer must lie
To this I have a solution

Crush kill destroy
I will smash any resistance
Crush kill destroy
The reason for my divine existence

You may ask what's right have I
To take human life this way
Well I'm in control I make the rules
And I don't need your o.k.

Genocide is my way of life
It's a fact I will not hide
The millions I've killed to sterilize
Euthanasia's not homicide

Crush kill destroy
I will not tolerate imperfection
Crush kill destroy
I will impede the spread of infection
I was born my own master

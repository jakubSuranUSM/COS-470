Standin' on a corner,
Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, honey, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
They studied rows of verse,
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

Jack, he is a banker,
Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money
Then they come home from worka.
Sittin' by the fire
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you that life is just made out of dirt.
And the women never really faint,
Oh the villains always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
And life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane
Aw now that's sweet Jane
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

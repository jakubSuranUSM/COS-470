Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law, oh

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight

I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

Well I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha)
I can howl in the rain (ow)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
So give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight

Love me tonight

Spinning, further deeper
I know you're out to try me
I'm not in this to be a slave
Push the dirt, make me feel
Locate what swallows life Night bird you build my world

The night close my eyes (and then I close my eyes)

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much brighter from today

Drown the monster
Make all bad dreams go away
Whatever takes to keep running free
Open scars
The quiet place
The bridges fall to the ground
And you say you sacrificed

The night close my eyes (and then I close my eyes)

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down!
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much brighter from today

Judge me now
The king in my own mind
Judge me now
The king in my own mind

Judge me now
Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much better from today
A king in my own mind..

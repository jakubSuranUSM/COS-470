And I will continue to move forward
Crushing everything
Diamond crusher and I am the hammer
You're worthless, not me
Living a life that only I can see
You're worthless, to me
Singing back to a song that you'll never be
The time is now, to prove your worth
Show the world

If you're reckless, and free
Speak up, sing this with me, with me, with me, we're all fucking free!
If you're reckless, and free
Speak up, sing this with me
We're free, we're free
You can't fucking stop me

And as the wall keeps moving forward, distorting everything
(Dream smasher, smasher)
Look to the sky and scream with me
F*ck this place, we are free

(Your diamonds will crumble beneath my feet
? I am the diamond crusher, I am the dream crusher

If you're reckless, and free
Speak up, sing this with me, with me, with me, we're all fucking free!
If you're reckless, and free
Speak up, sing this with me
We're free, we're free
You can't fucking stop me

You can't fucking stop me
I'm relentless, you'll see
You can't fucking stop me
I'm the diamond crusher, dream smasher
I'm the diamond crusher, dream smasher

You can't fucking stop me

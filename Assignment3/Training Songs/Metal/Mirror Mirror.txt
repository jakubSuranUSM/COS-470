Look inside my eyes
You can see everywhere I've been
You can drag me down, I'll come right back again.

You gotta hold on to every little thing
Every little bag of bones
When the love's gone you shoot from the hip
You make or break it on your own
Love takes your heart away and gives it back in pieces
I look at myself and say now all I have to say)
(Is)'i know who to believe in'

[Chorus]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
I'm still here, I survived it all
Mirror, mirror, tell me more.
If that was love then love is war.

I am gonna fight until I win
Another place in time, I might have given in

[Chorus]

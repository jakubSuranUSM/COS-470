The Highest Intelligence as the explaining principal of existence
Visions and conclusions eager to reveal some kind of significance

Critical realism, an imperfect reality
Knowledge, a human construction of theories

Moving the limits of wisdom to edges of its disappearance
Explanations captured in schemes of time
Unfolded with human interference
The emptiness of ignorance in a darkened void of mystery
Unanswered questions to be solved by the presence of some deâ?¹ty

Spheres!

An endless galaxy of time zones, dimensions, preserve the astral secrecy
The unity of time and space, a human philosophy

A faithful reflection, an imperfect reality
Knowledge, a human construction of theories

Spheres!

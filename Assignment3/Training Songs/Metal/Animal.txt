I rise from the ashes 
 From the core of the earth 
 Evil undetermined 
 Claim my bounty?s worth 
 Rise all creatures and hail to the beast 
 Eyes full of fire 
 Consummate my feast 
 I prowl the innocent forbidden terrain 
 Unleashed, half human, half insane 
 Animal - howlin' through the night 
 Got my prey in sight 
 Animal - foamin' at the mouth 
 For your sweet delight 
 Come drink from the well of desire and greed 
 Angelic creation queen of my dreams 
 With passion and fire, I'm gonna plant that seed 
 Where ecstasy explodes in a silent scream 
 I'll make your blood tingle in a throbbing rage 
 Let natures bounty be now uncaged 
 Animal - howlin' through the night 
 Got my prey in sight 
 Animal - foamin' at the mouth 
 For your sweet delight 
 Animal - Surrender to my ritual rites 
 Animal - howlin' through the night 
 Got my prey in sight 
 Animal - foamin' at the mouth 
 For your sweet delight

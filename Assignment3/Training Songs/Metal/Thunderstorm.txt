In times of darkness
In times of war
The warriors will ride like never before
In search to conquer

The unholy light
The sound of thunder
Will bring us to fight
Black horse ride for me

Into the sky
I will fight until
The day that I die
Thunderstorm

Blows in my mind
The magic spell that
Makes me blind
Thunder storm

One of a kind
The legend that
won't leave us behind
We are fighting the dragon

With fire and steel
Only in blood and pain
The beast will kneel
In death or glory

Immortal we stand
So we will defend
Our holy Land
Black horse ride for me

Into the sky
I will fight until
The day that I die
Thunderstorm

Blows in my mind
The magic spell that
Makes me blind
Thunderstorm

One of a kind
The legend that
Won't leave us behind

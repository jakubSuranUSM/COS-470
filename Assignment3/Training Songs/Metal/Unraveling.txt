I need an answer
Some way to understand
This feels so convincing
And a little outta hand
So tell me one thing
Who gave you all those scars
That took away your innocence
You push away with everything you are

I can't take this anymore
I'm tired of breaking
I'm tired of breaking

I want the world to see
You sold a broken dream
You were not there for me
I was unraveling
All that we never knew
That could have been me and you
But you took everything
Now we're just here Unraveling

So here we are now
Break what's already broken
I guess I coulda seen this coming
If you'd been around
Lets tear the past wide open

I can't take this anymore
I'm tired of breaking
I'm tired of breaking

I want the world to see
You sold a broken dream
You were not there for me
I was Unraveling
All that we never knew
That could have been me and you
But you took everything
Now we're just here Unraveling

What have we become
The hopeless tonight and I think its over
We hope to find the truth still breathing
Can we survive the low

I want the world to see
You sold a broken dream
You were not there for me
I was unraveling

I want the world to see
You sold a broken dream
You were not there for me
I was unraveling
All that we never knew
That could have been me and you
But you took everything
Now we're just here unraveling

Somewhere in desert of the void
Beyond the wall
We're the last survivors
We're the ones who'll never fall
Men inside the circle, leave the night!
Darkness all around us,
Not a single beam of light
We all have is our faith
No will to win this fight
The time has come to break the outer wall
(Break down the back wall)

Grab your heart, I'll show you the way,
Now hold your head up high

High above, at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free

Men inside the circle,
Tell me what you feel and see
Delusions of reality,
The mirror of your dreams

Hold your ground
And I'll show you the way
Now hold your head up high

High above, at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free

[SOLO: Kai/Dirk/Kai/Dirk]

And when the cracks appear, upon the wall
We know the moment's here to see it fall
And as the sunlight appears again in our sky
No wall, no more, no more will darken our life

[MELODY: both/Dirk]

High above, at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free
Our return to the land of the free

Chimmy-cherry-some, we used to make up songs, remember
Sha-la-la-la-loo, I used to sing to you, remember
Hi-de-hi-de-ho, we used to kiss hello, remember
And then we said good-bye and made each other cry, remember

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la shoo-be-doo-aye
Remember all the little things we used to say
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la shoo-be-doo-eye
Wonder why we ever had to say good-bye

Sing-a-sang-a-song, we used to sing along, remember

The sparkle in your eyes light the starry skies, remember
We would hum along to the beatin' of the drum, remember
The band began to play and we began to sway, remember

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la shoo-be-doo-aye
Remember all the little things we used to say
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la shoo-be-doo-eye
Wonder why we ever had to say good-bye

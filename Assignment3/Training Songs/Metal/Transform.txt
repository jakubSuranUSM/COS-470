Oh yeah

How come everything is not like it used to be
And how come everything is never the same
Your head spins, turns around a look of confusion
This can't be real, I think it's only a game
They said one way, you're going
One way to be and
I can't believe in those words

[Pre-Chorus]
The truth is there is no truth
Mystified, can't compute
Well I say forget about
Everything you've heard

[Chorus]
You won't last that long
You won't last that long
You might as well transform
You won't last, you won't last

How come everything is not like it used to be
And how come everything is never the same
There you want to, gonna get, first time, last place
Nothing stays the same here, including your name
I've seen it all twice before 
They try to be original
Disappoint the way of the world

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

(Oh yeah, baby - be your right man that's the truth)

Hey, hey, hey [x4]

What's the meaning
You must be dreaming
To want the meaning of life
I heard you screaming
To know the meaning
To know the meaning of life 

[Chorus x4]

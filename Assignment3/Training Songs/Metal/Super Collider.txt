When you feel life’s bringing you down
And you see that you’re all alone
When your friends they have all run out
That is when you will know when to run

[Chorus]
On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(like a super collider)

This could be all the heaven you see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living terror
Come with me and I’ll train your soul good

[Chorus]

Just one thing that I want you to know
You don’t need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and I’ll take you home

[Chorus]

On the high road
(On the high road)
I will take you higher
(I will take you higher)
Till the world explodes
(Till the world explodes)
Just like a super collider
(Super collider yeah)

On the high road
I will take you higher
Till the world explodes
Just like a super collider

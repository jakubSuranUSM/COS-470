I feel the wind in my hair
And it's whispering, telling me things
Of a storm that is gathering near
Full of power I'm spreading my wings

Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I'm starting my journey, I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

I am Hunting High and Low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for, more and more, once again
I'm Hunting High and Low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
It's just a game that I play

After the storm there's a calm
Through the clouds shines a ray of the sun
I'm carried from all my harm
There is no one I can't outrun

Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I'm starting my journey, I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

I am Hunting High and Low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for, more and more, once again
I'm Hunting High and Low
Sometimes I may win sometimes I lose
It's just a game that I play

I am Hunting High and Low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for, more and more, once again
I'm Hunting High and Low
Sometimes I may win sometimes I lose
It's just a game that I play

Gross abominations
Dreams that haunt your sleep
Dying to awaken
Unheard cries you weep
Inner vision drowning
Shredding terrors nears
Clogging lungs you¹re choking on
Hallucinogenic fears
Chorus :
Incubus, disturbing nightmare
Locked inside your head
Assassinating rational thought
The dreams you dread
Oppose the phobid landscape or you¹ll
Suffer anxiety
Self witch - hunting pretrifies
Aghast reality
Chorus
Your own aggression
Generates the dreams you dread
Chorus

We pick the ultra-violets 
We get to wear the made up fantasy 
We like to spin the bottle 
Hogs on the road, you and me 
You got the vice to pull you in 
Watch the cobra shed his skin 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
You've got the hand in pocket 
The hand that bites and feeds our family 
I've got the magic potion 
It's called the anaconda snake 
Down go two fingers 
Heard you like all the lead singers 
You got the vice to pull you in 
Watch the cobra shed his skin 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
Yeah 
How many ways to fly 
You're going for a ride 
Tell me, how many ways to fly 
You're going for it, you're going for it 
You got the vice to pull you in 
Watch the cobra shed his skin 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
You're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
Oh, you're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
Oh, you're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
Come on, you're a sexy violet, shrinking violet 
Oh, you're a sexy violet, shrinking violet

Getting ready to scream and roar,
With a chug and a thirst for more.
Telling tales of abuse,
From an old familiar juice.
Tell 'em words of sin,
From a bottle of Gin.

Drink a toast to a place we can hide,
Drowning tomorrows everything is alright
So I sit here and drink
To the brink of a nod and a wink.
Keeps me warm in the cold,
Sippin' from my bowl.

[Chorus]
Feelin' right tonite, yeah, each and every night.
Feelin' right, alright, oh happy days.
Feelin' good today, yeah each and every day
Get to feelin' those halcyon, halcyon days.

[Chorus]

Getting ready to scream and roar,
With a chug and a thirst for more.
Be things as they may
We need to drink to today
We gonna have our way,
No matter what the say.

Casted out and beaten down then fell
The war of evil
There you passed on heaven's place

Hell of pain sinner we became
You're damned upon this earth
Not hell

Don't go free
Hell of snake's creation
The fires of the will now do

Descend into Heaven's bowels bent
And broken
Sent across the chaos void
Your end begins
Endless
And into the blackness of your new soul
You must descend

[End]Helpless
Your end begins and into
The blackness of your soul
You must descend

Casted out and beaten down in vain
You're now the prince of Earth
Not Hell

Don't go free
Hell is snake's creation
The fires of the will now die

Hell of pain together we became
You're damned upon this earth
Not Hell

Descend into Heaven's bowels bent
And broken
Sent across the chaos void

Casted out and beaten down in vain
The war of evil
There you passed on heaven's place

Your end begins
Endless
And into the blackness of your new soul
You must descend

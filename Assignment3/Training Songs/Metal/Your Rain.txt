Lost inside, I will stand alone
What I really need is what I really want
Talking to my deep side
Talking to my heart
Everything's so easy
Melancholy day
Melancholy day

I'm calling your rain,
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain

I've been right, maybe I've been wrong
Hiding all the mistakes, hiding what is gone
Talking to the black clouds
Talking to the sky
Everything's so easy
Melancholy day
Melancholy day

I'm calling your rain,
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain
Rain

I wait for every drop
I'm calling your rain
I'm waiting for the storm
I'm calling your rain
Your I wait until it comes
I'm calling your rain
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Melancholy rain
Rain

I'm calling your rain,
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does
Take me away
Running through time
I'm calling your rain
I'm calling your rain
~rain~
Rain for my heart
I'm calling your rain
Like the desert does

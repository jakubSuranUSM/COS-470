Myzsterious Mizster Jones.
He'll wanna read your palm and keep you calm
Got a voodoo head on a lucky charm
With a snake tattoo going down his arm -
The myzsterious Mizster Jones.
Well
He's the living proof of eternal youth
Got an icecold diamond in his tooth.
And the walls will tumble when he hits the roof -
The myzsterious Mizster Jones.
Oh
What's good for him is bad for me
Oh
It's hard to break a myzstery.
A double dealing hero
To bring you down to zero.
His origins unkown and he ain't got no home -
The myzsterious Mizster Jones.
He's into shooting stars
Eccentric cars
Grew up fussing
Fighting in the bars.
All he's got to show for it's the battle scars -
The myzsterious Mizster Jones.
Oh
What's good for him is bad for me
. . .
Whatever makes him tick
Go take your pick
With a five line rhyming limerick.
Is it his silver tongue? Well
Maybe that's the trick
Of the myzsterious Mizster Jones.
Oh
What's good for him is bad for me
. . .
The myzsterious Mizster Jones - the myzsterious MizsterJones.

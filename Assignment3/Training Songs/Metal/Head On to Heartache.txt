Secure and hold fast
Before you lose control
It's hell or high water
Believe in gods, hoovers, horns and thunder
Days of wrath, don't go seeking shelter
Poison creeps, serpents slither, then slumber

Bastards, paradise, true the bargain was made
Full thrust, enticed to an early grave
Deals were struck late into a cold winter's eve
The table was set, laid out for the feast

Secure and hold fast, before you lose control

Head on to heartache
Beware of the promises made
Head on to heartache
Steadfast to an early grave (Let them rot!)

Deals with the Devil, there's no second best
It's in my nature to say f*ck the rest
Ever thought the world was crashing down?
Man, people were talking all around

Bastards, paradise, true the bargain was made
Full thrust, enticed to an early grave
Deals were struck late into a cold winter's eve
The table was set, laid out for the feast

Let them fucking rot!
Let 'em rot

Secure and hold fast, before you lose control

Head on the heartache
Beware of the promises made
Head on the heartache
Steadfast on an early grave (Let them rot!)

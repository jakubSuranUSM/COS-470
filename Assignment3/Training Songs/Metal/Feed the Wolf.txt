I can feel the animal within
I chain the beast crawling inside myself
I hear the call of violence
I sleep no more and I can't
I've lost it all

Carry me through this world of lies
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more, and rise again
I've lost it all

Carry me through this world of lies
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

(It's no longer human, it's a beast, a merciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature
Every man's vicious and raw)

Carry me through this world of lies
I feel no more, the suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

Carry me through this world of lies (fight the animal)
I feel no more, the suffering (fight the animal)
Bury me in this cold light (fight the animal)
I feed the wolf, and shed my skin

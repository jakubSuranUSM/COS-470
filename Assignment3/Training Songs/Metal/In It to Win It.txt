Are you gonna live or walk away
Back to the wall cause you’re so afraid
And die a little more each day
Are you gonna get burned, knocked down for the count
You better dig deep for another round
Don’t let it end this way

I want to know now
Yeah, I want to know now
I want to know now

You gotta be in it to win it
When it’s kicking your ass
Are you kicking it back
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
Are you gonna bitch out
Or never back down
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
In it to win it and never back down

Are you gonna quit now and hide your scars
The pain, the proof of who you are
You’ve come so far
I would give it all up, you can’t turn and run
If you don’t take a chance you’ll never get one
When it’s over and done

I want to know now
Yeah, I want to know now
I want to know now

You gotta be in it to win it
When it’s kicking your ass
Are you kicking it back
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
Are you gonna bitch out
Or never back down
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
In it to win it and never back down

When it’s kicking your ass
When it’s kicking your ass
Are you kicking it back
Are you kicking it back

I want to know now
I want to know now
Are you gonna bitch out

You gotta be in it to win it
When it’s kicking your ass
Are you kicking it back
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
Are you gonna bitch out
Or never back down
You gotta get, you gotta get in it to win it
In it to win it and never back down

(When it’s kicking your ass)
In it to win it
(are you kicking it back)
In it to win it
(When it’s kicking your ass)
And never back down

I want to know now
I want to know now
Are you gonna bitch out
Never back down

Standing over there she doesn’t have a care,
Giving me the eye, I don’t know why.
Rock ‘n’ Roll lady’s got the boys dangling on a string,
She does her thing.

But I moved in and asked her for a jive.
The joint was rockin’ I knew that she was mine.
Slippin’ and a sliding all around that greasy floor.
Gonna rock some more.

Rock and roll lady knows how to move.
The rock and roll lady sure cuts a fine groove.
She’s a hip-shakin’ mamma with the boys buzzin’ ‘round her hide.
Rock and Roll lady knows how to move
Rock and roll lady sure cuts a fine cruise.
Humpin’ and a bumpin’, reelin’ at the high school hop

Now these black leather boys make a whole lotta noise.
Spinnin’ the queen on their throbbin’ machines.
She’s the queen of them all – out ranks them all.
Now the Queen is mine till the end of time.
Ain’t gonna set her free, it’s just her and me.
’Cos she’s the queen of them all, we’re gonna have a ball.

The sweat just pours from your body combat is nigh
Into the arena we march to die

Your blood spills to the ground your body feels broken
You face the earth and breathe the dust again
Your head is spinning you feel another blow
You hear the steel rip you to the bone

[Chorus:]

In the arena oh mighty gladiator
In the arena you are the chosen warrior

In armor and mail you were born to fight
Learned how to kill keeping the gold in sight
Who can match your fury none can give you such pain
Part man and beast time to battle again

[Chorus]

Your head is spinning you feel another blow
You hear the steel rip you to the bone
Your blood spills to the ground your body feels broken
You hear the steel rip you to the bone

[Chorus]

Is nothing sacred in these parasitic ways
Perhaps it's just another way to make you feel like you belong
I stand accused of all your insecurities
Somehow your smoke and your mirrors cannot hide the envy

[Chorus:]
Monsters under the bed, under the bed
Bash in your head
Somebody tell me, please tell me
Who's got my back

Harsh untruths and those pathetic little digs
I slit the throats of all those fucking pathetic little pigs
On my beach I kick up metaphoric sand
I flush the toilet of weakness with mushroom clouds in hand

[Chorus]

Stitch my throat closed
Cut my smile wide
Sew my eyes blind
I can still see through you

Is nothing sacred in these parasitic ways
Perhaps its just another way to make you feel like you belong

[Chorus]

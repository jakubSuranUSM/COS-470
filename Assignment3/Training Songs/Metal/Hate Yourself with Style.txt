Yes sir, no sir anything goes
Change your looks and change your clothes
Get in where you fit in play by the rules
Masturbating with the fools

Play the game, choose a side
Learn to lose, f*ck your pride

Taking no chances making safe bets
Acting like a teachers pet
Making your way but still not climbing
You're too worried about your timing

Shake those hands, fake that smile
Kiss that ass & sit back & hate yourself with style

Photostat copycat imitator
Faker traitor moneymaker
You're not a giver you're just a taker
Good for nothing impersonator

Chorus

Yes sir, no sir anything goes
Change your looks and change your clothes
Get in where you fit in play by the rules
Masturbating with the fools

Play the game, choose a side
Learn to lose, sit back & hate yourself with style

I was alone, she was a woman
I was a man, I never knew her name
And she was pretty, New York City
Goin' down the hill, going right on you see, and so

I just gotta let it go, now, now
The train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Well you see, and so

I just gotta let it go, now, now, yeah

Get it on, cheap little woman get it on
On my way
Get it on, cheap little woman get it on
On my way
Well you see, and ya go
You just gotta let it go, and now, and now

Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long
Train kept a-rollin' all night long, you see, and so
I just couldn't let it go, all right

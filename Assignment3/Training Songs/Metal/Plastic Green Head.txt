Plastic soldiers look stupid in green
They're not exactly what they seem
Night sleeps never bringing me dreams
Soothing sounds of your machine

Hey you Mr. Green Man
Won't you be my friend
Hey you Mr. Green Man
Keep fuckin with my head

Other friends have flown before
Mourning worn by the poor
Misunderstanding keeps knockin at my door
Just the wind and nothing more

Hey you Mr. Green Man
Won't you be my friend
Hey you Mr. Green Man
Keep fuckin with my head

Repeat 1st verse
Repeat chorus

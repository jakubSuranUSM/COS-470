Tonight, I felt stronger, inside of your ways, 
It takes a lot to get home, but its OK when the light is always on
I just want you to understand, theirs no need to keep waiting.
Another day in another hand, it could be so different.
A letter to me, your wasting time, 
You know you could be, yeah you could shine
But tonight you'll get it right, 
You will make a difference

Tonight, tonight, tonight, 
Feels so good, 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
If I could see through, even so far away
Its all you need too, make it through another day.

Surprise, scream your heart out, 
Inside you will hand down, 
Today it all seems too strong
If only you would try you'd move on

I just want you to understand, theirs no need to keep waiting.
Another day in another hand, it could be so different.
A letter to me, your wasting time, 
You know you could be, yeah you could shine
But tonight you'll get it right, 
You will make a difference

Tonight, tonight, tonight, 
Feels so good, 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
If I could see through, even so far away
Its all you need too, make it through another day.

Tonight, tonight, tonight, 
Feels so good, 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
If I could see through, even so far away
Its all you need too, make it through another day

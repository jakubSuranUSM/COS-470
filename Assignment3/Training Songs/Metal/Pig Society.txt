Polite to say that I drifted away and I never thought I'd care
Along the way I've made mistakes but I made them over there
If I told you twice I'd beat it what you never thought I'd beat
If I told you I survived in your pig society
You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what lies inside and you never want to see
Locked away in a cage today so I'm doin' what I can
Take these fuckin' chains off me and I'll show you what I am
You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what I've survived and you never would believe

chorus
Sick of politicians and politics and prisons lyin' and runnin' my life
You pathetic preachers and hypocritic leaders smilin' and wastin' my time
Servers of the people, pigs with broken egos, brother beware of the type
Drug me in and threw my in the pen, but I am still alive

Survive the hate of this fuckin' place and I'll call you when I can
Some snitch fucker died last night, do you think I give a damn
You don't know what it's like to be in me
You don't know what it's like inside and you never want to see

repeat chorus

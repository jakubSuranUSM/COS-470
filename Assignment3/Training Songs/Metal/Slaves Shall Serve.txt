Father ov Terror!
Abu ol-Hol
Enter the pylon
Through' the galleys ov past
Catacombs ov night
Into the starry womb

slay, slay!
Asar un-Nefer
We have no fear
Our time had come
Our will is done

dance, dance!
O Mighty One
In the fields ov Aqert
And spit
Upon slaves ov death

War God!
Trample all weakness
This is your day ov pride
Draw Thy flaming sword
Cut the umbilical cord
To set me free from eternal sleep...

lead: Seth

...step by step
Khem: evolution: spiral vibration
Can you hear?
Can you touch?
Can you see?
Can you really see?

we charm all jins -
Automata, inprinted realities
They creep like snakes
And all we feel
Is painful bliss
As we burn forth
Like winged globe
Like solar disk...
...and penetrate eternity

lead: Nergal

Slaves shall serve!

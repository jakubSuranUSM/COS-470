On trial for our fates, we are the runaways
Out of place with mistakes we never made
Because all we are to anyone is just a runaway
So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are to anyone, is just a runaway

Well if the water's so deep then why are all of you still standing?
And if the sinner's asleep then how can I rattle his cage?
I'm so sick of these dark days chasing me further underground
But I'll find my way to light and you'll find your own demise

We were not born the enemy and we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall

Well how am I supposed to feel like everything will be okay
When you try to suffocate what little is left of me
So f*ck off, you've dug your grave and I will be just fine
'Cause I'll find my way to light, it's always been here inside

We were not born the enemy
And we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
So try to live with the things that you've done
And try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me, I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall

Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away

On trial for our fates, we are the runaways
Out of place with mistakes we never made
Because all we are to anyone is just a runaway
So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are is just a runaway

We were not born the enemy
And we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
So try to live with the things that you've done
And try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me, I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall

Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away
Run, run, running, I keep running, I keep on running away
I keep on running away, I keep on running

[SOLO: MICHAEL]

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our High Priestess

Come, come into my Coven
And become Lucifer's Child

[SOLO: MICHAEL]

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the middle of the ring

Come, come into my Coven
And become Lucifer's Child

[SOLO: HANK & MICHAEL]

Suck the blood from this unholy knife
Say after me: my soul belongs to Satan

Now, now you're into my Coven
You are Lucifer's Child
Into the Coven
Lucifer's Child

Don't know why I feel
This way every night
Somehow lost my way
On this timeless flight All these feelings I keep locked up inside

I've pulled and twisted all those strings
And tried to mend these broken wings
Still inside the night I fly on

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep

See me as I fly
So high in the night
All these feelings surround
This new gift of life
With these wings I'll fly
So high in the sky

I'll watch the world
As it goes down
It's buildings crumbled to the ground
The panic-ridden streets
Will cry on

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep

You're feeling free
Apart from reality
All you do is run away

I'm falling from a hole in the sky
Once again don't know if I'll survive
Every second falling closer to the end
Broken wings of destiny
Spiral down again

You can feel the wind
Against your face
You cannot move
You're caught in place

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Watching in silence
Watching in silence again
Keep pushing on
I keep pushing on
Watching in silence
Inside the night as
All of the world
Is asleep

The pacifist won't last 
His view means nothing 
Take off your safety catch 
Earn your blood money 
Shoot first don't hesitate 
If they lie, you lose, too late 
No monument to grace 
You as you leave this place 
No-don't-be-fooled by 
All-those-codes-you've lived by 
The mercenary will act 
The suckers stand and take it 
Initiate attack 
Or one time you'll never make it 
Always assume the worst 
You fight or bite the dirt 
Who needs a good excuse 
Just stick it where it hurts 
Dog-eat dog 
Don't-forget it 
Or-you'll live-to-regret it 
Kill or be killed 
Live or die 
Kill or be killed 
Don't think twice 
I ride the wall of death 
I've never fallen yet 
No need to risk my neck 
Just second guess 
With every step 
So-don't-be fooled by 
All-those-codes-you've lived by 
Kill or be killed 
Live or die 
Kill or be killed 
Don't think twice 
Kill or be killed 
Live or die 
Kill or be killed 
Take my advice

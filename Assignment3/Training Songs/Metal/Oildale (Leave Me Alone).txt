Look at you, feeling all good
You can't resist, have to be all
Up in it, don't it feel great
Talkin' shit
I let it go

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My hearts gonna break from the fall!
Holding on to petty things!
Feeling all the hate it brings!
Why don't you just leave me alone!

What a puss, think you're so tough.
I take this shit
All I had was, lovin' me
It was so good, but that wasn't enough
You ripped that away!

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My hearts gonna break from the fall!
Holding on to petty things!
Feeling all the hate it brings!
Why don't you just leave me alone!

Oh this is it!
Oh f*ck! hypocrite
All the bullshit
You took from me!

Your such a piece of shit
Nothin' but heretic
Suckin' the life out of me!

Fucker your gone without me!!

Why don't you just leave me alone?
My hearts gonna break from the fall!
Holding on to petty things!
Feeling all the hate it brings!
Why don't you just leave me alone!

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me the f*ck alone

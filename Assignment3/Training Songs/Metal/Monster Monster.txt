Ooh it took me down I'm on the groung tryin' not the breathe 'cause I know I'll be found
Dray the lord 'till I'm sore it's pounding me until I'm driven in
I would be damned if I ever fell but could I tell

I would be damned if I do I'm damned if I don't this time I'll go for the kill
Monster monster I can't take this hell no more beast be gone something's gotta give
Monster monster gonna throw you out the door one will die and the other shall live

You taught me I shouldn't say I shouldn't do and now I'm defyin'
A human voice it's nature's choice now the hunter shall become the haunted
Damned if I ever fell but could I tell I would be damned 
If I do I'm damned if I don't this time I'll go for the kill

Monster monster I can't take this hell no more beast be gone something's gotta give
Monster monster gonna throw you out the door one will die and the other shall live
Monster monster I can't take this hell no more beast be gone something's got to give
Monster monster I can't take this hell no more beast be gone something's gotta give
Monster monster gonna throw you out the door one will die and the other shall live

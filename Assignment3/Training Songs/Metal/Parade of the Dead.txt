Exterminate the laws of old
The sacred past begins to roll
Oh oh the denying of your death
Oh oh the machines must be fed
Parade of the dead
Parade of the dead

The asylum marches on
The men that kill whats left is gone
Oh oh the denying of your death
Oh oh the machines must be fed
Parade of the dead
Parade of the dead
The machines must be fed

Revenge, and retaliation
The shadow of man's war has been killed

The masses in the grave
I bet that can't be saved
Oh oh the denying of your death
Oh oh the machines must be fed
Parade of the dead
Parade of the dead

Parade of the dead
Parade of the dead
The machines must be fed

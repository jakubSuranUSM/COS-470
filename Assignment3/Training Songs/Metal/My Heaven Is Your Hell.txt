As the night falls on the town
That's when I rise as day goes down
Trough the dusk to you I greed
I watch you wile you sleep

Freeing from my life eternal
There's no blessing in these curs
Night by night is so infernal
And yet is getting worse

My heaven is your hell
I'm about roam shadows
The way you shine is killing me
We two can not mean war
My heaven is your hell
And there is no tomorrow
If I stay I'll fade away by dawn I will be gone

As the morning sun will rise
Bringing death I can't survive
I should spread my wings
Oh I should fly, but tonight I choose not to hide

Freeing from my life eternal
There's no blessing in these curs
Night by night is so infernal
And yet is getting worse

My heaven is your hell
I'm about roam shadows
The way you shine is killing me
We two can not mean war
My heaven is your hell
And there is no tomorrow
If I stay I'll fade away by dawn I will be gone

As the sun, enters the room
I bid farewells
To life in gloom
I hear you scream, but I can't see around, that's my house

My heaven is your hell
I'm about roam shadows
The way you shine is killing me
We two can not mean war
My heaven is your hell
And there is no tomorrow
If I stay I'll fade away by dawn I will be gone [2X]

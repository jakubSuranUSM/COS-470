In the shadows of the dark night,
You need a woman by your side
She'll help you make it in the cold light
And keep you warm an' satisfied

If you want some more lovin'
Drive you out of your mind
Give a little sweetness and sugar
Just make it sure she understands

White skin women keep me howlin' for more
Brown skin honey, I love

Got a Whitesnake mama
You want to shake it mama
Got a Whitesnake mama
Come an' let it crawl on you,
Just enough to see ya through

You want to find a little angel
Sweet surrender in her eyes 
Broke down heart through morning
To the moon is on the rise

Night time is the right time
For rolling on the silent gloves
Daytime, nighttime, anytime is the right time
Stealin' round and makin' some love

White skin women keep me howlin' for more
Brown skin honey, I love

Got a Whitesnake mama
You want to shake it mama
Got a Whitesnake mama
Come an' let it crawl on you,
Just enough to see ya through

Listen

Back door man ain't done nothing,
But creep around the door..
When you see his woman weepin'
You know the snake is there for more

Day time, night time is the right time
For rolling on the silent gloves
Night time is the right time
Make it sure you're the only one

White skin women keep me howlin' for more
Brown skin honey, I love

Got a Whitesnake mama,
You want to shake it mama
Got a Whitesnake mama
Come an' let it crawl on you,
And you, and you

Got a Whitesnake mama (endless repeat)

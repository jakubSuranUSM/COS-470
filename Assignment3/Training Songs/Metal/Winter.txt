Silence is all I hear
Blackness fills my world
Midwinter days and lonely nights
Depression takes over
My frozen mind 

Morning starts a new day
Dawning nowhere to be seen
Oh, won´t you break
My chains and let me go
Free as a bird in the sky 

Winter blows colder
I´m feeling older
Visions of darkness
Breaking the silence

Winter blows colder
I´m growing older
Light fades away
I´m here to stay 

I´m telling you no-one could ever take your place
Open your eyes and you will see

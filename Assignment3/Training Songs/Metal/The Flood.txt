This world it needs a cleansing, removing all its filth.
Wearing your masks of envy but I see you still.

For forty days, walk the earth, removing all this curse.
These forty nights, and you're drowning as I fill your lungs.

Hoping hoping hoping, to drown the world.

To drown the world.
And now your world is ending and I'm doing just

And now your world, world is ending, and I'm doing just fine.

Look into my eyes and I can see right through you

This world it needs a cleansing removing all the filth.
Wearing your masks of envy but I see you still.

But I see you still. 
But I see you, see you, see you still.

This world it needs a cleansing removing all the filth.
Wearing your masks of envy but I see you still.

Hoping hoping hoping, to drown the world.

And now we drown the world. 
You're drowning in the flood.

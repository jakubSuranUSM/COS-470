We have to go on, have to find a way
It's not the first time, you should know
We've been through hard times and worries before
But in the end we always find a way to go
I don't follow, I don't understand
You use to be so strong and sure but suddenly

Heaven comes falling down on you
Dark clouds surrounding us
The light seems so far away
But still I believe it's not too late

[Chorus]
So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
Before we throw it all away

I know your worries, I know your agony
I'm also hurt from time to time
I guess we need to believe once again
That we can beat the odds like many times before
I don't follow, I don't understand
To throw away what we've achieved is not the way

Use your imagination now
Could you really leave it all?
We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again!

[Chorus]

You know we didn't chose an easy way
But somehow we've managed
To overcome impossibilities
We have only got this far
By being who we are

We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again

So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
Before we throw it all away

Victory or die!
What do you say, what can I ever do for you?
What are we gonna to do to pass the time?
What do you care when you find that life's unfair?
Equality is just a state of mind
Believe whatever is right
What's right for you tonight
You know where to draw the line
What have you done, what's in your mind, what do you need?
Where shall we go to let it out?
What have you seen, we don't know where you've been
Life so often blows your candle out
Believe in what is right, what's right for you tonight
Who knows what the f*ck it's all about?
Look up and see the flying saucers cruising in the sky
I saw one myself, it ain't no lie
Look down and see the road you're on
As if you run a marathon
That's the spirit, victory or die

What did they say, what have we learned, what do we know?
What shall we do to even up the score?
What do you find, if you find that you've got blind?
Darkness is a thing we've seen before
Believing is your right, all right
Whatever makes you right
You always end up on the killing floor
'Cause now they see the soldiers, see them marching off to war
Taking care for [?]
Never hears what they don't know, what they fucking do
That's the spirit, victory or die
Watch out for the monsters, and the eyes of the night
They're always hungry, look them in the eye
They are looking at your daughters
They've seen the flying saucers
You have to tell them victory or die
Or die

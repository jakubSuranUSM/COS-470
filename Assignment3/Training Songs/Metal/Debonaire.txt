I don't need diamond rings or high priced suits that shine
Limousines and flashy things or ancient bottled wine
Designer names and lavish things and million dollar hair
Bonny dames without a brain
I never really cared

I don't care nothin' about it
Wow yeah

I don't care for glitzy things or a fancy neighborhood
Glamour games or plastic fame or the king of Hollywood
Dazzling flamboyant things or a top hat on my head
Modeling for magazines and to be a debonair

I don't care nothin' about it
Wow yeah

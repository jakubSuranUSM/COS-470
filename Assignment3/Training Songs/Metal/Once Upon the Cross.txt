Once upon the cross

Fear him, fear him, fear him... Satan

Nazarene in the valley of persuasion
To receive last temptations from Lord Satan
"Take a bite" said the serpent "eat of it"
Without no choice to do so, you cannot resist

Impaled crucifixion
Compassion forgot
Eternal damnation
Once upon a cross

Blasphemy laughs at thee
Jesus you've been deceived
Struggling on the cross
Gagging to breathe
Despite your god, question why
You were retrieved by the angel of light

Kill him, kill him, kill him... Satan

Nazarene screaming on his crucifixion
Prophecy in its final contradiction
When you die is when the lie will be believed
Upon the cross, before the world to see

Once upon the cross

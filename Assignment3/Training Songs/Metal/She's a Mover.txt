Hey lady your lookin' like your scared,
I don't want to hold you down,
I just want to hold you close tonite.
You know, you've been a part of me.
Your leaving me here like this,
With just the memory of the warmth of your kiss.

Chorus:
She's a mover, so come closer.
She's a mover, but it's over.

Hey lady, I never saw you like this,
You're movin' away from me.
Don't you see that I've been waitin' for you?
Don't go spinning my head around.
Don't leave me here alone,
Now that you've taken all the love that I own.

Chorus:
She's a mover, so come closer.
She's a mover, but it's over.

Solo

Hey lady, you're lookin' fine tonite,
Come a little bit closer to me.
Make it easy to feel the way you want me to feel
With you, it's not the same at all.
You're tellin' all those lies,
When all you really had to say was goodbye.

Chorus:
She's a mover, so come closer.
She's a mover, but it's over.
She's a mover, so come closer.
She's a mover, but it's over.

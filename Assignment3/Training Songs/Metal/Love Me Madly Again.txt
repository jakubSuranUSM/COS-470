Love me madly again
Are you still cutting it on the street
Do you make savage love when you meet
In the zigzag shadows that promises much

Don't talk about it, show me
Talkin' about it's, easy
Don't talk about it, love me up

Is that lightning exciting ya quite as much
Would I could feel it, would I could touch
Don't talk about it, it's not the same
Love me madly, once again
Don't make it easy for me
Some like it tough you see
Loving is easy for me
A whole lotta love has passed this way

Don't talk about it, show me
Talkin' about it's, easy
Don't talk about it, love me up
Is it as passionate as it seemed?

Was it for real or some kind of dream?
Don't talk about it, it's not the same
Love me madly, once again
And should we meet again
Uncertain, out of reach
On the other side of time

Barriers broken
Thoughts entwine
Never words spoken
Love me madly again
And who can draw the line
A strand from me to you
A world apart, a smile
Loving is easy
Hard to end

Love letters tearing
Love me madly again
And when you find the time
Let's share a silk caress
Somewhere for a while
Mirror to mirror
Frame on frame
Within' without you
Love me madly again

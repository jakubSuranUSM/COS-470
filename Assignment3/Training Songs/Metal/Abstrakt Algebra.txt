In a place called the Ozone 
The two rooms divided, I was never there 
Are the vectors depending? 
Release the suite, meet the hyperplane 

Longitude and latitude, may the two never meet 
Make a circle complete with a line square and neat 
A bizzare way of cancellation, integrated transmutation 
The missing equation, the sixth inclination

Sictor virus protection 
The logical factor, the basis of Greek 
Plus and minus, they equal 
Two plus two, but sometimes they freak 

Digital and analog, a note inside the captain’s log 
Arithmetic, mathematic, same old form but asymmetric 
Elemental misery, transcendental elegy 
A maze of the mind and the code I can’t find

Enter password rejection 
Synopsis infection, carbonized seed 
Biological breakdown 
I breathe in the vacuum like a fish in the sea 

Digital and analog, a note inside the captain’s log 
Arithmetic, mathematic, same old form but asymmetric 
Elemental misery, transcendental elegy 
A maze of the mind and the code I can’t find

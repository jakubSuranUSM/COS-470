Tonight we're summoned for a divine cause
Remembrance, no
But for their future loss

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar

Beduins and nomads
Carried through the times
Through pestilences and famines
These ancient scrolls of rhymes

Our fallen angel vexed was banished from the sky
Recite now from the text pray for all to die

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard

Our father
Who art in hell unhallowed be thy name
Cursed be the sons and daughters
Of thine nemesis whom are to blame
Thy kingdom come nema

Tonight we summoned for his unholy fiend
Now celebrate the end

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard

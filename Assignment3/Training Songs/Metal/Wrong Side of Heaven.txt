I spoke to God today and she said that she's ashamed
What have I become.
What have I done
I spoke to the devil today and he swears he's not to blame
And I understood 'cause I feel the same

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell
The wrong side of heaven and the righteous side,
The righteous side of hell

I heard from God today and she sounded just like me
What have I done and who have I become
I saw the devil today and he looked a lot like me
I looked away, I turned away

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell
The wrong side of heaven and the righteous side,
The righteous side of hell

I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day

I'm getting closer every day
To the end, to the end, the end of the end
I'm getting closer every day

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell
The wrong side of heaven and the righteous side,
Righteous side of hell

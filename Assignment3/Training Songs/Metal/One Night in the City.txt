Oh, Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But rides in the night, 
But can lift you out of sight when they call, that's all

My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound

Of one night in the city
One night looking pretty

Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright, 
Where dark is always light
But there's no day, no way

The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name

Come steal away, we'll play the game

Do you watch, do you see 
Do you know the people in me
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm you poor, I'm you sure
I'm you holy, I'm you pure
I can tell you tales you just might not believe

One night in the city, one night looking pretty
One night in the city, one night looking pretty

(One night)

The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away, 
And one child stayed to play

For one night in the city
One night looking pretty yeah

One night in the city
One night looking pretty yeah

But chains don't make the wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Darkness in the night when dreams make up the light 
One night in the city, one night looking pretty yeah
One night in the city, feeling pretty, pretty in the city
One night in the city
One night, one night, one night, one night 
One night in the city
One night, one night
One child went away and one child stayed to play
Chains don't make the wall, dreams are lay just where they fall
In the city, one night in the city

We all carry the cross and speak what we're taught
Lies and money become the white man's god
We've burned all our bridges one too many times
The time has come now to draw the line

You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
Oh, you got to stand for what you believe

Alright, alright
You got to listen now
Express yourself in the face of change
Repress yourself, you surely seal your fate
You got to look inside, the answer lies in wait
Resurrect before it's too late

You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
Oh, stand, stand for what you believe

Somebody rescue me, come down and rescue me
I know the soul of a good man has got to be free
When you stand, stand for what you believe

You know you've got to stand
Stand, stand for what you believe
You know you've got to stand
Stand, and I said, stand or what you believe

You know you've got to stand, to stand
Stand for what you believe
So help us to stand, stand
Stand for what you believe

Believers help us stand, yes you do
You know you need to take a stand, well oh yes you do
Come on, come on you believers help us stand

Everybody come on, everybody come on, come on
Everybody come on, everybody come on, come on
Everybody come on, everybody come on
Stand for what you need

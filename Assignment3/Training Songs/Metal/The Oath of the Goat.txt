I have sworn the oath of the goat
I have bled for my oath
I have been in the kingdom unknown
I have sworn the oath of the goat
The everlasting oath, (I) never shan't betray
For I have drunk, for I have drunk the blood and the sperm of the gods
My soul has been raped, I carry bestial mark
Inside me burns black flame and I'll never betray, my oath!

I am branded, I have power
I have vision of the new world order
The time is to come, to gather the beasts
To rewrite history, to head for the final apocalypse war
To make the swines pay, pay with their pathetic lives
To create an elitist world, for we have given the power
We have the power!!!!
We are the gods, the strongest ones
And we will exterminate
And we will annihilate
And we will desecrate
Cause we have the power

We stand the highest! the strongest ones!
And we will rule the world the way it should have been done
So fucking die!

Given the chance to run in the race
The battle is on to win, show or place
Am I the one expected to be
Everything you want of me

My heart is fading in the time that it takes to blink
My confidence is slowly washing down the sink
Gotta move forward, leave that all behind

I do what I do, it's all I can do, you know?
I do what I do, it's all I can do
I do, I do, do you?

Eyes looking down critically, feeling their breath on me
Under the scope, they read every word
Defining what's good, what's absurd

Used to be that the world was intimidating
That was light years ago, just a passing fancy
Gotta move forward leave that all behind

I woke up that morning feeling slightly stressed
Getting an urge to just bail out, completely pissed
What did I know that night we made our way
Through the darkness and the shame

Don't let yourself run away
Cause we have another game to play
That night you would make us say
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to make
There was no way we could fail
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

The Pittsburgh syndrome

One hour of destruction, intoxicated bliss
Moments of sobriety would cease to exist
A sudden turn would make that city burn
With souls on fire, relentless desire

Don't let yourself run away
Cause we have another game to play
That night you would make us say
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to make
There was no way we could fail
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

The Pittsburgh syndrome

Don't let yourself run away
Cause we had another game to play
That night you would make us say
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

It doesn't matter if the mind's at stake
Cause we had another round to make
There was no way we could fail
F*ck all the details, get on with the show

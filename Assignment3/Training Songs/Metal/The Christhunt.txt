I know thy name
From the book of shadows
The curse to uncreate

Thy kingdom will fall
Speak out his name, backwards
And eternity will rot

I am the one begotten son
My heart is forged by blackest coal
I am he who maketh whole
The glorious goal of Satan's unborn soul

Terrorize the living
On the unexpected hour
When the last day comes
The hunt on christ begins

For centuries, milleniums
Banished to the ninth ring
Storm howl through the small passengers
As he moves his wings

I know the name
From the book of shadows
The curse to uncreate

Thy kingdom will fall
Speak out his name, backwards
And eternity will rot

A spiral down the freezing point
There were Lucifer reigns
Captured by the fallen angel
Locking their souls inside ice

A flow of frozen tears
Like bolts tightening their eyes
Losing their human forms bit by bit
Causing endless pain

I know thy name
From the book of shadows
The curse to uncreate

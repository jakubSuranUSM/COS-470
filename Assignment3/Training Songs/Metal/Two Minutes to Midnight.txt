Kill for gain or shoot to maim, but we don't need a reason 
The Golden Goose is on the loose and never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside this shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun for the love of living death 

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamor, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore 
2 minutes to midnight, the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight, to kill the unborn in the womb 

The blind men shout let the creatures out, we'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames, of a prime time Belsen feast
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies 

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamor, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore 
2 minutes to midnight, the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight, to kill the unborn in the womb 

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions, to make a better kind of gun 

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamor, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
But don't you pray for my soul anymore 
2 minutes to midnight, the hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight, to kill the unborn in the womb 

Midnight, midnight, it's all night
Midnight, midnight, all night!

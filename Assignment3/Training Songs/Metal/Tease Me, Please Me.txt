It's getting late and I'm ready for you
There's a message that's coming on through
I'm all worked up no place to go
They tell me babe your all talk, no show
It's not the way it's supposed to be
You take my love give nothin' to me
I can't stand when you say no more
You know it's your love and I've gotta score

Don't just tease me, please me
Don't just tease me, please me
I try so hard but it does no good
Oh honey I wish you would

The feelings strong I just can't wait
Bring home your love and don't be late
I've had enough of your teasin' ways
Your little games I don't want to play
So change the rules and come to my side
I'm gonna take you on a rock 'n' roll ride
There's more to me than meets the eye
So come on honey gonna give me a try

Your game is over it's my turn now
Relax babe I'm gonna show you how
You gave into me I knew you would
Givin' it to me I knew you could
Together now we will always be
Me with you and you with me
I was right and you were wrong
Ah listen baby 'cause here's my song

Don't just tease me, please me
Don't just tease me, please me
I got through and it felt good
Oh honey I knew it would

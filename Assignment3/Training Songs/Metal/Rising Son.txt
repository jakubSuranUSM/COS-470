Lost in darkness, like a shadow there I was
Always searching for tomorrow yet to come
Never thought I would see again
See the light shine upon me

Can't you see me coming, coming for you baby?
Coming there to take you from the light
Can't you hear me calling, calling for you baby?
So you better take on to the night, I'm the rising son

I was haunted, but now I broke free from the spell
But now it's your time to live the nightmare all through
Never thought I would run again, run free across the lands

Can't you see me coming, coming for you baby?
Coming there to take you from the light
Can't you hear me calling, calling for you baby?
So you better take on to the night, I'm the rising son

Lost in darkness like a shadow
Always searching for tomorrow
Haunted, but I broke free, it's your time now
So look at you all through

Can't you see me coming, coming for you baby?
Coming there to take you from the light
Can't you hear me calling, calling for you baby?
So you better take on to the night

Can't you see me coming?
Can't you hear me calling?
I'm the rising son

On scorched earth return me to be a simple man
I am destined by the gods to walk this land
An embittered poet, a slave to this black blade
Oh, my heart still searches for truth, a lost age

I have loved, I have lost
I have killed those who have loved me so
I have loved, at what cost
Lord, I don't know
I'm living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time

These robes, purple royal, claim me their own
From a city lost in dust, I stand alone
Evil thoughts; evil minds; must I live like I do?
Without fear, on borrowed time she helps me through

I have loved, I have lost
I have killed those who have loved me so
I have loved, at what cost
Lord, I don't know
I'm living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time

On scorched earth return me to be a simple man
I am destined by the gods to walk this land
To search for love, to search for love
All in my heart, is this enough love...
As Satan's child, I stand alone in hand
I'm a nomad of this desert, barren lands
My time is short, wild gods of air and sea
Stand by your corruption, and thrive by sorcery

I have loved, I have lost
I have killed those who have loved me so
I have loved, at what cost
Lord, I don't know
I'm living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time

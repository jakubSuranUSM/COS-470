Heart is heavy, feelin' low 
I needed someone ta talk to 
I called him up jus' to say hello 
I couldn't wait 'til tomorrow 

I hear 'is voice an' he brings me down.. 
Somehow it seems like the magic's gone 

I'm, (runnin' from the fire) 
The flames are gettin' higher 'n' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) 
Can't ya see I'm runnin' from the fire... 

Down on life, down on myself 
I needed someone to make me smile 
Oh just a friend but when love's on the shelf 
I turn to you to stay a while 

We talk for hours it feels so right 
Oh what ya doin' my heart's givin' way 

I'm, (runnin' from the fire) you' got me runnin' 
The flames are gettin' higher an' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) you' got me burnin' 
Oh I've got to keep on 

(Runnin' from the fire) you' got me runnin' 
The flames are gettin' higher an' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) you' got me burnin' 
Can't ya see I'm runnin' from the fire... 

(As time goes by), I know things are gonna change 
(Between you and I), it could never ever ever be the same 

(Runnin' from the fire) you' got me runnin' 
The flames are gettin' higher an' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) you' got me burnin' 
Oh I've got to keep on 

(Runnin' from the fire) you' got me runnin' 
The flames are gettin' higher an' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) you' got me burnin' 
Can't ya see I'm runnin' from the fire... 
(Runnin' from the fire) 
You' got me runnin' 
The flames are gettin' higher an' higher 
(Runnin' with desire) you' got me burnin' 
Oh I've got to keep on 
(Runnin' from the fire)

I saw a dream that can't be real
It takes me to my mind
Now look inside this evil dream of mine
I left you dying in the rain
Now you feel my fucking pain
You know I am insane 
But in the end it's all the same

In this dream I am only real
Take my hand and fly with me again tonight
Far away in the shining moonlight 
We are forever and together we will die

Now you are dead and gone 
I won't cry no more for you
I don't know why I'm going on
Now I am turning back for you 
You are dead, it's all so true
After all this dream was real now
It's only pain I feel
Let me go!

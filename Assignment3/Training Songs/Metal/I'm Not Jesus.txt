Dirty little secret
Dirty little lies
Say your prayers and comb your hair
Save your soul tonight

Drift among the faithful
Bury your desires
Aberrations fill your head
You need a place to hide
And I am

Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember me?

When your world's come crashing down
I want to be there
Your god is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
Jesus wasn't there!

You could confess it all away
But it's only shit to me
Your god ain't looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

No I won't
No I won't

I've thought you were a good man
I've thought you talked to God
Your hippocratic messiah and child abusive turned satanic

Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

When your world's come crashing down
I want to be there
Your god is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
Jesus wasn't there

When your own world comes undone
Let me be the one to say
I'm not Jesus
You can't run away

And the innocence you spoil
Find a way to live
Your god is looking down on me!
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

I won't forgive
I won't be whatever you want to

Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Not the same as I used to be
Oh, do you remember me?

No!

When your world's come crashing down
I want to be there
Your god is looking down on me!
I'm not Jesus
Jesus wasn't there

You could confess it all away
But it's only shit to me
Your god is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
I will not
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

Oh, I will not forgive, yeah yeah
No, I will not forgive!

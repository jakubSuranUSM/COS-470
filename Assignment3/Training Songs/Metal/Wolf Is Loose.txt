The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the wale
Refusal of return

Hollow eyes
Dry pale legs
Howling on
Through fields and graves

Language of the signs
Symbols to our sight
Guardian to thy throne
Take on form

Daylight
Hide the skin
Cut it of
Scatter ash in the wind

Shapeshifters rolling on winds of tyrants make
Fierce lore of fanged horn
Danger all the way
Night's sea reflection
The faces of bodies slain
Returning to the form of natrual human's fate

Grown from the cold
Spirits unclean
Dealer of the days
The ice will thaw

As the solider walks through the crimson side
Researchers of aftermatch
Dispelling disarming man
One-toed horses subject of genesis
And the immigrants

Fundamental side of a human mind
Hulder folk and fairies
So belive

The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the wale
Refusal of return

I'm one of them
Who have rejected traditional values of life
Trusting in slaughtery, vanity and apathy
Sucking my strength from other's weaknesses

When you think of me
You will remember from the scars of your soul
That I'm the man full of hell
Born with unsound soul

I'm rising from filthiest ground
And you will pray with distorted sound

I am the one who can't forgive
I am the blade that helps you cut your wrists
I break your wings and crush your soul
I know the ways to hurt you

I'm rising from filthiest ground
And you will pray with distorted sound

I reform your thoughts
I rape devotion, erase emotion
Now you're lost, empty princess
Staring at me

When you think of me
You will remember from the scars of your soul
That I'm the man full of hell
Born with unsound soul

I'm rising from filthiest ground
And you will pray with distorted sound

I reform your thoughts
I rape devotion, erase emotion
Now you're lost, empty princess
Staring at me, staring at me

Princess...

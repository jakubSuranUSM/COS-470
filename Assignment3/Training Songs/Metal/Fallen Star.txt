I've been drinkin' quite a lot lately, been thinkin' of the times, When you made a star
Times do change and we must rearrange, our lives with it

I'd like to send you a postcard
But still don't know your address, Don't remember your name, It's funny how your face
Is still in my eyes, hidden by a tear

I do believe in, that one day you'll rise again, I'll always keep on believin'
It gives me strength to carry on, without love the dark nights, a million miles away

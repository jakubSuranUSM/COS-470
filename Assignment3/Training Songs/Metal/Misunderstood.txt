Little old man contemplates 
Suicide twice a day 
Life's passed him by 
Little old woman scared and blind 
Left alone in desperate times 
Life's passed her by 

(Chorus) 
Oh life it's misunderstood them 
So they close their eyes 
And dream of better days 
Oh life it's misunderstood yeah 
Life's not always fair or so they say 

Little boy with vacant eyes 
Daddy won't be home tonight 
And he don't know why 
His mother she sits alone 
Tangled in the web she's sewn 
She lives lie to lie 

(Chorus) 
Strangled, caged, left alone 
Doin' time in a broken home 
Feelin' left to die 
I'm a product of your troubled ways 
You made me what I am today 
Now you're askin' why 

Oh, life it's misunderstood me 
So I close my eyes 
And dream of better days 
Oh, life it's misunderstood me 
Life's not always fair or so they say 

Restless soul deep inside 
Searches for some piece of mind 
Livin' just to die 
I'm an angry man I always have 
Had to fight to survive my past 
Sign of these times 

Life, it's misunderstood me 
And I know, know you've been there too 
Time lets a restless soul fade away 
Life's not always fair 
Life's not always fair 
Or so they say 

Yeah, life it's misunderstood me 
So I close my eyes 
And dream of a better day 
Oh, life it's misunderstood me 
Life's not always fair 
Life's not always fair 
Or so they say 

Little boy with hopeful eyes 
Daddy's comin' home tonight 
So don't you cry

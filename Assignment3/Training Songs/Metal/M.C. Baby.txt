My baby is hot, I mean the way she rocks
Gives her old folks a shock
The way she burns her wheels down her hometown street
My my my my my my my my my little motorcycle babe
My baby is mean, she's the fastest chic
That I've never seen
'tho' she's only sixteen, she knows how to use
her machine and she's so mean
She's sweet sixteen a leather queen you should
see her streakin' down the street
All the boys are jealous but they don't dare
to tell it to my my my my my my my my
My little motorcycle baby
On a Saturday night she goes out for a fight
'n' she beats them black and blue
I don't mean she's cool but she's so cruel
And she's no fool
No one can stop her an' no one can rock like
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby, baby, baby, baby
Drive on! Drive on!
Could've given her time, the best years of my life
want to give her everything money can buy
Could've given her love and a whole lotta more
Could've given her everything mommy can buy
My baby is hot, I mean the way she rocks
Gives her old folks a shock
The way she burns her wheels down her hometown street
My my my my my my my my my little motorcycle babe
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby
My little motorcycle baby E H H E E H E...
My little motorcycle be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be oh my baby!

Champagne glass of blood and wine
On chocolate hearts alone I dine
Candles weeping waxing fears
Ten roses for one year- disappear

Arrows faster in my heart
Each memory another dart
Love and death both colored red
Showing my past, my dream is dead

Another lonely Valentine's Day
I can't believe that things turned 
out this way
And though I hate to see you go
I know it must be so
Another lonely Valentine's Day

Nobody will break your fall
All for non, yeah, none for all
Nothing's so cruel as the truth
Join the Festival of Fools

Nobody will break your fall
All for non, yeah, none for all
Nothing's so cruel as the truth
Join the Festival of Fools

Another lonely Valentine's Day
I can't believe that things turned 
out this way
And though I hate to see you go
I know it must be so
Another lonely Valentine's Day

The dream is dead.

Goin' down to Rosie's
Gonna talk to Fanny May
I gotta tell her what I heard
Her boyfriend say

But don't you start me talkin'
I'll tell ev'rything I know
I'm breakin' this signifyin'
Because somebody's gotta go

Jackie's wife two dollars
Gonna get some '?'
Because she stepped out on the street, you know
Ol' George slaps her face
He knocks her down
And gonna blackeen her eye
So when she gets back home
Tells her husband a lie

Don't you start me talkin'
'Cause I'll tell ev'rything I know
I'm breakin' this signifyin'
Because somebody's gotta go

She borrowed some money
Ran on down the beauty shop
You know when she honked the horn
You know she began to stop and said
Come get my baby
Goin' down around the block
I'm goin' down the beauty shop
And get my hair styled

Don't you start me talkin'
'Cause I'll tell ev'rything I know
I'm breakin' this signifyin'
Because somebody's gotta go

An' I ain't goin' no further, no!

She borrowed some money
Ran on down the beauty shop
You know when she honked that horn
I said that she began to stop and said
Come get my baby
Bring 'im down around the block
I'm screamin' down the beauty shop
And get my hair styled

Don't you start me talkin'
I'll tell ev'rything I know
I'm breakin' this signifyin'
Because somebody's gotta go

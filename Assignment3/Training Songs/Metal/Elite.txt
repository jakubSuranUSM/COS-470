I am here to invoke the beast in you 
Tear out the pain that you've consumed 
Trust in me as I stare into you I recognize all that you've been through 
Because I have been there too provoke what makes you thorn 
Now flip that switch and transform we are
Fucking elite 
And nothing can ever touch us 
We are elite 
As for the rest, obsolete within these walls we are defiant 
Look at this as your therapy 
Lose yourself in this moment of cleansing 
Lose yourself 
In this moment of intensity as for the rest, obsolete
We are elite 
We are elite 
We are elite shed your mortal shell 
Let those inner demons free 
Close those eyes and dig deep 
Clench your fists and with me say what makes your hair stand tall 
What makes your blood boil 
What makes your sking crawl channel these feelings and erupt 
Now we're rigged and set to explode we are elite 
This is where you belong! we are elite 
This is where you belong! we are elite

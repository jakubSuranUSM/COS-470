Sit down and listen 
I'm going to tell you about a place 
Which existence was so long ago 
And far away 

A small and funny village 
So full of laugh and joy 
Until a cloudy day 
When everything has burst away 

Take my hand and we'll go back in time 
Just before the evil rituals 
Hold on tight and read my mind 
So you won't forget what I'll say 

I can tell you 
About the evil forces 
That came down from the hills 
To kill and slaughter man 

But instead I beg you 
To keep your heart clean 
And make sure that the opposite 
Remind you of what I'll say 

Take my hand and we'll go back in time 
Just before the evil rituals 
Hold on tight and read my mind 
So you won't forget what I'll say 

Now! Help me find a way
To make you understand
The way that mankind's selfishness
Will make people all banned
Quick! Give me answers
To all my unsolved thoughts
Or is it really so it is
That we will never learn, at all?

Hollywood we never goin' down
Hollywood we never goin' down
Hollywood we never goin' down

And all the kids in the hood
Come on wave and shake your hands
Hollywood we never goin' down
And when you're drunk shake that ass
Like you know how to dance
Hollywood we never goin' down

Start getting loud I wanna party now
If you hate on Undead that's a party foul
I only drink Mickey's, I can't afford the cans
I drink so much they call me Charlie 40 Hands

If the keg is tapped, then you're getting capped
Take your girl to the sack and I'll take a nap
Ladies drink 'em fast so I could have a blast
You got your beer gog's on and I'm getting ass
Like, oh my god, is that Charlie Scene'

Ladies show me your treats like its Halloween
You got a fake I.D. and your seventeen
I'm a complete catastrophe
Buzzing around you like a bumble bee

So let's take some shots
Do a beer run and flip off a cop
Girls give me props and there on my jock
Paris Hilton said, that's hot
When she saw my cock! That's hot!

And all the kids in the hood
Come on wave and shake your hands
Hollywood we never goin' down
And when you're drunk shake that ass
Like you know how to dance
Hollywood we never goin' down

I'm About to serve it up for all you party goers
Scene kids, meat heads, alchi's, stoners
Dancing around like a bunch of fagots
Funnier than f*ck, you can ask Bob Saggot

I never claimed that I knew how to dance
But I'll get drunk, get high, pull down my pants
So f*ck five bucks just fill up my cup
Don't kiss me bitch, you just threw up

Now I'm drunk as f*ck about to pass out
Destination your mothers couch
Dude is it true that you screwed my mom'
F*ck yeah bro that pussy was bomb!

So I'm hopping, jumping, sipping, and skipping
It's nights like these that we all love living
So take out your hands and throw the H.U. up
Now wave it around like you don't give a f*ck
Check please

And all the kids in the hood
Come on wave and shake your hands
Hollywood we never goin' down
And when you're drunk shake that ass
Like you know how to dance
Hollywood we never goin' down

Can't stop, won't stop
Charlie make the booty drop
Can't stop, won't stop
Someone make the booty drop
Can't stop, won't stop
J make the booty drop
Can't stop, won't stop
Shady make the booty drop

Can't stop, won't stop
Kurlzz make the booty drop
Can't stop, won't stop
Funny make the booty drop
Can't stop, won't stop
Let me see the panties drop
Producers on the dance floor
Let me see your booty pop

Grab your drink, get on the floor!
Grab your drink, and get on the floor!
Let's dance in the Hood
Shake that ass Hollywood

And all the kids in the hood
Come on wave and shake your hands
Hollywood we never goin' down
And when you're drunk shake that ass
Like you know how to dance
Hollywood we never goin' down

Let's dance in the Hood
Shake that ass Hollywood

Hollywood we never goin' down

Let's dance in the Hood
Shake that ass Hollywood

Hollywood we never goin' down

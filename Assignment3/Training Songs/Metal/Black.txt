Unknown substance, a putrid cloud, choking all within
Results of progress, a noxious waste, floating in the air
Living free? Chemically, so now our world is fading into slowly burning out
Prime wealth? Toxic health, advancing towards extinction is the way it's turning out
Foul air? Do you care? Is cleanness where you live going against your common believe
Too much slime, insufficient time? In a suffocated future will you find the time to breathe

Jammed in one place
Blind in haste
Progress can't wait
A life in waste
Tending towards, technology
Reverse of, life's biology

Chemical comatose
Radiation overdose
Burning, melting flesh

Leaking slime of dissolving waste
Overflowing blackness of death
Creation is being torn down by abuse
Infringement of the substance and our use
Elements decomposing, dilution is too slow
Every contribution, to the evolution
Its bad gets worse; deathly course.

Swallowed in black
Faced with reality?
Search your memory
Nothing dead ever comes back, the black

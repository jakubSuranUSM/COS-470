Imperfection, new temptation
innocence will breed new life
disillusion, desperation
free my mind and let it rise
mass enslavement, brutal torment
tomorrow will they see it clear
resurrection, disconnection
substance that can make us fly without fear
without fear

never to be seen again
ever to release the pain
renewal of your mind

female's poison, male aggression
distance to reality
foreign places, fallen kingdoms
always keep secrets from me
subliminal, disciplinal
the art of lying lives on and on
as we struggle, as we suffer
inferior to life renewal has begun

never to be seen again
ever to release the pain
renewal of our minds
renewal of my mind

isolation, illumination
modern men embrace the light
war believers, peace deceivers
remaining in eternal night
politicians, fake musicians
create no relationships
hate frustrators, penetrators
resistance from a path that should not exist

never to be seen again
ever to release the pain
renewal of my mind
of my mind

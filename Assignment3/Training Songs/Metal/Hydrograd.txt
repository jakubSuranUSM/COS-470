Don't come over, I don't want your company
I think you ought to spend a little bit of time alone
You say you don't need it, but damn I know you gotta have it
I tell you why, it's stronger when it's on it's own

Oh, I gotta love it on the inside
This hell is nothing new
If there's a heaven on the other side
You better pray I don't get through

I'm not better than you, I'm just better
I've been fighting just to breathe my whole damn life
What do you think you know and what do you wanna know
I never thought I'd let the truth tell all my lies
My lies yeah

Oh, I gotta love it on the inside
This hell is nothing new
If there's a heaven on the other side
You better pray I don't get through

Bleeding for the savages
You bill me for the damages
When you're dealing with the devil
You know you gotta watch your back
Stack, you're thick, you're slick
They pull you in a killer embrace, to your face
You can trust em, love em
Until you start to turn it away
And then they throw it all away

Oh, I gotta love it on the inside
This hell is nothing new
If there's a heaven on the other side
You better pray I don't get through

Oh, I gotta love it on the inside
This hell is nothing new
If there's a heaven on the other side
You better pray I don't get through

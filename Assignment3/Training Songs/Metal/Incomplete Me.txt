The night rolls on like the beat of a drum
It goes bang, bang, bang. Til the morning comes
I'm screaming at the sun just to feel this
Just to feel this, just to feel

The night rolls on like the beat of a drum
It goes bang, bang, bang. Til the morning comes
I'm screaming at the sun just to feel this
Just to feel this, just to feel!

On and On, I Keep building
On and on, these walls to keep you out
I'm not lost, I know exactly who I am
And that's not my problem
So if you think there's room in this heart for two
You should know that you fall the hardest

The night rolls on like the beat of a drum
It goes bang, bang, bang. Til the morning comes
I'm screaming at the sun just to feel this
Just to feel this, just to feel

The night rolls on like the beat of a drum
It goes bang, bang, bang. Til the morning comes
I'm screaming at the sun just to feel this
Just to feel this, just to feel!

Brace yourselves, 'cause there's no meant to be
We're all dreaming
With all I've known and all I've seen
Could there ever be, could you ever
Incomplete me

On and on, I've never hated anyone
Without them hurting someone I love
On and on, I've never loved anyone
Without them hurting me, my heart's a black hole!

On and on, I've built these walls to keep you out
But do they just keep me in?

The night rolls on, the night rolls on
The night rolls on like the beat of a drum
It goes bang, bang, bang. Til the morning comes
I'm screaming at the sun just to feel this
Just to feel this, just to feel!

Brace yourselves, 'cause there's no meant to be
We're all dreaming
With all I've known and all I've seen
Could there ever be, could you ever
Incomplete me

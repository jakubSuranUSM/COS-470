I been wounded by ambition
Promised the impossible dream
Lied to me with pen and ink
Criticized for ministry
Reach out for the lost Manipulated
by my friends
The heart is desperately wicked
Who are the Born Again?

God cannot change
God cannot lie
God does not evolve

God cannot change
God cannot lie
God does not evolve

All is gained all alone
Nothing?s lost all if found
All for love

(god it is all heard)????
All is gained all alone
Nothing?s lost all if found
All for love

(god it is all heard)????
You say I have a problem
Sounds like you have a problem
I got no problem with you

Only thing I know

God?s Word is pure
Only thing to liberate my soul

You can't keep your soul
You talk about love

This is my freedom
This is my statement
This is God?s music
Here is my confession

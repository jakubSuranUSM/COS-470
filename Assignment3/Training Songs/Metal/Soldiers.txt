On your feet, who's with me

Lock tide, hold steady, there it goes stand ready
There is no compromise, your pain your worth your sacrifice

On your feet, who's with me
On your feet, let's go

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you
Let's go

(Whoah, yeaheah) This is for the soldiers

Every time I see inside you I see myself within you, don't let that fade away
Your pride inside of me, your honor inside me, respect inside of inside of me, go

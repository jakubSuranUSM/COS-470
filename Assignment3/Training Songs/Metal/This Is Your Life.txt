Who cares what came before
We were only starlight
One day, then nevermore
Because we're whispers in the wind

Once upon a time
The world was never blind
Like we are

Right now it seems
You're only dreams and shadows
If wishes could be eagles how you'd fly

This is your life
This is your time
What if the flame won't last forever
This is your here
This is your now
Let it be magical

Who cares what came before
We're only starlight

Once upon the time
All the world was blind
Like we are

This is your life
This is your time
Look at your world
This is your life

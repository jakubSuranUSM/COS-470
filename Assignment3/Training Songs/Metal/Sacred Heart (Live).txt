Hey the old ones speak of winter, the young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away
Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a day

Whenever we dream that's when we fly
So here is a dream for just you and I

We'll find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night, yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart

Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass
And he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do, yeah

Oh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
But oh, sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun

And find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look to the light

You fight to kill the dragon you bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground
Still you don't know why

Whenever you dream you're holding the key
I opens the door to let you be free

And find the sacred heart, somewhere bleeding in the night
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart

A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack
And he's looking right at you, quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black, attack

And oh, sometimes you never fall, and ah, you're the lucky one
Oh, sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun

And find the sacred heart yeah, somewhere bleeding in the night
Find the sacred heart

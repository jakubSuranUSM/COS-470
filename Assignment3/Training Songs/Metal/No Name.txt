I'm writing a letter to say
That I'm leaving you leaving you
It's always been hard to maintain
No one believed when they needed to

Well sometimes somethings are better left alone
And when the seasons change
The sun may shine but the darkness will remain
And should my reasons sway

They'll bury me with no name
I've still got the picture you framed
There's only memories memories
I'm finding it hard to explain

I don't feel anything anything
Well sometimes somethings are better left alone
And when the seasons change
The sun may shine but the darkness will remain

And should my reasons sway
They'll bury me with no name
I was reminded of you today
So I've written this out to say

That sometimes somethings are better left alone
And when the seasons change
The sun may shine but the darkness will remain
And should my reasons sway
They'll bury me with no name

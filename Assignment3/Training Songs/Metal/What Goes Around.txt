You play with lies and suffocate everyone you know 
Memories can't touch you and you've sold away your soul 
So easy to live that way let your conscience slip away 
Such a rush to play that game 
Nothing else will feel the same
What goes round 
What goes round 
What goes round
Comes round
Don't look back there's nothing there 
But traces of old pain 
You killed everything that cared 
So you could live this way
Don't come running back this time 
When you think its all over
Just take someone elses hand 
Cry on someone elses shoulder
What goes round 
What goes round 
What goes round 
Comes round 
Yeah 
That's right 
Yeah 
That's right
What goes round 
What goes round 
What goes round 
Comes round 
What goes round 
What goes round 
What goes round 
Yeah 
That's right 
Yeah 
That's right

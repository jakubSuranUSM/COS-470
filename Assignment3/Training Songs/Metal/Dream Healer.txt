Who will creep inside your mind a night,
Who makes your wildest dream arise?
Who makes you see what you can't see,
While you're awake but in your dreams?

Out of a world we call the twilight zone he comes,
Out of a world where all your reason is a lie.

DREAM HEALER - he makes you see what you can't see
DREAM HEALER - reflecting your identity.

Shout at the morning when the red sunrise awakes,
The call of reality is all you hear.
Gaze at the stars, when the night comes down again
Then you begin to see through all of your fears.

Out of a world where you can see what is inside
Out of a world where all your reason is a lie.

I see red and I see blue,
I see green and I see yellow - yellow lights.
One day black another day white. He's one day quiet
Another day he calls my mama
He's comin' out - he's comin' out

Listen to dreams - they always tell you the truth.
Listen to dreams - it is your heart that's speakin' to you
Listen - listen to the dream healer.

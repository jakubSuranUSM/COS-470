Privileged, a chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision, the day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age
A shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass

It's only getting worse
Not worth a moment's regret
Each dawn another curse, every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake?

An ill wind blows this way
The edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengeance
Payment for you intent
Fear and death in the wings
In thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does
Witness the mass disgrace

Fear and death in the wings
In thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does
Witness the mass disgrace

God forbid you read the signs, watch for meanings between the lines
Gehenna has now arrived, no hindsight for the blind
Your trust has been misplaced, believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it's too late

You finally made it home
Draped in the flag that you fell for

And so it goes
It's ashes of the wake

It's only getting worse
It's only getting worse
It's only getting worse
It's only getting worse
It's only getting worse

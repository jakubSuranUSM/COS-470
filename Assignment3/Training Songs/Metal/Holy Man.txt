I could be wrong here
I could be right
I could be the Son of God
Selling you a little life

But you wouldn't see me
You wouldn't hear me
Why you and not me?
Tell me Holy Man 

Is that supposed to mean something?
Am I supposed to feel something?
Am I to believe that you hold the key?
My way wrong and yours right? 

I could be wrong here
You could be right
Please forgive me I have sinned 
Not on your life

But that's how you want me
But I'll never fear thee
Why you and not me?
Tell me Holy Man 

Is that supposed to mean something?
Am I supposed to feel something?
Am I to believe that you hold the key?
My way wrong and yours right? 

You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it 

You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it 

You want me to bow down, lie down, accept it and die
Say what, say what, say what, say what, say why
You want me to fear you, revere you, never question your lies
Say what, say what, say what, say what, say why

I'm in love with you
And it's crushing my heart
All i want is you
To take me into your arms

When love and death embrace
I love you
And you're crushing my heart
I need you
Please take me into your arms

When love and death embrace
When love and death embrace
When love and death embrace
When love and death embrace

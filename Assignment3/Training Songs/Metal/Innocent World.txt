They tell me things that I don't understand
So many things that twist my mind
I learned to follow, I learned to obey
I learned believing every word they say

I wake up crying at the dead of night
I feel as helpless as a lonely child

Free world of innocence, far beyond the skies
Where freedom and innocence await
Free world of innocence, no more tears and lies
Children so innocent

I see the craziness spreads everywhere
My mind is lame I feel a deep despair
No time for grace, no time for charity
I have to function like a cold machine

I wake up crying at the dead of night
I feel as helpless as a lonely child

Free world of innocence, far beyond the skies
Where freedom and innocence await
Free world of innocence, no more tears and lies
Children so innocent

I got my dreddlocks
A hole in my lip
And it might be strange, but I got my brains
My baggy pants and I?ve got strong legs
For jumping around in the mudd
You know I found myself
You know down on my knees
You see if you can recognize yourself

I feel alone what about you?
I feel alone what about you?

What I give you what I can give you
What I got is what I got is just everything I am
I?m just an Underdog

I felt battered ?
Without protection
And now I got a mic it?s my reaction

Have you been hated ? underrated?
So, keep your head up give me your attention

You know I saw the list
You know I was the last thing
You see if you can recognize yourself

I feel alone what about you?
I feel alone what about you?

(Chorus)

Nothing can stop my fight to get out of here
You can?t stop my fight to get out
Nothing can stop my fight to get out of here
You can?t stop my fight to get out

(Chorus)

I saw the list, I saw the list I was the last thing

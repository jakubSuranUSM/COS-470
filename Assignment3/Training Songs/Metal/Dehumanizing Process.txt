Explode

Clear the way, the new king has arrived
To take your place while I've got you on your knees
I always had this vision of who I'd become
A powerful giant who could rule with ease
And who would

Bring the truth
I will bring the truth
Your time is up- there's no chance left for you

Bring the truth
I will bring the truth
Your time is up as I end it for you

Was it me or were you just afraid
When you promised me nothing but a throne
When time comes you will hide the fact
That you will only be one way
A fake liar

Bring the truth
I will bring the truth
Your time is up- there's no chance left for you

Bring the truth
I will bring the truth
Your time is up as I end it for you

You can try to hide
It will all come back to you
You shatter dreams before they're fully dreamt
You're a pig and should die
I would feel no remorse
I honestly absolutely fucking hate you
Hate you

You can't change this
The only thing you have to remember is

Bury my dreams, I will bury you

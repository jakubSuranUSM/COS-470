Take a black grab 
I think of what you'll had 
Here's a wildcat 
Take a white mouse 
He's hiding in a house 
Here's a colored love 
Pay, pay, pay 
You can get it if you 
Say, say, say 
That you want to, but 
Hey, hey, hey 
Just remember it's the way 
Day- or nighttime 
You can really shine 
With your groupy clothes 
If the inside 
Is on the outside 
Everybody knows 
Pay, pay, pay 
You can get it if you 
Say, say, say 
That you want to, but 
Hey, hey, hey 
Just remember it's the way 
Take a black grab 
I think of what you'll had 
Here's a wildcat 
Take a white mouse 
He's hiding in a house 
Here's a colored love 
Pay, pay, pay 
You can get it if you 
Say, say, say 
That you want to, but 
Hey, hey, hey 
Just remember it's the way

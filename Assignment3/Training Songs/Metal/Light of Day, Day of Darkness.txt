A vision, a call
In times before my fall
In life before I became
I dreamt I was insane

I saw the unseen
I heard the unheard
I rode the sky above the earth
I felt the breeze of the world
I walked along
I should have retrieved
What was real as a merry blue sky
Was long gone within of me

Crimson tide
Wave of lost time
Scenario of a velvet blue sky
I dreamt about day
But I lived in the night
I looked and I saw
That in my dream I was free
Red turned blue
White became black
The daylight erased the shadow of me

Insanity reached
Whispering voice
The sky above the stars
The wind below the moon
The light created shadows
The dark beyond the eyes
I sat before myself
I looked above below

Doves and birds, grass and trees
Where was all I used to see?
Why am I not
What I used to be?
I embrace
My living self

I see the unseen
I hear the unheard
I learned the secret
But not before I learned

Night divide day, day erase night
Light of day, day of Darkness

They are inside my head
Climbing the walls
Falling off the ceiling
Jumping on the floor
Voices and calls
And on the edge of sanity
I stumble and fall

Through the gates of the endless halls

Come walk with me
Through the valley of eternity
In passion I see
Am I the one only the mirror sees?
Through the valley of eternity
Am I the one only the mirror sees?
A distant call for me
I am lost within my memory
Lost in the maze
The secret place that no one's ever seen
I am lost within my memory
The secret place that no one's ever seen
Silent cries of despair
Through the valley of eternity
What sanity remains
Within this frail and twisted mind

I am all alone
Me, myself, and I
Echoes pound my head
Shapeless forms everywhere

I think, therefore I am
You are a fantasy
Made by me
I dream this world
When I end, the world will end with me
I am everything
You are me
Sleep my child to never be

I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby
A sleep in which I had a dream
In this dream
I conceived a perfect plan
That would change the face of mankind

For it was my dream
To create a perfect world
From this cold imperfect world
And all the answers were inside my mind
And I was unafraid
The dream was so enticing

Light of day, day of Darkness

The soul of an angel
Will live forever
The love of the innocent
Will last forever
A moments passion
I hear a desperate cry

I weep for the weak
I pray for the strong
But now I see it fate
And I'm lying here alone

Through Crimson eye
And shattered lie,
Preform the sacrifice
Of the innocent life

There's blood on the bended knee
The light paint a shadow on me
Will I forsake you
Or will I the forsaken be?

I left my body
Come meet me in my dreams
It's been so long
Would you know me?

I see the unseen
I heard the unheard
I learned the secret
But not before I learned

Time stands still, but I wonder
Who is watching you
Who is watching me

Will I forsake you
Or will I forsaken me
I am so lost but still I am so free

As a traveller
I seek hospitality
As a wanderer
I seek immortality
As a journey through insanity
I seek divine comparity

Funeral Symphony
Behind me, a dark shaping mass
I turn and face, the face of deception
A face without the warmth
Of dignity and grace

In Twilight atmosphere
A silent seductive call

To my new world
A great new world
Where right is wrong
And justice is gone

I fell asleep, to sweet lullaby
A sleep in which I had a dream
In this dream
I conceived a perfect plan
That would change the face of mankind

For it was my dream
To create a perfect world
From this cold imperfect world
And all the answers were inside my mind
And I was unafraid
The dream was so enticing

In this dream I conceived the perfect plan

I sit here alone, so cold
Left in the dark, to feel
Pity my soul
What is left to say?
What is left to see?
Where did I fail?

Watch me and my new desire
I am emptier than ever
But I feel complete
I conceal myself
Until night falls
I am who I am
I just want to be

I hear a voice
Who could it be?
Is there anybody else here with me?
Why do you torture me?
Won't you leave me be?

Am I whom I should be?
For all that you are lies only within of me

Out of reach, out of sight
I feel strange and lost
can you lead me right?
It's too dark for me to see
Capture of soul
won't you please forgive me?

I heard the tales
Of the secret way
That tears are replacements
For what has been taken away
From us and those who were lost
Still, all I see is burning fields
Still, all I hear is dying screams

For all that you are
Lies only within me

I am the future
I am the past

I am what you wish for
The god you wish to be

I am the voice
Behind the silent scream

I am the dark
I am the light you'll never see

I am the blood
That makes your soul free

I am pure
I am unclean

It takes one to be a god
It takes one to feel lonely

It takes two to outlast me
It takes two to feel complete

It takes a moon to light the stars
It takes a light to see the dark

Insanity reached
Whispering voice
The sky above the stars
The wind below the moon
The light created shadows
The dark beyond the eyes
I sat before myself

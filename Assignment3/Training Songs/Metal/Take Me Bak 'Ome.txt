Came up to you one night
Noticed the look in your eye
Saw you was on your own
And it was alright
Yeh it was alright.
Said I could call you Sidney
I couldn't make out why
Standing here on your own
An' it was alright
Yeh it was alright.
So won't you take me back home
Take me back home
And we can find plenty to do
And that will be alright
Yeh it will be alright.
You and your bottle of brandy
Both of you smell the same
Still on your feet still standing
So it was alright
Yeh it was alright.
Superman comes to meet you
Looks twice the size of me
I didn't stay round to say goodnight
So it was alright
Yeh it was alright.

Frankie baby wears leather boots
She likes the stooges and punk rock groups
Born in something she just can't win
She strives for pureness but she's built for sin

She tried it once with Jesus and she once was a June bride
When I met her on the bar stool she just smiled

Frankie, Frankie, Frankie, got me down on my knees
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie, going aahh!

Frankie baby's misunderstood
All the time in the neighborhood
She's the beauty that they can't get, she's the freedom that they resent
A well respected husband but your kids don't know you well
Hiding with your whore at the motel...

Paul wears lipstick and a dress
Frankie lives like any man would do
You feel you've sinned so you confess
But it don't go

What you are is just what you are!
I can't love you!

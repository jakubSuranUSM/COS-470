Sliding spinning
Turn around
Feel my heart pound
Motor screaming
Sliding down
Got to turn it around
Danger nowhere
By myself
I burn the thrill
Claw my way out
Right now
Got to try to get out

[Chorus]
I'll start a war with it
I'll start a war with it
I'll start a war with this fucking emotion

I'll start my war
Against you
You're one of them
You call yourself
A victim
But you're at it again
I've felt stranger
Paradise
You made me kill
Now I'm far out
Right now
Got to try and get out

[Chorus]

I'll take it all 
Give me some more
I'll take it all

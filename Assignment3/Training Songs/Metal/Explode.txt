March in, take commands
Line up, take a stand
Make this war to act
Strike fast, start to hunt
Gear up, to the front
Let the fire start

Soldiers as you were
shadows as you were
We’ll soon march in affect
Ammo, bring it in
Weapons, make’em sing
We’ll now attack to protect

Explore
Flip the switch
Reload
Trigger it
We will scorch the earth
Explore
Let it sound
Reload
Another round
It will be our rebirth
Eurotopia

Patrol, punish man
Strike hard, burn the land
It’s a ravished scene
Now aim head and heart
Untamed, tear apart
Hear the perfect screams

Soldiers as you were
shadows as you were
We’ll soon march in affect
Ammo, bring it in
Weapons, make’em sing
We’ll now attack to protect

Eurotopia

When the world here turns
And the flags there burn
Then I stand by my grounds
And all the roads that we try
We set aflame to the sky
And I stand by my grounds
When the white eyes dream
And the ruins gleam
Turn your little faiths at the iron stakes

You will evolve
When the masses dissolve

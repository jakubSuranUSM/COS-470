Bask under bloodfall
Head in the wound
A doorway through the skin
A taste of the tomb
Join the malady
Imploding veins
Burrowing deep within
Tormenting what was
Your weakened brain 
I want your open wound 

Wavering senses 
Blue skin in flaps
Ravenous breakdowns
Barbed wire straps
Hungering coffin
Red eyes peek
Ravage the once whole
Bleed dry the weak 
I want your open wound 
I want your open wound

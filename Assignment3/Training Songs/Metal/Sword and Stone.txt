We're in a world where just the strong survive
Day after day you're heart's in danger
You've gotta fight to keep your love alive
You are the game, you are the changes
And I get stronger when I look in your eyes
I can take on the world
I can cut through the lies

I feel the power runnin' through my bones 
I am the sword, you are the stone 
I swear forever we can stand alone 
I am the sword, you are the stone 
I am the sword, you are the stone 

Two heart's together make a force that's one 
No one can stop love's fire burnin'
Our passions racin' with the risin' sun
The dye is cast the wheels are turnin' 
Some people say that we'll get nowhere at all 
Let 'em tear down the world 
But we ain't gonna fall 

I feel the power runnin' through my bones 
I am the sword, you are the stone 
I swear forever we can stand alone 
I am the sword, you are the stone 
I am the sword, you are the stone 

Hey!

And I get stronger when I look in your eyes 
I can take on the world 
I can cut through the lies
We're in a world where just the strong survive 

I feel the power runnin' through my bones 
I am the sword, you are the stone 
I swear forever we can stand alone 
I am the sword, you are the stone 

I feel the power runnin' through my bones 
I am the sword, you are the stone
I swear forever we can stand alone 
I am the sword, you are the stone

I feel the power runnin' through my bones 
I am the sword, you are the stone
I swear forever we can stand alone

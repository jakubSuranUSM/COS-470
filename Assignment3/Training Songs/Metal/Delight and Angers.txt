Everyday takes figuring out how to live,
Sometimes it feels like a mistake,
Sometimes its a winners parade,
Delight and angers,
I guess thats the way its supposed to be...

[Chorus]
Please heal me, I cant sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything
Make me fell unbreakable, now you set me free

I feel the fear takes hold
Afraid this hell I create is my own
Come my fatigueness, I cant take it anymore
This used to be my own world, but now I've lost control

[Chorus]

Chasing leftovers,
Under the fading sun,
Searching for shelter,
I feel my time has come

[Chorus]

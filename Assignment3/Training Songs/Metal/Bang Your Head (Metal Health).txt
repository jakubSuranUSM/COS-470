Yeah ah arr!

And I'm an axe grinder, pile driver
Mama says that I never, never mind her
Got no brains, I'm insane
The teacher says that I'm one big pain

I'm like a laser, six string razor
I've got a mouth like an alligator
I want it louder, more power
I'm gonna rock it 'til it strikes the hour

Bang your head!
Metal health will drive you mad!
Bang your head!
Metal health will drive you mad! 
Alright

I'm frustrated and out-dated
I really wanna be over-rated
I'm a finder and I'm a keeper
I'm not a loser, and I ain't no weeper
I got the boys to make the noise
Won't ever let up, hope it annoys you
Join the pack fee the crack
Well now you're here, there's no way back!

Bang your head!
Metal health will drive you mad!
Bang your head!
Metal health will drive you mad!
Alright

Bang your head
Wake the dead
We're all metal mad
It's all you have

So bang your head!
And raise the dead, oh yeah!
Metal health! 
It drives you mad, mad, mad, mad!

Bang your head!
Metal health will drive you mad!

Ah get your straight jackets on tonight! Oh! (bang your head, metal health will drive you mad!)
The bad boys are gonna set you right! (bang your head!)
Oh rock ya, rock ya, rock ya (metal health will drive you mad!)
(Bang your head!)

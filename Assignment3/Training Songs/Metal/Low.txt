Fuel the fire for war
It's man against mankind
Bruises that they bear
Been beaten down with time

Innocent people suffer the loss
Your broken hope so close to the cross
Sometimes, you just don't know
How low, how low you can go
So low it's sickening
Low, low, show some mercy

Hey you piece of shit
Just leave the kids alone
Why can't you bear
The things that we endure

Innocent people suffer the loss
Lost hope with faith to the cross
Sometimes, you just don't know
How low, how low you can go, 
Show some sympathy
Low, low, show some mercy, 

I don't like you for your warped demented ways
I hope the lock you down, so you never get away
Low, low, show some sympathy
Low, low, show some mercy,

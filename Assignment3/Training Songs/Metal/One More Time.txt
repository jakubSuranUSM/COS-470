One more time 
One more time 

Saints, from heaven 
Hell hang-arounds, descending 
Disciples of repression 
Fuse, our evil 
Exterminate, protectors 
Bringing us down to the ground 
And pushing us back to the  

Final frontier, wedlock in the grime 
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time. 

One more time 
One more time 
One more time 
One more time 

Pray, steel demons 
Don't look away, tormentors 
Travers the darkned heavens 
Seek, our wicked 
Seek and destroy, opponents 
Soldiers of heaven and hell 

Hey, we're fighting 
Eye for an eye, protecting 
Our mother earth, dissecting 
Break, their evil 
Ruin the core, allegiance 
Vengeance is now in our hands 
Vengeance 
Pushing us back to the  

Final frontier, buried in the grime 
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time. 

One more time 
One more time 
One more time 
One more time 

Final frontier, the judgement bell will chine 
No wasted years, stand up one more time 

One more time 
One more time 
One more time 
One more time

[Chorus]
For your love I'd give anything 
For your time stars above 
And if I ever get you 
I`ll never let you go 

Oh no
Don't deny, you have seen me before 
Realize, look me in the eye 
Just a while 
I got love I won cute hide it
Now when I finally found it 

Hey you, hey you, where did she come from 
To supermarket parking yard 
Hey you, hey you, what's going on 
While I turn my head away 
She had gone the other way away
 
Oh yeahh, oh there she walks again 
I have to be her boyfriend 
Hey you, it`s true, baby there I stood 
When I looked her in the eye 
She gave me her sweet sweet smile 

[Chorus]

Don`t deny, you have seen me before 
Realize, look me in the eye 
Just a while 
I got love `n I wonÂ´t hide it 
Now when I finally found it 

I`ve seen you many times before 
For each time you mean more 
I`d like to be always yours 
So it`s up to you 
Please take me home with you 

[Chorus]

You, you`re the sweetest thing 
For you I`d give anything 
If you`re a dream 
Then let me sleep forever 

Until I get you
I`ll be dreaming of you every night 
And all of my time

I get drunk and I stumble to the phone
And conjure up a bitch to bone
When I'm alone
Fucked up, tore back
I need to take a piss
Only when I'm drunk? I sing a song like this
My grandma and your grandma
Sittin' by the fire
Hold on, turn that beat off
No, keep it going
Crazy Town, yo y'all just not known'
I get drunk and start talking more shit
And when I got a gun in my hand
You better get out
'Cause my brain
Just ain't what it used to be
Forget trying to rationalize,
Cover your eyes
I get, (Uh!), damn I'm drunk.
I need a chuck, no better yet
A hunk of that f*ck
I get, (Uh!) damn I'm drunk.
I need a chuck, no better yet
A hunk of that f*ck
Yeah I'm good bad, dope
I'm freak fresh
I'm make hip-hop fans say "yes" "yes"
Crazy's comin' through
You know we're gonna blow up
Na' false alarm
I'm getting all ladies with my cool charm
When I get drunk
I might even call my daddy a punk
Yeah , but only when I'm drunk

[Chorus]
Yeah, only when I'm drunk
Only when I'm drunk
It happens only when I'm drunk

It goes, one for the chronic
Two for the amnesia
I'm that crazy white boy
With the drinks in the freezer
Bust a one out, two out
Bitz type rapper
That will get you out of your seat
Quicker than a car jacker
Sippin' colt forty fever
When I'm coolin' with my people
Got he's in east Columbus
When I'm Billy D. Rico
"Cause I move like I'm smooth like
Like I'm Harry Belafonte
Lookin' for them suckers
That jumped my homey
Le Le
All up in thisbitch
With the grin and Tanqueray
Drink like Mr.Wendal
Smoke bud like Dr Dre
But that's cause I'm old enough
To do that of shit
God damn I gotta piss
I pass the mic to Mr. Shift
I get drunk and can't nobody
Whoop me
I'm trippin'
I must be that brew that I sippin'
Kickin' in
Guess I shouldn't Have mixed it with the gin
'Cause when I'm laying on my back
I can feel the room spin
One too many, I reckon
Felon' I got to hurl any second
Want to get up but can't move
Feels like I'm stuck in a groove
What the f*ck was I trying to prove
I got a knack for dawin' four-o's
All the hos know them Doobie Bros.
People call me shift
I keep a fifth in my trunk
I might f*ck an ugly bitch
But only when I'm drunk

[Chorus]

Yeah, one two, one two
Only when I'm drunk

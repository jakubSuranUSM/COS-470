I bleed this blasphemy
The sin that courses through my veins
It burns beneath
Beneath the scars of my decay

This suffering
These fingers claw against my flesh
I pray for this
This touch that takes away my breath

I pray for..

This is my final breath
The choking end of misery
My walls collapse
I pray for death
This is my final breath
Peel back the flesh to watch it bleed
The Darkest Red
I pray for death

We share this suffering
One open wound a whispered cry
It breathes in me, draining the life from the inside
In ecstasy, exposing my flesh to darkest red
I can't resist this touch that takes away my breath

I pray for..

This is my final breath
The choking end of misery
My walls collapse
I pray for death
This is my final prayer
Peel back the flesh to watch it bleed
THE DARKEST RED
And pray for death

Feel me.. breathe me.. bleed me
I beg you

This is my final breath
The choking end of misery
My walls collapse
I pray for death
This is my final breath
Peel back the flesh to watch it bleed
The Darkest Red
I pray for death

When I close my eyes I see tomorrow
When I open my arms I touch the sun
I have come a million, billion light years through the sky
And now my fairytale has begun

I am the Time Creating Man
In my Time Travelling Caravan
Synthetic miracle in hand
I am the Time Creating Man

On Planet Ten, there is a land of wonder
On Planet Ten, is where I cast my spell
And if there's still a million, billion light years in the sky
We will see but only time will tell

I am the Time Creating Man
In my Time Travelling Caravan
Synthetic miracle in hand
I am the Time Creating Man

Oh yeah

So you know I've seen the future
And you know I've seen the past
And the human race is changing
Now we're living life too fast

Now this world's so full of hatred
And this world's so full of pain
But the clock keeps ticking on now
As the whole world goes insane

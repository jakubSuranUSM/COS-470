Two thousand fattened years like maniacs
Have despoiled our common grave
Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs
From the cradle to enslave?
 
Sickle constellations 
Stud the velts that welt the sku
Whilst the Bitter winter moon
Prowls the clouds, dead,eyed
Like shifting parent flesh
Under silk matricide
 
Watchful as she was upon Eden
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon to be kept
 
Hear that hissing now on the breeze
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
A fres horror blows
But ten billion souls
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
 
This is the theme to a better Armageddon
Nightchords rake the heavens
Pandaemonaeon
 
And what use are prayers to that god?
As devils bay concenus for the space to piss
On your smouldering faith
And the the mouldering face
Of this world long a paradise lost
 
This is the end of everything
Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring
 
Dance macabre Â´neath the tilt of the zodiac
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
What sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black?
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back
 
I see the serpentine in your eyes
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive
 
Our screams shall trail to Angels
For those damned in flames repay
All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day
We should have cut our losses as at Calvary
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
Salvation, like a promised nation
Gleamed a claim away
 
This is the end of everything you have ever known
Buried like vanquished reason
Death in season
Driven like the drifting snow
 
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
On our knees or another fucker's shore
Heiling new flesh
Read, then roared
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause
What else be whipped to frenzy for?
 
This is the end of everything
Rear the tragedies
That the Seraphim shall sing
 
Old adversaries
Next of Eve
Now theyÂ´re clawing back
I smell their cumming
As through webbed panes of meat
Led by hoary Death
They never left
Dreaming sodomies
To impress on human failure
When weÂ´ve bled upon our knees
 
Tablatures of gravel law
Shall see Gehennag paved
When empires fall
And nightmares crawl
From the cradle to enslave
 
This is the end of everything

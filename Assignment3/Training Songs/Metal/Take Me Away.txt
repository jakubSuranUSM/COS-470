I've been thinking, trying to find
The way back home, some peace of mind
My world is shrinking I'm losing all touch
I just can't find the things I miss so much

Take me, take me away
I've been losing my mind these days
I see so unclear
I've really gone astray

I ran away from you, I thought I knew
How to leave the problems behind and make it through
Though I've been drifting I keep winding back here
Confused by the world I'm longing for you

I have often told you stories about the way
I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
And may be you would say
"Come lay with me and love me"
And I would surely stay

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune.

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you
Those days I thought my eyes
Could see you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here.

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

I can hear the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune.
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune.

I'm tired of holding up the weight, the weight of the mother fucking world,
All I want to do is just get right here right now
We struggle and fight just to get in a grave, that's overflowing,
Clock's ticking on my fifteen minutes of fame, come on now

Go

Yeah, yeah go
You better believe it, confidence

Yeah, yeah go
Spit out all reason,
Yeah

So fucking determined

So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go
Spit out all reason

I'm flushing the trust of everyone,
Stabbing in the back and thinkin' they can break me,
Set my sight can't die till I'm done,
Mind endurance
Never wanted anymore than what I deserve,
Better bring it I'm taking it all,
F*ck an inch 'cause I'm bringin' a mile,

It's on now 123 go

So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go
You better believe it, confidence
Go
So fucking determined
Yeah, yeah go
Spit out all reason,
Yeah

This fire, is growing, is burning deep inside of me,
Focused, driven, certain, the way it's
Got to be.

Fire. growing. burning. deep inside of me, focused,
Driven, certain, the way it's got to be.
Crooked, no trust, liar, conman, drunk with, power,
Mentor, taught me everything that I know

So wrong,
Wrong,
Wrong,
Wrong

You better believe it, confidence

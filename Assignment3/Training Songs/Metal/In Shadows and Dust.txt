In shadows & dust... in shadows & dust...

As I walk through the valley of shadows & dust
No hope in the eyes of the lost
Your hero nailed to the cross
We're animals in search for blood
Never satisfied, never gratified
Until the day we die
I step into your life and take control

Time stops the sky turns dark
Never again shall you feel godlike
We're nothing divine
Never again shall you feel godlike
Emotions are swift like the winds
Never again shall you feel godlike

In shadows & dust... in shadows & dust...

Reflections of yourself
Illusions made by your mind
Realise we are nothing... but shadows & dust

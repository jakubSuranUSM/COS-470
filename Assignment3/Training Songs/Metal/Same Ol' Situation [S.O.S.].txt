Come on girls, ha ha ha I got something to say
She's got an alligator bag 
Top hat to match 
Dressed in black on black 
She's got a Philipino girlie 
She claims is her friend 
I tell you boys you just gotta laugh 
Now I used to call her Cindy 
She changed her name to sin
I guess that's the name of her game 
I really used to love her 
Then the kitty she discovered 
It's got to be a sexual thing 

Now all around the world 
Girls will be girls 

It's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 

I say no, no, no 
No, no, no 

Come on
Now check this out
Introduced me to her lover 
In a cellophane dress 
Then they bid me a sweet farewell 
Last time I saw them 
They were kissing so softly 
To the sound of wedding bells 

Well, all around the world 
Girls will be girls 

It's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 
It's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 
I said no, no, no 
No, no, no, alright

It's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 
Girl it's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 

You know we just gotta say 

All around the world
Girls will be girls

It's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain 
I'll tell ya girl it's the same ol', same ol' situation 
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain
Yeah, uh uh, yeah yeah no, no

In the depths of the river
Deep in the waves
Three rhinemaidens are singing
Songs of the brave

An ugly dwarf
Greedy with pleasure
Desires the gold,
Tries to steal the treasure

Guardians of the holy treasure
No cheat should steal it from the river
Gleaming glow in the water's depth
Shines brightly, bravely through the waves

Rheingold, Rheingold
Rheingold, Rheingold

Who denies love
Who forfeits its power
Can attain the magic
To forge a ring

If you are enarmoured
And longing for love
Let's see my handsome
What you look like

Guardians of the holy treasure
No cheat should steal it from the river
Gleaming glow in the water's depth
Shines brightly, bravely through the waves

Rheingold, Rheingold
Rheingold, Rheingold

Aren't you afraid
Brood of the waters
Then conquer the dark,
And I'll put out your light

I wrench the gold from the rock
Forge the ring of revenge
For hell and the devil
I curse my love

Guardians of the holy treasure
No cheat should steal it from the river
Who from the Rheingold will fashion the ring
Win the world's wealth and will be king

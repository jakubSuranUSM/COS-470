Up and down the boulevard, 
I go walking in the night, 
Memories of times gone by, 
Ain't no way to put it right, 
You tell me that you're lonely girl, 
You say I was wrong, 
Baby that was yesterday, 
Now yesterday's gone. 

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain 
Remember the years darling, remember my name 
And love is a game honey, that none of us won 
I just walk away now, the show must go on. 

Yesterday's gone, the show must gone 
I guess I was wrong. 

The good times that we shared together, 
Making love by candlelight, 
Then we went through stormy weather, 
And I guess we lost the fight, 
So write another lover's song, 
And drink some more wine, 
Cause when the rain starts falling down, 
The sun always shines. 

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain 
Remember the years darling, remember my name 
And love is a game honey, that none of us won 
I just walk away now, the show must go on. 

Yesterday's gone, the show must gone 
I guess I was wrong. 

Up and down the boulevard, 
I go walking in the night, 
Say goodbye to yesterday, 
And leave it behind, 
So once more we feel in darkly, 
Kiss me again, 
Darkly again my baby, 
Cause this is the end. 

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain 
Remember the years darling, remember my name 
And love is a game honey, that none of us won 
I just walk away now, the show must go on. 

Yesterday's gone, say goodbye to yesterday, 
So once more we feel it darkly, kiss me again.

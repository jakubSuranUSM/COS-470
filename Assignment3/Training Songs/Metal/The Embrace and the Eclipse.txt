Fall, and come back to
Your only adorned wish
My final soul, for your sun
Sometimes we
Bask in the
Mortality, drown in it
But this could mean the earth to me

And if everything seems like spring
It's often just a dream of
Breathing liquid of all, and just
A piece
Enchantment is everything, you thought
But only the time of eternity is
Able to heal the bottomless wound

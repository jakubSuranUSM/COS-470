I can't get, get any closer, 
You're so distant, 
So far away, am I losing you
This fix of love will cool you down for awhile, 
I know how bad it was before
You told me we could make it somehow, 
If we really try
But where's the love, 
Where's all the money we saved

Love's floating to the beat, on the 42nd Street, 
And money killed the love, we tried so hard to keep
Remember how love was wild, 
Remember how love was real, 
Love's hot, love's an injection
Now that we're out of control,
Give me a try, one more try, 
Am I too young for you
The city streets look so cold, 
So don't throw me out, 
I know things will turn out good

And they'll be just like they were before, 
If we really try, really try
Don't throw me out, 
Don't throw me out, 
Don't throw me out, no
Remember how love was wild, 
Remember how love was real,
Love's hot, love's an injection

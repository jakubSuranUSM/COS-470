The worst is yet to come, so vulnerable and dumb say the words and I'll dissolve
Tell me how long should this last I've been forgetting how to act and
These memories will burn like gasoline
And I believe there's something more cause this isn't what I've been looking for
If I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it
This makes no sense a mirage of an oasis but it kills my time
Well try to remember what I sought, I never gave it that much thought
Does it really matter at all, cause there really is no time for opening up my eyes
Cause you know that I have seen it all before
And I believe there's something more cause this isn't what I've been looking for
If I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it
This makes no sense a mirage of an oasis but it kills my time
Well I wish I could always feel this good, I wish that I could always feel this way,
Wish I could always feel this good, wish that I could always know what's out there
Cause I believe there's something more, cause this isn't what I've been looking for
If I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it this
This makes no sense a mirage of an oasis but it kills my time
I wish I could always feel this good, I wish that I could always feel this way,
I wish I could always feel this good, wish that I could be imitating the screen imitating the screen if you hate something it goes away if you hate something then just wait

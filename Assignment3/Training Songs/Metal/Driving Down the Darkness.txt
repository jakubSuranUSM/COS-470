Beat down through worlds This time it's crossed the line Beware of what's behind Wolfs coming quick to kill you Currents running strong Think your right, wrong Look, it's long gone Look, it's long gone
Stick it to yourself, hold your own Stay strong in the sight of insanity
Driving down the darkness Stricken by the madness Praying for forgiveness While you play god (with my life)
Me against them, no stopping Time for action not talking If it rears it's ugly head I'll cut it clean off Change this, change that Change this, change that
My ears are burning from all the talking Time for fuckers to start walking Stick to yourself hold your own Stay strong in the sight of insanity
Driving down the darkness Stricken by the madness Praying for forgiveness While you play god (with my life)
I'll pray for you, your prayers come true That I don't come for you
Driving down the darkness Stricken by the madness Praying for forgiveness While you play god (with my life)

I got all my machines.
Anything that I need.
Gimme peace, gimme war.
Save our world, save our souls.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Here, down we go.
Down we go.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Just like our fathers.
I got shoes, you got nothing.
Let me roam,
Let me sing the morning.
I got peace, you know that.
I got war, you know that.
I got everything.
I got soul.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Here, down we go.
Down we go.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Just like our fathers.
I got peace on my pillow.
I can go anywhere.
All through time, through
Dimension.
Save our world.
Save our souls.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, down we go.
Down we go, down we go.
Down we go.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Here, down we go.
Down we go.
Here, down we go.
Down we go, again.
Just like our fathers.

The first chord from the vein of the ore
There it all begins
The blacksmiths forge will resolve
The metal's nature
The riddle of steel, hiding the key
Are you able to find it?
Unlock the chain, the prize you gain...
Soul of the sword has spoken

Wave it in the air, let it breath
This perfect blance, the harmony
Shivers on the edge of the steel
Tranquillising melody

Respect the way how it stands and feels
Will it give you a chance?
It's not for everyone to see
How it sings on a battlefield
Faithful mate of the whitest knight
The loot of the lowest thief
Path of justice, hope for the weak
Path of blood for your enemy

Two sides of the sword
You may think it's nothing but agony
When you feel the hate
It is the hand that carries the blade

Cold steel the warrior's chum
It will never deceive you
Take a good care of it
And you will be rewarded
Use it wisely don't be a fool
IT could be a burden
But when it's time for you to meet the steel
Let it dance for you

Feel the might
Inside of you
Raise your blade
It's time to fight

I heard the sword's song 
And it sang to me 
Both the iron, the will
Under my control

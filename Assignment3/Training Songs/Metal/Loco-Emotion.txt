Ain't there something I can take
Something I can do
Ain't ya got some kind of love potion
Ain't there somewhere to go
Somewhere to stop
Can you stop this loco-emotion
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it's a loco-emotion
Go go go I got no place to go
I can't stop this loco-emotion
Go go go L-O-see-O uh oh it's a loco-emotion
You can't dance with a juke box and glass of wine
Try holding hands with the hands of time
You can't erase the love that you gave to me
You can't put your arms around a memory
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it's a loco-emotion
Go go go I got no place to go
I can't stop this loco-emotion
Go go go L-O-see-O uh oh it's a loco-emotion
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh it's a loco-emotion
Go go go I got no place to go
I can't stop this loco-emotion
Go go go L-O-see-O uh oh it's a loco-emotion
Loco-emotion
Loco-emotion

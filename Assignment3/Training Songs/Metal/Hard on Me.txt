Six foot legs with the moves of a shark
Leave the room she forgets you
Lips like fire even glow in the dark
A blood red rosy tattoo

This bad girls been on my mind
But I won't waste my Valentine
I know her story all too well
Too little heaven for so much hell

And when I see you coming
I gotta get to running
You know you're really much too hard on me
And though I'll always need you
I know I'll never please you
You know you're really much too hard on me
You know you're really much too hard on me

Skin tight leather on satin sheets
Now she's got me surrounded
I can't swim when the water's too deep
She makes me feel like I'm drowning

Here she comes movin' in for the kill
A smooth black widow on my windowsill
And if I ever live to tell
She's one third heaven and two thirds hell

And when I see you coming
I gotta get to running
You know you're really much too hard on me
And though I'll always need you
I know I'll never please you
You know you're really much too hard on me
You know you're really much too hard on me

I know her story all too well
Too little heaven for so much hell

And when I see you coming
I gotta get to running
You know you're really much too hard on me
And though I'll always need you
I know I'll never please you
You know you're really much too hard on me
You know you're really much too hard on me

And when I see you coming
I gotta get to running
You know you're really much too hard on me
And though I'll always need you
I know I'll never please you
You know you're really much too hard on me
You know you're really much too hard on

Get a grip on yourself
Get in shape for tonight

Take a look at yourself or your dreams
You're losing sight
It just ain't right, it just ain't right

Hey man look at me I'm screaming
Are you watching me bleed, are you believin'

You got to stick to you guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone

Too much too soon, too much for you
Every day has a hero, don't it though
Don't let it go
You gotta fight, it just ain't right

Hey man, look at me I'm screaming
Are you watching the green are you believin'

You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
It ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone

Hey man, look at me I'm screaming
Are you watching the green are you believin'
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
It ain't right for everyone
You got to stick to your guns
What's right for you ain't right for everyone
Ain't right for everyone...
Come along

[1] Be helpful to the shyman,
But be wary of the slyman oh baby,
Be guidance to the blindman,
And be thankful to the kind man oh baby,
Be scintillating, aggravating, penetrating, over rating,
Baby don't you know,
Be hostess with the mostest to
Whoever comes the closest,
Oh baby don't you know.
Be faithful to the true man,
Sympathetic to the blue man oh baby,
Be dwarf against the tall man oh baby,
Be a giant against the small man oh baby.
Be scrutinizing, tantalizing, appertizing,
Full moon-rising,
Baby don't you know,
Be mistress with a history of mystery and twistery,
Oh baby don't you know.
Chorus Stand up, stand up, stand up and be yourself,
Stand up, stand up, don't be nobody else,
'cause me well you see, I don't need nobody else.[2] Be beauty for the plain man,
But be sane for the insane man,
Oh baby don't you know,
Be dirty for the clean man,
But be shirty for the obscene man
Oh baby don't you know
Be understanding, undemanding,
Hand in hand happy landing,
Baby don't you know,
Be harem, scarem, grin and bare em,
Wash and wear em, do or dare em,
Oh baby don't you know.Chorus are E P E A T[3] Be beauty for the plain man,

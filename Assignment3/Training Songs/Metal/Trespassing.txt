Well I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Sayin' "who are you and where are you from?"
We don’t like when visitors come.
'No trespassing' that’s what it said
At least that’s what I could read.
No trespassing? yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!
One day I was trippin' and that’s when I could see
That the ether I had tapped into could be reality
It was great, that’s when I climbed that optimistic vine
Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind

I don’t need no sympathy. I won’t cry and whine.
Life’s my light and liberty
And I’ll shine when I wanna shine.

Make their faces crack
There’s no turning back.
Let’s go!

Well I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Sayin' "who are you and where are you from? "
We don’t like when visitors come.
'No trespassing' that’s what it said
At least that’s what I could read.
No trespassing? yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

I ain’t got B-S in my bag
That’s the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is lax
Come on baby, can’t you see?

Well I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Sayin' "who are you and where are you from?"
We don’t like when visitors come.
'No trespassing' that’s what it said
At least that’s what I could read.
No trespassing? yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

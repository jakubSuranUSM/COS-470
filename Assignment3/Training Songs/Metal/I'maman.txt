I maman
So I'm an elegant man
I'm a man
Clara bowes and open toes
Are what I am

Yes I maman
Yea I'm a fragile man
I'm a man
Light of step and soft of touch
A gentle man

You know I could love you
But if I should love you
Then I would love you
The way a man loves a woman
And live my life like been livin' it
My body claims my mind and soul so let me be
What I am
An elegant man

Yes I maman
So I'm a graceful man
I'm a man
Pierrots and spaceous clothes
Are what I am

You know I could love you
But if I should love you
Then I would love you
The way a man loves a woman
And live my life like been livin' it
My body claims my mind and soul so let me be
What I am
An elegant man

Yes I maman and I could love you

Well, I've had my share
Of remarks about my rear
But I know it's all 'bout fear
And that you'd probably love it
If you'd only dare
And I know q thousand girls
Who'd go wild
If I'd ask them to bear my child
So I don't see why you'd even care
To prevent me
'Cause I can swear,

That one day I will become
The father of a son
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah!
One day I will become
The father of a son
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah!

And you're totally fogged in you head
If you were serious right now
When you said
That "it's because
They will be bullied in school"
'Cause that means you let the bullies
Set the rules

And you can legislate and oppress
And you can make my life a mess
But you can't change the way I feel
Or convince me that my wish is unreal

And you can strike me down
And fence me
And you can claim
That there's opinion against me
But I'll still win over you, sir
'Cause if you fight love,
You're always a looser...

So, one day I will become
The father of a son
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah!

And I may be gay
But I can tell you straight away
That I'll become a better father than
All of you anyway...(so listen!)
One day I will become
The father of a son
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah!

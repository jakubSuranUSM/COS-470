Penetrate
Penetrate me
I'm so fine, so fine, so fine
I get excited
I get excited
I'm alone, I'm so fine, pull a line

Every night outta town
Every night outta town
I go now, go now, I pulsate
I'll be all fine, man
I'll be all fine and leave with you
I'll take away, I'll take away, be alright

Penetration

Oh, come and take me
Oh, come and take me
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'll stick it out, babe
I'll stick it out
I'll be all fine, every time, penetrate

Penetration
Penetration
Penetration
Penetration

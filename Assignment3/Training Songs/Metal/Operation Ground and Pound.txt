Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one
Look towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Soul is searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas,
Torture in the winter skies,
Riding over plains of ice,
Shadows in the fields of the slain!

Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the glass destroy the army
Crush the legions of the twilight
Give us our steel on the way

Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the war as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes
We'll never see our world

Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight, woah, woah?

Watch you die, I watch you die inside
While fate controls your life
And reject this animosity
That's piercing every mind
You feel the power, do believe
The fear you hold inside
Choose to find a reason for the treason
Now you will be mine

Screams of pain are not the same
And rise again from hell, defending
Power of hearts within the fire
Warriors of hell fear the slain

Rise through the pain
And the sun will rise again,
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Riding on the wings of hell
The innocence of our souls

Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight, woah, woah?

Far away and ever onwards see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
With tonight, woah, woah?

Yeah!

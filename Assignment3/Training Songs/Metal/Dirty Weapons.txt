Strange games
Politicians
No match
It's obsession
Twelve minutes
Made your mark
One sided
Shooting star

It's getting really hard
To keep believing you
Don't want to lose

Dirty weapons
You're never fighting fair
Dirty weapons 
Turns deadly into dare

Locked on
Full trigger
Shot down
Interceptor
High price
Competition
No winner
Fatal decision

It's getting really hard
To keep believing you
Don't want to lose

Dirty weapons
You're never fighting fair

Dirty weapons 
Turns deadly into dare

What's it really going to take
To make you change your ways?
We don't have time to waste
When we're standing face to face

In times of turmoil
In times like these
Beliefs contagious
Spreading disease
This wretched mischief is now coursing through your souls
Never to let go
Never to let go

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats)

Into your sanctum
You let them in
Now all your loved ones
And all your kin
Will suffer punishments beneath the wrath of God
Never to forgive
Never to forgive

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah

This devastation left your cities to be burnt
Never to return
Never to return!

Them filthy rodents are still coming for your souls
Never to let go
Never to let go!

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah
Rats! (rats–rats–rats)
Aaah whoah

They're still coming after you 
(Aaah whoah)
And there's nothing you can do
(Aaah whoah)
They're still coming after you
(Aaah whoah)
And there's nothing you can do
(Aaah whoah)
Rats!

Infinite
The ultimate expression of who I am
Incredulous
The barren definition of a dying man
Presumptuous
To assume that a tomb is not the body you’re walking in
In all of us
Is a sin that begins and doesn’t end until we siphon the last breath.

I am alive inside of your truth
I am your proof

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me
We are only one in the same
In pleasure and pain

Permissive
The fatal flaw of a forgiving God
Dismissive
Reactionary to all the laws above
Reverse it
Into the wake of mistakes and see the cosmos exploding
Deserve it
In the land of the sages we render the verdict

I am alive inside of your truth
I am your proof

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me
We are only one in the same
In pleasure and

Pain
My weakest pleasure
Deranged
And a sense of abandon
Tame
In the wake of a tyrant
Survive in the aftermath
Nothing comes after that
Moment of fiction and friction is
Truth

I am aware that I’m vicious

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me
I am just a piece of perfection in you
I see your eyes and you see it too
We are only one in the same

Pleasure and pain

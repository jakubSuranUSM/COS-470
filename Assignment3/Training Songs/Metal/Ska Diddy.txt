Baby don't move too quick just move your hands and feet
Because you know we got to get moving on
Baby don't do just weak 'cause we can't be beaten
You know you gotta keep on feeling strong

So won't you do with me funky lady
Don't leave me on a boat again
So won't you do with me funky lady
You know we wanna ska again

Don't need no reason for my moving jaws
Don't need no reason why we overload

Shoot me down, turn me around
Put me out in the streets
Pick me up, take me home
I'll play between your sheets
Want you to hold me
Want you to squeeze me
But baby not too tight
Bet you believe me
Don't ever leave me
At least not tonight
No not tonight there's 

No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
There's no easy way 

You got me cornered and you're closin' in
I got nowhere to turn
I kind of knew that I'd
End up right here
When will I ever learn?
I want to take you
I want to make you do
Things you've never done before
And when you're done
Havin' my fun
You're gonna beg for more 

No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
There's no easy way 

Shoot me down, turn me around
Put me out in the streets
Pick me up, take me home
I'll play between your sheets
I want to take you
I want to make you do
Things you've never done before
And when you're done
Havin' my fun
You're gonna beg for more 

No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
There's no easy way

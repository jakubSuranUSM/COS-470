I know you were lonely, Till you found yourself with us
Now we're the only company you need to find comfort in the night
Bank robbery is your life, We gave you a knife
We gave you a Smith and Wesson, we Gave you ourselves to trust on
Women get out of our way, 'Cause if you stay you gotta pray for your lives
We came today to check out the situation 
But we'll be back soon in full attack 

Tonight we'll drink till dawn, As we sing our outlaw songs 
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, could never break this cowboy heart of mine
We'll kill all the men and rape all the women, Sometimes we'll even shoot down the children, 
Outlaws don't feel no pity and outlaws is what we are
We both come floating down the street, We shoot down anyone we see
Outlaws don't feel no pity, Because of what we are
We sing desperado's

Ten thousand heartaches, baby, Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby, could never break this cowboy heart of mine
We are the desperado's, 
We brought the death to El Dorado 
We are the desperado's, We're like tornadoes

This town won't ever rise up again, 
And you'll never see us again
And the woman who tried to break my heart, 
Now her head and body are apart
The tales we tell for generations to come about the fires,
And somewhere in the night

You can still hear the melody, 
But its the memory that's scaring you
Ten thousand heartaches, baby
Ten thousand heartaches now
Ten thousand heartaches, baby
Don't look back and worldwide
We brought death to El Dorado

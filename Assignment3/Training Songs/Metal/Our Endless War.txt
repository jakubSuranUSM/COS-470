Let's go

America our wasteland
Where death is entertainment
The place where moving forward means you turn the other direction
A place where reality existed
And we still continue to bleed

Red, white, blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth so we say
F*ck you
My country tis of greed, sweet land of idiocracy

This is our endless war

While we still have liberty
Lets take back our justice for all
We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war
Let's take it back
We the people have spoken against

Our endless war

There is nothing left to prove
We've spoke our minds risked our lives
Make your move
Tread lightly, choose your words wisely
Or we will refuse to bleed

Red, white, blue for ourselves and who?
And they still hold the truth so we say
F*ck you
My country tis of greed, sweet land of idiocracy

While we still have liberty

Shut it down

50 states united as one
But we still cant find a solution
Where have we gone
It seems that our motto to live by
When your chin deep in shit
Duck, breathe and die

50 states united as one
But we still cant find a solution
Where have we gone
It seems that our motto to live by
When your chin deep in shit
Duck, breathe and die

Let's take back our justice for all

We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war 

We can march at sundown upon capitol hill
We're calling you out
Come face us now and see your true war

I've said before and I'll say it again
This world is ours
Let's take it back and give them their war

Let's take it back

We the people
Have spoken against

Our endless war

My country tis of greed, sweet land of idiocracy

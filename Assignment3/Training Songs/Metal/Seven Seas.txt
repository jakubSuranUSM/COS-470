Long ago we sailed with fury
Across the oceans of the world
The legend lives, it stays forever
We are ready so beware

We are rulers of the ocean
Kings of seven seas

Strong - we'll fight for king and country
With power left to spare
The longboat force is back again
To take on all the world

We are rulers of the ocean
Kings of seven seas

We are immortal
The glory's in our hands
For blood is our hunger
We know where we stand

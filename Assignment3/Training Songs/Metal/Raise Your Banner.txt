Blood for freedom

You're pushing me into the corner
Don't fight with me, don't fight with me, don't fight with me
I'm crowning no man for his armour or Rhapsody
For what I see and what I feel

Wake up
I'm defying you, seeing right through you once I believed in you
Wake up
Feel what's coming deep within we all know

Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within

I'm feeling the eyes of the fallen, they're watching me
They make me see, they make me see
I'm feeling the pain how you break them and make them bleed
You make them bleed, you make them bleed

Wake up
I'm defying you, seeing right through you once I believed in you
Wake up
Feel what's coming deep within we all know
The way that you torment me
The way that you challenge me
The way that you make me bleed

Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within

Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within

When gods are failing
They put all heaven in a rage
We're on our own
Our tears keep falling
They're setting fire to the flame
Blood for freedom

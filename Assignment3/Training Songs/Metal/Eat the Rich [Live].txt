I've been down, I've been beat
I've been tossed into the street
Beggin' nickels, beggin' dimes
Just to get my bottle of wine

Some say life she's a lady
Kinda soft, kinda shady
I can tell you life is rich
She's no lady, she's a bitch

1.They suck my body out
But friend there is no doubt
I'm gonna pay the devil his dues
Cause I'm sick of being abused

Eat the rich, eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich, eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch

Steal my money, steal my car
Took my woman and my old guitar
Runnin' crazy, runnin' wild
Blind alley in my mind

Just can't fight the temptation
It's become my inspiration
Gonna get myself an axe
Break some heads, break some backs
Repeat 1
Chorus
Don't stop me
Chorus
Chorus
Out of the palace and into the ditch
They suck my body out

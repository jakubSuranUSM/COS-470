In between, insidious vapor shall teem 
Looming so loathesome 
And it seems to me like I'm dead inside 
Bloated corpse, propped out of tradition 

I can never recall what it was I had ever to strive for as a youth 
Was it just to exist, autonomously? 

No, we don't want to work 
We just want to f*ck, 
Swallow pills and forget our curses 

No, we don't need pigs like you 
We'll follow the laws of our emptying veins 

In this world of nothing for me 
I'd be sooner destroyed 
Vampire youth, raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon, 
Let its visage ring true! 

To the hearts cold and blue 
We're dying each moment, free 
We're all animals here 
Flesh and blood, bone and dream! 

We're just impulses here 
Another piece of shit in the storm 

Just another piece of shit

From the smelling of things it appears this shit has come to a boil 
The night-time we shall rule as our own 
While the hollow shall sleep 
We shall bark at the moon 

In this world of nothing for me 
I'd be sooner destroyed 
In this world there is nothing for us but the sound (but the sound) 

Vampire youth, raise your cups to the ne'er waning moon, 
Let its visage ring true! 

To the hearts cold and blue 
We're dying each moment 

We'll never sleep again 
We'll be going fucking mad 
Sin and hell is all we will ever know 
Just another piece of shit!

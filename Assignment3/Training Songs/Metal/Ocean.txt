If the wind could bring the rain
I would save it all for you
Make an ocean to sail away
And begin again
They said I could never change
That it can't belong to you
Then I watched you slip away
In the ocean's arms

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

If a star could light the way
That could take me back to you
And the rain could wash away
Everything i've done
Only melody remains
So I sing my song to you
As I watched you slip away
In the ocean's arms

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

Falling down a wave
(falling down a wave)
I will never get you back
Like falling down a wave
(falling down a wave)
I will never get you back

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

I will never get you back
Like falling down a wave
Falling down a

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

I will never get you back
It's like falling down a wave
Falling down a wave

I will never get you back
I will never get you back
I will never get you back
I will never get you back

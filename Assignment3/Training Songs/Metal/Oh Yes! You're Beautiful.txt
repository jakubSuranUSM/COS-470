You're nice, I've told you once or twice
And here is my advice
You're everything a girl should be
So here, I'll whisper in your ear
And make it very clear
How Beautiful you are to me

Tonight (tonight)
Heaven must have smiled far upon you
Tonight (tonight)
Can't believe my eyes
Looking at you

Oh yes! You're beautiful! beautiful!
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
You look beautiful! beautiful!
Didn't I tell you? Don't you know?

So there, you're wonderful I swear
You make me stop and stare
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You see, there's you and there's me
That's how it'll always be
Cause you and I were made for love

Tonight (tonight)
All the star's shine down on you
Tonight (tonight)
Can't you see my eye's are shining too

Oh yes! You're beautiful! beautiful!
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
You look beautiful! beautiful!
Didn't I tell you? Don't you know?

Oh yeah

What are you?
Beautiful! Beautiful!
What are you?
Beautiful! Beautiful!

What are you?
Beautiful! Beautiful!

I'll always tell you you're,
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Didn't I Tell you, oh, Don't you know?
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Didn't I tell you?
Why don't you know?!
You are so beautiful!
Beautiful, Beautiful
(Oh yeah!)

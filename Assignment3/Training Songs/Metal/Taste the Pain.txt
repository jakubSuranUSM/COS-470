Flat on my back In a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling Because I can not fall
Asleep tonight 
No not at all
Head lights flash Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open Because I can not fall
In love with you, I know not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two Like a brittle stick
I can not drink
Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream and no I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Yeah, yeah
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid

Oh oh how the price gets paid
Well I got to pay, I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay
I couldn't price

Everyone came around here 
Everyone else got sick 
And watched the clock tickin' slowly 
Everyone knew the ending 
Opened a bag of tricks 
And stumbled over their own 
They blew minds away 
Sort of cripplin' just like thunder 
And it's gone today 
I'm so happy that it's on 

Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 

Well it's far away 
In a hurricane, twisting slowly 
Now it's gone today 
I'm so happy that it's on 

Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 

It's my world, my love, my gun 
It's my world, my love, my gun 

Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 
Well it's the end of the world 

It's my world, my love, my gun 
It's my world, my love, my gun

I feel so lonely
Since I had to leave you
'Cause all I had to say
Was not true

I'm thinking of you
Every day and every night
I'm missing your lovin'
Your face and your eyes

I feel so lonely
Since I had to leave you
'Cause all I had to say
Was not true

I'm thinking of you
Every day and every night
I'm missing your lovin'
Your face and your eyes - oh

I had to leave you
But I cannot, cannot forget you
I want you
I want you
I want you!

I stand by my window
And all seems so low
Slow but sure I understand
The good times we had
The good times we had

So empty is my heart
Without you
Without you
Stand apart

I remember your brown eyes
You looked so kind
Looked at me
Sparkled in the night

I'd change my mind
I will take your way
Together forever
Come on, it's the last essay - yeah

I had to leave you
But I cannot, cannot forget you
I want you
I want you
I want you!

I stand by my window
And all seems so low
Slow but sure I understand
The good times we had
The good times we had

So empty is my heart
Without you
Without you
Stand apart

Since I had to leave you
I cannot forget you
Slow but sure I understand
The good times we had
The good times we had

I stand by my window
And I've been so low
Slow but sure I understand
The good times we had
The good times we had

So empty is my heart
Without you
Without you
Stand apart

It's the darkest place 
Like beneath the stairs 
The "IT" it comes 
And it takes me there 

We take everything in sight 
All through the night 
Leaving scars 
And crashing cars 

Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 
Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 

It's my life 
For everyone to see 
For you a charade 
For me a disease 

Everything in sight 
All through the night 
Leaving scars 
And fucking stars 

Still reasoning my life 

Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 
Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 

Still reasoning my life 

It's do or die 
It's do or die 
It's do or die 
Not for me! 

Still reasoning my life 

Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 
Fiend for the fans and 
Fodder for the press 

Still reasoning my life, fucker!!

We come into this life in blood and tears
We leave this life in blood and tears
Paranoia deepest darkest fears
How beautiful the life, yes

The highs and lows of every day
Laughter and screams won't go away
But the total experience of it all
Blows me away
Implosion

Mother lover child of wife
Taken from us in this life
My griefs is yours and yours is mine
But o the gift of life is o so fine - Yes

The highs and lows of every day
Laughter and screams won't go away
But the total experience of it all
Blows me away
Blows me away
Blows me away
Implosion

Truth begins to dawn, a smile across my face
Realization in a total state of grace
The mines of Solomon we left behind,
We left behind the evils of the west
Rites of light and ceremonies bright
Playing this great game of life and death - Yes

The highs and lows of every day
Laughter and screams won't go away
But the total experience of it all
Blows me away
Blows me away
Blows me away

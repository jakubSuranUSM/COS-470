Riding the underground, swimming in sweat
A rumble above and below, hey cop don't you know?
The heat's on alright
The hot summer day didn't quit for the night

1277 express to heaven, speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven, rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in it's spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out

Blackened out eyes, scratched on a wall
Stoned out looks from the crowd, the king will not know
On the wall it was said
The flash of his cards was sprayed with red

1277 express to heaven, speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven, rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in it's spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out

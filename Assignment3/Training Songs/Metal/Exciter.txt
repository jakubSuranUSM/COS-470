Racing' cross the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand

Stand by for exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for exciter
Salvation bids to ask

Everything he touches fries into a crisp,
Let him get close to you so you're in his trip,
First you'll smoke and smolder
Blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe

Stand by for exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please

Who is this man?
Where is he from?
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue

He's come to make you snap out Of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you See the light again
So much self-indulgence Results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency Leads to beguiling lies

Stand by for exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for exciter
Salvation bids to ask

When he leaps amidst us
With combustive dance
All shall bear the branding Of his thermal lance,
Cauterizing masses Melting into one
Only when there's order Will his job be done.

Stand by for exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please

Who is this man?
Where is he from?
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue

Racing past the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand

The wrong time, the wrong place,
Our smiling face of distrust.
Buried, the seed
Deep in all our heads.

Prepared ourselves for the fall.
The greed killing !
Instinct of mistrust,
Instinct - the lust.

Their butchery of feelings,
Geared for the
Greed killing.
The greed killing!

Not now, then when?
Not now, then when?
When?
The lust denies the need.

Existence is a steady flow,
The moulded image grows.
No core, no faith in what you are,
The pressure builds

Right from the start.
Could it be just sour grapes?
Or have we failed
To fit their shape?

It's always give, and never take.
How much more can we give?
How much more can we take?

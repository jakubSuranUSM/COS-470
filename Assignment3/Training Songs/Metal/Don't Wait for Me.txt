[Lyrics & Music: Vicious Rumors]

It's time we had a talk.
Yeah let's get something straight
No it won't take long, but it's getting very late
Don't put me off, you know I'll cut you down
Ohh... that's right
All night long.. doin' what we've got to do.
Well so long... but you know... I'm comin' after you
Don't wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't... don't... don't wait for me 'cause I'll be on your tail
Don't..don't wait for me, don't you wait for me.. no no!!
I've been down... many times before
I've been around, seen it all and maybe more
But now I'm up...and gettin' higher yeah
Let's break the chains that's right
All night long... doin' what we've got to do, yeah
Well so long but you know I'm comin' after you!
Don't wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't.. don't...don't wait for me 'cause I'll be fuckin' on your tail
Don't.. don't wait for me.. don't you wait for me... no no!!
Don't you wait for me no no!!!

All night long... doin' what we've got to do.. yeah

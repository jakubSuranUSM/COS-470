Go, conflict, terror, hear the noise 
You're in the edge of a nerve-racking force 
Oh my god, here's a fight 
Never siege, never riot, must defy 

When you look at me, what do you see 
Another trophy like a fuckin' dead beat 
Close your eyes, take a step inside 

Insanity and abnormality 
It's not what you call reality 
But you will always find 
You should know 

I don't give a flying f*ck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying f*ck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying f*ck 

I'll never wait for the pain of death 
With a bullet in my gun don't f*ck over my shit 
Can you hold my crazy as I go 
So f*ck hypocrisy and f*ck you too 

Incoming 
Say one, more word 
I double-dare you, bring it on
Its my world, you're in it 
It'll take you down in a minute 

You can alter your look 
And diversify your image 
But the truth seems like 
A fist mark in your face 

When you look at me, what do you see 
Another trophy like a fuckin' dead beat 
Close your eyes, take a step inside 

Insanity and abnormality 
It's not what you call reality 
But you will always find 

I don't give a flying f*ck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying f*ck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying f*ck

A fist mark in your face

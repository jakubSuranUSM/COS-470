In your life
You seem to have it all
You seem to have control
But deep within your soul
You're losing it

You never took the time
Assume that you're to blame
You think that you're insane
Won't you spare me

I know the breakdown
Everything is gonna shake now someday
I know the breakdown
Tell me again am I awake now
Maybe you can find the reason that
No one else is living this way

Yeah your lies your world is built around
Two faces to a clown
The voices in your head think
There's four pawns down

Well in this unity
Fate has found the need
You better check yourself
Before you check out

If you find yourself
Then you might believe
Then within yourself
You just might conceive

You can find the reason that
(You can find the reason that)
No one else is living this way
(You can find the reason that way)

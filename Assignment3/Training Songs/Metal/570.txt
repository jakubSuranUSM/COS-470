Burn it down, brick by brick, made in 2006
Lost and found, losing grip, I needed this
Question me not, for I gave up everything
Forget me not, 'cause i’ve not forgotten what this means

Strip me down, tear me apart, you’ll find one thing left
No sign of stopping 'til my veins rust
Strip me down, tear me apart, you’ll find one thing left
I fucking know where I came from
And nothing can replace those lessons learned
As I stood with my brothers on the side of the road
No longer haunted by the skeletons
No longer haunted by the past

For so long, it’s all i’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring

Miles repeat
My worst enemy, is me
But then 4 soon became 6
To shatter the canvas

Handed nothing, loss pulling the strings
Outlived the dead trends
United by distance

For so long, it’s all i’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring

Ive been to hell and back, with no promise of return
So I made friends with fire, to keep from getting burned
No money, no sleep, dedication
10 years on the road this is sacred
And when i’m facing a wall, I do not quit
'Cause if you mean it, you will make it

Pulled apart in a world so demanding
I’m still here, still standing
I’ve sweat blood from stockholm to scranton
Still here, still standing

You can always rinse the surface, but the stain will remain

For so long, it’s all i’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
I did my time

You live, you learn, you defy the terms, but this house will be my home
Beguiled, betrayed, it’s the price we pay, as trust will be our tomb

If you mean it, you'll make it

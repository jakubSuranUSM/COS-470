There was a cold winter night
Where the dark went on forever
And the world seemed like a
Dream gone astray 

And somehow there on this night
As the world huddled together
There a child slept at the end of
This day 

And he dreamed of another world
In another time
And another place 

Where no man
Has to wear a sign
Saying where he's from
Saying what's his race 

And he wants us to believe
This world that he sees 

What is the dream of this night
Why does it echo forever
Here in the cold at the end of
This year 

And with all our different lives
Why do we dream it together
When at the first sign of snow it
Appears 

When he dreamed of another world
In another time
And another place 

Where no man
Has to wear a sign
Saying where he's from
Saying what's his race 

And he wants us to believe
This world that he sees

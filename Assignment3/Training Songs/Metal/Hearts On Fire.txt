We saw the writings on the wall
When heathens ruled above us all
Tormented we still heard the call

You come to bring us down
wield the scepter steal the crown
Time on the throne is running out

â??Cause seasons change but we are still the same
Event though the cold winds blow we're burning like a flame

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel

Hearts On Fire

For years shunned by society
Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs
Our legions grew in secrecy

And now, the time is here
I see the Templar's everywhere
The Freedom Call is drawing near

We hold our rebel banners up with pride
The color's crimson and the Hammer is the sign

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire

Hearts On Fire, Hearts On Fire
Burning, burning with desireâ?¦

Hearts On Fire

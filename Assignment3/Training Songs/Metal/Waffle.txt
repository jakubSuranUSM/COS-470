A universe to fill
Can't scratch the surface
Now a slow pay
Still why everyone watching
It's like I'm real tired of the clones
I'm real tired of the clones

Whatever you you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Where's the space I fill
Where's the sympathy I killed
I need to find a meaning
I'm useless, I'm useless
Trapped inside my own web

Whatever you you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

When I'm alone
I stare at nothingness
Painful silence
Painful silence kills)

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

Whatever you say
Whatever you say

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more
Show me a light
Bring a light

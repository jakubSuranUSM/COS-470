I been knockin' the walls down 
Tryin' to get to you 
But I won't wait forever 
Ya gotta let me through 
Now I been diplomatic 
But I don't know what for 
'Cause you hurt me, now just watch me 
'Cause I won't take no more

This means war and you will see it's senseless 
This means war and soon you'll be defenseless 
'Cause you can't win this war

There will be no replacements 
Ya better get your gun 
Because I'm comin' after you 
For everything you done 
And then when you are captured 
It won't be like before 
'Cause you teased me, deceived me 
But this is what's in store

This means war and you will see it's senseless 
This means war and soon you'll be defenseless 
'Cause you can't win this war

You avoid reality in the calm before the storm 
It hurts me so to fight with you 
But since you closed the door

This means war and you will see it's senseless 
This means war and soon you'll be defenseless 
'Cause you can't win this war

This means war and you will see it's senseless 
This means war and soon you'll be defenseless 
'Cause you can't win this war

You can't win this war 
You can't win this war

You'll soon be hearing the chime
Close to midnight
If I could turn back the time
I'd make all right

How could it end like this?
There's a sting in the way you kiss me
Something within your eyes
Said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

It keeps on giving me chills
But I know now
I feel the closer we get
To the last vow

I don’t wanna end like this (Like this, yeah)
But the sting in the way you kiss me (I'm loving it)
Something within your eyes
Said it could be the last time
'Fore it's over!

Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you one last time with me tonight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you all right
Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night

All right!
Woh-woh-woh, wohh!

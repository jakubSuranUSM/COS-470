Wake up
Grab beer
Grab rear
Shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
Break up, with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts
I'm undead
Unfed
Been sleeping on, bunk beds, since ten
So if I don't booze it
I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it
Do it
Get ruined.

Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'
Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'

When I start drinking
My dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me
And I like their big fake titties
D cup with extra filling
Take it out let me lick it quickly
Calm down its just a hickie
I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping gets me tipsy
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back street to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let ya
I gotta 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer
Or pay the rent
My signing bonus was quickly spent
So I beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher

Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'
Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'

Lets get this party jumpin'
Lets see some 40 chuggin'
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzin'
C'mon girl I wanna see you drinkin'
I wanna see your brain start shrinkin'
Make a move I saw you winkin'
Drunkin' pussy's what I'm thinking
I don't give a f*ck if your drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
F*ck a wrist band
Lets all do a keg stand
Like a Cheech without the Chong
Hitting up the beer bong
When the cops show up
They're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a f*ck 'cause I'm the designated drinker

Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'
Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'

Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'
Lets get this party started
Lets keep them 40s poppin'
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties droppin'

Dead man, crawling out of his crater
Sucking on the air from his ventilator
Watch out, little girl, you're just a beginner
He wears outside his face the smile of a winner

Drags his woman around by the hair
It turns her on, she don't wanna be square
Standing on top of the family mountain
Drinking lemonade from the magical fountain

Holiday trips in a Volkswagen camper
Children locked into an old picnic hamper
Let them loose to play in a sandpit
Leave them there 'cause they take us for granted

Man is an ape and woman a martyr
It's not what you do when you do it, it's what you do after
I went down to the zoo and I looked in the cages
Then I walked on home past the office, collected my wages

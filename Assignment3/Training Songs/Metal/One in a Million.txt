Once in your life you'll find someone
 To make it all so real
 When it comes you will know
 'Cuase it's like something
 You never thought you'd feel

 (And) sometimes you say to yourself
 Is this really what i'm looking for ?
 'Cause only time will tell
 if this is heaven or hell
 To really know if you're sure

 I walk this lonely road
 And I felt i'm goin' nowhere
 (And) some things I'll never know
 But I know why you're the only one

 And I'll never find love again
 Like the kind you give
 Like the kind you send
 'Cuase you're one in a million
 One in a million... to me.

 Baby you've got a certain way
 of doin' things that makes me feel
 Like I'm someone
 So don't change the way that you are

 I walk this lonely road
 And I felt i'm goin' nowhere
 (And) some things I'll never know
 'Cuase you're a million and one

 I walk the lonely road
 And I felt i'm goin' nowhere
 (And) some things I'll never know
 But I know why you're the only one

 And I'll never find love again
 Like the kind you give
 Like the kind you send
 'Cause you're one in a million
 One in a million to me..

 No more lonely nights
 I'm finally goin' somewhere
 And it's all because of you
 That I know why
 You've always been the only one

 And i'll never find love again
 Like the kind you give
 Like the kind you send
 'Cause iou're one in a million
 One in a million to me

 I'll never find love again
 Like the kind you give
 Like the kind you send
 'Cuase you're one in a million
 One in a million to me

 One in a million to me..
 One in a million to me...
 One in a million to me...

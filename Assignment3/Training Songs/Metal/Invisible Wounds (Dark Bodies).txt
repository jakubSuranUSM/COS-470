Dark bodies floating in darkness
No sign of light ever given
Imprisoned in a world without a memory
Unconscious, or am I conscious?
Cut from the heart I am part of
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness (loneliness)
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven

In dreams I see myself flying
Closer to the sun and I'm climbing
Tried to touch the sun
But the brightness burned my eyes 

Unconscious, or am I conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness (loneliness)
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness (loneliness)
And I saw my own face like a spark

Dark, dark, dark
My life was so dark
Dark, dark, dark
My mind was so dark

Dark, dark, dark
My life was so dark
Dark, dark, dark
Everything was

Unconscious or am I conscious?
Fell from the sky like a star
Sometimes I feel as though I'm frozen in heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness (loneliness)
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness 

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness 

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness 

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness 

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness 

And I saw my own face in the dark and loneliness
And I saw my own face like a spark frozen in heaven
Dark bodies floating in darkness

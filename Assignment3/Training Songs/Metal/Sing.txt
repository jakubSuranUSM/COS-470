It’s late in the evening
I'm on the side now
I’ve been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could just talk now
I don’t wanna know
If you’re getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
So everybody knows
Take another step so that understand
To the end of time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know, oh ooh, oh ooh
If you love me come on let me know
Feel the music move you from your head to toe, oh ooh, oh ooh

Sing, oh oh, Oh oh
Louder, oh oh
Sing, oh oh

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to sing and maybe to joke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local place, no
I don’t really know what i’m supposed to say 
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said it’s nice to meet ya 
Then she handed me of a bottle of water, said nice to meet ya
I already know she’s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, i’m in deep
If anybody finds out i’m meant to drive home 
But I've sung all of it now, waiting it out
I just sit on the couch one thing led to another now I'm running my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know, oh ooh, oh ooh
If you love me come on let me know
Feel the music move you from your head to toe, oh ooh, oh ooh

Sing, oh oh, Oh oh
Louder, oh oh
Sing, oh oh

Can you feel it? 
All the guys in here don’t really wanna dance
Can you feel it? 
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? 
Found you hiding here so hoped you'd take my hand, darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it, oh
Can you feel it, oh no no no?

(oh, oh) I need you darling 
Come on set the tone
(oh, oh) If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know (louder), oh ooh, Oh ooh
(Sing oh, oh) if you love me come let me know
(oh, oh) feel the music move you from your head to toe (louder), oh ooh, Oh ooh
Sing

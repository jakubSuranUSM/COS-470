Yeah
Baby I want to walk you home
Baby I want to walk you home
There's a shadow in my basement
And I'm scared to sleep alone
Baby doesn't everybody bleed
Baby doesn't everybody bleed
I'd slide up there beside you
But my nightmare long too steep

Yeah
Baby I want to buy you a Cadillac
Baby I want to buy you a Cadillac
I'm going in with my song
But you say you're gonna give it back
Yeah
Baby I love you baby
I love you baby I love you baby

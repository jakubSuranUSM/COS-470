We're destroying your crown and your walls are crashing down. Wreak havoc.
Humanity has put evil on a throne, destroying the walls we built to contain our hearts; barely keeping us alive.
We've given power to the things that only wish to hold us down. It's time to wreak havoc.
I can't even remember a time when I could stand up for myself. I won't give in, I'll never surrender. No more fear, only fight.
I'm a slave, I'm a slave to nothing.
We're destroying your crown (get up, get up) and your walls are crashing down (get up, get up)
Wreak havoc.
Now is our time to rise above the fire you've cast down on us. I hear the words that you say, but at the end of the day you'll never see me surrender.
A kingdom reclaimed, the spawn of sin is shamed; reaching from the dirt as darkness falls beneath the Earth. Devouring souls of the ones who chose to stay behind; thrown into eternal prison. I'm the one who's still alive.
Hell awaits the king of lies. The perverse will fall, the beast will burn alive. King of lies.
I HOPE YOU ROT.
We're destroying your crown (get up, get up) and your walls are crashing down (get up, get up)
Im a slave , I'm a slave to nothing.

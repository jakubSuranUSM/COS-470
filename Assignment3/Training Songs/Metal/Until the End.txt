Wings spread, poised
Faintly convulsing the sky
How will I know?
Bask now in this graying
Light
Search for that word
Something likened goodbye
How will i know
That they will cry?

(chorus) We were blessed
(in this lifetime)
Laid to rest
(all we live for)
We were blessed

Voices ring on 
Autumn is always at hand 
Angels corpses
Hollow and stolen so fast
I heard your voice
And it spoke softly to me
We have this time
And then we're free

Take me under
Take me under

By burial this night
Nitocrys weaves the spell
Down the vault's misty light
The lurking Sphinx dwells

Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one

In the nuclear domain
Arcades lost in eternal skries
Written by the insane
Nitocrys orders must

Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one

Mummy's rebirth by wrath
Below the temple of nile
Vanished in Osiris' path
Above us reigns the Necrophile

Agony and nightmare
To Yog sothoth they noan
Nightfalls, morbid affair
Beard the faceless one

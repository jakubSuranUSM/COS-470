Road racin',
Movin' on down the line.
Shiftin' gears, and time
Move so fast I can't
Hands on the wheel
road again
Baby
Radio's blastin'
Rockin' all night
Rollin' down the
Through the dead of night.
Road racin',
Feel the earth move under my wheels.
There, The chills you get from the turns and squeals.
On my way
Just let me know
Rollin' down the
With the
World's flashing by,
Past the smoke and the heat.
We're road racin'
kick it out now
Road racin,
the line
space and time
dead of night
we're road racin'
..

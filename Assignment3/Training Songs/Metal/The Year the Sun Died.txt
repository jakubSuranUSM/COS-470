“Contempt and defiance brought the haze
Truly the sun was dying
Deliverance came like a stark shadow for some, slowly, twisting.”

Contemptus saeculi

We've reached the final days
We tread the light of nothingness
In fractured existence, we praise the light that still remains

We have reached the final war
Beaten heads broken against the wall forevermore
Was it worth the violence? Was it worth the cause?
Was it worth the inevitable changing of the guard?

What if there is nothing more?
What if there is only emptiness?
What if there is nothing more
beyond the code of deliverance?
What if everything decays?
What if we've all just been betrayed?
The code of deliverance leads us closer
We are closer to the end

Defiant ones defend their sins
While the sun is collapsing
The world is on a diving spin to this infernal holocaust
Was it worth the consequence?
For we have angered the gods
Our broken dreams and silent screams
Shall never be felt, shall never be heard

What if there was nothing more?
What if there is only emptiness?
What if there is nothing more
beyond the code of deliverance?
What if everything decays?
What if we've all just been betrayed?
The code of deliverance leads us closer

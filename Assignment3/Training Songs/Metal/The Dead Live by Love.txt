No it should have not been you
I never meant the things I said
Nothing of it ever true
Whoever writes it and whoever makes the future happen
Would've gone in your place but it happened to you
No more time to say goodbye and no more time for what we have
End of all our things is this really true to you?

You've left me with this time
I old onto your life
These shattered pieces that you left when I survived
I'm not the only one who's suffered since you've gone
And so the dead still live by love

No it should have not been you
I never meant the things I said
Nothing of it ever true
Whoever writes it and whoever makes the future happen
Would've gone in your place but it happened to you
No more time to say goodbye and no more time for what we have
End of all our things is this really true?
No I should have left with you
Take back all the wrongs I did
Showing you my inner truth
I always wanted and forever I will live my life
To make you smile from your place I am binded to you
In my mind I say farewell but in my beating heart
I'm binded to you

Lift me up
Memory of the things I saw
The lonely view that you hand to me
Never fades in time
You're inside and feeding my soul
Giving to me hope for my life
Darkness snaps to ruin this night
Memories ignite the flames of time
Lift me up
Memory of the things I saw
The lonely view that your hand to me
Another day that I can relive

Reach inside feel forevermore
This battle
Falls unto all

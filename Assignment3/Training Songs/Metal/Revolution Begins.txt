Since the day that you were born the wheels are in motion
Turning ever faster
Play your part in the big machine
The stage is set, the road is chosen
You fate preordained
We are watching you, every step of the way

Never too late to stand your ground,
Revolution begins
In you, in me, revolution!

Once lost
Lost in their game
Mental chains breaking now
Set yourself free
Who are they to tell you what to do?
The stage is not set, the road is not chosen
Your fate not preordained
They are losing control, every step of the way

Never too late to stand your ground,
Revolution begins
In you, in me, revolution!

Never too late to stand your ground,
Revolution begins
In you, in me, this is revolution!

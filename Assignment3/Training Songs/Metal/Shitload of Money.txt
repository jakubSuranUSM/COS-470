Yeah!
She got a shitload of money
The night´s a mile high deja vu
Taking her wings and halo down to boom town, yeah

She got a shitload of money
When the night is over
She walks away no wings, no halo

There's an angel with no glory
There´s a book without a story
Wings road stained will now descend
Teary smile to rip your heart in two, yay

It is an ordinary day dream
To save an angel, be her plaything

But now you know

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

Nobody knows how she got it (what she´s got)
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

Underhanded, they are falling
All the trump cards they are folding
Oh, the greenback days are over now
Lady Luck took off with her new love

"I´m never
In for the penny, but always in for a pounding when I'm playing
Put your mouth where my money is, the world is now for sale, hon!"
So many open mouths, one silver spoon

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

Nobody knows how she got it (what she´s got)
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

Shitload of money, shitload of money, all gone, yeah.
Shitload of money, shitload of money.

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

The neon-light lit night
She got a shitload of money
A fallen angel paid for her halo

She got a shitload of money
Shiny wings dark sky
All chains only glorify freedom

She got a shitload of money
Shitload of money
She got a tale to spin but no halo

Empty hearts and muted voices are the fabric of this world
With spirits sunk so low you can see the bottom
There’s a hole deep within us all, never fulfilled
Let us say a prayer for those who walk the earth when we’re no longer here
Destroy our indifference and burn with despair
Forgive my ignorance, this is all I can bear

No grace, no love, no light, no future, no hope

With your hands removed from the equation
And no sign of your hedge of protection
We’ve destroyed all you’ve created
Never fulfilled

A constant reminder that this world is not my home
No future for the wicked
No future without hope

The God of Storms will you hear me
The shore is close but I fear it
Njord
I am lost on my course to Gardarike
Caught in a fiery temper

Njord
When you touch the earth
With golden sun rays
Njord
Your white palace embraced in gold
Vanir God, I am Njord
Send me waves
Like silk from the East
Njord
And skin of a maiden's cheeks
Nine wave maidens arise

The ruler of winds will you save me
My hopes are strong but you guide me
I am lost on my course to Gardarike
Caught in a stormy weather

Storm lay down your sword
Silence your breath
Allay your tempest now
Agir be aware
Be aware

Sea be calm and clear tonight
Silence your waves
Njord

Becalm your anger now
Storm lay down your sword
Agir be aware
Be aware

Yesterday
When I was just a boy
In times of youthful hero worship
My kind have been molded by images on the screen
Brought up to emulate the big
Guns

Just another guest on death's best show
The influence cuts deeper than mom knows
Electric waves
The demon's fly

Now could we just be
Bred to kill or DIE

There must be something else
The blame I place on myself
Behind the tired eyes
The tears go uncried

In the Box
Doin' time
In the Box
Just like doin' time
In the Box
Doin' time
In the Box

Now that I'm grown
Abandoned childhood toys
But still what danger
Have I retained
To grab the brass ring
To go in for the kill
And covet the good you know 'dem got for
MURDER

It's just another guest on death's best show
The influence cuts deeper than mom knows
Electric waves
The demon's fly

Now could we just be
Bred to kill or DIE

There got to be something else
The blame I place on myself
Behind tired eyes
The demon's stir
The tears go uncried

In the Box
Doin' time
In the Box
Just like doin' time
In the Box
Doin' time
In the Box

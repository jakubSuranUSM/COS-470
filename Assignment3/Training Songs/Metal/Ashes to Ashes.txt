Rain on me baby mean mistreater lover
You got me branded by your love iron
With a love and affection I keep praying for our desire
Sweet evil woman I walk through your fire

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I live and I die for your love
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Heart breaker taker of love

Sweeter than honey of love on my tongue
Well I'm a slave to your love
Black widow woman thy will has been done
Trapped in your web of fire

Sister of mercy I'm hooked on your drug
Well I hear the cry of the sirens
And the reeper is calling
She's really gripped around my soul
My time has come and the bell it tolls

[Chorus]

Ooh babe I love for the breath of your love
Day after day, girl I'm waiting in vain
I keep waiting for the time to come
When my darkest hour will fade away
Oh when it does
Then I'll feel the rising sun of your love

[Chorus]

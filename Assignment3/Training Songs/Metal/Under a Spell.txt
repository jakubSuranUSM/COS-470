You know she only plays beneath the night of day
Weaving her deadly web of lies to tempt her pray
Her deadly poison rots the reason in your mind
You contribute towards the future of her kind

Oh no - Don't you believe her - Look out

She is the fire - Heavenly hell
You can't resist - Under her spell
So inviting - The angels fell
She lets you in - Under her spell

But you can't see behind the schemes
You thought you'd fell into a dream
You should have taken more care
Can't you see your dreams - They're a nightmare

The angels fell - Heavenly hell - Under a spell
Caught - Under a spell - Under a spell

You know she's dangerous between her smiles and grace
Her charms adventurous with schizophrenic lies
And then her final trick the noose that she has tied

Oh no - Don't you believe her - Look out

She is the fire - Heavenly hell
You can't resist - Under her spell
So inviting - The angels fell
She lets you in - Under her spell

[Repeat Verse 1 & Chorus]

The angels fell - Heavenly hell - Under a spell
Caught - Under a spell - Under a spell

You're caught

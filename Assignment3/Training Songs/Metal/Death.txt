I'm not your gateway
I'm not your prodigal son
I am the vile lesser-than
Just who do you think I am?

I'm not your standard
I'm not your vision divine
I am no sacrificial lamb
Just who do you think I am?

I am death
I am death 
I am death 
I am death 

I'm not your sacrifice
I'm not your shelter in the storm
I am determinately man
Just who do you think I am?

I'm not your child
I'm not your paragon of just
I am by other means damned
Just who do you think I am?

I am death 
I am death
I am death
I am death
Who do you think I am? 
Who do you think I am? 
Who do you think I am? 
Who do you think I am?

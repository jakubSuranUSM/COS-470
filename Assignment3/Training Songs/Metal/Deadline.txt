I lust a princess - A crystal queen
Virginal whiteness is all that I dream
My magic snow - Show me your real
To make a contact - I'm dying to feel
Watch out - You there

She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside - Can't fight it
It's a deadline now
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
Give me an angel - Blow me a breeze

It's a deadline
Hunting a killer - It's a jungle disease
Watching in marvel you'll steal her release

You walk on silver - Travel the seas
Watch out - You there
Don't you care
She makes you feel good
Inside - Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
My mind's in torment - Something's not clear

I take my goddess where nobody hears
She sees right through me - She's in my mind
Mother of madness - Immortals blind

Watch out - You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside - Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now

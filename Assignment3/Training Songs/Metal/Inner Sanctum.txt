(music and lyrics by Nergal)
Background lead: Nergal

split my skin, f*ck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels ov light

pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped is disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered

I nevermourn, I never look back
As long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace...

pain is timeless
When I question the laws ov god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...

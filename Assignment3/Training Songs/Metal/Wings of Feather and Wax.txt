Cut from wire, blind of light, from another breed
Realize wrong from right, turning raw inside of me
Having visions in the sight, like cutting razor wire
We live on through the night, night of eternal fire

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

Wings above, danger's near, they're coming down
Flying close to the sun, you will only hit the ground
The silence is so deafening, the end is just the beginning
Inside the void, I hear you scream

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

Arise, arise, not so close to the sky
Alive, alive, when you face death, you feel alive
Kill it, kill it, channel your animal side
Fire, fire, it's time to start a riot

Unleash your wings
Unleash your soul
Unleash yourself
From the sun

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

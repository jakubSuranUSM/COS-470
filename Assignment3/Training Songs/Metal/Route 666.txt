Pedal to the metal, led on my feet, enginge roaring, turn up the heat
A roadrace to hell, on crashcourse with sin, a package of spells, bet and you'll win

A date with the devil, close to the heat, people are dancing and Jesus the meat
A date with the devil, close to the heat, people are laughing and drums play the beat

Chorus:
l am the bastard son - evil inborn, Satan in tip-top, from head to toe
Just look at me, sense my blitz, down riding route 666

Semi-automatic, a delicate show, gotta keep running, a few miles to go
Hook up a motel, I need some sleep, before joining in as his black fucking sheep

Follow the piper follow the drum
Follow the footsteps our comrades begun
'Til the battle's won, the battle's won
Follow the Sabre, follow the gun
For King and for Country
We stand here as one
'Til the battle's done, the battle's done

We are brothers in arms
We fight for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground, killing ground

Cannons are roaring
From left and to right
Into the carnage before us we fight
'Til the day is won, the day is won
Thousands have fallen, around us they lie
Onwards together, we fight or we die
'Til the day is done, the day is done

We are brothers in arms
We march for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground, killing ground

Charge into battle victory we cry
Onto the lances our sabres held high
Hear our battle cry, battle cry
The field is now silent
The conflict is done
Marching to glory through rivers of blood
Hear our battle cry, battle cry

We are brothers in arms
We die for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground, killing ground

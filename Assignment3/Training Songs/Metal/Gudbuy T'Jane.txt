Goodbye to Jane, goodbye to Jane
She's a dark horse see if she can
Goodbye to Jane, goodbye to Jane 
Painted up like a fancy young man

Goodbye to Jane, goodbye to Jane 
Spits on me 'cause she knows that she can
She's a queen

See, see, see, she's a queen
And I know she's alright, alright, alright, alright

You'll never take my soul
You'll never take my soul

The next generation in synchronization, devoid and astray
Burned and defenseless against the relentless hacking machine

We're disconnected as one, soulless nation
We're disconnected as one, devastation

No soul, I gotta have all control, before I break
No soul, you'll never take my control, I dominate

Contamination, severe violation of all that I see
Breaking down defenses, devouring access, decoding their dreams

We're disconnected as one, soulless nation
We're disconnected as one, devastation

No soul, I gotta have all control, before I break
No soul, you'll never take my control, I dominate

Seek out and destroy the source of inhumanity
Seek out and destroy the source of inhumanity

We're disconnected as one, soulless nation
We're disconnected as one, devastation

No soul, I gotta have all control, before I break
No soul, you'll never take my control, I dominate

No soul, I gotta have all control
You'll never take my soul
I gotta have all control, I dominate

Livin' alone, ready to bed
Nothin's gonna mean a thing if I don't have you
You pass me by with a wink of an eye
I'm all shook up and I don't know what to do
And then I look in your eyes
And you look in my eyes
I must be dreamin'
I must be dreamin'
Flashback heart attack, everytime I see your face
Flashback heart attack, ooh you drive me wild
Flashback heart attack, come and take me away
Night after night I put up a fight
Nobody else got so much to win like I do
Oh livin' the life of an angry young fool
Standin' in the shadows I gotta stay cool
And then I look in your eyes
And you look in my eyes
I must be dreamin'
I must be dreamin'
Flashback heart attack, everytime I see your face
Flashback heart attack, ooh you drive me wild
Flashback heart attack, someone come and take me away

Livin' alone, ready to bed
Everybody knows that you've got a hold on me
Livin' the life of an angry young fool
Standin' in the shadows I gotta stay cool
And then I look in your eyes
And you look in my eyes
I must be dreamin'
I must be dreamin'
Flashback heart attack, everytime I see your face
Flashback heart attack, ooh you drive me wild
Flashback heart attack, someone come and take me away
Take me away
Flashback heart attack
Flashback heart attack
Flashback heart attack, someone come and take me away
Flashback heart attack, ohh you drive me wild
Flashback heart attack, everytime I see your face
Flashback heart attack, ooh you drive me wild
Flashback heart attack, someone come and take me away

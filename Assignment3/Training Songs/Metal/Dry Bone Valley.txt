Head down running from the beast.
Break neck speeding, taken down on my birth.
Black feet scrape the scarlet dripping blood
Rain come down, take me with your flood

I can't do it, I was running from you.
Feel your breath on the back of my neck.
Where have I,
Come to be?
Is a song,
That's left for me.

I wish that I was still there.
I wanna keep on breathing.

Fools roll loud,
Snakes move past my feet.
Oh gee, thou have set me free.
Bones start rattling 'round inside my head.
I don't know if I'm alive or dead.

I can't do it, I was running from you
Feel your breath on the back of my neck.
Where have I,
Come to be?
Is a song,
That's left for me.

I wish that I was still there.
I wanna keep on breathing.

Dig deep, kicking the bucket, turn and said
Out of this lifeless but impotent hell.
Over these mountains to the seas of life.
Leaves me to stand up for the sick and damned.

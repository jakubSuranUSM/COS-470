Fear

We’re still struggling
Halfway through this journey
Our eyes are burning but we're not slowing down
I wish we could have all the time in the world
But we have come too far to give up who we are

We fear nothing, we fear nothing

Life long, road blocks
High walls, teardrops
Nothing, stands in our way
Blood stained, stock crash
Mistakes, heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

We’re still running
We are not afraid the thrill is on
Speed up without any brakes, oh no
'Cause sometimes we still have to hit the wall
To see things that are right before our eyes

We fear nothing, we fear nothing

Life long, road blocks
High walls, teardrops
Nothing, stands in our way
Blood stained, stock crash
Mistakes, heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

We fear nothing, we fear nothing
Now that we've come so far
Do you still remember our dreams
The need to have it all?
Don't give up, I feel we are almost there

Life long, road blocks
High walls, teardrops
Nothing, stands in our way
Blood stained, stock crash
Mistakes, heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

Life long, road blocks
High walls, teardrops
Nothing, stands in our way
Blood stained, stock crash
Mistakes, heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way
That's our way, that's our way, that's our way, that's our way

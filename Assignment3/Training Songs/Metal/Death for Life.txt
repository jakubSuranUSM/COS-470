Go!

We're on a mission
The way to a better life.
We've got conviction.
The strength to stand up with pride.
Don't need no reason
Not scared to fall down and try.
We keep on pushing
The way to a better life.

What's the purpose?
Yeah what's the reason?
Your stupid questions
Yeah I don't need 'em.
Whatchu got to fall back on, son?
Don't need no reason why.
Whatcha gonna do when you're old?
I'll fight until I die.

If you don't run straight into the sun
You'll never see the light.
If you don't open up your mind
In darkness you will die.

I can't forget it
The purpose in my life.
I got a mission.
Don't need to show you why.
You're in your own hell.
The lifeless kind.
Too scared to take a chance
You run and hide.

What's the purpose?
Yeah what's the reason?
Your stupid questions
No I don't need 'em

We're on a mission
The way to a better life.
We've got conviction.
The strength to stand up with pride.

Yeah what's the purpose?
Yeah what's the reason?
Your stupid questions
No I don't need 'em

Whatchu got to fall back on, son?
Don't need no reason why.
Whatcha gonna do when you're old?
I'll fight until I die.

If you don't run straight into the sun
You'll never see the light.
If you don't open up your mind
In darkness you will die.

Your world despise my life!
Your world it taints your eyes!
Your world destroys your mind!
Your world can't stop our kind!

Yes, here is what you came for,
I know what I'm here for,
Knocked out right to the floor,
Committed to kill!
Kill what you don't know,
Can't trust, let it go

Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story!
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.
Committed to kill!
Kill what you don't know,
Can't trust, let it go
The God damned hypocrisy

My story's in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me
My story is in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me

I fear to be tied
My consciousness; dead to rights,
F*ck suicide,
Living along side you, yeah!

So, get what you came for,
Locked up on the floor,
Get straight at the door,
Get yourself more inventive!

Say what you mean
Don't ask what's the story!
You'll be knocked out right to the floor.
Committed to kill!
Kill what you don't know
Can't trust, let it go the God damned hypocrisy

My story's in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me
My story is in yours,
Throw at me what you got,
'Cause I will break free, from all the words that bind me

I fear to be tied
My consciousness; dead to rights,
F*ck suicide,
Living along side you, yeah!

Let me out, let me out!
Let me out to try!
I've got no idea,
I've got dead to rights, yeah!
Dead to rights!

Don't take it too personal
Is just that trouble is coming
Yeah!
You know it could be God damn true!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you!
I got you dead to rights!
I got you dead to rights!

I choke on my bitterness
Because some things are better left unsaid

Hesitant is my instinctive venom
Since I've stepped out of this light

I said I'm sorry
The truth is I never was
Begging to be indifferent
I'll take you down with me

You're going down
I'll take you down

Falling
Scratching, tearing

Ripping, falling, melting
Scratching, tearing, bleeding, feeding

I said I'm sorry
The truth is I never am
Begging for indifference
I'll drag you down with me

You're going down
I'll drag you down

A toxified embrace holds me up
As my suicide increases
And my life skids out of control
Shouting back in my face

As I lose control of my hands and mind
As I reach for my peace

I claw at my eyes
Insensitivity looking away
Just like a raped mother to her child
I hate you just the same
I hate you

And when patience wears thin
Intentions watch hungrily transparent
Anxious to feast on your devotion
Anticipating that quenchless thirst

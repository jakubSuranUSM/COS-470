Shoot, shoot, shoot, hey!
Please tell me kind, I'm out of my mind
And I'm telling you
It's not that I'm bad, I'm totally mad
I'm a boogaloo

I'm certain, I must be a burden
Completely...
Over the top, over the top!

I don't know what it means, all I hear is screams
And I don't know whose
The nightmares are real, I got a raw deal
And it's all bad news

I swear it, I can't get it
Completely...
Over the top, over the top!

You know it's no lie, my main alibi
It's a waste of time
You know it's the truth, the lyrics the proof
And at least it rhymes

You can have me, 'cos I'm barmy
Completely...
Over the top, over the top!

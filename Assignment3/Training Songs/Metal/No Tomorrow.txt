Later that night as I fell to my death Leaving my body behind Out of my mind into endless beyond
Into the other side Lost in a dawning darkness Down through the gate of the dream Death without end
Night of No Tomorrow Night of No Tomorrow Alive under will Break the surface again
Approaching the corpse of myself Shivered and shook as my spirit returned But I lost my heart in hell
Lost in a dawning darkness Down through the gate of the dream Death without end Night of No Tomorrow
Night of No Tomorrow Lost in a dawning darkness Down through the gate of the dream Death without end
Night without mercy Death without end Dawning darkness No Tomorrow Heart in hell No Tomorrow
Approaching the corpse No Tomorrow Death without end

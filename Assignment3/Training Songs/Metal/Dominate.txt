In my dominion You die
But first You'll suffer pain
Your wings won't fly again

Awaken from Your dwell
As I force Your eyes 
to see the lies in Christ 

In my dominion You die
Godless You slowly burn
Soulless You now return

My Demons grant You hell
The spirit in Your soul...
Reduced to burning coal

When You've failed
You've failed once more... 
Your heart is frozen
and Your body's cold
Then angels' tears will fall...
down from heaven

When You've failed...
You've failed once more...
Your heart is frozen
and Your body's cold
Then angels' tears will fall...

Charred soul, instant death
Deprived of Your last breath
God's angels, burnt and raped
Oh, I so dominate

Fallen from grace, Their laughter has died
The maggot race, in vain They run for the light
Demons, prepare to war for the 666
Angels, prepare to burn on the crucifix... 
Crucifix

Arise now avengers
My demons, My armies
Hate, Dominate
Congregate, Eliminate
The angels, God's angels...
Now burning, while turning...
Skinless
Lifeless
Faithless
Faceless

It's so much darker now...
when shadows are growing tall
And the screams are louder no
The screams that once were moans

You died before this time
Your blood still runs cold
Your heart is frozen now
Frozen to the core

Fallen from grace, Their laughter has died
The maggot race, in vain They run for the light
Demons, prepare to war for the 666
Angels, prepare to burn on the crucifix

When You've failed
You've failed once more... 
Your heart is frozen
and Your body's cold
Then angel's tears will fall...
down from heaven

When You've failed
You've failed once more... 
Your heart is frozen
and Your body's cold
Then angels' tears will fall...

These tears will fall like a gentle rain
One last breath

These tears will fall like a gentle rain
One last... last breath...

I'll take You down...
into the fire
You will suffer, You'll wear the crown
Your pain is My desire

Once inside
You'll scream in vain
every sin known to man
You'll experience with pain

I'll rape Your soul 1000 times
then My demons continues with Hate
For the years of oppression and indoctrination
I now dominate!

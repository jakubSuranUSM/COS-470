Packing your things and you storm through the house, said
No, I can't take it, I just wanna end it
And all I can think, you look good when you're angry
So, let’s take a step back and get us back on track

Mistakes that are made are the gifts that keep giving
There’s never a right time, except maybe this time

It's always something less than what I thought we had before
Like always, I'm blown away
But right now, I feel the need for something more
'Cause there's always, there's always right now

I'm not gonna let the emotions take over
This probably won't end well, but maybe I can't tell
Nothing will change, so just go through the motions
It's better in my mind, believing our own lie

Mistakes that are made are the gifts that keep giving
There’s never a right time, except maybe this time

It's always something less than what I thought we had before
Like always, I'm blown away
But right now, I feel the need for something more
'Cause there's always, there's always right now

Packing your things and you storm through the house, said
No, I can't take it, we needed to end it

I'm blown away
It's always something less than what I thought we had before
Like always, I'm blown away
But right now, I feel the need for something more
'Cause there's always, there's always right now

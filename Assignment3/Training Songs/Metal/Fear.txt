Daylight is waving goodbye
Darkness is here throwing sand in your eye
What can you do, where can you hide?
I just wonder

Light in your room's turning red
ready to find monsters under your bed
Dreams just fall apart
Chill from the inside is touching your heart

Round and round wind of time's gonna follow you
Round and round stealing year after year
Every night it will overpower you
Every night - face your fear

Build your illusions to last
Merciless time's gonna turn them to dust
Over the years just look what all of us've done
one to another as God to his son

Thousands of tricks up it's sleeve
playing with you like a wind with the leaf
Making you scream every day:
"Take me down, just take me away!"

Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you`ve left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I've always been a dreamer
`Cos dreaming is all I've ever done
Just like our summer, I thought it would last forever
But as the autumn came, you had gone away
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
You said I was a born loser
`Cos losing is all I've ever done
Like when I lost you, it proved that all you said was true
And now without you I feel I`m being used
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I`m all all one in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you my Rosalita
All there is left is a photograph
You smile and the ice cream`s meltin` down your pants
And I keep living on, you`re in the past, it`s been so long
Since the Ice Cream Summer, it`s forgotten now it`s gone
Rosalita, now our summer`s gone and you've left me all alone
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to seal my love away
Now you`re just a memory, don`t mean nothing more to me
A photo among others of my old friends and my lovers
And the winter is gone, a new summer`s coming on
A new summerÂ´s coming on for you as well somewhere Rosalita

I am in control
I haven’t lost my mind
I am picking up the pieces
Of the mess you left behind

I don’t need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don’t need your arms to hold me
'Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
This misery loves my company
Misery loves my company

Leave me in the cold
You better run away
I’m gonna dig a hole
And bury all the memories we’ve made

I don’t need your condescending
Words about me looking lonely
I don’t need your arms to hold me
'Cause misery is waiting on me

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
This misery loves my company
Misery loves my company

I am not alone
Not beaten down just yet
I am not afraid
Of the voices in my head
And down the darkest road
Something follows me
I am not alone
This misery loves my company
Misery loves my company

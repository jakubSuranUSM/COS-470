Your world is an ashtray 
We burn and coil like cigarettes 
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud 
It's the nature of the leeches  the virgin's 
Feeling cheated 
You've only spent a second of your life 
My world is unaffected  there is an exit here 
I say it is and then it's true  
There is a dream inside a dream  
I'm wide awake the more I sleep 
You'll understand when I'm dead 
I went to god just to see, and I was looking at me 
Saw heaven and hell were lies 
When I'm god everybody dies 
Scar/can you feel my power? 
Shoot here and the world gets smaller 
Scar/scar/can you feel my power? 
One shot and the world gets smaller 
Let's jump upon the sharp swords 
And cut away our smiles 
Without the threat of death 
There's no reason to live at all 
My world is unaffected, there is an exit here 
I say it is and then it's true, 
There is a dream inside a dream, 
I'm wide awake the more I sleep 
You'll understand when I'm dead 
(bridge) 
(chorus) 
"each thing I show you is a piece of my death" 
Shoot shoot shoot motherfucker 
No salvation, no forgiveness 
"this is beyond your experience" 
Forgiveness

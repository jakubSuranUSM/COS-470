A blue and blinding light
Is devouring the dark
Someone must be there
It's no fancy and no lark

Footsteps trail my moves
I turn around and no one's there
Phantom hands that touch my back
A pungent smell is in the air

Black-eyed visitors talk to me at night
Revealing the truth

Sinister eyes
Deciphering the prophecy
Sinister eyes
The warning of catastrophe

Muddled hours are still lost
A weird module at my neck
Curious voice that talks to me
Piercing eyes that hit my back

A dream crawls through my sleep
A small and gray skinned seer
He talks about the universe
I fell, I've known him for a hundred years

Black-eyed visitors talk to me at night
Revealing the truth

Sinister eyes
Deciphering the prophecy
Sinister eyes
The warning of catastrophe, yeah, oh yeah
Catastrophe

You wonder why there's no contact
The man of science twists the truth
Politicians telling lies
Ooh, these criminals have to lose

2000 years of blood and death
No money will ever change the fate
Army, church and government
Can't you fell their scornful hate?

Black-eyed visitors talk to me at night
Revealing the truth

Sinister eyes
Deciphering the prophecy
Sinister eyes
The warning of catastrophe

Sinister eyes
Deciphering the prophecy
Sinister eyes
The warning of catastrophe, oh yeah
Catastrophe

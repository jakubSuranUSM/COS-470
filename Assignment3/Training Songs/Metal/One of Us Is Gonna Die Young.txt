I want to hold you but you're out of reach
Somewhere searching for your inner peace
I'm just looking for a little squeeze
Face to face and cheek to cheek

It's in your blood but not in mine
What's in your blood is in my mind
Something's broken in the way we smile
It is within us all the time

You're well acquainted with the So- o- o-Ho
And all the "Ello" and "Ow are 'you?"
And we both have to get it on before the summer's gone

We gotta hurry with no worry to get done today
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
Let's put our money where our mouth is and get out today
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young

And don't you take this the wrong way
I'm not looking for a way to replace what love can give
'Cause you can't do that!

I'm only saying that where I come from
People find it very fashionable
To burn like a flame
Never get tame
Grown-up and lame
Yeah! Yeah!

You're looking beat but you say: "no, oh, no, no"
"I'm all messed up and I'm ready to go!
We ain't gonna go it alone no more
So let's get on with the showâ€¦"

There's a lot to be said and to be done today
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
Before they put us in a coffin I've got things to say
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, ooh, one of us is gonna die young
Ooh, ooh, one of us is gonna die young

There's a lot to be said and to be done today
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
We'll go shim-shim shammey
And get whimsy and get whammy
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young

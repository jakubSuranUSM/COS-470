In the beginning 
Good always overpowered the evils 
Of all man's sins...
But in time 
The nations grew weak 
And our cities fell to slums 
While evil stood strong 
In the dusts of hell 
Lurked the blackest of hates 
For he whom they feared 
Awaited them... 
Now many many life times later 
Lay destroyed beaten beaten down 
Only corpses of rebels 
Ashes of dreams 
And blood stained streets...
It has been written 
"Those who have the youth 
Have the future" 
So come now children of the beast 
Be strong 
And shout at the devil

Yeah yeah yeah
This is the noise that I make when I wake the dead
Oceans collide inside my head
I have no fear, no use for pain
I am omnipotent
Yeah yeah yeah
Come wake the dead
Waking the dead
Waking the dead
Yeah yeah yeah
This is the noise that I play when I raise the dead
Can't get this song out of my head
Black zombie radio
Come with me where I go
Yeah yeah yeah
Come wake the dead
Waking the dead
Waking the dead
Yeah yeah yeah
Come wake the dead
Waking the dead
Waking the dead
I have no fear
No use for pain, pain, pain, pain
Oceans collide inside my head, head, head, head
Raise the dead, dead
Raise the dead, dead
Raise the dead.

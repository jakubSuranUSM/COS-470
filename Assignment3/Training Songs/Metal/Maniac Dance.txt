His year has been a nightmare
I've been so low, I don't care
I've dwelled in depths of darkness
Swam across the ocean of pain

I've fed the tabloids, the media
It's a bottomless pit, a redia
Front pages, gossips, knifings, drunken nights and days

Sadness, rage, hopelessness
I am nothing without you

Again the dance
I do the maniac dance
Just like in trance
I do the maniac dance

This demon serves me well
It wants to send me to the depths of hell
A roller coaster ride it has been I can tell
I'm a walking miracle of medicine
A real catastrophe on legs
A proud member of human race known as the dregs

Xanax, Remeron, Therapy, Buspiron
Anger, Fear and Shame

Again the dance
I do the maniac dance
Just like in trance
I do the maniac dance

Dressed in cold black - gun in your hand
Looking so cool you act like a man
Livin' by terror government blessed
You're taking your prisoners and shoot down the rest

Terrror terror, terror squad
Terrror terror, terror squad

You're supposed to protect instead you attack
Displaying your force you're the Devils in black
You think you are Heroes at least so you act
That you are just cowards is surely a fact

Terrror terror, terror squad
Terrror terror, terror squad

Provoke me once more then what can I do
I might just be poiting my gun right at you
If I succeed your terror sets in
Then only the Gods will know who's to win

Terrror terror, terror squad
Terrror terror, terror squad

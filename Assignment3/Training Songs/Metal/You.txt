Life as dreams
Streets of gold
You used to go there
Now you're draining down the bottle
Systems failing
Sirens wailing
It's no secret that you're headed for the farm child

It's time you're leaving
Take a break down to the shore
You used to love it where the Holy waters flow
Maybe you'll find your long lost message in a bottle
Sent long ago
To your self long ago
What are you looking for?

The line is long
You're too far out
No hidden meanings here
But I have to spell it out
Sleep in late
Or never wake
Missing such a good time
Thinking that you're never gonna throw it all away

They found your message on the other side of life
But they don't want you over
They don't wanna cry
Seems that you've gone too far caught up in your self
Better find your way out
It's not all about "You"

Into the light of the sun
Now you're gone
Send me a word out of faith
You'll be home
Far away

You make believe before you go to sleep
That life is going your way
The things you need are superficial indeed
And leading you astray, far away

Its time you're leaving take a breakdown to the shore
You used to love it when the Holy Waters flowed
Maybe you'll find your long lost message in a bottle
Sent long ago
Is it just all about you?

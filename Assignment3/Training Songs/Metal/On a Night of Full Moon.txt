Stay away
I am evil
Or you will die by tomorrow
Copulation with a body of woman recently dead
My ceremonies with all the corpses
Finding souls so to unlock the coffins
It's a desecration of souls in their holy lair
Magic circles drawn after midnight
Around graves to be opened
I'll use a wand and bodies rise
I'll ask the questions and I'll burn the remains
It's a desecration of souls in their holy lair
Oh this sacrifice I've been searching on the night of full moon
Copulation with a body of woman recently dead
My ceremonies with all the corpses
Finding souls so to unlock the coffins
It's a desecration of souls in their holy lair
Oh this sacrifice I've been searching on the night of full moon

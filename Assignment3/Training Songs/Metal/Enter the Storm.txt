Enter the storm 
You probably won't survive 
But if you do 
You'll be much stronger cos you tried 
The mighty fall 
A world gone mad beneath it all 
Nothing to loose 
Step through and watch all hell break loose 
Rip away the rotten wood 
You've been reborn 
End the lies and face the truth 
The blackness comes 
The risk no greater than the gain 
But if you stay 
Your soul evaporates away 
Cyclonic winds 
Will blow away the sins you gained 
A tidal wave 
Can take you where you've never been 
Clear the haze inside your brain 
You've been reborn 
End it all and start again 
Gonna lie in wait 
For a hurricane 
And for sure when I'm 
Inside I'll shed my skin 
Don't assume 
You are doomed 
In the stratosphere 
Only way to escape 
And get out of here 
If you should see the devil there 
Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn 
If you should see the devil there 
Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn 
Enter the storm 
You probably won't survive 
But if you do 
You'll be much stronger cos you tried 
As your life disintegrates 
You've been reborn 
When confusion blows your brain 
Enter the storm 
End the lies and end the pain 
You've been reborn 
End it all and start again 
If you should see the devil there 
Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn

I see you turning, turning away
And we're ready to leave, to the bridges of sin yeah

Seven wonders, we are ready to fly
Like an eagle, we're touching the sky

We sailed across the ocean
On the wind of the sea
We're sailing on the oceans of time
We're moving through the twilight
Passed the black moon on our way
We're sailing on the oceans of time

As the sun fades to dark light we knew
There was no way to return
All the stars were passing by, we're riding through the sky
On our endless journey through space

Seven wonders, we are ready to fly
Like an eagle, we are touching the sky

We sailed across the ocean
On the wind of the sea
We're sailing on the oceans of time
We're moving through the twilight
Passed the black moon on our way
We're sailing on the oceans of time

The dust turned to stone, and the black moon touched the dawn
As we tried to get out, of this world of burning fear ooooooh

Seven wonders, and we're ready to fly
Like an eagle, we're touching the sky

We sailed across the ocean
On the wind of the sea
We're sailing on the oceans of time
We're moving through the twilight
Passed the black moon on our way
We're sailing on the oceans of time

We're sailing on
The oceans of time
And never look back oh
We're sailing on
On time

I see you turn
And sailing away
(We'll never go back there)
We're sailing on
The oceans of time

We're sailing on
The oceans of time
Oceans of time
Don't turn away
Don't turn a-don't turn away

Don't turn away
The oceans of time

We sailed across the ocean
On the wind of the sea
We're sailing on the oceans of time
Oceans of time
The oceans of time
Don't turn away

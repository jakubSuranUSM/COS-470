It's all been done before and
No one can listen to anyone's answers
They're drifting farther everyday
And they say

"We hold our hands to block the sun
We blame the light for what we've done
We look away so We'll forget what We've become"
 
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World

When the night falls you know who you are
And you cast reflections as the mirror gathers rust

"It's so safe and lonely with you"
Lovers ripping in two
Grind away 'till nothing's left
There's nothing left inside

First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
Your lives will fade before their time
And you'll never say goodbye

The end of all the things you know
And all of what you can be
It's fading fast before you

What we want, we are

Paint a perfect picture Over me
Smoke away the shakes and fall asleep
Dream about the things I used to be
Sporadical smiles

I can't take that much
Wash away
Burn away
Fade away
I feel too drained now
I can't take that much
Wash away
Burn away
Fade away

It's too late to redeem myself
I should of been something better than this
I'm so ashamed
And I know I'm to blame
Should have been thinking, thinking of you

My tired eyes are falling down on me
Chest is caving in but i'm too warm
Saturate the habit
Stroke thin air
down the hill I go

I can't take that much
Wash away
Burn away
Fade away
I feel too drained now
I can't take that much
Wash away
Burn away
Fade away

Talk about the aftertaste
Talk about the afterlife
Should of been somewhere
Out of this town
Talk the about the nights we've shared
and talk about the fights we've had
I want you to know that
I'm sorry

It's too late to redeem myself
I should of been something better than this
I'm so ashamed
With no-one to blame
Should have been thinking, thinking of you
Talk about the aftertaste
Talk about the afterlife
Should of been somewhere
Out of this town
Talk the about the nights we've shared
and talk about the fights we've had
I want you to know that
I'm sorry

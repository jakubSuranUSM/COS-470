Not one iota of thought
Not one iota of vision
Just corned and distraught
Complimented submission

Not one iota of thought
Not one iota of vision
Just corned and distraught
Complimented submission
No room to maneuver, no room for mistakes
Dish the pain out as you wish, don't worry if it breaks

Seeing is believing. it's the small things that count
Singing, screaming. it takes one to know one

Leave me be, let me go
You cannot fathom what I know
Is this real or a show
My redemption is unknown
Do you see, do you know
I need to find an answer within

Not one iota of envy
Not one iota of hate
No need for confusion
Just mellowed and sedate
Remove what's not working
Replace that what's fake
Create an atmosphere of trust, on which life is made
On which life is made

Leave me be, let me go
You cannot fathom what I know
Is this real or a show?
My redemption is unknown
Do you see, do you know?
I need to find an answer

Leave me be, let me go
You cannot fathom what I know
Is this real or a show?
My redemption is unknown
Do you see, do you know?
I need to find an answer within

Leave me be, let me go
You cannot fathom what I know
Is this real or a show?
My redemption is unknown
Do you see, do you know?
I need to find an answer within

Therefore I'm laying down in laughter 
Mighty, the mightiest life hereafter 
The trip we started hasn't finished here 
And while we think there`s not a shade of fear 
 
Black points jump in crossing lines 
Insanity and Genius 
Both two sides are what I find 
And I know they're mine 
 
Sometime my womb bears an actor 
Your mind creating tragic factors 
You've got knowledge stolen from the sea 
You've got wisdom just stolen knowledge 
 
Black points jump in crossing lines 
Both two sides are what I find 
Insanity`s not far behind the genius inside 
 
Close before insanity and genius close before
Solo Dirk 
And everyday a dreamer dies 
To see what`s on the other side 
And everyday more dreamers die my friend 
While black points jump in crossing lines again 
 
Companions in approaching time Insanity and Genius 
Good old friends in common life Insanity and Genius 

Close before insanity and genius close before

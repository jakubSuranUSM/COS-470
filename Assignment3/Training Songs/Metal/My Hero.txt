Tell me my hero what do we need
To end it all yeah and to never let us bleed
So hit me on the ground without a sound
Bring it on now till the day we take the lead

In the middle of the fake game 
The same proclaims made by the liars from the lost age
Try to believe to know what you are
But you are not sure which side you’re on from the start

Take a look 
All the junk we made the last corner you’ll take 
Will never lead you to the pearly gates
What else did we betray Turn into a machine
We just gave it away to fit into the scene

Are you losing your way or are you lost?
Where are you going?

Tell me my hero where you’re going
What do I need to end my war?
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

信じ 喜び 叶え 分かち合い
全てを捨て 今 立ち向かう
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

Demolition of the world we know
The natural selection that was all ineluctable
Now you see what a beautiful view
When everything is in the right place 
Nothing’s left to improve

What else did we betray?
Turn into a machine
We just gave it away to fit into the scene

Are you losing your way or are you lost?
Where are you going?

Tell me my hero where you’re going
What do I need to end my war
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

怒り 裏切り 妬み 抗い
嘆き 消しても その先は無い
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

Say can’t you see we all know they wanted to see tomorrow
Say can’t you see no one ever wanted to live in sorrow
Say can’t you see we all know we wanted to be

Tell me my hero where you’re going
What do I need to end my war?
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

信じ 喜び 叶え 巡り会い
きっとまたいつか そう君に会う
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

信じ 喜び 叶え 巡り会い
きっとまたいつか そう君に会う
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

Bread like sins
Suffer persecution
Showing the price
Forced stay of execution

Life failed once again
To see truth from the lies
Life fallen again
Watching truth fail in its eyes
Like and go back
Where I lost the way I am
Lay locks in time
Where does the nest begin?

Bread like sins
Suffer persecution
Showing the price
Forced stay of execution

I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I’m running out of time
Before the broken pieces realign

I still hate shine
For what I’ll never grasp
Just for mercy
It’s all I’ve ever lost

I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I’m running out of time
I see clear
Broken piece realign
The only thing I fear
I’m running out of time

One choice, one choice, one life
One choice, one choice, one life
One choice, one choice, one life
My choice, my choice, my life!

One choice, one life, I’m running out of time
One choice, one life, I’m running out of time
One choice (one choice) one life (one life) I’m running out of time
One choice (one choice) one life (one life) I’m running out of time

Throughout the history of mankind
Millions have lost their lives
On the fields of combat
For mans quest of supremacy
Countless battles commence
Vicious bloodshed proceeds
Peace will never be attained
Warfare will never cease

Marching on to war
Marching on to fight
Marching on to win
Marching on to die
Marching on to kill
Marching on to strike

In time we fly in time we die 
Oh, oh, oh 
Know what it feels to be lonely 
Don't know how it feels to be free 
Reacting wild, some moody child 
Don't know what's in store for me 
Oh, out in the cold, isolation 
Out on my own isolation 
Out all alone 

Up go the golden mast 
Float out to sea at last 
Roamed a thousand miles 
Still lonesome child 
But my ship is comin' in 

Oh, out in the cold, isolation 
Out on my own, isolation 
Out all alone 

It's my test no fight with myself I ain't wrong 
It's my quest a life with myself I am gone 

Oh yea isolation 
Oh yea isolation 
Out in the cold isolation 
Out on my own isolation 
Out in the cold isolation 
Out on my own 

Isolation out in the cold 
Isolation out on my own 

Isolation out in the cold 
Isolation out on my own 

Isolation out in the cold 
Isolation out on my own

Passing through this life with so much regret
It feels like I haven't got over it yet
It takes so long for these wounds to heal
I'm knockin' down walls, takin' my time
I gotta get outta here

Where will I go, who will I become?
I'm coming on like an elephant gun

Reaching for the piece of life that I can't find
The sun keeps fading away
Searching for the feeling that will never come
The return of the prodigal son

Last night the moon seemed to look so empty
I fell into a pit of despair (goin' nowhere)
I never thought that these wounds would heal
I fell to my knees, the rain came down
I swear I could touch the sky

What have I done, why was I so wrong?
Hear the pop of my elephant gun

Reaching for the piece of life that I can't find
The sun keeps fading away
Searching for the feeling that will never come
The return of the prodigal son

Reaching for the piece of life that I can't find
The sun keeps fading away
Searching for the feeling that will never come
The return of the prodigal son

The Prodigal Son
His time has just begun
Yeah yeah
I finally found a feeling
The return of the Prodigal Son

Let's go and give em their money's worth

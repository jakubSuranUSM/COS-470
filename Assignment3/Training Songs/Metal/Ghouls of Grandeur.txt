Taking all to the extreme
Four souls determined to be free
This is something we believe in
Don't you underestimate
The will to drink & dominate
This is something we take pride in
A pure & unholy paradise
We are here to dominate
Like parasites eliminate
The world you all consider holy

GHOULS OF GRANDEUR

Clenched fists blood & piss
There is no other way around
This shit lives inside us
In our blood
Right down to the last drop

GHOULS OF GRANDEUR

Taking all to the extreme
Four souls determined to be free

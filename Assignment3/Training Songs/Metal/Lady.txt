She got them eagle feathers; cocaine eyes
She got the heat to make a dead man rise
A rose in her hair, a devil may care attitude
She never said she would stay by my side
She only wanted to be there for the ride
A bottle of wine, a coupla lines
She was there for the night
Tried to change her ways
I said I'd keep her in a golden cage
She said: "Oh no this ain't no place for me"

Angel of mercy, angel of greed
Never stop till she get what she need
She dance like Salome
An' curses with a matelot tongue
I said baby won't you slow down for me
You gotta move if you want to be free
Like the wind I'm just blowin' anywhere I please
Tried to change her ways
I said I'd keep her in a golden cage
She said: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"

Lady, you're no lady
You're my woman
Got the love I need
You are my woman
Never change her ways
Never keep her in a golden cage
'Cause she say: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"

Tried to change her ways
I said I'd keep her in a golden cage
She said: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"

Lady, you're no lady
You're my woman
Got the love I need
You are my woman
Never change her ways
Never keep her in a golden cage
'Cause she say: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"
'Cause she say: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"

You might as well set me free

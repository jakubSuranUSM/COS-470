Don't want your God and His higher power
Want power to get higher
I'm not allowed, I'm not allowed
When you look up, what do you see?
Don't need a muthafucka lookin' down on me
Muthafucka lookin' down on me
'Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet
Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet
Beneath my feet

Don't bring your black heart to bed
When I wake up you best be God
Or you'd better be dead

Don't bring your black heart to bed
When I wake up you best be God
Or you'd better be dead
You best be God
Or you'd better be dead

This what happens when you put an apple on yo head
You could laugh all day but you can't after darkness sway
Can't after darkness sway
Too many bills and not enough kills
I need a bug out, sold that big house
You'll never take me alive, never take me alive, you'll never fuckin' take me alive
It's betta to be blamed for Robbin' Peter
Than guilty for payin' Paul

It's betta to be blamed for Robbin' Peter
Than guilty for payin' Paul

Don't bring your black heart to bed
When I wake up you best be God
Or you'd better be dead

Don't bring your black heart to bed
When I wake up you best be God
Or you'd better be dead

You best be God
Or you'd better be dead

You best be God
Or you'd better be dead

Don't need a muthafucka lookin' down on me
A muthafucka lookin' down on me

Don't need a muthafucka lookin' down on me
A muthafucka lookin' down on me

Don't need a muthafucka lookin' down on me
A muthafucka lookin' down on me

'Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet
Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet

'Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet
Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet

'Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet
Least I know wherever I go
I got the devil beneath my feet

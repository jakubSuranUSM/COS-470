Yeah, I want it
Yeah, I need it
Yeah, I love it
Yeah, electric head in your head
In your head, in you

Strip down core violate and paralyze
Flood my soul, a coffee dreg, supersize
Slung low like a whore, devil want some more
Cupid bought a gun, he gonna blow the fucker

Yeah, I want it
Yeah, I need it
Yeah, I love it
Yeah, electric head in your head
In your head, in you

Breakneck speed get a violent spinal crack'n
Back down to the chrome and feel the death wish attack'n
Hubcaps on your eyes, cannot sympathize
A fistful of hair and a splinter in the mind

Yeah, I want it
Yeah, I need it
Yeah, I love it
Yeah, electric head in your head
In your head, in you

Too far gone, see the freak apologize
Flood my soul a coffee dreg, supersize
Slung low like a whore, devil want some more
Cupid bought a gun, he gonna blow the fucker

Yeah, I want it
Yeah, I need it
Yeah, I love it
Yeah, electric head in your head
In your head, in you

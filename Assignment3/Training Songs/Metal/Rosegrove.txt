Right from the start you know you put me in the dirt
I never even got a chance to get away
I take all the crap from your drool attack
The years fly by and I get nothing to say
You expect me to be happy and to be satisfied
With the offer that you once had to give
You don't try to encourage anybody to develop
That's not the way that I want to live
Do this
Do that
Come here
You thought
I'm still here although I hate it
I wonder why I even care about a place like this
I don't know if I can take it
I've had it up to here with your shit and your piss
I've heard so much shit from the people I hate
That I really couldn't give a f*ck
I've been down in the shit for so goddamn long
That everything looks like up
Chorus
You see I'm sick and tired of being tied to the ground
My lungs they were made to shout
I'm stuck in the middle of a rosegrove maze
And I can't seem to find my way out
Chorus

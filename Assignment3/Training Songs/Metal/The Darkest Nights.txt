For so long I have felt alone 
Content to live with unrest 
Longing faded into countless nights 
That buried my weary heart 
But you brought an end 
To this dead hour 
And meaning to a calloused life 
Held in your arms 
But too far from my heart 
These thoughts will carry me through 
The darkest nights 
While your eyes rested in mine 
I remember the way you looked at me 
And the way you drew me close 
With one deep sigh 
Scattering pieces of my restless mind 
Forgetting all that we have left behind

It feels like we're blind...It feels like we're dead
We'll never find our way...we'll never feel the light of day

Don't try to think...Don't try to live your own life
We have you for keeps...Our ways are sewn deep in your hearts and minds

The colours have faded...everything's black
Darkness around me...Darkness inside me

Your blood line stops here...We are your family now Prepare for the end...a new life awaits us beyond

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see
Humanity struggles to be free

Are you willing to die for us
Are you willing to die with us

Strip us down to nothing and use us as you wish
Like little pawns you move around at your fingertips
We beg to serve and serve you well, you keep us in the dark
Hold us close and suffocate the souls you've led astray

The cycle's complete...the pieces for ruin are in place Our subjects are ready...to seal our date with infamy

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see

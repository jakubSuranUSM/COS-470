Woke up this morning so glad to be alive
I knew that this would be my lucky day
Waitin' and wonder just when would you arrive
Countin' all the hours you'd been away
Yes today is gonna be my lucky day.
It's so nice
Nice
Nice to have you home again
And you're lookin' exactly just the way you used to look before
It's so nice
Nice
Nice to have you home again
And now that you're here I know you gonna stay
You're never ever ever gonna go away
Anymore.
Looked at the letter I'd read so many times
Now the day had really come at last
Thought of you saving all your nickles and your dimes
But now our time was really comin' fast
We'd make up for everthing that's past.
It's so nice
Nice to have you home again . . .

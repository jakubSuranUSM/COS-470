The trick of turnin' bricks to gold 
The lick you churn to not grow old 
Let it all out n' scream it n' shout 
I let you in on everythin' 
Yer heart desire burning on the dark side 
Of yer wild side 

Ya got an alley cat style 
Yer a crazy child 
You got what it takes 
Gimme yer smile 

All is right coz we're 
Breakin' the chains, breakin' the chains 
All is right coz we're 
Breakin' the chains, breakin' the chains 

Livin' on the edge of nyte 
Sukkin' love from every bite 
All that we need we're in for the feed 
We get from every kiss of death 
Yer heart expire burnin' on the dark side 
Yer a rotchild

I had a dream in earlier days
Loved by the one my Heart desired
Then it all started to fade away
Our love, once so strong,
Flowed through our hands
Human so helpless, what could we do
I could but watch him walk out of my life

Oh, my Heart, why art Thee weak
Oh, my heart, how deep art Thy wounds
Thou who thought that love was life
Thou who thought that love never dies

Cry out Thy sorrow
And seek to heal
Cry out Thy sorrow
And try to forgive

He that promised worlds unseen
He that caused Thy pain unreal
How could Thou believe his words
How could Thou believe his love

Cry out Thy Sorrow
And seek to heal
Cry out Thy Sorrow
And try to forget

I had a dream in earlier days
Loved by the one my Heart desired

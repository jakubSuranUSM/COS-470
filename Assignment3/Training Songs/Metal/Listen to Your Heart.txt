When you're hungry , on the dark side
And you're ready to make you move
Don't try to fight it
Don't wait too long
Your life's a mystery
There's a shadow where the road leads
You can't control it
Don't try to hold it down
So when you hear those voices
Callin' out to you in the night

Listen to your heart
Angels are cryin' out to you
Listen to your heart this time

You're a victim of the madness
That's turnin the world around
You've got the future locked up inside
You
Hold the wind , take the sun
The border crossing has just begun
You're rising higher , born with desire
Keep it strong , win the race
And don't look back if you're losing the
Pace

Listen to your heart
Angels are cryin' out to you
Listen to your heart this time

Solo

Listen to your heart
Angels are cryin' out to you
Listen to your heart this time

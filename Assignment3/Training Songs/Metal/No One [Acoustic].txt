Well I can't ever really believe
No one was sent to get me
And I feel like I'm being erased
No one got left here,
I'm all alone,
No one was sent to get me
I'm all alone, no one got left here

But I'm fine,
No one got left here,
Well I'm fine,
No one got left here,

I can't even breathe when I see,
The pictures sent without you,
And I feel like I'm being erased,
No one got left here
I'm all alone, no one was sent to get me,
I'm all alone, no one got left here,

I'm so sick of this terrible instinct
It's so hard now just to find you
So sick of the terrible instinct,
I can only find you

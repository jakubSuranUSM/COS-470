Teardrop on a fragile eyelash 
She's looking like a dream 
Hoping for some understanding 
And answer or at least 
Cunning word a single sentence 
To restore her heart 
Aching since the day I left her 
Crossing lonely seas 

Silent tears of a woman
Make a warrior cry 
Heaven, I beg you 
Please release hopes from fears 

This is my elegy 
Do you know what I feel? 
This is my elegy 
Do you believe it's real? 
Will I hold you in my arms again? 

Dewdrops on a single rosebud 
This purity of rain
Reminds me of the moment I left her 
Kisses filled with pain 
And if I should leave her waiting 
For another year 
Will she ever know the answer? 
Will she follow me? 

Silent tears of a woman
Make her warrior cry 
Heaven, I beg you 
Please release hopes from fears 

This is my elegy 
Do you know what I feel? 
This is my elegy 
Do you believe it's real? 
Will I hold you in my arms
Hold you in my arms again? 

Cunning word, a single sentence 
To restore her heart 
Aching since the day I left her 
Crossing lonely seas

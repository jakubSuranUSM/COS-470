Raising the gavel, pleasing the king
These proceedings shall come to a close
Guilty of treason, sins of the flesh
Your crimes have all been disclosed

Say what you will as your penalty's cast
Down on your judgement today
Let it be heard sentence is passed
The ultimate price you will pay

Sharpening to perfection, let justice be done
Crowd pleasing dissection, your table's reserved
This proclamation be served

You'll be hung drawn and quartered
Punishment fitting the crimes
Hung drawn and quartered
Soon your last bell will chime

Off to the four winds, your parts be displayed
A warning for all to take heed
And to your heirs a corruption of blood
Seizing your assets and deeds

So in conclusion my thanks to you all
There's just one thing left to say
"ladies and gent|emen, court is adjourned
Take him, be on your way"

Sharpening to perfection, blind justice be done
Crowd pleasing dissection, your table's reserved
This proclamation be served

You'll be hung drawn _and quartered
Punishment fitting the crimes
Hung drawn and quartered
Soon your last bell will chime

You'll be hung drawn and quartered
Punishment fitting the crimes
Hung drawn and quartered
Soon your last bell will chime

You'll be hung drawn and quartered
This be your judgement today
Hung drawn and quartered
This is the price you will pay

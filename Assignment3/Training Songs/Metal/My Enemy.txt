Play the fence, one way you're gonna fall
Sometimes I don't know who you are at all
Your opinion is something that you've got inside
But I see the loyalty has up and died

Your skeletons
My skeletons
Life is only getting shorter

You can be my enemy and I don't care
Keep throwin' stones at yourself

Stories run in circles that have no end
I hit on luck, then you bum me out again
There's a way that you keep the truth in check
Scratch the surface and treat it like a broken neck

Keep the peace when face to face with the scene
Got a hunch that ain't what you really mean
Weather's fair, does that change where you stand ?
My back is turned and the knife is in your hand

Your genocide
My genocide
Like is only getting shorter

You can be my enemy and I don't care
Keep throwin' stones at yourself
You can be my enemy and I don't care
You try too hard and I can tell

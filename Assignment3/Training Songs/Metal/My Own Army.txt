I need no angel
I need no cover
I come with my own army

I have no heaven
I have no Father
I come with my own army

I followed the pain
And after all I stand
Following the path on my own

I need no heaven
I need no saviour
I come with my own army

There is no anger
There is no sorrow
I come with my own army

Mother, I followed the pain
And here I still stand
Following the traces you left

Madre,
I'm shedding my skin
Mother I believe, 17
In a bed of roses
Where you're lying frozen

I'm shedding my skin
Mother I believe, 17
And I need no angel
If you stand with me
You're my army

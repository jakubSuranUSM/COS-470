Remembering those years, emotions so black 
They're cracking the whip, you yearn to strike back. 
Days filled with anger and nights filled with pain, 
They'll pay the price for their worthless games.

Raise your hands (raise your hands) 
Take a stand, you'll be free. 
A new world stand 
Fight for your lives, make them see.
Driven by hatred, a passion so dear. 
The nighttime is stirring, the new world is near. 
The morning awakens. 
Revenge in their eyes. 
To tear down those visions of years gone by.
Racing like demons, we move into fight. 
The onslaught is breathing with muscle and might. 
Bashing and crashing, the battle hymn roars. 
Roaring like thunder, right to the core.

Raise your hands (raise your hands) 
Lay down your life to be free. 
The new world stands (Raise your hands). 

Screaming out equality.
Driven by hatred, a passion so dear. 
The morning awakened, the new world is here. 
You've paid the price for your worthless games. 
Reach out your hands and take hold of the reins.

Raise your hands (raise your hands) 
We've taken a stand to be free. 
A new world stands (raise your hands). 

Screaming out equality.
Driven by hatred, a passion so dear. 
The morning awakened, the new world is here. 
You've paid the price for your worthless games. 
Reach out your hands, take hold of the reins.

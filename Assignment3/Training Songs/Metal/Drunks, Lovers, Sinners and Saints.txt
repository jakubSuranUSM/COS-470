Alright!

This is from our hearts
So suddenly a super chart to make some mistakes
We'll make some mistakes
Well it's a long time coming when your giving it everything

Alright!

This is from our hearts
So suddenly a super chart to make some mistakes
We'll make some mistakes
Well it's a long time coming when your giving it everything

Alright!
This is from our hearts
And if you reach for the sun
You'll find that my conscience just can't put out

Alright!
This is from our hearts (from our hearts)
And it's always gonna be a part
Well this crowd, don't understand

Well I feel the same
I won't ever change
Not a jaded hair up on my head

Are you pretending?
(that you care!)
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?
(that you understand!)

Are you even

Straight to the left
Straight to the right
Cuz my heart, my heart is strong
We ride to fight

Straight to the left
Straight to the right
Cuz my heart, my heart is strong
And we ride to fight

Straight to the left
Straight to the right
Cuz my heart, my heart is strong
We ride to fight

Straight to the left
Straight to the right
Cuz my heart, my heart is strong
And we ride to fight

Are you pretending?
(that you care!)
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?
(that you understand)
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?

I know, I know!

Are you even listening?!
Are you pretending?!
That your heart's in the right place!

Are you pretending?
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?
Are you even

There's no need to waste my time
Spending your life
Jumping from sinking ship to sinking ship
I think I'd rather drown
I know I'd rather drown!

And I feel the same
I won't ever change
Not a jaded hair up on my head!

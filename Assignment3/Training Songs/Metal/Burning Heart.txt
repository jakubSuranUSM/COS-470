The wind of the west ? it whispers and calls
A dirge to the still of night
I'm lying awake ? and sorrow is on my mind

'Cause baby, I know ? we must make a move
This world's running out of time
There's a force that keeps pushing me on
I can feel it inside ?

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again

A world in a daze ? in fear and confused

Is rising before my eye
We run from the truth ? too blind for signs of time

There's a vision of justice and peace
Living on in our souls
There must be a way better than this
And I'm longing to go

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again

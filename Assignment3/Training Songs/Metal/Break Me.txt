You´re in me,
Just like a bad disease,
But I can´t find a cure to get you out of me!
You´re so real, as real as you could be,
But it feels like you´re a part of someone´s phantasy!
Hey, I don´t know, what you want from me, but you take away my life and all my privacy...
I don´t care for what you see in me,
´cause you try to break me down like I´m an enemy...
But you don´t know me, you can´t own me,
read my lips "I think I´m falling!"
Hold me...take me...know me...break me!
You think of me just like a butterfly,
You want to pin me to your wall so I can never fly!
Just like a flower that you need to dry,
Caught between two books you squeeze me ´til I die...
Now i´ve got to break it down,
Back to where I used to be as a child,
No one told me who or where to be,
As I grew up I didn´t want to deal with the shit of my parents,
´cause they made me feel like a piece of shit,
I didn´t fit, wanted me to quit,
Get back to the real world so they´d say, anyway,
I relied on myself since I was ten, nine, eight...
I don´t care for who you want me to be,
I´ll be just who i want to be...

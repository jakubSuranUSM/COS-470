Are you ready gentlemen? (Yeah)

When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Clause is on the way

Oh well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the snow cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way
Now the frosty paws appear
And they've frozen up my ear
So we'll lie by the fire
Till the sleet simply knocks 'em all the way

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas

When the snow man brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)
Well he just might like to know (he just might like to know)
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face

So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)
All along the milky way (along the milky way)
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay

Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
So let the bells ring out for Christmas

Under your arms, check it!
Oh well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

Why don't you give your love for Christmas

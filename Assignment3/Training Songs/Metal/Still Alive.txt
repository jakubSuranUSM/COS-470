These are those days, when I can get no sleep
I'm so tired I'd like to fall into sleep
I fall in my bed
But still I'm awake
These questions in my mind are so much bigger than life
When my life is sold I have to leave them behind
I have to try to forget
That I am still in my bed
In my deepest fears I'm losing you
Even if somebody tried to stop my heart
I'm still alive I will never give up
CHORUS:
Just turn off the lights
Don't want to see me die
I look like I'm dead
But when you look at me
I am still alive
Just open your eyes
Don't want to see me cry
I'm right here where you want be to be
Fighting with myself
All I need to feel is your breath on my skin
This endless longing between you and me
We can't give up now
We're gonna make it somehow
In my sweetest dreams I'm with you
Even if somebody tried to stop my heart
I'm still alive I will never give up
[CHORUS]
Just open your eyes
Don't want to see me cry
I'm right here where you want me to be 
fighting with myself, with myself
[CHOURS]
Won't you open your eyes
Don't want to see me cry
I'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself
I'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself
I'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself, with myself.
Ooh, I look like I'm dead
but when you look at me
I'm still alive

Fight for the black shark 
See what evil brings 
Can't you see we're out for blood
Love from a shotgun 
License to kill 
Can't you see we're out for blood 

(Pre Chorus) 
The kids scream in fright through the night 
Loving every bit with delight 
And we blow out our minds with your truth 
And together we stand for the youth 

(Chorus) 
Red hot red hot 
To the top we are 
Red hot 

Shout at the devil 
We've laughed at your wars 
Can't you see we're out for blood 
Run with the pack, now 
Always ask for more 
Can't you see we're out for blood 

(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)

This is the soundtrack of my life
The sound by which I live and die
The things I've seen I can't describe
This is the soundtrack of my life

Watching the movie of your life
You see things in a different light
You see mistakes and tragedies
You have avoided so easily
You see the times when there were lies
Now it's yourself that you despise
And as you see the movie play
And as you hear the words you say

It's the soundtrack of my life
The sound by which I live and die

Trying to be true true to yourself
Surviving your own mental health
But pharmaceuticals today
Are not what you thought they'd be
Seeking your own oblivion
But you are not the only one
Join the queue and stand a line
If there's no victim there's no crime

It's the soundtrack of my life
The sound by which I live and die
It's the soundtrack of my life
The sound by which I live and die

This is my life

This is the soundtrack to my life
The sound by which I live and die
The things I've seen I can't describe
This is the soundtrack of my life

This is my life

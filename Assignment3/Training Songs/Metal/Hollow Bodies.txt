Black souls, empty bodies
You had me fooled straight from the start
We pray for an answer.
We have to fight or be hollow just like them
Walking lifeless,
Have we been left for the dead?
Black souls, empty bodies
We have to fight or be hollow just like them

They're coming for us now (whoa)
So don't make a sound (whoa)
Is there anybody left to see the sun?
Is there anybody left to cure the dead?
Unaware and unawake
Unaware and unawake

Every city is burning,
We're all wasting away
Nothing will end this, nothing to prove
There's nowhere to run, all hell is breaking loose

They're coming for us now (whoa)
So don't make a sound (whoa)
Is there anybody left to see the sun?
Is there anybody left to cure the dead?
Unaware and unawake
Unaware and unawake

Something tells me we could be here for a while.
And all I know is if you can't run learn to die
And now I wonder if we'll make it through the night.
All I know is if you can't run learn to die

With the setting sun put the gun in my hand
Pull the trigger, don't fail me now
With the setting sun put the gun in my hand
Don't fail me now

It's starting again
We're going hollow
We're going hollow

Something tells me we could be here for a while.
And all I know is if you can't run learn to die
And now I wonder if we'll make it through the night.
All I know is if you can't run learn to die

Whoa, whoa
Don't fail me now

Whoa, whoa
Don't fail me now

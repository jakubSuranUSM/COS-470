While being alone
In a crowded place
When living with nobody
Who could kill
Is it possible to be afraid
When one can be saved?

Can I sleep again?
Will I keep the gain?
Shall I gain more pain?

When seeing no-one else
Around your pathetic existence
Not a single soul who could hurt you
When you're slain into the drain

Can I sleep again?
Will I keep the gain?
Shall I gain more pain?
Breathtaking pressure

Underneath all of us
The survived ones
Who will never survive
Who will never survive
 
Breathtaking pressure
Underneath all of us
The survived ones
Who will never survive
 
While being alone
In a crowded place
When living with nobody
Who could kill
Is it possible to be afraid
When one can be saved?
 
Can I sleep again?
Will I keep the gain?
Shall I gain more pain?

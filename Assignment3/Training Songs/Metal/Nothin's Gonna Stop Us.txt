I am no messenger
But I will give you message
A message...of death

When you're cycling through the city at night
And you're dodging these apartment lines
I've got my fingers greasy
And you didn't care
I was fixing your shame
While you were fixing your hair
Rolling my tie back
And walking on air

Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Fixing your hair
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Across the beach
Let's have a party there
Cause it doesn't matter where we are
Oh when you're the stunt peg
And I'm in the chair
I was pulling a wheely
You were pulling my hair
They'll never catch us
Cause we're catching air

Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Fixing your hair
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Fixing your hair
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us

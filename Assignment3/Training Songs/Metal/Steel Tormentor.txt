Headless pulling the machine down
Coming to the low sound
Feeling like a real man

Racing flashing from down under
Flesh and blood and thunder
Trembling wheel in cold hand

Faster, much faster
Wot a human speed disaster
Deeper, much deeper
On to the void I cast'er

I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round every curve
I'm a mean imperator
Of my intimate machine

Turkey near to devastation
Losing all my patience
Cannot make this kit fly

Danger muscular contraction
Out for satisfaction
Solid intoxication, yeah

Nightride, it's nightride now
Try to catch my tail lights
So sad, I'm so sad
But you won't ever suck my steel bride

I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round every curve
I'm a mean imperator
Of my intimate machine

I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round every curve
I'm a mean imperator
Of my intimate machine

I'm a steel tormentor
And I speed 'round every turn
I'm a mean operator 
Of my intimate machine

I'm 
Oh oh oh

What you believe
Is the vanity you conceive
What you love you don't pen
To put in a cage is to put to an end

Enamoured of the passion
Life-sucking lust
You will never gain my trust

I'm a misanthropical breed
Insatiable in my need to feed

Utterly fearless
For your luscious flesh
I've got am appetite like a war
And I always hunger for more

Vicious mammal
The blood is my call
Pound for pound
I am the most vicious of all

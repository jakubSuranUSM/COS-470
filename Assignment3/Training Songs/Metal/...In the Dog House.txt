You don't have to be the person actin' like the fool
About time you learned you somethin', so go to school
You never knew you had the answer but that's a lie
Livin' by your intuition and that ain't right 
Face first
In the doghouse
Face first 

Would not could not should not, but you did
Don't even try to cross me you snot nosed kid
This fight ain't half way over, you soft skin clown
That ill pill you're selling just won't wash down 
I see what you do to others, and what you've done
I can't help but think and wonder when my time will come
So when you go for yours, you better knock me out
You come back to my neighborhood and I'll bust your crown

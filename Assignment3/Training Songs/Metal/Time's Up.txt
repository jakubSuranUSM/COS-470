Time's up,the rivers have no life
Time's up,the world is full of strife
Time's up,the sky is falling
Time's up,the Lord is calling

How you gonna stop the clock
When the well runs dry
All the rivers have died
Moment by moment, day by day
The world is just slipping away
Your future won't save your past
The time is now, it won't last
The time is nigh
Time to do-or-die

Time waits for no one
If you want to go on
Leave me something to grow on
The forests, the trees, the rivers, the seas
All die of this disease

Time ain't on your side
Don't sit idly by
You've just got to try

You can be the change

Pain is the elixir that keeps us entertained
Flowing through a looking glass
Numbing stinging eyes of shame
Absence rinses guilt away
But our conscience is still stained
You can be the catalyst
The ripple to the wave

You can be the change

One small step will shake the earth

We're sedated into submission
Apathetic addicts
Hooked on tunnel vision

Mindless progress is a dire setback
Humanity is slipping through the cracks

Let the pathways through our hearts guide us
To a universe where love survives us

You can be the change

One small step will shake the earth

Let the pathways through our hearts guide us
To a universe where love survives us

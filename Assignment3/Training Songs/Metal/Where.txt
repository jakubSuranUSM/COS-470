There
Somewhere out there is a better day
Somewhere out there has to be
Better than today
Hopes to be
Anyway

[Chorus]
To be a part of anything
Shows me what I've missed
To be a part of all the answers
My wish

Stand there before me
With your emptiness
Emptiness
So true to form
So true to all I've missed from (you)

[Chorus]

I've run from you before
And closed this door

[Chorus]

I'll miss you anyway
And I'll miss you anyway

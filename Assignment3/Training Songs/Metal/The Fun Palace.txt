Welcome, I invite you off to the other world
You'll have to face this house of no escape
Confront the past, in this psychic house of horrors
I lead you up the path you'll take

Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside panic 
Your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace

Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace

Tonight you'll be tried, I invoke the memories
The guilt to be driven from this unconscious mind
Young lives that you've denied, behold their faces
Innocence cut to pieces, just look behind

Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace

Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream
Panic, your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace

Look at the fun and the games 
That you've taken away, confess!
Dreams of growing up have been 
Destroyed because of you!

Farewell, I impel you back to your other world
You'll have to face your every sin
Take this a painful bounty, representing me
The keeper of the palace and 
The secrets held within

Panic, your conscience lied
Trapped inside panic 
Your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the fun palace

Panic, just try to scream
It's only a dream panic
Your ultimate nightmare
Welcome to the palace
Goodbye, from the fun palace
